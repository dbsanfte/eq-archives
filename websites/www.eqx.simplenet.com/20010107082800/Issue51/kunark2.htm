And it seemed that muck would be the with us the whole trip.  Our second day out of Qeynos we encountered a storm.  Not a hard, driving storm, but a solid and steady one that lasted the entire day and on into the night.  When we arrived at the DeadFall Inn that second evening of our journey we were covered with water and the mud tossed up by our horses.  This is the one thing that you never hear in tales, the miserable conditions that exist on the road.  Certainly the heroes of legend, Idar, Finn, Rebal, all had to travel in the rain.  But unless it adds to the suspense, like when Vebblin lead his forces against the Ogres at FireHeight bridge, you never hear about how wretched water can be.  Especially when it soaks your trousers and your saddle.  And as it adds nothing to the tale here, I will let it pass with but one further comment.  We were miserably wet when we stomped into the DeadFall that night.  Even Drebben was uncomfortable.  Radvar was ordering hot spiced ale even before he passed through the inn doors.
<br><br>
As we waited for our meal I told them what I was willing to tell them about our journey.  We were currently headed to Freeport.  From there we would cross the ocean of tears to Kunark.  We would make our landfall somewhere in the Dreadlands, exactly where I did not know.  I assured my two companions that I had enough gold to purchase a passage, despite the fact that I knew no captain that would be willing to go there.
<br><br>
"What?  That sounds pretty foolish, don't it?  I've been around, and I don't know anyone that's ever been to Kunark.  And you don't know a captain that will take the trip?  Neither do I."  Radvar didn't actually seem angry, despite his words.  "So I suppose our journey ends at Freeport.  No problem.  I know some folks there that I want to visit anyway."
<br><br>
"We'll find passage.  And I do know someone that has been there.  I have a rough map and have been told that landings are fairly easy in the Dreadlands.  But before we reach Freeport we need to pick up another member for this group.  We have our muscle, but we will need some survival skills in the Dreadlands.  When the rain lets up we will be heading into HighPass Hold.  There, or nearby, I hope to locate Theyell, an old acquaintance of mine.  He should be of great help to us, as he is perhaps the greatest living tracker in Antonica.   And I think I can convince him to join us."
<br><br>
"I don't like all this secrecy.  Alright, I'll admit that I want to be one of those folks that go to Kunark and return to tell the tale, but I want to know why.  I…"
<br><br>
I interrupted Radvar, mostly to remind him that I had that right.  "I won't be telling you exactly where we are going, or what we are looking for until we are shipboard.  I'm not famous, but I have been known to attract attention.  I don't need anyone discovering our intent.  I haven't even told Drebben where or why.  So you'll have to wait."
<br><br>
"Fine.  I don't like it, though."
<br><br>
"Well, I'm not too pleased about it either.  With the exception of Drebben I was specifically asked not to invite the folks that I usually would make such a journey with.  This forces me to recruit as I go.  But I think that our employer has enough reason to distrust them, and to hide what exactly we are doing.  And don't even ask who our employer is."
<br><br>
That evening was passed in relative silence.  I knew that Drebben would never ask me to reveal the truth of our mission.  But I also knew that he did not like that I would not tell him.  For over a dozen years we have traveled together, doing things just because they could be done.  For me it is the travel that makes my life worthwhile.  While I can easily spend a year or two in a town like Qeynos, I can't spend my life there.  Soon enough I will hear someone talk about a place that I have never seen, and I have to go there.  Drebben's reasons are different.  He was sent from his homeland to make a name for himself.  His task is simply to make certain that there are still Dwarven heroes in the lands.  That may seem odd to until you think about it.  Since the legends of the IronToe Brigade there have been no Dwarven legends.  None.  Certainly there are famed Dwarven smiths.  And sure, there are many well loved Dwarves in our tales, always as sidekicks.  But there are no Dwarven heroes.  None.  So Drebben was sent to meet me for the first time through the Dwarven scholar Oghma.  Oghma and I have been in professional contact for a very long time.  When Oghma was asked to advise Drebben on his task, he suggested that I might be able to get him started, find him a task that a hero could perform.  Well, that's not as easy as it seems.  Over twelve years he has saved three princesses, one king and numerous small towns.  I have lost count of the number of heroes feasts he has been honored at.  But never is he remembered as the hero.  Always it is someone else, the handsome Wizard, the local sheriff, one of our other companions, or even myself.  It seems to be a sort of quiet racism that will not allow the folk of Antonica to see the truth of his deeds.  I have written and told hundreds of tales about his exploits, yet he goes unremembered by the people.
<br><br>
But I know that the powers of Antonica know him.  I know that Drebben is called Lich slayer, wolfkin, and knight by many lords of the land, be they Ogres or Humans.  And it is mostly for this reason that I insisted on bringing him along, despite my employer's reservations.  For among the leaders of the Dark Elves he is known simply as Slayer.
