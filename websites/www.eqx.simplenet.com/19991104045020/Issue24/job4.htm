4. Speak clearly.  Don't mumble.  Answer every question with detail.  Refrain
from using two word answers.
<br><br>
5. Keep good eye contact.  Don't stare the desk, or off in space thinking
about EverQuest.  
<br><br>
6. Keep your hands in your lap.  Don't waive them around or play with them.
It's annoying, and may distract your interviewer.

7. When you get asked questions related to the job, answer as if you have
already been offered the job.  "We require our employees here at 8am"
<br><br>
" I will be here at 7:15 daily.  I like to use that time for following up on
tasks from the day prior" Never say words like "I can do that" instead answer
with "I will do that" again suggesting you already have the job.
<br><br>
8. If he asks you if you have any questions.  DO NOT SAY NO.  You better have
at least ten questions.  Show him your serious about the job.

9.  Ask him/her for the job!  "When do I start?"
<br><br>
10. Don't worry about not having enough experience.  Let the employer decide
that.  Be yourself.  The last two positions I filled had required at least a
BS in computer science.  I don't even have a degree (not that that's a good
thing.  GET your college education!).
