<big><big>I</big></big> often wondered what inspired others to cheat on multi-player games.  The years that I played on Mud’s, I never perceived anyone as a cheater.  Though I had the experience to perform the act, I never once contemplated altering my character.  Blizzard’s Diablo™ sold millions of copies to the multi-player world.  Gamers just could not get enough of the game. Servers were created for players to adventure together (or against; it was your choice).  The first week or so that I played the game I was mesmerized.  I lost sleep, sometimes staying up all night, starving to gain levels.

Then a few weeks after the game was released the first signs of cheating became obvious.  Players suddenly turned 50th level (which Blizzard announced was impossible).  Characters were trading unique and power items like they were sweepings.  Room titles surfaced like "I can Dupe Godly Plate".  It took a few months before anything was changed to stop some of the cheats.  After the first month there were hundreds of various types.  The multi-player aspect of the game was ruined for me.  My son and me, and my two daughters began to play on our own local area network   (I have a house full of geeks).

Diablo set a new standard for graphical multi-player gaming!  But not only did it set new standards, it showed us what people can do if they don’t have to suffer consequences for there actions.
<br><br>
This proved true with the next lineage of multi-player games.  Meridian 59™ from 3DO and Ultima Online™ from Origin were born.  Although I didn’t play Meridian 59, I did play Ultima online.
