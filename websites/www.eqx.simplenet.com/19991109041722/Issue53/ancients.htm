<em>It has been over twenty years since the young Leif was thrown into the flames of mourning by the passing of his master Brendelson. He wanders without a cause hoping that one day he will be able to rid himself of the grief he feels. He has seen much of Norrath, gaining knowledge and experience in his travels. Despite his travels and encounters he has only acquired three true friends. Tieon, a young female elf, adept in the ways of the paladin, Yeoul, a large troll with, surprisingly, a heart of gold, and Frok, a mischievous, rogue halfling, who gets in more trouble than he's worth. None of Leif's friend know his true past and are not brave enough to ask.</em>
<br><br>
	

	"No! NO! NOOO!!" Leif screamed, arousing the attention of his three companions.
<br><br>
	Tieon, ran over to Leif to awake him. "Leif, Leif, what's wrong?" Tieon asked in her high flute-like voice. 
<br><br>
	"I was just having a nightmare, Tieon," Leif lied. Leif was actually reliving the day that Brendelson died. And he was having the dream more and more often.
<br><br>
	"It did not sound like just a nightmare. What is really wrong, Leif?" rumbled Yeoul in his low bass voice. 
<br><br>
	"Yea, Leif. You've been having these dreams nearly every night, and you still haven't told us what they are from," Frok repeated.
<br><br>
"Maybe someday, I will be able to tell you," Leif answered mysteriously. He didn't want his friends to know of his horrible mistake. The day Brendelson died had been the worst day of his life. He had lived happily with Brendelson and still he had allowed his master to die. He swore that he would help anyone who is in danger and would save them. He had done that, but he still couldn't get rid of his feeling of grief.
<br><br>
	With that statement, the friends started taking down their tents, and were preparing to leave. No one spoke, as if a distance had suddenly been pushed between them. 
<br><br>
They were currently on the road to Qeynos, the city that Leif had been traveling too when he had gotten attacked in the forest. He dreaded returning here, but they had intercepted a messenger running to the nearest town from Qeynos, had been panic stricken. He had said that the ancient ones had returned. 
<br><br>
	"Are we ready to go?" Leif asked throwing his pack onto his back. 
<br><br>
	"Yes," the others replied in unison.
<br><br>
	"All right, I'll take the lead, Yeoul you take the rear," Leif ordered.
<br><br>
	"Agreed," Yeoul said, taking his position in the rear. As they joined together Leif began walking. Their march to Qeynos would be a long and hard one.
<br><br>
	They had walked for several hours when finally Qeynos appeared on the horizon. Leif smiled as he remembered the large town. He looked at the city and realized something was wrong. The main tower that had been the symbol of Qeynos wasn't there. Leif ordered the others to quicken their pace. 
<br><br>
	"Leif, I don't see the tower! What has happened!" Tieon cried. Tieon had grown up in Qeynos and her family still called it home. 
<br><br>
Tieon had met Leif when she had been traveling to a town far away from Qeynos.  She had just been a young girl then and had been on an errand for one of the clergy men in Qeynos when she was struck by a vision. She dreamed that a man, wrapped in a flowing robe, approached her and silently kneeled in front of her. She was suddenly awakened by a deep voice. She looked at the man. He was kneeled down and his robe was over his shoulder.  She acknowledged him and told him of her dream. She offered to stay with him all his life. Now, after years of training, she had finally returned to her home, to find something wrong with it. 
<br><br>
	"Something has happened," Leif stated, with a grim sound in his voice. He had a bitter taste in his mouth, as if something was terribly amiss. 
<br><br>
	As the party entered the large town a shocking chill overwhelmed them. It was several degrees colder in the town than outside. Leif drew his cloak around him. As they passed several houses they could see the people huddled inside, trying to keep warm. A guardsman came down the path and intercepted them.
<br><br>
	"What are you doing here?" the guardsman asked.
<br><br>
	"We were sent here by an urgent message from a traveler. If you could tell us what is wrong…"
<br><br>
	"Nothings wrong," the guardsman interrupted. It was as if he were concealing something from the party. 
<br><br>
	"I must know what is going on!" Leif roared, his anger overwhelming him. He drew the large sword he carried with him. It was the late King Orag's own sword, and Leif carried it with honor. 
<br><br>
	"I don't know what you're talking about," the guard said, again trying to conceal the truth. Leif drew his sword up to the man's neck. 
<br><br>
	"Tell me NOW!!" 
<br><br>
	"The ancient ones have returned," he said. As he finished the guard squirmed out of Leif's grasp and ran down the street.
<br><br>
	Before Leif could run after the guard, Frok stopped him. "Leif that thing wasn't human, it was made out of ice. Your grip made him start to melt, that's how he escaped your grasp," Frok explained. Frok was and important part of the party, due to his excellent perceptive skills. Frok had joined Leif when he had chosen him to be the victim of his quick fingers. He had successfully gotten Leif's purse, but only for about half a minute. Leif then caught the little halfling by his collar and hoisted him over his head. Frok realizing his error, hurriedly gave Leif's purse back. Leif commended the halfling on actually taking the money and offered the halfling a chance to redeem himself in the eyes of the gods. Frok accepted.
<br><br>
	"Made of ice…" Leif thought, for a moment then race off down the street.
<br><br>
	"Leif! Waiiitttt!!" Frok yelled. 
	<br><br>
Leif ran down the street in pursuit of the guard. The guard was incredibly fast, but Leif wasn't having a hard time catching up to him. He threw a sidelong glance around him. He stopped running. All of the buildings around him were made out of ice. It was as if no regular buildings had ever been there before. The people inside were also made of ice. 
<br><br>
	"Tieon, are you here?" Leif called for his holy companion.
<br><br>
	"Yes, Leif," panted Tieon, out of breath from the run. Leif reminded himself to take a nice 15 mile jog with her.
<br><br>
	"Do you know what used to be here?" Leif asked curious.
<br><br>
	"This is very close to where the tower used to be," Tieon said.
<br><br>
	Leif began running again, slower this time to allow Tieon to keep up. He began to notice a odd tinkling sound that he heard over his foot falls. The farther he ran the closer the tinkling. When the tinkling could grow no louder, Leif stopped. He hid behind a corner. The two others caught up and also hid. In unison, they peered around the corner. 
<br><br>
	Hundreds of ice men were dueling in front of a very large castle. The human icicles looked very fragile, but also very dangerous. 
<br><br>
	"That castle is the answer to this mysterious question," Leif concluded, "Look, we can go around the castle to the side and go through that side entrance."
<br><br>
	The party quickly moved around the castle and stealthily approached the door. As they did, Frok tripped and fell. As he fell a icy hand grabbed him.
<br><br>
	" Ahhhh!!!" Frok screamed, as the ice creature lifted him off the ground. 
	<br><br>
	Yeoul instantly drew his large mace a brought it, with crushing force down on the monsters head. The creature exploded from the blow. 
<br><br>
Yeoul had joined Leif when he had been just a young troll. He had been cast out of his clan when he wouldn't fight in a local tournament. Leif found him hugging a small animal. Leif took him and raised him for several years. Now he was full grown and fighting for his life. Yeoul bashed another creature but was suddenly struck from behind. He turned his head to see another creature, standing with his ice sword pointed at his chest. 
		<br><br>
Leif, sword drawn, brought it down hard on the creatures head. The creature shattered into a hundred pieces. As Leif relaxed he realized that hundreds more of these ice men/creatures were forming themselves out of the icy ground itself. 
<br><br>
	"Form together," Leif shouted, hoping that Frok, Tieon, and Yeoul remembered there battle tactics. As they merged the ice men attacked. There were thousands of them, but one blow usually destroyed them. Leif asked for the others to cover his flank. He lowered his sword and began concentrating. A red glow surrounded him as he became more focused.  
<br><br>
	"Do not move from your positions," ordered Leif. As he said this, the ice beneath them began to melt. Suddenly the earth opened up and hot red lava spewed onto the ice. The ice men melted as well as the ice around them.
<br><br>
	The crisis over with, the group relaxed. Leif could hear a slight tinkling in the distance. The noise grew louder with every passing moment. The party tensed again, ready for more action. The fortress ahead of them suddenly quaked and a whole chunk of the wall collapsed as something large crashed through the wall. Leif looked up and gasped in horror.
<br><br>
	" You have destroyed my city… therefore you must die," the ice dragon boomed.
