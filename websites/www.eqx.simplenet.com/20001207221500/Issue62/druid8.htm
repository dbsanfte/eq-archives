Antonius Bayle surveyed the encampment before Surefall with satisfaction, nodding to himself, and occasionally sending an aide with orders to one company or another.   The forces from Qeynos were arranged in a wide semi-circle in front of the tunnel entrance, and stretched from the river almost to the skeletal ruins.  A contingent of Clerics had cleared it of the undead as the army approached, and now camped there, sanctifying it with prayer and holy magic.  The last thing he needed was to be flanked by some ambitious Necromancer, hoping to win favor with the Gnolls.
<br><br>
His army was laid out in good order, Qeynos guards and Warrior volunteers in lines at the front, each camp with Clerical healing backup.  The spell casters stood back, a wide line of Magicians with their lumpy glowing pets arrayed in front of them, Enchanters and Wizards behind them, waiting and meditating.  Bards roamed, tuning their instruments.  The whole area was bathed in the light from a veritable sea of glowing spheres.  The summoned light made the twilight bright as day.
<br><br>
Antonius floated in the air above the tunnel entrance with the First Wizard, his aides and Captains waiting below.
<br><br>
"No sign of them yet," murmured Gahlith, his unfocused eyes shifting minutely.  He scouted the hills with magic, as the Rangers did afoot.  The Druids were inside Surefall as a last line of defense, praying and communing with Tunare.  Te'Anara had regarded him levelly when he'd asked her about deploying her guild members with the army, and he had dropped the subject.  Everyone knew the path that the Druids had followed under her guidance, but it still rankled.  It was <em>their</em> Goddess this army sought to protect, <em>their</em> home... Bayle shook his head.  He'd learned the art of diplomacy, but it was still hard to deal with the stupid stubbornness of the self-righteous.
<br><br>
Inside Surefall, sitting cross-legged in the dead center of the Great Tree, Te'Anara strove to hear the Goddess.  For days, her presence had been, at best, a dim sensation of wind.  The sap of the Tree glowed but feebly.  Druids milled about outside the Tree, murmuring nervously.  Some had been openly rebellious about her orders to stay out of the fight.  Hagar had shaken his head at her and left without a word.  It had hurt, to see her old friend disappointed in her like that, but she had no choice.  The will of the Goddess came before personal feelings.  
<br><br>
She closed her eyes and once more sought the calm cool peace she needed.  There was a feeling of stillness, like the calm before a storm.  The Goddess was waiting.  Te'Anara knew what she was waiting for.  She only hoped that Aklar would come.  She had done all she could.  There was nothing left to do but, like the Mother, wait to see if it had been enough.
<br><br>
Below Bayle, grouped with his subordinates, Freygar waited as well.  He ran his hand restlessly along his sword hilt, every so often pulling his gaze from the surrounding hills to glance impatiently at Bayle.  He wanted to be at the front, not back here in safety with the Wizards and battle leaders.  He had no head for strategy.  He needed to be where his strength was of use.  Bayle had asked him to wait though, so he stood, shifting and twitching, and generally asking himself why he bothered.
<br><br>
From here, he could see the company that Gera had been assigned to.  They were up the side of a hill, camped at the top, and set to defend the high ground.  He could see white figures moving among the bright uniforms of the guard, but from where he was, he could not make out faces.  Not that he cared where that snippet was.  Pretty or not, she was without a doubt, the most annoying woman he'd ever met.  And far too short.  Freygar searched the hill again, eyes straining.
<br><br>
"My Lord!" An aide dashed up.  "A Range scout team had reported activity around BlackBurrow."  
<br><br>
Gahlith nodded.  "They are beginning to move their forces out."
<br><br>
"Good," snapped Bayle, and nodded to the Captains.  They immediately moved away to their own vantage points, each with a Wizard in tow.  Bayle was the genius behind the battle plan that had each leader high in the air.  Knowledge was the key to winning wars, and communication was vital.  The Wizards would be in continual magical contact with one another, and orders would be relayed in the blink of an eye.  The only problem lay in persuading the First Wizard to release his guild members to Bayle's command.   Gahlith and the leader of Qeynos were apparently friends, but friendship only goes so far.  Freygar hadn't been present for the monumental clash between the two formidable men, but the Wizards had gone where Bayle had pointed, so some compromise had obviously been reached.
<br><br>
The activity in the encampment slowed and then stopped, as everyone waited, poised for battle, all eyes searching the horizon for the first sign of the enemy.  A trickle of sweat ran down Freygar's back.
<br><br>
When the Gnolls finally came, it was as if the ground had turned gray and was advancing on the defenders.  They topped the hills in the distance, saw the bright and orderly army arrayed against them, and broke into howls, turning the night hideous with their noise.  The High Shaman led them, three commanders by his side.  The surging mass of Gnolls swept around them and descended like a breaking wave.
<br><br>
"Fire!"  Arrows arched up and hailed down on the Gnolls.  Grey forms stumbled and fell, tumbling down the slopes of the hills.  There was time for a second and third flight before the two forces crashed together with a sound like thunder.
<br><br>
Freygar stepped away from Surefall, drawing his sword.
<br><br>
"Master Freygar," Bayle's voice halted him.  "I may have need of you here."
<br><br>
"What need?" asked Freygar impatiently.  "They have need of me."  He pointed to the front, where the Gnolls' charge was barely broken.  More and more of them came flooding down the hills.  The Shaman had disappeared, and only one commander remained on the hilltop, a huge dark figure surrounded by lesser shamans.  As the armies fought with steel, a mage war was waged over their heads.  Explosions of fire, ice and wind wreaked havoc among the fighters.  More burst harmlessly against the shields surrounding each Captain, and the one above the Gnoll commander.
<br><br>
"There is a time to blindly charge, and there is a time to wait and choose your attack,"  Bayle said.  He nodded to the Wizard, and was floated down to face Freygar.  "I asked you to stand with me, and you pledged that you would.  What of the honor of the North?"
<br><br>
Freygar wrestled with himself for a long minute, trying to avoid Bayle's penetrating eyes.
<br><br>
"I will wait," he reluctantly said at last.  Bayle nodded as if he'd never expected anything else, and resumed his position up above.  Freygar ground his teeth as the left flank bowed inward, and was barely reinforced by a group of Paladins.  What was the man babbling about?  Freygar itched with the need to be where the battle was.
<br><br>
On the high hill, Gera's camp was holding its own, barely.  Blue flickers of light marked where the Clerics spread their healing arts and kept fighters in the fray.  Yet the Gnolls were slowly pressing inward, sheer numbers making the crucial difference.  They flung themselves on the blades of the defenders with mindless ferocity, fell, and were replaced by twice as many.
<br><br>
"Fall back!" Bayle's voice echoed over the field.
<br><br>
The Qeynos forces made an organized retreat, abandoning the hills about Surefall and consolidating in the valley that led to the tunnel entrance.  The Gnolls pressed harder, as if tasting victory.
   <br><br>
"Bayle," said Freygar, taking a step forward.
<br><br>
"Hold to your place,"  Bayle was looking into the distance, toward Qeynos.  A company of guards faltered, splitting apart.  The Gnolls rushed into the gap and clashed with the Magicians' pets.  A Magician was cut down, and the air was filled with the high pitched sounds of dying elementals.
<br><br>
"Bayle!"  
<br><br>
"Hold."  The man was as cold and calm as a frozen lake.
<br><br>
And then light bloomed in the valley.  A force of guards and Paladins came charging along the road to Qeynos and slashed into the Gnoll's flank.  The defenders rallied, and the tide began to turn.
<br><br>
Bayle landed on the ground next to Freygar and spoke quickly, waving a Wizard over to them.
<br><br>
"Take Morna and go into Surefall..  Let me know what's going on in there.  Te'Anara knows more than she claimed to, I am sure of it. The High Shaman went some place, and I think I know where."  He was up in the air again, passing quick instructions to Gahlith.  Freygar stared at him a moment, and then turned and ran into the tunnel.
<br><br>
Anthiel watched over Aklar worriedly.  She'd been asleep for about an hour when her breathing abruptly slowed almost to a stop and her eyes began flickering rapidly beneath her lids.  When he'd tried to gently awaken her, she was completely unresponsive, bonelessly limp.  The skin beneath her bruises was white as snow.
<br><br>
The door crashed open to admit three Gnoll guardsmen and D'anok himself.  Anthiel hunched over Aklar protectively.
<br><br>
"How gallant of you, my cousin," said the Teir'dal.
<br><br>
"I am not your cousin," spat Anthiel.  "You are a blight on the face of Norrath.  Never name me a relation of yours!"  
<br><br>
"Temper, temper, cousin.  I come bearing news.  Bad news, I am afraid."  He smiled down at Aklar.  "You are about to part ways with your dear friend here."  He snapped his fingers.  The Gnolls came forward and pulled her away from Anthiel.  He fought them and was subdued easily, his arms twisted behind him, a Gnoll arm about his throat.  D'anok glanced at Aklar's face.  "Wake her.  They should get to say goodbye, don't you think?" He laughed.   The guardsman shook her brutally, and her eyes fluttered open.  Her gaze was unfocused and glazed, and her expression didn't change at all.  Anthiel's heart hurt, looking at her.  For the first time, he allowed himself to consider the possibility that D'anok had damaged her mind somehow.
<br><br>
The Dark Elf came toward her slowly.  
<br><br>
"No greeting for me, Aklar?"  He stopped just in front of her, searching her face for some sign that she heard.  "Nothing at all?"  Her eyes remained fixed and still, her features unmoving.  "Most interesting," he murmured and abruptly backhanded her across the face.  Her head snapped sideways, dark hair falling forward in a concealing curtain.
<br><br>
"You bastard!" Anthiel threw himself at D'anok in fury, only to be wrenched back by his guards.  The Dark Elf didn't even glance at him.  He lifted her face with a slim dark finger.  She stared past him into infinity.
<br><br>
"Most intriguing... could it be?"  he whispered to himself.  D'anok paused in obvious indecision and then nodded.  "Bring them both."
<br><br>
They followed the Teir'dal to a small room not far from the cell.  It was lowed-ceilinged, filled with the accoutrements of magic.  D'anok went to a huge slab of black stone and inspected it minutely.  Every inch was covered in runes and patterns that twisted and writhed about each other.
<br><br>
"Crude work, but it will suffice.  Fetch the knife."   A lesser shaman laid a gleaming obsidian knife in his outstretched hand.  He turned it over, tested the edge and pursed his lips.  "Better.  Come.  We leave now."
<br><br>
He made himself the center of a circle of 13 shamans, each wearing a black stone pendant that bore lesser versions of the altar's pattern.  Ten burly Gnolls hefted the slab of stone and entered the circle.  Anthiel and Aklar were held by two guardsmen each.
<br><br>
"So it begins."  D'anok raised his hands.  Silver blue light shot out to every side, and the room was filled with the blindingly bright shimmering of a group Gating.
