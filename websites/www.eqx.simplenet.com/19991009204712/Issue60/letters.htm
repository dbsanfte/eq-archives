Greetings!
<br><br> 
I have only just finished reading one article, but I can't help but writing right this second and saying"
Great work!! Right on man! "
 <br><br>
*smiles*
 <br><br>
I'm referring to <a href="../Issue59/definition.htm">Russell Linton's article</a> concerning role-playing. I hope many other future Norrathians read this and give it some thought. I have always felt that role-playing is fun and not some laborious process. It allows you to truly exercise your own personal creativity.  I have always felt it adds such an incredible element to games(worlds). I can truly say that there is nothing, and I mean nothing like being "involved" in an environment where most everyone is acting(role-playing) as if their character is "really" in the fantasy world(environment). It is an incredible experience.
 <br><br>
*grins* Well it started out as one little phrase.
 <br><br>
Great work, EQX, keep it up.

                   I was just looking through the Everquest sites the
other day after I had just found out I was going to recieve the phase 4
beta. When I came stumbled across your online newspaper and I was
impressed to say the least, the stories were good and the editorial was
excellent, it even had me commenting to myself or cracking a smile every
once and awhile(the names some people picked to play with).  The way you
talked about the game definatly raised my anticipation to play.
Needless to say I thought your paper was great and wanted to say Good
Job.
