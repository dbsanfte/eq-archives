Things are going well, except for having to run for my life to get away from a pair of goblins.  One is a challenge, two is suicide at this point.  So I look around and find my next target.  Somewhere on the horizon is a skeleton (SLANG: a skel).  I can handle him.  I'm full of mana.  According to all signs I can get him.
<br><br>
*BLINK*
<br><br>
Pinhead stares up at me from the wallpaper on my Windows desktop, seemingly mocking my attempts at dimensional travel.
<br><br>
It's gonna happen, of course.  In fact, it's likely to happen a few times in a night when you are testing a beta.  So I decide to take the opportunity to disconnect and reboot to prevent any problems, get a soda, and come back just in time to hear pinhead say "We'll tear your soul apart" and the desktop blinks back to life.
<br><br>
First I connect to the Chat server.  It's generally a sign that the entire game is down for repair if there is more than 1 room called "General Chat".  In fact, I come up in General Chat 5.
<br><br>
Need I say what appears on screen?  Anyone who has logged back into a game that went down knows what madness reigns when one logs back in.  I count 1 name in red… Sony personnel.  There is an enormous scrolling list of yammering, mewling, cursing individuals sending barbs back and forth.  You can just hear the 989 employee sighing on the other end.
<br><br>
That's not to say that all of them are yelling at the 989 employee (SLANG: a sony).  No, just a very vocal ¼ of them who can not tell for themselves that the swelling masses of chatting individuals are a sign that the WHOLE game went down.  There is also another vocal ¼ who insist on answering the redundant "Is the server down?" message with their own "Obviously you #$*%!" (Yes, there is a chat filter).
<br><br>
Ever tried to follow a thread in chat when there are dozens, even hundreds of folks online?  Here's how a conversation (Names changed to protect the silly and insufferable) typically sounds!…
<br><br>
UnixRules:  Is the server down?<br>
Pogoschtick:  I was in Qeynos zoning<br>
DrPuss:  Does anyone know how to get a <<x>insert quest item here><br>
Bogusone:  Did the server crash?<br>
Lotto69:  That sucked<br>
Motorhead:  Man once you get a real sword this game rocks<br>
Picknick:  PORTISHIA ARE YOU IN HERE?<br>
Wordsworth:  OF course the server is down!<br>
Ulysses: 989!  Can you get my Stuff for me!  I lost my corpse!<br>
DrPuss:  I'm in Befallen and I can't find one.<br>
Lotto69:  I was about to kill a <<x>insert creature here><br>
Igneous:  Did the server go down?<br>
Newbian:  989 How Long until the server comes back up?<br>
Stumply:  Pick go to Erudin Chat<br>
989-<<x>employee>:  The whole server is down for an update.<br>
Bogusone: When will it come back up?<br>
Motorhead: For how long?<br>
Luigi:  It'll be up when it's up!  You ungrateful bastages.<br>
Mostell:  You can get a <<x>quest item> in surefall.<br>
PigglyWiggly:  How do I memorize a spell?<br>
Bogusone:  Will the server be back soon?<br>
Picknick:  PORTISHIA?<br>
Igneous:  Man this game goes down a lot<br>
Luigi:  Shut up you loser.  You lucky you get to play at all!<br>
Wordsworth:  Don't like it go back to UO!<br>
989-<<x>employee>:  Server should be back up in a couple minutes<br>
DrPuss:  Is the <<x>quest item> something I can buy?<br>
Stumply: PICKNICK it's me!  go to Erudin chat!<br>
Igneous:  Do we need to download anything?<br>
Motorhead:  Thanks 989-<<x>Employee><br>
Mostell: Nope.  You've got to take it from<<x>name monster><br>
Luigi:  Thanks SONY!<br>
<br>
Imagine all of this in the space of 12 seconds.  (Incidentally, there's not Quest like the one I mentioned here).
<br><br>
Let me first say that this is magnified by 5 or 6 times (currently).  Because the number of "General Chat" rooms increase dynamically in proportion to the number of people logging in to the chat server.  So anybody who can count 5 chat rooms for general chat can realize that the server is down.  And the same conversation is happening in each one of them.
<br><br>
Is there a fix for this?  Not really.  It's been acted out on many betas and it will continue in betas the world over long after this game has gone "pay".
<br><br>
I've decided to characterize these folks by their obvious traits.
<br><br>
The "DUH" group.  They insist on asking a question that anybody with common sense could figure out on their own.
<br><br>
Then there's the "Ungrateful Bastard" category.  They know it's a beta, they know they've paid *nothing* so far and that only limited numbers of people have been let in, yet they insist on complaining about something.  It's hard not to feel bad about losing your stuff, but when you've read the rule that says "No items will be restored--This is a beta!" and they ignore it, they deserve what they get from…
<br><br>
The "Defenders".  Luigi and Wordsworth.  They know it's a beta and they're here to never let you forget it!  Say something bad about our benefactors… I dare you!
<br><br>
The "Illiterates" are folks who won't read the manual.  Instead they want to ask everyone how to do things.  A hint:  "How did you know what level I am?" is a reasonable question, "How do I cast a spell?" is bound to draw cries of READ THE MANUAL!
<br><br>
Among all those who would frequent the chat server there are no creatures lower than… "THE SPOILERS!".  This is a tandem of individuals; One asks a question that is something you should discover on your own in a game ("How do I do this quest") and One that answers ("All you have to do is…").  Please…PLEASE PLEASE!  If you are ever asked a question that would be something that perhaps everyone in the room might not want to know, then go ahead and answer the person PRIVATELY.  Either find out their e-mail and reply, or TELL them specifically.  Don't shout out a game secret in general chat.
<br><br>
There are more categories.  The dEWd is the best known (In chat they boast about their level, where they've been, and how big their sword is or how many orcs they killed today).  Nothing wrong with being proud.  Just save the boasting for in-game, where folks can leave the pub.  The last category is the least noticed and most thankless… the "Helper".  Some folks try and help out by giving answers to questions without shouting "read the manual".  It takes a lot of patience.  In fact, it takes more patience than I have.  I've kept my helping to doing so in-game.
<br><br>
Over the next months there will be plenty of discussion of how the game plays, how to do the quests, what spells there are.  And you'll see plenty of pictures of creatures that you should wait and see when you reach whatever level it takes to get to said creature, as it increases the awe when you finally reach one (I'll never forget running into a sphinx and an undead pawn!  Don't stare, just run!).
<br><br>
I figured I would give you a taste of what happens when the server is down and the bright images and flashy effects recede, and the withdrawal pains start!
