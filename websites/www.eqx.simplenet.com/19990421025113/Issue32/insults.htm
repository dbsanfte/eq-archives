A good while ago I wrote an article on <a href="../Issue8/racism.htm">racism</a> and another on <a href="../Issue9/racism.htm">racial interaction</a> in Everquest. With some of the information we have on how Norrath will be a seething hotbed of racial mistrust, I realized that we will probably all be playing racial bigots to a certain extent.  It's already happening in IRC.  I hope to play a dwarf bard (yes, I know, it doesn't look like there will be dwarf bards, but if you read my article on <a href="../Issue7/rpout.htm">Role-playing outside the lines</a>, I'll probably still do it anyway) and I find my self in good natured insult fests with people in #everquest who want to play ogres and dark elves, while coming to the defense of fellow short people, like halflings and gnomes.  Since I am sort of out of practice of being a bigot (thank goodness), I thought I would do some research on it and look at the roots of racism and how we could bring some flavor and intensity to Norrath by being creative with our in-game racism.  Let me throw around some sociological terms so we can come to grips with what we are discussing.
<br><br>
<em>Ethnocentrism</em> is the tendency to assume that one's culture or way of life is superior to all others.  <em>Prejudice</em> is a negative attitude toward an entire category of individuals.  <em>Discrimination</em> is behavior that excludes all members of a group from certain rights, opportunities or privileges.  When we decide to be racist, we are really looking at an interaction between these terms.  Sociologist Robert Merton  defined 4 types of racist individuals.
<br><br>
1.  <b>the unprejudiced non-discriminator</b>
<br>
 This individual believes in equality and practices it.  "all races are my brothers"
<br><br>
2.  <b>the unprejudiced discriminator</b><br>
 This individual believes in equality, yet in his/her everyday behavior, discriminates. "Some of my best friends are elves!"
 <br><br>
3.  <b>the prejudiced non-discriminator</b><br>
 This person has negative attitudes towards other groups, but won't practice it as a matter of practicality or law (for instance,  a human tavern keeper who hated dwarves would still hire a popular dwarf bard as an entertainer) "Well, he's a dwarf, but some people like that stuff."
 <br><br>
4.  <b>the prejudiced discriminator</b><br>
       This person believes and acts as if other groups are inferior. "Elf scum, we don't serve your type here!"
<br><br>
There are several theories as to why people are prejudiced.  The <em>exploitation theory</em> keeps a racial group in a subordinate social position, like a lower social class, often for economic reasons. The scapegoating theory says that prejudices people believe that they are society's victims.  In this sense, <em>exploiters</em> abuse others, and <em>scapegoaters</em> feel they are being abuse.  We could think of a pre-Civil War plantation owner as an exploiter, and someone who thinks that Jews own the economy as a scapegoater.  Other theories examine the authoritarian personality as being basically racist, and still others look at environmental causes, such as a male competing for a job against three females.
<br><br>
The content of prejudice is the stereotype, an exaggerated generalization of traits of a certain group.  A stereotype arises out of a small fact that becomes a broad sweeping categorization against a certain group.  This generalization can become a <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> when conformance to the stereotype by the affected group becomes evidence of the validity of the stereotype.  Sometimes people holding negative stereotypes of a group in the abstract, however, don't apply them in the specific (I call this the Michael Jordan effect).
<br><br>
With all this theoretical information, we can see how we can make racial prejudice part of our experience on Norrath. It gives us a why and how for racial attitudes that help guide the role-playing experience.  Here's an example.
<br><br>
Borin is a dwarf.  He thinks that other races are the reason that dwarves have difficulties in Norrath, and that other races are jealous of dwarven accomplishments.  Elves, in particular, he sees as deceptive liars who trick other races into believing they are not interest in wealth, and go and steal it from dwarves and horde it.  His group of adventurers contains an elf mage, but he thinks that this particular character is ok, since "he really isn't an elf".
<br><br>
Norrath seems predicated on having lots of racial strife, and it is important to remember that some racial attitudes will come from historical events, and not just be unsupported prejudice.  If you are an elf, and orcs burned your homeland, you have a good reason to hate orcs.  
<br><br>
I hope that you see this as a way to make the in-game experience of Norrath a more varied and interesting one, rather than take this as a blueprint for your real-life activities.  Doing the research for this article showed me that prejudiced belief patterns and discriminatory behavior are easily entrenched and difficult to eradicate, and it encouraged me to be more vigilant personally.  I hope that this article, in addition to being a game tool, helps us gain some insight into why we act the way we do.

	That's right!  I'd like to do a racial epithet article, so we can get some good interaction going back and forth.  If you have any good names to call any of the races of Everquest, send them in to (email here).  I'll make a list and compare some of the best ones.
