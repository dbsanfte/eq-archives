I am sure you're going to read this and say "That's Winter all over" ..rofl..but you made me think of it so I have to tell it to you.
<br><br>

The bullies in our neighborhood were a gang of sorts, led by a nasty scruffy girl named Jackie. She wasn't all that tough, but she had a friend who was 16(!) who was also very nasty and had very bleached blond hair, which made her cooler than any of us 12 year olds. Somehow I was cast in the role of defender, and the other kids would run to me when there was trouble. I was usually smart enough to get them out of it, picking my approach so as not to face the whole gang and always having my staunch defender, my collie Sheba, at my side.
<br><br>
Of all my brothers and sisters, my baby sister was the apple of everyone's eye. She was sweet, and pretty, funny and helpful. Everyone adored her. It was September, my baby sister's birthday, and she had just received a brand new bicycle as a gift. Dusk was approaching, but she decided to take one ride around the block before it grew dark. Not ten minutes after she left the house did she appear running up the back steps crying. "Jackie pushed me down and kicked in the spokes of my new bike."
<br><br>
It was all I needed to hear.
<br><br>
I ran out the door in a flash and down the street in a red, blind rage of hate. I had forgotten to be careful, and I had left the house without my dog. I spotted Jackie lounging against the stop sign at the end of the street, and made a missle of myself in her direction. I stopped a mere 6 inches from her face, stared straight into her eyes and said "You are dead".
<br><br>
The look of fear on her face was instant gratification to me, although I had a moment's puzzlement when her expression changed and her eyes left mine to look over my left shoulder. 
<br><br>
I looked up and saw that I was surrounded.
<br><br>
There were six of them - the three brothers that usually hung with the gang, another bigger guy that I didn't know, and her - the blonde. They weren't close, though... and didn't look like they wanted to get any closer. I hadn't lost my rage and it was carrying me through somehow, and I knew for certain for just that moment that they were ALL afraid of me... that I had done something to make myself bigger... and that no one dared touch me. They began to yell taunts at me, but they weren't moving any closer. I turned my attention back to Jackie and began to close on her, when I sensed that the mood of the group was changing.
<br><br>
That's when I learned my second lesson of the night - attitude will only get you so far, after that you've got to follow through.
<br><br>
Then the group began to close the circle around me, sneering and taunting all the while. A small bead of worry began to form in the back of my mind, but I ignored it. Wasn't I invincible? Didn't the good guys always win?
<br><br>
"You and your stupid sisters. We'll beat you ALL up every time we see you."
<br><br>
One step closer...
<br><br>
"Your whole family sucks. Just wait till you try to go Trick-or-Treating this year."
<br><br>
Two steps closer...
<br><br>
"Yeah, and your old man... gettin' us in trouble about breakin' that window..."
<br><br>
Another step closer...
<br><br>
"Yeah, your old man is nothin but a... aaaaack... arrrrrrgh"
<br><br>
And I looked in amazement as my father appeared out of the darkness and lifted the little hoodlum up off the ground by his shirt collar using only one hand.
<br><br>
"What were you saying about me?"
<br><br>
"Aaaaaaackkk... nothing! Nothing, sir!"
<br><br>
"Oh! All right then" And he chuckled and set my tormentor back on his feet. The ratfink wasted no time in running off after his friends who had already fled. It was obvious that my sister had finally gained enough coherence to spill the story along with the important detail that there were SIX of them.
<br><br>
I walked back home with my father.
<br><br>
"Pretty big bunch of them there, huh?", he asked quietly.
<br><br>
"Yeah. I could have taken em, though", I replied.
<br><br>
I never forgot to take my dog with me after that.
