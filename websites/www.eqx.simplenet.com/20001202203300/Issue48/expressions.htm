There have been a number of topics submitted, some of which are very interesting and well written, that all relate in some way to a common theme.  Balance.  And so, without addressing any submission in particular, I would like to discuss this.  I will let others respond in more detail to each specific topic.
<br><br>
Basically the questions revolved around how to maintain a variety of classes, races, and skills in EverQuest.  It has been witnessed in various other online RPGs that players shortly discover the "best"  combinations and then everybody flocks to become the most powerful character in the world.  No one wants to see the same thing happen in EQ.  So how can this be done?  It is not as difficult as you might think.  It's all about balance and defining early in the game's development cycle what your purpose is.  
<br><br>
Games like Ultima Online were based on a single player game, and thus the online incarnation of it was also focused upon the individual.  There was a combination that allowed players to be the most powerful, and most everybody went that route.
<br><br>
The well balanced online RPGs put much more emphasis on group tactics. For example, a solo mage may not live long enough to dish out the killer damage, because he has so few hit points.  A solo warrior may live much longer, but have a hard time getting through the thick hide of his enemies.  The troubles arise when you have combination characters and end up with physically strong mages, and magical damage dealing warriors.  Again, it comes back to balance.  If these combinations are allowed, the physical and magical aspects of the character must be much less than those of a pure mage and pure warrior.  The single player should not be a full replacement for the two.
<br><br>
But what about races?  If every warrior is a Troll and every wizard is a High Elf, then that makes for a boring atmosphere.  One of the main attractions in EverQuest is the racial diversity, and it would be a shame to ruin that.  Once again, that brings us to balance.  Every class has different base stats.  These can be tweaked so that every race has both advantages and disadvantages.  Maybe the Troll has huge amounts of strength and regeneration, but maybe he is also a slow moving target who can't dodge a thing.
<br><br>
Another balancing technique that has a lot of potential is the racial interactions that have been brought up by 989.  Since each race has a separate hometown populated by that race, it is quite possible that a particular race will not be able to travel into various parts of the world.  This is a disadvantage if that area contains the magical item you are seeking for the quest you are working on, or a weapon you are trying to purchase.  Some races will be more hated by others.  I can't imagine the Troll being welcome into a human town.
<br><br>
I have a lot of experience with MUDs, and one in particular has a lot of the same aspects I have read about EverQuest.  <A HREF="http://www.bat.org">BatMUD</A> has 33 races, 21 classes, nearly 200 unique spells, PvP, quests, events, and over 200 players in game at most times.  The MUD has been around in various forms since 1990 and still going strong.  One way this MUD helps to achieve balance is to give each race different multipliers to the exp they earn.  For example, that Troll may earn only 75% of the exp for a kill, while a Human would gain 100% of it.  They also modify things like the cost of training, thirst/hunger rates, and healing rates.
<br><br>
This serves to illustrate that there is a lot an online RPG can do to maintain diversity and give a reason for playing any race/class combination.  The developers just need to design it in at the earliest phase of development and stick to their original goals as they add and modify game features.  Since the EverQuest staff has stated the game will focus on groups, racial interaction, and variety, I am certain that they are putting forth a significant effort to achieve the proper balance.  During the beta test program, they will be monitoring player diversity and will be able to make any necessary adjustments.  So rest assured, eager fans, that our wishes should become reality.
