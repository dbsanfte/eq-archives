First off, I wanted to say that I am aware that my last editorial sounded a bit harsh.  I received a few letters and comments telling me just how harsh.  The following short snippet was from Delphaeus, and is pretty typical of what I heard:
<br><br>
<em>I couldn't help but respond to your most recent Editorial. I went away from reading it thinking, 'Hmm, Abs doesn't think EQ is going to be much fun'.</em>
<br><br>
I also heard some comments from the EQX staff.  In fact, Oghma wrote his first <a href="edito.htm">editorial</a> about it.  So all I'm going to say in response is this:  I think that EverQuest will be the best computer game I've ever played.  But I was not really aware that I had expectations that it would rival my weekly games for my roleplaying enthusiasm.  Those expectations were unrealistic.  So I'm sorry if I made it sound like I thought EverQuest was not going to be a great game.  That is not the case.
<br><br>
Now, on to this weeks editorial...
<br><br>
Well, having written an EXPRESSion this week, I'm sort of ranted out so this issue I am just going to babble about a few brief subjects that are on my mind.
<br><br>

For those of you that do not know, Avault has decided to shut down it's forums for Tanarus and EverQuest.  As a poster in those two forums for well over a year now, I now that I will miss the place.  I wanted to thank Avault for hosting them.  I also wanted to thank all the folks that I have met there.  We have had discussions that ranged from the ridiculous to the truly inspired.  I suspect that several of the ideas that were brought to light in that forum (can you say dueling?) have influenced the designers of EverQuest, at least a little bit.  They have influenced me a lot.  So thanks to all of you for being there.  I suspect we will now turn our attention to the poor folks of alt.games.everquest.  Hehe...  I hope they have braced themselves. :P
<br><br>

There is now a third EverQuest movie out.  I have, of course, watched the two previous movies.  Now I have seen the third.  I still think that the music for the first one, with the hard driving beat, was the best.  But this new one shows us so much about the game.  I'm still impressed.  The spells look impressive, I loved the fact that they showed us shots of the races.  I'm sure that there will be tons of speculation about what can be gleaned from that movie.  I'll leave that to the others.

For those of you that are curious after reading my commentary last week about the monsters and their lost key, we were not able to recover it.  I managed to convince the Humans to kill all of the Goblins.  All but one...  The accursed Kozak, Goblin Shaman, escaped with my... er... our key.  So I put a price on his head.  Again, shocked the GM a bit, but he was able to deal with it.  I wonder how many Goblins are trying to take their leaders head in order to gain leadership and a small reward from a winged bard.

<br>
I'm off to Las Vegas to celebrate the start of the football season.  By the time you read this, I'll probably be broke...  :P  That may explain why I have little to say this week.  I'm sorry about that.  I have just been too busy this week to dredge my mind for something interesting to say.  My brain is numb.  Hopefully a short vacation will help me out.
