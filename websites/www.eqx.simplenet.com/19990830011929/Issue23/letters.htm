I suppose this a "letter to the editor" regarding your last <a href="../Issue22\editorial.htm">editorial</a> (in issue 22).
<br><br>
As a DM I too have found this a difficult thing to judge.  But I dont
think people are necessarily a bad judge of it.  I try to modify the
rules and give experience where experience is due.  Sticking to the
classic, "You kill monsters and thats how you gain experience" is ok for
some but when you are serious about roleplaying it just doesn't work.

What a good DM must do is be in touch with player's characters and their
goals.  You have to be able to spot behavior that is out of line.
Usually for such transgressions I try to mention something to the
player.  "Now didn't you say your character was deathly afraid of water?
He seems pretty anxious to hop the boat to treasure island...."  and try
to remind them of things they may have forgotten.

Of course the player is the final judge of how the character is played.
It must bring about in game consequences though if their roleplaying
goes very far afield from their concept.  The character must be forced
to adjust to circumstances. (i.e. "Ok, so your out on the high seas and
the boat springs a leak.  I'm assuming everyone can swim; well of course
except the guy who was only until recently deathly afraid of water...")
