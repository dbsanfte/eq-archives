   "Turn off that computer!" Chris shouted at the top of her lungs.  
<br><br>
Jeff did his best to ignore her request, and continued to play.  There was something about spending the day at his mother in-laws that just did not appeal to him on a Saturday.  It wasn't so much the long drive to get there, or that his wife's mother was a huge nag.  It was just the fact that he would have to sit there and listen to her parents talk about all the things Jeff didn't do right as a husband.  Lectures on how they should spend their money, and what investments they should be making.
<br><br>
"RIGHT NOW!" a shrieking voice echoed from another room.
<br><br>
Jeff knew it was only a matter of minutes and those words of anger would escalate into a full-blown fight.  Jeff turned off his computer, mumbled a few choice words under his breath, and headed up to get a shower.  Once he reached the bathroom he tossed off his shorts and hopped into the cold water that Chris had left him.
<br><br>
"GROWL!!  There's no hot water!" Jeff screamed.
<br><br>
His screams fell of deaf ears.
<br><br>
"Daddy said too make sure you brought your 401k portfolio, and he would check over your stock options." Chris shouted from the bedroom, now calm as a spring meadow.
<br><br>
"He can kiss my arse." Jeff mumbled under his voice.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"I said he sure is smart." Jeff shouted.
<br><br>
Jeff finished his cold shower and proceeded to get dressed.  
<br><br>
"Ok I'm ready." Jeff said, pulling on the final piece of clothing making his outfit for the day complete, an old pair of jeans, and a worn out Budweiser T-shirt, and a pair of (once white) grass stained sneakers.
<br><br>
"You're wearing that!" Chris gasped.  
<br><br>
"Um yea!"
<br><br>
Chris gave him a disgusted look, knew it would be a hopeless battle, and turned her attention back to her hair, which was not doing what she wanted it to do.  Getting her bangs just the way she like them was a challenge just short of a miracle. Chris always got excited when taking the family over to her parent's house.  It was a day she could show her family just how successful she had become, as a wife and a mother.  It was something she was very proud of. 
 <br><br>
Jeff headed back into the computer room and fired up his computer.  
<br><br>
From one hundred feet away Chris heard the static charge of the NEC 17" monitor and knew her husband was back on the computer.  "Turn that off!  I'm almost ready to go." 
<br><br>
Jeff knew this meant he had at least another thirty minutes he could enjoy himself before the days torture began.  
<br><br>
After forty-five minutes Chris was ready.  She herded up the children, got Jeff off the computer again, and loaded everyone into the family car, heading to the in-laws.  
<br><br>
Jeff backed the car out of the driveway and headed towards the exit to the freeway.  
<br><br>
After a forty-five minute drive they arrived at Chris's parents house, pulling into the driveway.  
<br><br>
Chris's father walks out the front door waving at the children.  
<br><br>
"Grandpa!" They shouted, happy to see him.
<br><br>
Her father then tuned to Jeff and said "Hey park on the street would you? We are expecting more of the other family today."
<br><br>
"<em>OH great what the hell are we?  Not good enough to park in the driveway I guess</em>." Jeff mumbled under is breath as got back into the car and moved it to the street.  After parking the car Jeff headed into the house.  The rest of the family had finished exchanging hugs and were settling down on the living room furniture.  Jeff found a spot on the floor, since everyone else had beaten him to a chair.  
<br><br>
"So Jeff, Chris says you got that new promotion?"
 <br><br>
"Yea Sir, sure did." Jeff said and smiled.  He was very proud of his accomplishment.
<br><br>
"You know when I was your age I was making twenty thousand more." Her father added and walked into the kitchen. 
<br><br>
Jeff smirked.
<br><br>
Chris shot Jeff an evil stare as it to say "<em>Don't you dare start anything</em>."
<br><br>
Jeff bit his tongue. <em>Why does he always have to outdo me?</em>
<br><br>
Chris's father returned to the room.  The conversation continued about one issue after another related to finance.  
<br><br>
"Well I sure hate to tell you how to run your life Chris, but you guys need to invest more money.  It's the only way you're going to have anything for retirement." He said.
<br><br>
"Well I think I'm doing alright." Jeff replied.
<br><br>
"Well don't forget my little girl there.  Hell without her income you guys would be up the creek." Her father laughed.
<br><br>
"Up the creek?" Jeff started to get angry.  "Hey look I'm a top executive of XYZ Company.  I earn a very comfortable living."  Jeff retaliated.  
<br><br>
"Comfortable?  Well maybe for your standards."  Her dad answered. 
<br><br>
"My standards?  Well I guess we can all get Dad's money to start…"
<br><br>
"JEFF!" Chris screamed, staring deep into Jeff's eyes.
<br><br>
The room fell quiet.
<br><br>
"Well let's go eat." Chris's mother said, trying to restore the piece.  Like Chris, her mother was also the piece keeper, and very good at it.  She had been doing it for many years for her out spoken husband. 
<br><br>
The family ate dinner, but the conversation didn't get any better.
<br><br>
"So Jeff tell me.  Just how much money do you think you and Chris will need to have saved to make a decent retirement?
<br><br>
"Oh I don't know." Jeff paused.  "<em>How much are you going to leave us when you croak?</em>" Jeff imagined saying in his head.  He looked at Chris's helpless expression.  He knew she looked forward to these family gatherings.  He paused and then added replied. "Oh I don't know sir.  How much do you think we need?"
<br><br>
Her father's answer required the rest of the time at the supper table.
<br><br>
By the end of the day Jeff was physically drained.  
<br><br>
Chris sensing that her husband had taken about all he could take made the official announcement.
<br><br>
"Kids get your stuff.  We are leaving."
<br><br>
"Awe do we have too?" He said with a look of disappointment, then turned the corner and grinned.
