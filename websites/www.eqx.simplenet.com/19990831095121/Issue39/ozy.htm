Gublink Furnhorn stood before the window of his bar, The Lumberyard,
watching the rain fall and grumbling to himself.  "Grey rain fallin' on grey
walls in a grey town.  Why must it bloody rain all the time here?"  At the
sound of rushing footsteps near the front door, he turned swiftly and
picked up his cudgel, his compact frame prepared for the worst.
<br><br>
The door swung open widely and a tall, hooded figure stepped in, quickly
seeking shelter from the rain.  Closing the door behind him, he turned his
back to Gublink, removing his cloak, shaking it off, and hanging it from the
pegs near the door for that purpose.  He then turned and faced Gublink,
arching a narrow eyebrow as he regarded the cudgel wielding dwarf facing
him.  "So, is this how you welcome an old friend?"
<br><br>
"Ozymandius!!!" shouted the dwarf, dropping the cudgel and stepping forward,
his hand extended in greeting.  The tall Erudite accepted the proffered hand
and winced as the dwarf's exuberant shake gently crushed his fingers.
<br><br>
"Easy there, my powerful friend...these are my stock and trade" said the
tall mage, cradling his hand and trying to massage feeling back into them.
<br><br>
"Come, t'your table" and the dwarf placed a hand on the taller figure's back
and pushed him to a small corner table.  On the way to the table, he turned
to the bar and called for a bottle of Kalish and a tray of muffins, then
settled his friend into his favorite chair.  "Tell me, how have you been?"
<br><br>
Ozymandius frowned.  "I am neither ancient, nor infirm, and do not need to
be treated as such.  If I can burrow in the ground for roots to eat, I can
certainly get my own food here"
<br><br>
"But you are one of the few celebrities we get here, old friend" chuckled
the dwarf, "since the passes have become...well...impassable"
<br><br>
Ozymandius gratefully accepted the Kalish and took the tray of muffins,
gifting the waitress a sly wink as he did so.  She blushed prettily and
hurried away under the flirtatious gaze of the mage.  He then poured
himself a glass and drank deeply of it before speaking.  "Yes, that is one
of the reasons I am here.  The Sabretooth Gnolls have become more aggressive
of late, pressing their attention upon travelers more and more."
<br><br>
The dwarf growled quietly, the sound of his thick knuckles cracking as he
clenched his fists.  "Aye, they've even found ways around the gates, over
the mountain walls, and in here to High Pass itself.  By Brellis, I caught
one o'them in MY stores!!!  They breed like rabbits and are not afraid to
die.  A bad combination."
<br><br>
"My opinion as well" said Ozymandius.  "I've been speaking with Commander
Tehafer about increasing the patrols too and from the roads into Karanas and
Kithicor, and she agrees with the need but does not have the resources.
Apparently Anna is tying her hands."
<br><br>
"Damn the woman!" shouted the dwarf as he slammed his fist into the table,
sending Ozymandius' supper tumbling.  Only the deft dexterity of the mage
averted the waste of a perfectly good bottle of Kalish.  "Our beloved
'Mistress Anna' has no business governin' a Keep like this.  We are at WAR
with these mongrels!  Cannae she SEE that?"
<br><br>
"She has other business to attend to, my passionate friend.  I will meet
with her this afternoon and attempt to guide her true, as High Pass is too
valuable a strategic point to allow it to fall into the hands of the Gnolls.
Unfortunately, the Gnolls of Sabretooth are not my only concern.  Rumour has
it that the Gnolls of Split Paw, Infected Paw, Black Burrow, and Sabretooth
are beginning to see past their differences and begin to work (albeit
reluctantly) together."
<br><br>
Gublink raised both  bushy eyebrows in surprise.  "Gnolls?  Working
t'gether?  That is indeed bad news"
<br><br>
Ozymandius nodded gravely "Antonius Bayle of Qeynos is keeping the Black
Burrow threat in check, as well as threatening Infected Paw, but Sabretooth
and Split Paw run unchecked.  If Tehafer can not increase her patrols, we
may lose the Pass entirely.  If that happens, the Alliance will be split and
Freeport may very well be overrun."
<br><br>
The dwarf picked up a muffin and nibbled on it idly, looking down and
thinking.  "What about Rivervale?  Cannae the haflings help out even a
little?"
<br><br>
"No, my friend" stated the mage.  "Rivervale is all that stands between the
rest of the world and the Goblins of Runnyeye.  Now that they've walled off
that area, they must remain ever vigilant as the Goblins are fierce and
numerous.  The haflings have their hands full."
<br><br>
The pair sat in silence for a while, the mage sipping his wine and the dwarf
picking at his muffin while the rain pounded down outside.  After a few
moments, the mage looked up and regarded the dwarf, then smiled...
<br><br>
"So, how was your day?"
