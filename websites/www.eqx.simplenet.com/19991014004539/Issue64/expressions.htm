<em>I've heard there is to be a PVP only server in the upcoming phase 4 beta.  Why is it that the pleas of serious roleplayers go unheeded when they ask for a server for only roleplayers?  I think an all RP server would be incredibly popular and not much more difficult to accomplish than the PVP server which seems a sure thing.  Tell me is the PVP lobby so powerful, or merely more persistent?

Hector Cornwall,
<br><br>
	I can agree with some of what you have said about it not seeming fair, but I do think the players have more power over the situation than just complaining about it. In Ultima Online, a few social groups of role players that had petitioned for a Role-Playing only server all decided on one server and dubbed it the unofficial role-playing server. This was a choice made by the players and not by Origin Systems. Since Origin did not give them a Role-Playing only server they did the best to populate one server and play the way they wanted to.
<br><br>
	Another thing I would like to point out that everyone should have learned from in Ultima is that even the role players could not decide on one true way to role-play. Everyone had their own ideas, and not everyone role played as much as the next guy, and some people also power-gamed at the same time as role played and were disliked because of it. Truth is, none of them were correct on the proper way to role-play because role playing is about individuality and being sociable to those around you. It isn't something you can write rules about, and a role-playing only server would have to have rules.
<br><br>
	There was also a problem with those players that wanted to role-play evil. Well, no one liked being killed or stolen from, and since competing with and killing other players means you have to push your character to the limits to be better, it turns into power gaming anyway, even if they are never kewl doods. 
<br><br>
	I am pretty sure that if all the people who want a role playing only server decided on one server, named it and made that choice publicly known that Verant Interactive would at least acknowledge the choice and maybe support the idea in the future. Since Verant GMs will be running dynamic quests, I am not sure but I have a hunch that they will have a lot of fun working with a server mostly full of role players, because they players would provide more interaction for them as GMs in return. 
<br><br>
Thanks for your letter,


<br><br>
