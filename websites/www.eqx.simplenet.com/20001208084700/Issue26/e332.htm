Asheron's Call has a simpler interface for skills (a text listing with numeric
values of your skills) and inventory (all done on the right margin, atop a
humanoid representation of yourself).  This is a lot easier to use.  AC also
lets you use the right mouse button to move around, as well as the arrow keys.
While I found it cumbersome to control, I'm sure others out there will find
it easier to maneuver in this way.

<b> Combat </b>
<br><br>
EverQuest has an attack mode toggle button that gives the server control
over the basic combat events.  Each round, you swing.  This is what all of
us with a MUD background are used to.  This also has the advantage of being
lag proof.  You aren't required to click your way to victory, which means
if you lose a precious few seconds of data, you won't find yourself a bloody
corpse.  EQ also lets you use your combat skills as additional attacks, 
which gives those with a clicking fixation something to do during battles.

Asheron's Call requires manual aiming and manual clicking to attack.  You
hold down the mouse button and let the power bar reach the max.  Meanwhile,
you move your cursor over your target, and it has arrows telling you if you
are too low, too high, or whatever.  When you release the button, you attack.
I think this system will have to be scrapped when they realize a little lag
will destroy the whole thing.  If it is lenient and lets the client report 
whether it was a hit or miss, they will find Diablo-like cheaters taking over.
