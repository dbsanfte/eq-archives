<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Baaarrrrrkkkkk!!grrrr... Why do all those humans keep attacking me, when I run down the road? grrrrrrryap yap, baaaarrrrkkkk 
<br><br>
Fippy
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear blue gnoll, they aren't really attacking you any more than you are attacking them.  It is simply a confusion of languages I think.  They hear "Baaarrrrkkkkkd!grrr" and then translate that to mean you're saying "I want blood" when what you are actually saying is, "Would you like some Fippy Snax?"    You see the problem?  Now,  the solution.  First, may I suggest you start with a "yap" and dispense with the comments about what you are going to do to those you meet on the road.   This is another case of cultural displacement I'm afraid.  So while, of course, the gnolls expect to be greeted in such a manner, others without exposure to gnoll conventions will simply misunderstand and hold out their sword instead of an empty hand to be filled with gnoll sweets.  Next, after a friendly yap and perhaps a light bark, slow down just a little so the would-be attackers can see that you are merely on your way to town for supplies and are gladly sharing your trademark candies as a friendly gesture.  I can't assure you that all will understand your change of behavior so I suggest you take along a friendly bard to interpret and to reassure those who think you actually would use those big canines to bite.  As for the humans, well, they haven't written to me yet, but if they do, I'll ask them to remember that even blue gnolls need a friendly smile and a wave of greeting along the road.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail!  I am new to the land of Norrath and have enjoyed it very much!  In fact I highly recommend it to those who have no real life. I'm kidding. <chuckles>.  Okay. I am very interested in role playing with my 6th level Pally vs power gaming. I have tried to learn more about what is expected of a Paladin.  I am learning this slowly.  Having said this, I fear I may have already killed things that I should not have (e.g., bears, wolves, pumas). These are not evil creatures, as opposed to skeletons, orc's etc.  How do you raise level's without killing?  Or do I need to slay these beasts in order to level up? Also, I wanted to journey to other lands to explore what Norrath has to offer but I did not know if this would find me looking for a corpse that has 'poofed'.  Is it safe for me to travel?  How does a Paladin not jeopardize what she stands for? Leveling up is great but I also want to practice the many skills available.  Sincerely,
<br><br>
Jorelei
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah I have a soft spot in me heart for Paladins.  Just think of the evildoers wending their chaotic way along the roads, making travel miserable for all those who cross their paths.  And then along comes a Paladin, shining in goodness, ready to make the world a better and truer place.  I don't know what your guild leaders allow you to kill but of course, you will agree that, if by killing that which would harm others, you actually save lives and the happiness of families across the land, then killing is part of your duty.   There is no way to level in Norrath without killing, but you can be as persnickety as you wish as far as where you choose to go.  Perhaps if you truly wish to help the world you will help clear the dungeons of their foul inhabitants.  Now that you are 6th level, you can travel the world without fearing the consequences of death as much.  My suggestion if you choose to go exploring is to leave your best equipment in the bank, find some travelling companions to speed your journey and share the dangers, and turn your face to seeking new vistas.  If you die, as long as you are level 6 or above, you have 24 hours of in-EQ time to find your corpse (this does include chat time by the way), or up to 7 days of real world time.  Travel can be dangerous but you never know when you might meet those in distress who will benefit from your skills and attention.  Between journeys, in those quiet times,  you will, of course, want to add to your non-fighting skills.  Choose wisely and seek the advice of older paladins for those trade skills that best fit your life.  Good journeys!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Ranger quest for the Short Sword of Morin broken?  I have been camping the area of WK for 2 days and no luck. I would like to find out if the quest is broken or I need more patience? 
<br><br>
Nyla
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvos and Tolth inform me that this quest is working quite nicely if you have some patience.  You might want to ask other rangers about the best strategies for fulfilling it but it can be done.  All the Pillars agreed that this is a nice blade and worth going after. 
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, I have been looking over a bunch of different Q and A's you guys have, here and there, and I haven't seen ANY questions pertaining to rogues. Are there just no rogues out there? Anyways, what kind of creatures can see through Hide/Sneak, and how does evade work with it? One other thing, got any tips for a lvl 5 Dark Elf Rogue pertaining to exp or armor? 
<br><br>
Jerid, Rogue on The Rathe
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my, you know, rogues are certainly difficult to find for question-answering, what with their abilities to just fade out of view if they don't find the matter interesting.  Luckily, a couple of rogues did take pity on me  -- how could they resist helping a young rogue? -- and told me that you should remember that Hide/Sneak is a skill based on level and use.  You should practice them as much as you can to raise your skill quickly.  At lower levels, random mobs will see through hide and sneak.  However as you level up, you'll find that many npcs that can see through invisibility spells, can't penetrate the shadows of your hide skills.  So it's definitely worth it to max your skills.  As for evade, the advice I was given to pass on is this:  stop attack; hit sneak; hope it works; if it does you are now at the bottom of the mob's hate list.  Evade is a combat skill so you'll need to treat it accordingly.  When in doubt, you might want to check with high level rogues you run into for information and advice.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, and well met. I am an orphaned barbarian taken in by the druids of SureFall Glade. During my stay in the glade I met a halfling named Cormach Anklebiter. He told me wonderful stories of his town, RiverVale. I was entranced by his voice and longed to see this place. After a perilous journey, ,for at the time I was only in my first season, I made it to the quiet and charming village. I was disturbed to discover, however, that  they didn't trust me. I have always protected the animals and forest woodland creatures. I understand the halflings have a right to be distrustful with the human encroachment of their land. So my question is this:   How do I gain their favor and trust? It has already been 4 seasons now, and they are still apprehensive of me, except my druid brethren. I have done my best to protect them, and honor their customs. I humbly await for your response.
<br><br>
Sincerely,                 
<br><br>
Archeon of the Hidden Path (5th)

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like you were a lucky child from the chill then to run into Cormach.  I can see how you wish his countrymen were as welcoming and as kindly toward you.  Of course, halflings are partial to their elvenses so even though they might be wary at first, you can join them at their repasts and if they hear of your exploits ridding the world of those they detest and fear, soon they'll be buying you a pint or two to show their regard.  You are aware, I'm sure, of the goblins of Runnyeye, those nasty predators of hairy toes and round cheeks.  I think you need to get your strength and skills up so you can begin to assist in the ongoing effort to keep Rivervale and the misty woods free of such greenskinned nasties.  Then my guess is you'll find that as you offer this protection to them over a period of time, they will soon come to trust you, even if you tower above them and scare them just a bit.  I believe you might also want to come to the aid of a hurt halfling in Misty who seems to need a perpetual supply of bandages.  However, you choose to help the halflings, I think you'll find that it won't be too long until you feel more welcome in Rivervale.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have so far, in my estimation, leveled at a respectable rate - but now at level 16 I find myself 'stuck in a rut' so to speak - what can I be doing wrong?    I kill all shades of blue and easy white/black's, but to no avail!   Can you give some guidance of where to hunt.  I hail from the cold reaches of Everfrost. 
<br><br>
Iste
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A time comes to all, whether bard or warrior, that the home territory cannot teach what we need to learn or offer challenges that suit us.  I think what you might want to do is to consider what other zones will offer you a chance for better experience and even a bit of excitement now and then.   You might want to find mentors to introduce you to the icy entrance to Permafrost or you might wish to go further afield and find a party to explore and smite their way through the Karanas.  While I don't know where you will find what you seek, I do know that if you can gather some companions for the journeys, you will all benefit from the companionship to be found.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cleric of 14 seasons, it is often hard to find good hunting.  Can you offer a suggestion of a site that perhaps has a map of what levels are appropriate at each zone.   Also, a realistic map of each continent would nice.  The current map is too unclear.  (I know of zone maps, just want a real map I can print for each continent) 
<br><br>
Bolus Lumpp
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure where to find a good map shop because every time someone tells me of one, I get lost trying to find it.  However, your best bet is probably some of the more well-known EQ news sites, like EQ Vault, which have a "links" section which will, I think point you to the sites out there that specialize in all kinds of maps.  I hope you find what you are looking for and should you come across me at some crossroads looking totally befuddled, please point me in the right direction.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Freeport Monk on Mithaniel Marr, and I really wanted to know:  Are they ever going to have the other sash and headbands quests?  I mean, I know I can get a black sash from killing my guildmaster, but I don't  wanna do that!  Eck, it goes against my entire character persona!  I was also wondering about the Iksar Monks, what are they gonna have?  I mean, Humans have sashes and headbands, what the hell do the Iksar have, tail ribbons???
<br><br>
Gabriel Vanyier
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, harumph, all I can say about Iksar adornments is that if they get tail ribbons, I get a dress.  It's only fair.  I mean -- geez -- lizards with fancy duds and half elf bards still in plain old armor.  As for sashes and headbands, well, my understanding is that you want to get sashes in Freeport and headbands in Qeynos.  How this works, I don't know, as the only monk I know, Wrenna, is more confused than you on this and totally agrees that no way would she kill her guildmaster.  Since I don't have a great answer for you, and since the thought of a pretty dress is definitely distracting me, I think the best thing you can do is seek advice from a friendly highlevel monk or two on Mithaniel Marr.  Tell them if they aren't nice and friendly, you're going to write to Nep and tell her.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well for a long time (level 14-20) I was killing a bard named Taressa Whistlesong.  Considering this is my first character I didn't realize how bad this would make my life.   Although it was great money and exp, I did hurt my faction with many people.   Well my problem is this --  I need to know how to get my faction up with the following groups without having to get near any of them.   I am kos to most of them.   Now keep in mind I am only level 20:  1) League of Antonican Bards 2) Knights of Truth 3) Ring of Scale 4) Qeynos guards.  Any help would be greatly appreciated because I am getting tired of walking next to a building I don't know and I get whacked in the head by something.  Thanx in advance!
<br><br>
Zerosend
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness, you do have your work cut out for you.  And, as Taressa is a fellow musician, I hope you can make up for the ordeals and deaths you put her through.  I don't know exactly all the factions you must satisfy but here's a way to begin to figure it out.  Make a newbie that would have reason to train in a guild related to each of the above.  Make a list of the factions you receive when you do the training.  Again, using your newbie, try for quests from members of these group and, hopefully, discover, who they hate and who they like.  Once you've done that, take your list back to your penitential higher level character and start killing all the mobs that will raise your faction.  You may need to experiment around for awhile to find them, but I'm pretty sure you can do it.    In the meantime, you might want to scan npcs around you and /con them and you might also want to check some of the EQ fan sites for information on factions if you run into a problem finding them.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day in Highkeep, a guildmate of mine let me try out his Executioner Axe. While in the middle of combat I received a message that told me I did not have the will to wield this weapon. I was wondering if there might be some intelligence to the weapon or if my god <Rallos Zek> has something to do with it. I told my guild mate and he had no idea either. 
<br><br>
Barnes Stormbasher [Raptors] Warrior of the 27th Winter Tribunal Server
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapon holds the intelligence here although what Rallos Zek might be doing is definitely beyond my consideration.  What you will find eventually as you gain in levels, is that instead of the message, you will receive the benefits of the special procs of the weapon.  If you ask around, I think you might find when to expect this to happen.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My question relates back to an earlier edition of EQX Q&A regarding baking/clumps of dough etc. and was wondering if there were any vendors who sell infinite supplies of snake eggs. You can get an everlasting supply of fish from many vendors near the ports and there is even a vendor who has an unlimited supply of batwings in EC. But as yet I have found no 'snake egg merchant'.  Many sell them but only have a handful in stock.  Am I to be ridiculed forever as being the only player over level 20 to actively hunt moss snakes ?  Please help - and keep up the good work.
<br><br>
Cley
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to my friend, the baker extraordinaire and Pillar of Wisdom, Adelrune, and asked him if he knew where to buy an unlimited supply of snake eggs.  His response was very short and to the point.  He said, "I wish!"  Perhaps others can write and let us know if there is indeed a merchant who will let you stock up on the eggs, but if not, you might try helping newbies by  paying them reasonably well for gathering the eggs.  Good luck in your baking.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm thinking of purchasing EverQuest or Asheron's Call, but don't know which. Have you tried AC? Can you make a comparison? 
<br><br>
Unknown
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I've never tried to play Asheron's Call so I don't know how they treat bards and thus can't compare the two games.  (How a game affects playing a bard is my main criteria, by the way!)  If I find out they have half-elf bards who wear dark blue dresses with mauve, green and pale yellow trim, I probably will feel dreadful.  This I do believe, however -- a multiplayer game, for me,  depends on finding friends to enjoy spending time with as much as it depends on seeing fancy graphics and earning nifty toys.  So, while I can't recommend Asheron's Call or compare it to Everquest, I can tell you that ever since Beta 1, almost two years ago, I have met literally dozens of wonderful people in Everquest and I wouldn't trade that for anything. 
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyzar D'vizzrack recently said he made the mistake of earning the disdain of the Dark Bargainers. I am afraid I know a troll (Ourok of Brell) who made the same mistake. Much research by him has led me to the conclusion that the Dark Elves don't give up a grudge. Unless Nyzar has a way to magically increase his faction to complete the wine quest, I am afraid he may never be held in high esteem by the Dark Bargainers. 
<br><br>
Kaynim of Brell
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may well be correct on this.  However, Norrath is a magical land and one never quite knows what will be around the next corner, a monster or a fabulous quest to cure all ills (and factions)! 
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question but a response to the GRY question in Issue 114.  The riddle goes "Angry and hungry are two words in the English language that end in gry.  There are three words in the English language.  What is the third word?" The answer, in all reality, is language. 
<br><br>
Jihnus
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in!  It's a cool puzzle.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You forgot Augry
<br><br>
Tilvaren Frostfingers of Bristlebane Third G-R-Y word
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a word Augry?  I was told about aggry but when I looked up Augry in my Oxford English Dictionary I could only find augury as the closest match.  Can you tell me where to find the word?  Thanks.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoi the ... errrr I mean Hi there! I heard of this GREAT game an' it's based on none other than that incredibly dreamy Lrets ... it's called LRETS ALAXIAN! You can get the reference to it from issue 99. What could be greater than to play in a game featuring that TRULY DREAMY bard of bards LRETS *sigh!*
<br><br>
Lre …errr ..  um Balrog
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile, as much as I would love to meet the incredibly dreamy LRETS and to play his game, I must admit that what could be greater is to play a game where the half-elf female bards got to wear dresses and everyone went around talking about what a marvelous bard Nep is!  However, bring LRETS ALAXIAN over to my cottage and we'll give it a whirl!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize I'm probably not supposed to do it this way, but I couldn't find an email address for you on this site Nep.  I recently relocated from Toril/Duris, and I was wondering if there is any particular server I might start on to find faces familiar to me? Thanks for your time ;)  PS: If you don't remember me Nep, I'm gonna go on every server till I find you, so I can hunt you down and smack ya ;) 
<br><br>
Nymn
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Nymn, my dear, it sounds almost like you'd like a challenge.  Soooooo here goes  -- if you go back and read my earlier columns, you might find a hint about where I play !  (In the meantime, I'll send you an email - it's lovely to hear from you again.)



<br><br><br><br>

Thanks again for all your letters.  It was quite amazing to hear from the blue gnoll.  Who knows?  Next maybe Lady Vox will invite me to tea or Aradune will flash his mighty sword across the pages of EQ Express.  Now wouldn't THAT be something!
