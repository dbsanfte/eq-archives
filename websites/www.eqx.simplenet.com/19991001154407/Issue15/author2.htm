Roleplaying an interesting character is more fun for me, because I enjoy making in-character decisions that are not necessarily the safe or wise choice to advance in the game.  I once had a cleric who had low self-esteem, who was always dithering and deferring to others.  He redeemed himself completely in the adventuring party’s eyes when he ran in front of a dragon to heal our fallen tank paladin.  When asked why he had done it (He survived, barely) He said simply "I would not want to live in a world that did not have the paladin in it.  I was afraid."  An act of outstanding courage was, to the cleric, the ultimate act of cowardice. It is the creation of characters flaws that allows for great, defining moments later on in the characters life.

Now, to take all these elements: youth and inexperience, race, class, flaws, goals, and make them into a character is what we will try to do.  But first, a caveat: NONE OF THESE "RULES" MATTER.  Yes, these are guidelines and suggestions, and can be tossed out at will.  I just spoke with a player whose character concept has his character starting out as a god from another plane, and it was excellent. Not for him the young teen leaving home for the first time.

Creating a character concept is the foundation of role-playing.  The inspiration for a concept can come from anywhere.  Fiction, Science Fiction, Biographies, and myths are often sources of character ideas.  Occasionally, the game design itself is the source of inspiration.  I once made a warrior in GURPS who had powerful magical abilities that he was unaware of, because the game allowed me to design a character with magical ability without using it.  The GM built game hooks into adventures until he discovered his ability, then off he went to become a mage, halfway through his career.  Once a friend designed a character named "Norm" who had completely average stats, across the board.  Just an average guy.
