<b>My Confession</b>
<br><br>
It has come to my attention that some of you think I might be stretching the truth, or even lying about things I write about.  Well I am ashamed of you for even thinking this way about me [<em>gasp</em>].  Remember Razor is your friend, and would never, ever lie or bend the truth.

Fale stepped out of the alley, eyes shifting quickly to scan the street
for signs of activity. In this weather, he sincerely doubted that anyone
would be about, least of all someone who would be interested in his
activities. Caution, however, was something that Fale prided himself on.
Throughout Norrath, there was not another burglar alive who could lay
claim to the exploits that he had accomplished. The Gauntlet of the long
dead king of Neriak, the chalice of Bishop Alderick of Rodcet Nife, and
even a stone idol belonging to the Frogloks of the Innothule Swamp. All
had passed through his nimble hands, to new owners and locales. <br><br>

<font size="-1">
     Weapons have different base damages, different speeds, different weights, different class restrictions, different race restrictions, some are one handed, some are two handed, some are slashing weapons (which is a skill), some are crushing weapons (which is another skill), some are piercing weapons (which is another skill), some cast spells, some are enchanted to increase/decrease stats, and they all look different, too :) 1 dominant weapon? Heh, in EverQuest there won't be one dominate anything. It all depends on who you are, what you're doing, and where you're doing it.

It sickens me to have to tell you this.  I have gone over this in my head over and over again, and still can't come up with a better way of conveying this news.  My life could be in danger for telling you this, but I feel I owe it to my readers.  I guess I'll just come out and say it.

The visions churned on the black canvas of his dreams.  Flickering images of battle and death darted again and again past his eyes, while in reality the sleeping troll tossed and turned on his bed of straw.  Sometimes the troll would sleep in a Cazic Thule temple, feigning worship and prayer just to have a warm place to rest.  Sometimes if he was lucky, the troll would be allowed to lay his head in any number of inns<b>...</b>

The Famed Alarik proudly strode up to the arena. Clad in golden
platemail, his green cape waved with every step he took.  He was the
first warrior to arive at the tournament it would seem. The only other
person there was a mage by the look of him. Brown robed, wearing only a
somber expression on his face.<br><br>

On dark nights, such as this, when rain falls in heavy sheets from starless skies, and eerie gales rustle wet leaves on ancient trees, dark things begin to creep.  Wakened from summer dreaming, they scurry about in their underground burrows, and toy with dark thoughts and musings as awareness slowly returns.

It is considered to be a failing of the soul when one can not believe in Gods or miracles.  By the same point one is thought to be weak of heart if they don't believe in love or when they lack courage in their own abilities.  But what about when one can not believe their own eyes?  What has failed them then if they can't bring themselves to acknowledge what they've beheld?

EQX will be interviewing some of the folks in the EverQuest community, our community.  We will be starting with those that have been around for a while.  These should be names you recognize.  We will attempt to make them in-depth, informative and fun.  To start this new column we have two interviews for you, <a href="interview.htm">SeVeN</a> whom you may know from Moongates, and <a href="interview2.htm">Kunzite</a> from the Tower of Sorcery.
