 <b>Bard</b>

<em>The Bard's stock-in-trade is his ability to play songs. His songs are
actually spells of a sort, and their magical affects last as long as the Bard
continues to sing and play the correct instrument. They have some passing
knowledge of the Warrior ways (mainly for self-defense), but their main focus
is always their art, and so they will never be as skillful as Warriors.</em>

If you read the previous two articles (<a href="../Issue21/thebard.htm">part 1</a> and <a href="../Issue22/troubador.htm">part 2</a>) on bards, you will have seen that bards
are, essentially, the bearers, transmitters, creators, and repositories of
their respective cultures.   Whether the dignified and imposing bards of the
Celts, or the romantic and lyrical troubadours of medieval France, the bard
character is one whose knowledge, training, and talent allow him/her to
reflect the culture back to it's members.  Words and song are the bard's
tools to accomplish this, being the best way to transmit information in the
"fantasy/medieval" environment.

In Everquest, bards use their songs as power to affect events around them, as
medieval bards did, but the effects are spells rather than the power of
language and culture.  Whereas the Celtic bard had the weight of his entire
culture behind his words, giving him power over the members of his culture
that believed in the power of a bard, EverQuest will use song-spells to
obtain the same result.  It's highly unlikely that a warrior player who meets
another bard player will pay as much attention to their words as would a
Celtic warrior.   Reputation or prestige of a single individual could do
that, but not just some guy who is playing a bard.
