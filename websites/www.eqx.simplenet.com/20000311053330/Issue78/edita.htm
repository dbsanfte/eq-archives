One of the hardest things for me to do as a writer, and I suspect it's this way for a lot of us inexperience hacks, is to through away an hours worth of typing.  Especially if that hours worth of typing was preceded by several hours worth of thinking about what to write.  But sometimes ya just gotta do it.  And so the first version of this editorial is... well, I didn't delete it, but it'll never see daylight.  At some point, no matter how right you think you are, you just have to move on.
<br><br>
As I was plowing through the letters for this week and trying to figure out which to post and which had to be left out, I realized that my editorial and our letters to the editors section was becoming one darn slow version of a newsgroup.  I rant, a week later you all respond, and I make comments.  While I love dialogue, and I still feel <b>very</b> strongly about the issue of watering-down EverQuest, I think I'm done arguing it.  This seems to be a pretty clear case of agreeing to disagree.
<br><br>
So I'm going to talk about something that came up in a newsgroup.  Seth told me that EQX, and especially me as editor and the one really responsible for what we print, is just to negative.  He thinks that there have been far too many negative things on this site (this very page in specific) and that anyone considering playing EverQuest that reads this site would go running, screaming into the hills (I'm paraphrasing, and then adding stuff, but that's just creative license… right?).  That made me think about what I'm doing here, really.  I mean, what is it that makes me write these things every week?  And what affect have I had, if any, with all my ranting?  What affect do I want to have?
<br><br>
Well I'll admit that I know more or less how many people read this publication.  It's not a small number.  So I am also aware that there's a good chance that what I write here will be read by a lot of people.  And I sometimes use that to try to push a point of view out into the fore in an attempt to get a result.  I sometimes feel guilty about it too.  But EQX is all about encouraging and inspiring role-playing in Norrath, and I'll honor that.  Sometimes I feel that I have to yell a bit to push what I think is best.
<br><br>
But I never intended to portray EverQuest or it's creators in a bad light.  They may not see the game the same way that I do.  I may complain that they've done (or not done) something that I don't like.  But I respect them immensely.  And I still enjoy EverQuest very much.  I wouldn't be spending my Friday evenings working on this publication if I didn't.  But I wouldn't be serving myself or my readers properly if I didn't say what I felt.
<br><br>
Well, I'm taking the weekend out of town.  All this anger has worn me out.  I'm off to refresh.  I hope it works, I'd hate to come back even more bitter sounding...
