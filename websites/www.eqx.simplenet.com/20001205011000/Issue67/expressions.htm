 Having BETA tested in Phase IV for a little while now, I have discovered that a single player game is nearly impossible, and if not impossible certainly implausible. I realize the benefits of being part of a group, but is it wise to put an axe to those players who may choose to "go it alone?"

Thanks. </em>

This is a subject that has been debated, beaten and thrashed near unto death among the beta testers, the designers and, well, everyone else.  It's certainly something that's worth looking into.
<br><br>
First, the short answer to your question.  No, it is not wise to put the axe to solo play, in any game.  I, for the most part, am a solo player.  This is not something that I was aware of until I started playing EverQuest, since most of my previous roleplaying had been done around a table with several other players.  But once in Norrath, I learned that I really enjoy the feeling of playing alone.  There is a real sense of accomplishment for me to succeed on my own, especially in a game that is designed for group play.
<br><br>
Removing that from this game might just make me stop playing.  And I can imagine that there are a lot of people that feel the same way.  I don't know if it would be enough to bring the game to its knees, but it certainly might make a difference.  I don't think that there is any question that removing solo play from EverQuest would be a bad move.
<br><br>
But is it possible to make this game group orientated (a reasonable and worthwhile goal, as far as I'm concerned), and still allow for viable solo play?  There are a lot of things to consider with that question.  Experience points, death, life...  Can you make it so that one character can find places to hunt and kill things that four characters can't take advantage of?  A fair challenge for one person is a cakewalk for four.  So if the whole game is tuned to handle the solo player, grouped characters will find little challenge.
<br><br>
Well, then put a few 'encounters' in each zone that are a fair fight for a solo player, with a fair reward for success, and leave the rest for the group players.  Do that, and you'll find that groups are farming that encounter because it's easy and safe for them.  Do it that way, and you hurt the group game and gain nothing for the solo player.
<br><br>
Obviously if you make the whole world to accommodate groups, then the solo player just can't exist.  Is that what we have in EverQuest?  Not really.
<br><br>
The folks at Verant took a somewhat different approach.  I guess I'd call it a layered approach.  As your level increases, the game becomes more and more tuned for groups.  So rather than trying to balance solo and group play for the same level characters in the same general area, they've made it so that it, basically, gets much harder to solo as you increase in level.  Any character can make his or her way solo in the lower levels.  Certain classes do, I believe, effectively lose their viability for solo play at some point in the higher levels.  Or at least it gets very hard.  I can't give you solid numbers and classes, not only would I likely be wrong, but its not the way I handle these things.
<br><br>
Verant has stood by their claim that solo play is viable.  As it has been my habit to find a new and more interesting character idea before my current character has made much in the way of levels, I can't confirm this.  I have heard the same stories that you have, that you can't survive alone at the upper levels.  I know it to be true that grouping is by far the easiest way to make your way at the upper levels, and I know that this was by design.
<br><br>
From your letter I have no idea what class you played in beta 4, nor to what level.  But I do know that I managed to get a magician to 14th level.  I traveled mostly in a group of two.  And it wasn't that difficult.  I never had much trouble finding things to take on solo when my partner was not around.  In fact, I was able to hunt in the same areas, I just had to be a lot more careful and run a bit more often.  14th is not a particularly high level, so I don't know how this compares to what you experienced.
<br><br>
Let me say this, though.  I have every intention of playing a solo character as far as I can in this game.  Some times I just like to be alone, and some times the folks that I want to play with are not available.  And if I discover that I can't play that character after a certain level, then well, I'm not certain what I'll do.  I may just feel like playing another character anyway.  I may write a nasty letter to Verant about making solo play viable at high levels.  Or I may quit playing.  I won't know until I get there.  If I get there.  There may be no there to arrive at.
<br><br>
But to answer your question:  No, it is not wise.
<br><br>
To ask you one:  Is there any other way that they could have done it?
<br><br>
If any folks that have an answer to this question want to send me an <a href="mailto:alanvc@concentric.net">e-mail</a>, please do.  If there are any folks that have managed to play primarily solo into the high levels out there, send me a letter about it, please.  I think I'd like to write an editorial on this, but I'll need some anecdotes (in place of personally known facts).
