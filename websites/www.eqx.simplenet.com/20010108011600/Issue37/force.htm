Quoteth the good book, Chapter 12, verse 4, that when you die "You do come back with penalties - but not as a ghost, nor where you died".
<br><br>
The last part of this statement just seems to be kind of slipped in there.  You know, like when you want to slip bad news in amongst the good to keep it unnoticed… "I went to school, ate pizza for lunch, played at Tommy's house, flunked the math test, and I've done my homework already."
<br><br>
Wuh?  You don't come back where you died?  Then where do you come back?  This is an interesting and nearly untouched little tidbit of info, and a nice 'switch' from other topics which have been beaten to death(!) in the newsgroups.
<br><br>
It sounds as if you have a "spawning" point, much the way monsters do.  You know… those places where in UO people would build houses in order to trap monsters within for easy killing.  You die, then *poof* you appear at your respawning point, worse for the defeat, but ready to go.
<br><br>
So the big question becomes:  What if you are travelling with friends?
<br><br>
The screen captures on the EverQuest site bring to mind titanic battles with a couple of mages, a well-placed rogue and a few heavy duty fighter types slugging it out with griffons, skeletons, and all sorts beasties.  So Archanalia the Enchanter stands there and casts his combat spell (assuming enchanters have those), and suddenly the griffon falls from the sky and tears away poor Arch's entrails and displays them for him in that brief moment before Arch collapses to the ground.
<br><br>
Again, *Poof*, Arch reappears at his respawn point.  Hey!  Wait a minute!  My party is fighting all the way off at the Oasis of Marr, yet I am now where?  Qeynos?  Somewhere in the wilderness?  Another continent even?  That's quite a way to travel to get back to your fellow players.
<br><br>
What I am sincerely hoping is that there is a way to allow you to rejoin your party, assuming they want you back (Seeing as how the griffon had no problem with you, you wimp!).
<br><br>
To me, this approach would seem to promote a tendency toward fighting as an individual.  I mean, if you can be slain and sent many, many virtual miles form your party, then perhaps you are more likely to just fight alone.  Mind you, this is great if you are anti-social and have sufficient skill to succeed, but the very nature of playing online is to involve yourself with others.
<br><br>
So, while lacking knowledge of the game mechanics which will ultimately be employed by 989/Sony in their magnificent game [smooch!], I have some ideas on how the large world could perhaps be made a bit more convenient and therefore more fun.
<br><br>
ROOM AT THE INN…
<br><br>
Let's say you hit a new town.  You've wandered all the way from Freeport to Qeynos (They are quite distant on the map of Norrath).  First thing I decide to do is go to the local Inn and see the caretaker there.  I slip him/her a few coins for the room, and now I am set to respawn here.  Perhaps this can be done at any city you come to.  This would be a great convenience, being able to begin at the last city you came into, as long as you are currently maintaining a room there.
<br><br>
LANDMARKS…
<br><br>
Another idea would involve using specific landmarks as "jumping off" points.  Let's say the characters enter an area and pass an ancient tree.  This tree could act as a landmark.  Since it is the last landmark they encountered, it would become their respawn point.
<br><br>
Among notable landmarks could be specific objects created for the purpose (The ancient tree, the standing stones, balancing rock, etc.) or the last city the character entered.
<br><br>
An argument can be made that this is all part of the punishment.  Dying should be hard on the character.  It really should be something to be avoided, but should that always irrevocably remove them from play with their friends?  I can make an argument in either direction, and admittedly there are days where I would say "Yes!  They shouldn't rejoin a campaign where their friends saw them die!" but today I am more prone toward the belief that if a character is going to continue, and for that matter do so on the same server as where they died, then they should be able to continue in the quest undertaken by their party.
<br><br>
Undoubtedly there will be those who will keep to themselves and rarely team up with anyone.  Being a force of one is certainly a convenience in itself, but for an online game like this where the name of the game is Interaction, perhaps there are simple ways to allow characters who enjoy playing together to get back together without massive hours spent crossing the map just to meet up.  This is one penalty too many in a socially oriented game.
