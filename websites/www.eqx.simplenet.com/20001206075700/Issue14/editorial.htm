I hope you all found us easily enough.  Simplenet may be our home for a while, but don't 
be too surprised if we end up moving again.
<br><br>
This may be the first time here for some of you, since just after posting this I will be posting our URL to the search engines for the first time.  Even if you are not new to EQX, I wanted to stress again that we thrive on your feedback.  It is very hard for us to work in a void.  We can only judge our success or failure by your responses.  I encourage you to flame me if I screw up (not like you wouldn’t) and praise us if we do something right.  Otherwise we may pass a good idea by and stick with one you don’t like.  And that would be bad for all of us.
<br><br>
As to the rest of it, I don’t know.  I mean, I THINK my application was good.  But good enough?  Sheesh!
<br><br>
Harrumph!  It seems that lately I have been doing all my ranting and raving in the news group.  I’m all raved out.  I promise to save something that really sets me off for the next editorial.  Be ready…
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
