Well, it seems that my gaming companions are complaining now that I don't write about them anymore.  I always thought that they hated the fact that I mentioned them.  But I guess they miss the limelight, if you're generous or deluded enough to think that this editorial could be considered the limelight.  I would have thought it was more like the quicklime, but then I'm a bit harsh.
<br><br>
So in honor of my gamers, and perhaps as a way of getting a point or two across, let me tell you about our latest advent…  escapa…  journ…  umm… our latest big mess.
<br><br>
Let me start with a quick synopses.  We are playing a pack of Werewolves.  We are all new to the whole Lupine scene, both as characters and as players.  Over the last few weeks we've been taught the ways of the Sept.  We've learned how to change our forms, fight, hunt, survive… all the usual wolfy things.  We've killed vampires (leaches in the Lupine vernacular) and we've done a few simple tasks.  We just recently completed our initiation.  Cubs are required to complete some hideous tasks to become full members of the Sept.  We passed our test with some degree of success.  And now we are trying to become a pack.  To do so, we need to find a totem, a spirit to guide us.
<br><br>
So to start the game this week we were all asked to provide the GM and the pack with our wolf names.  We earned the right to these names last week when we completed our initiation.  Our homework assignment was to come up with our new names before this week's game.  So after an hour or more trying to get names for everyone that we liked (or that the owner of the name at least liked), we moved on to the next order of business, naming our pack.  This took a bit longer, since we all had to agree on the name (though I suppose as the Alpha I could have just picked one, but we wanted all the players to like the name).  So, let's see… I arrived late, since I had to work on this EQX thing, so we started at about 1:45.  We had our individual names and our pack name by, oh, maybe 4:00.  Then we had only one more menial task to perform before we could move on, choosing a totem.
<br><br>
Well, picking a totem is far more important then naming a pack.  We talked about it for a while.  We narrowed it down to a few reasonable choices.  The Bear (my preference):  Totem of healing.  The Werebears were the healers of Gaia, where the Werewolves are the warriors of Gaia.  But a long time ago, in a complicated series of events, the Werewolves managed to kill off a lot of the other Were creatures.  And they killed nearly all of the Bears.  In our travels we were rescued by one such Bear.  It was out of respect for that individual, and because of the need to heal the wounds between the Were races as well as healing Gaia herself, that some of us wanted to follow the Bear.  The other main choices were the Stag and the Owl.  The Stag is a primal creature of war.  It is honorable and venerable.  A solid choice.  It carries no stigma (the Bear for example is not trusted among the Wolves) and is a powerful totem.  Many of us were strongly in favor of either Owl or Bear, so choosing the Stag would have been settling.  But we just couldn't choose a totem just because it was safe.  The Owl ended up being our choice.  The silent Hunter.  The wise beast.  Not a bad choice, but not what I wanted us to stand for. 
<br><br>
The Owl also brought with it a problem.  The Owl and the Rat are natural enemies.  And the second largest group of Wolves in the area, the Bone Gnawers, follow the Rat.  One of our members is a Gnawer.  So he had a few issues to deal with.
<br><br>
By the time all of that was done, it was after 5:00.  We were all a bit exhausted.  Most of us were frustrated a bit, either because we thought the group chose the wrong pack name or totem, or just because it took us over three hours to get all that done.  So tensions were high, even after our break for dinner.
<br><br>
Luckily for us, our frustration didn't end after dinner.  We began our search for our totem.  With a bit of research we decided that we would ask our Sept totem, the Coyote, for advice about finding the Owl.  The Sept, by the way, is basically the collective name for all the Wolves in our region, effectively a really large pack made up of smaller packs.  Where each pack has a totem, our Sept also has a totem (actually, two totems).  But in order to be allowed into the Cairn to speak to Coyote, the guardian of the Cairn insisted that we bring her a magical lens.  This lens was part of a Weaver controlled device someplace in the Griffith Observatory.
<br><br>
So we decided to meet at my character's nice ranch home to plan our field trip out to the observatory.  I, being one of the few of us that actually owned anything, much less a vehicle, picked up a few of the others to bring them to the meeting. It was here that the real trouble and frustration began.  In my car I had three passengers.  One was our Bone Gnawer friend.  In his previous human life he was a lawyer for those that were put down by the man.  He was a heavy drug user and an advocate of freedom.  His Wolf name is Laughs at Justice.  He called shotgun.  In the back was the only female in the pack, Quicksilver.  She is a sixteen year old with a serious desire to be the Alpha.  She had challenged me for leadership of the pack.  Laughs at Justice defended me in that challenge, and defeated her.  So perhaps she was a bit frustrated with him, and probably with me, regarding that matter.  The third passenger was our newest pack member, Changes Faces.  He is a Lupis, meaning that he was born a wolf, not a human.  He was sent to join us by his Sept, the Winter Wolves from the far north.  This was probably his first trip into a large city, and certainly his first trip in a car.  He chose to remain in his natural form as a wolf, as that at least gave him some comfort.
<br><br>
On the way to my home Laughs at Justice turned on the radio.  Changes Faces was a bit agitated with this new experience (wolves, it appears, don't make radios, nor to they play rock music), but he said nothing.  Quicksilver asked that Laughs at Justice turn the radio off.  Laughs hesitated, wanting to know why.  When she asked him to turn it off again, I sensed the anger in her voice and turned it off myself.  The rest of the trip passed in relative silence.
<br><br>
There were other discussions, disagreements and such before we came to the decision to scout out the Observatory early the next day before finalizing our plans.  These, as usual, caused tensions to rise even further.  That night we had a Wolf slumber party.  It was during the trip the Observatory the next day that all hell broke loose.
<br><br>
We all piled into two cars and drove out there during the day to look at the place and come up with a final plan to steal this lens.  The seating arrangements were the same in my vehicle.  The only change was that our Lupine friend Changes Faces was in human form, something that he is not accustomed to.  Again Laughs at Justice turned on the radio.  In a fit of amusement later, the player of Laughs at Justice decided that it must have been the Abba song <em>Dancing Queen</em> that was playing on the radio at the time (this game takes place in the early 80's).  You can't imagine the amusing commentary that can came from that decision…
<br><br>
Once again Quicksilver asked Laughs at Justice to turn off the radio.  This time I sensed the anger in her voice immediately.  But I was not really thinking about it, and didn't do anything.  That turned out to be a mistake.  Laughs at Justice began to argue that it was a good idea that Changes Faces get used to such things as music if he was going to function in the Los Angeles Sept.  She asked him to turn it off a second time, much more angry this time.  He hesitated, beginning, I think, what probably was a long speech about adaptation and how it is a good thing, even for monsters like us.  Quicksilver reached her boiling point…
<br><br>
As Werewolves we are creatures of Rage.  We were given the gift of Rage by our mother Gaia.  For us it is a tool, something like electricity.  Used properly and with proper precautions and restraint, it is a powerful thing.  But in this case it was a full moon, and Quicksilver is a warrior.  The moon always brings us closer to our Rage, and a warrior tends to have a greater depth of rage than most.  She lost control.  She not only went into a frenzie, but she fell into the thrall of the Wyrm.  She went completely mad, unable to recognize friend or foe.  She proceeded to destroy the radio and moved on to destroying Laughs at Justice.
<br><br>
When it was all over, two of the pack were left lying on the pavement with near fatal injuries (it takes a LOT to kill a Werewolf).  Actually, three of the pack when you include Quicksilver.  The only way to take her out of here Rage was to knock her out, and you practically have to kill a raging Wolf to knock her out.  This happened on the freeway during a relatively high traffic period.  The pile up was huge.  Two people died, and eighteen were injured.  A terrible tragedy.  And a terrible destruction of the veil.  The veil is what keeps us hidden from humans.  Just like the Vampires, the humans would hunt us and kill us if they knew of us.
<br><br>
More happened that night, but most of it centered around that one event.  In fact, ever since then we've been talking about it.  It's the discussions about the whole event that I wanted to talk about first.  In all the time that I've been playing roleplaying games, I've only once been involved in a play-by-email game.  And that one was a failure due to the lack of interest from most of the players.  A few of us got so far ahead of the rest, that the continuity was all screwed up.  I've never even considered using e-mail for roleplaying purposes since then.  But ever since we started this Werewolf game, we've been chatting over e-mail.  At first it was just to try to organize where we were going to play.  But it evolved into discussions about the game and then into in-character discussions.  Without permission, I want to paste in here part of one of our discussions.  The red text is from me, the blue is from Laughs at Justice (and Crystal is Quicksilver's human name).  Also note that I have the advantage here, in that I was the last one to respond.
<br><br>
<font color="blue">Now Crystal did complain about the effect of the music on Changes Faces and demanded I shut it off.  I do not recall Changes Faces saying anything at the time and I assumed she was having some difficulty expressing her own feelings about the music or me.  Surge turned the radio off, as was his right as the "owner" of the vehicle.  (As if anyone could really own anything, it's all a power trip) </font>
<br><br>
<font color="red">Again, you skirt the problem by being flippant and self-contradictory.  You attempt to portray Quicksilver as a deranged person, one with a problem not only with music in general, but with expressing herself.  I find from experience that neither of those is true.  You also deny the possibility that she was actually concerned for Changes.  Perhaps that's a bit of projection on your part.  And I suppose if it is my 'right' to turn off the radio, then it was not your 'right' to turn it on.  You can't use it both ways.  Either you were usurping my rights by turning it on, or I was suppressing yours by turning it off.  Pick one and stick with it.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="blue">On the next trip I again made an innocent attempt to listen to some music, something millions of Americans, including children old people and the handicapped, do every day.  This time I was greeted with the same argument. Now I showed some hesitation in turning off the music.  I pointed out that if Changes Faces was to be expected to survive in the city he would have to get used to music.  At this point I had yet to hear anything from Changes Faces.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="red">Again with the distraction.  It matters not one bit that old people and children listen to music.  Please stop using such tricks.  You are not a lawyer in this pack, we don't need one.  And you failed here, as you did at the time, to note the anger in Quicksilver's voice.  Something that we all need to be aware of, considering our nature and the gift of rage that our Mother has given us.</font>
<br><br>
That all may sound a bit hostile, and it's not the most hostile of our exchanges.  But, it seems anyhow, none of us are taking any of this personally.  Laughs at Justice and I are still friends, despite how unhappy our characters are.  It is not necessary to take your anger with you out of the game.  I encourage all of you to take your joy with you, but leave your anger and unhappiness in the game.  Remember, one of the first uses for roleplaying was (is?) as a therapy device.  A way to express your anger and unhappiness.  A roleplaying game can do the same thing.
<br><br>
One of the other things that we have been discussing through e-mail was the tremendous amount of time that we spent talking and the very small amount of time that we spent fighting.  The only fight we had that night was amongst ourselves when Quicksilver frenzied.  For some of us, that was fun and was enough to make for a good game.  Others wanted more action and less talk.  I think we agreed that it was just the nature of the group that we did so much talking.  Another group, run by the same GM in the same game, could have had a majority of combat and a minority of talking.  The same thing applies in EverQuest.  If you want to hang out and talk a lot, telling tall tales and playing up your character's insanity, find a group that likes to do that.  If you want to kill everything in sight, find a group that feels the same way.  Only in EverQuest there are a lot of groups playing at the same table, so to speak.  There is no need for one to ruin the game for the other, all can play together this big table.
<br><br>
Unfortunately this week we won't be playing.  Something about a holiday or somesuch.  But next week we'll get to see what happens when you go to the Umbra inside the stronghold of the Weaver.  Should be fun!
