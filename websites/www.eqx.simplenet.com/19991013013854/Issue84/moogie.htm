<b><em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I seem to be at a huge bind on the Prexus server.  See, whenever I log on, I become inundated with messages from various... err... females, with whom I have had relations with... its hard, passing by the needy, and not help, especially when one knows that rewards often follow... I now am spammed incessantly with questions and hellos... I don't know who to bash heads with, and who to ignore! Help!

<b>Dear Draysoth
<br><br>
Ooooh, lucky boy, all dese womens fighting for your attention.  Why not auction yourself off everytime you come online?  Whoever wins gets to barsh heads wit you all day.  Moog did dis once, but no one bid.  Guess Moog too high class for dem cheapskates.
<br><br><br>

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I have what might be a problem. I'm a Paladin o' Brell (afore ya say anything that ain't my problem).  My problem is that whenever I find meself in a large group o' folks, be it at the docks er another place where folks tend ta gather, I find meself workin' it so I stand behind one er two attractive ladies. 
<br><br>
The ladies in request seem to be of almost every race on Norrath an' I find meself fightin' the urge ta reach out and touch these lovelies. Not a very good way for a Paladin ta act I thinks.
<br><br>
What should I do Moog?

<b>Dear Gunnarr
<br><br>
   Moog not see de problem.  You gots to meet girls somehow. If it a prob…prolab...bad thing den just come see Moog. You can reach out and touch Moog all you want. 
</b>
<br><br><br>

<em>Dear Aunti Moog,
<br><br>
I have been reading your letters and your replys for some time now, and I am saddned. Why all the violence? Why bash someone you love in the head? Why kill your fellow beings, when you can live in peace with them? I am saddned by all this violence, and I hope you can explain it to me...

Dear Sad
<br><br>
  Not kill, silly.  Just barsh lightly.  Den, when dey get up again, you can barsh dem again.  Good for lots of hours of fun. You know what dey say.  You always hurt de ones you luv.  And if dey not around, den whoever is nearest will do.
