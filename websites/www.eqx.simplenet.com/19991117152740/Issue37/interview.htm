<p style="text-align: justify">

<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome Jagang of the Doomseeker clan! First I would like to thank you for taking the time to be harassed by me, and also for being willing to share some information about yourself with us.
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My pleasure.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why don't you tell us a little about yourself. Age, Hobbies, Career?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm 22 years old and I just landed my dream job as a Quality Assurance tester for a major game company. Computer games are pretty much my main hobby, RPGs being my favorites. I try to get some exercise every once in a while too, and play some basketball. 
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned rpgs as one of your hobbies, could you give us a little introspective look at your experience and maybe list a few favorites?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I played my first pen & paper RPG when I was about 7 with my older brother, and when I was 9 we got our first computer. I played Wizardry, The Bard's Tale, early Ultimas, the Gold box D&D games, and just about every RPG that has come out since.  My favorites are Betrayal at Krondor, The Bard's Tale, Ultima 7 and Wizardry 7.

<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a massive role-player as you seem to be, what would you like to see EverQuest implement that you think would make it a cut above the rest?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I hope Everquest will be the best Online RPG to date, but I do have a hope for something... I know they won't do it though.
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But...
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spit it out!
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not the beer either! Wouldn't want ya committing alcohol abuse and blowing up your computer at the same time.
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think they should have a server or two for people who would like to role-play. This doesn't mean you cant powergame at all, but you could sign a waver or something saying you won't be disruptive to the role-playing environment of others... That way if somebody is a pain in the ass, they could just be banned from those servers.
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And beer, of course!
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aye, would like to see that myself, but I am sure it is highly doubtful...
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What race class combo do you plan to play from what has been released about them so far, and which do you think will be the best?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I don't understand their reluctance, myself... but I guess that's why I'm not a game designer.  Well, of course I want to try them all, but I think I most want to play a monk. Also, one of my first AD&D characters will be making an appearance in Norrath, a Halfling Ranger.  I'm not much of a mage myself. I like to cast a spell or two, but I all for getting in the melee.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a guildmaster must be quite a task. How do you go about it and what would you suggest to others thinking of becoming guild masters? Also what do you think of guildhalls and guild crests being implemented in EQ?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I think that being able to submit guild crests would be awesome. And I like that guilds will have to register with 989 in order to get a hall.  As for going about being a guildmaster, I think for one, you need a lot of slacker time to work on the webpage and all. After that, I think you shouldn't try to do everything yourself. Your members will appreciate it more if you let the guild run the way they want it to run.   Also, be careful about who you let in the guild. It isn't fun to deny people, but if you have an open door policy, your guild's quality will suffer.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the first thing you will do when you get into the beta?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take off all my clothes and run wild!
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j/k
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hehe.
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When (if) I get into beta, first I think I'll probably create a character of each of the races, so that I can see each starting town.  The graphics look awesome.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That they do and I can see lots of people trying that myself.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you feel about the beta manual being published on message boards? And what do you think of Brad's statement regarding it?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think its a shame that people abuse the anonymous nature of the internet, and the testers that gave that information to such unreliable sources should have their CDs given to me. I hope that those people are banned from the game like Brad said, but I'm not so sure it will be possible.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hehe, we all wish we could have their cds!
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you be extensively powergaming, role-playing, or engaging in pvp action in EverQuest?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a combination role-player/powergamer, like most people I think. I will be role-playing as much as possible, particularly around people I have never met, but I do a little powergaming also. I like my stats; I just won't talk about them in game.
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since they have the duel option in the game, I see no reason to be +PvP all the time.  If I have a beef with someone, we can take care of it.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is your dream for EverQuest. What is your ideal take on the game and how it should be?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeez... tough question.  I hope that Everquest will be an adventure that I never want to leave. I hope they implement lots of GM quests, and special items, and I hope the EQ community puts on lots of quests of their own.   I think what it comes down to will be us players, and I hope we help make it best that it can be.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of community, how do you feel that we as players can make this a better game?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we can make it better, by not putting up with the nonsense of some people. The switch will allow us to ignore their actions, and there is the "ignore" feature to ignore their words.   Also, I think that we should try to get together for quests, and adventure. Web sites like this one here are great for building the story of Norrath.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On stories, do you feel as players we should be able to change the history of Norrath?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should be making the history of Norrath. Hopefully it will go on for a long time, and player made empires will be built and fall. I hope there are heroes of epic proportions that don't go unforgotten. In that way we will change the history of Norrath.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are your views on advancement speed and economy in Norrath and how do you think it should work?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think if the advancement take 1.5 to 2 years to max out like Brad hopes, that would be about perfect. I don't want to see anybody that is super powerful after a few weeks or even months of playing.   And by the stories here, on EQX from the anonymous testers, it sounds as if it's really hard to get any kind of good equipment. I like that too. I hope things are very hard in this game, so you cant get ahead being a lazy player.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you feel that EverQuest will live up to its hype?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I sure hope it does. But hype can be a hard thing to live up to.  Unfortunately, I don't think is has as much to do with how good of a product 989 Studios puts out, as to what us gamers make of it.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are your goals in the land of Norrath? What do you want to do to make it a fun environment?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My goals or my character's goals?
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both.
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, my personal goal is really to just have as much fun as I can. It is just a game. But my characters will have their own goals as well. I don't know if this is really a goal or not, but personally I would like to help out and participate in as many quests (player of GM run) as I can fit into my schedule, and maybe put on some as well. 
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well that about sums up my questions for the evening. A lot of great answers there! Thanks for taking your time to do this!

<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for choosing me.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any last words or comments before I close up shop?

<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to say...Brad...I'm still waiting.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That it?
<br><br>
<b>Jagang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, that's it
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hehe thanks again.
