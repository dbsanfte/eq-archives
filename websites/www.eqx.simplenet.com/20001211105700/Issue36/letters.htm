Absor,
<br><br>
Just wanted to drop you a line and tell you how much i've enjoyed
reading EQX. I just discovered this website two days ago, from reading
another about EQ.
<br><br>
The reason i can't remember where exactly, is that i've spent all my
spare time since i discovered your paper, catching up, fronm issue 1
to 35 (ok, so i read 35, 34  and 33 first). Anyways, your editorials
are one of my favorite things to read (brings back memories) along
with Razor's (reminds me of my life now, minus the kids, heh). Not to
mention all the finely written informative articles, debates, opinions
and facts about EQ. I love this game already and i am just as anxious
as yall to start playing it. I too applied for the beta test and am
always hoping to get my NDA. Of course, i apllied rather later than
most, so my chances are slim of anything before the last phase of
closed beta, unless my application is possibly judged by merit before
date of sending. Ah well, the beta test is my main reason for writing
this to you, after reading your About Us section, i had a thought.
That if looked at a certain way, your staff's (shouldn't that be
staves?)profiles read like their beta test apllications . i thought
that was rather funny. I won't keep you any longer, just thought i'd
share this with you, and i might send you an article someday soon for
your perusal. Keep up the great work.

[Ed:  Hehe, everyone note, you have a better chance of getting your letter published 
if you suck up to us... :P]</em>
