Take for instance, you are a Non-PVP and a PVP approaches and begins
role-playing the bandit role. Speaking a bit of the perils of the wilderness,
and how such a heavy purse will surely just weigh you down. I mean, what if
you feel in water! You would surely drown. Here is where we must as the
Non-PVP, not react in a negative way and just run away, or go, "Shut up
PK.." Take full advantage of the situation, role-play it. If they do well,
reward the person with gold. A small portion of gold is very much a well met
trade for a good role-playing situation. Reward them for trying.

This is where the PVP's come into play. The PVP's must learn to role-play
also. Now that there is a switch, you aren't going to find that you have to
chase down people throughout hundreds of miles of land, to get their plate
armor. If they are PVP, they are going to know the drill. If they are not,
they will have it set to Non-PVP, and you can't hurt them anyway. So, with
this, take the moment to challenge your opponent. Introduce yourself in some
long winded history of your character. Then, slice his head off if need be.

Everquest is going to either be made a great game, or a terrible one, by us
as players. The gaming system aside, we are ultimately the ones responsible
for the upkeep and enjoyment of the game, as we are the community of players
that live in the fantasy world of Norrath. Take the time to interact with
your fellow players. Be it a confrontation, or a friendly introduction, spend
it doing what makes a Role-Playing game worthwhile, Role-Play.
