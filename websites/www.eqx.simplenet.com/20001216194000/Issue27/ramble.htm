    How many Ultima Onliners reading this have ever seen someone in UO say
	"cool dudez" or "hey man, wuz up?" or, more commonly, something totally
	incoherent like "yah, wel if you're moms' lazey were then I think your a
	farry"?  Probably about 95% of all Britannians have heard something along
	those lines.  Unless you play with a very select minority of players,
	you play UO with the rest of the populace, who neither "speak" in the
	context of the role-playing environment they're in, nor form
	understandable, gramatically correct sentences.

Some people reading
	this might say to themselves, "That's nitpicking.  You shouldn't
	criticize people's grammar or spelling.  Yours isn't perfect, is it?
	Besides, no one cares, and no one's perfect, and it's just a game, and
	etc etc."  Whoever says that is right, at least in part.  My grammar has
	never been perfect, I've been known to say and type some unintelligible
	things, and I agree, no one is perfect.  However, grammar and how you
	"talk" can have a very large impact on how enjoyable you make an online
	game for everyone else in it.

To make this article have something do to do with EverQuest, I'll use it as
an example in what I say next.  The idea behind a roleplaying game is to act
out someone else's life, right?  If you play an RPG, you probably play it and
enjoy it because you can remove yourself from the real world and enter a much
more interesting and fantastic one, right?  Let's just assume both of those
statements are true.  If that's the case, then you also probably envision the
romantic world you want to enter as something much more perfect than the real
world.
