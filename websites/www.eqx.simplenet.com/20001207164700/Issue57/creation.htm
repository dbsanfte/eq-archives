	Here I am again, burning this image into my eyes like an old rear-projection TV. Twelve races, 14 possible classes, dozens of different faces. Staring at this screen I begin to daydream, and begin to slip into the duality that exists in most of us like some sort of RPG-centric schizophrenia. The powergamer Ian and the role player Ian begin to separate and exchange debate. 
<br><br>
	Memories of MUD creation screens come forth, remembering pressing the command to re-roll dice for hours on end, only to cycle past the perfect stat combination several times in my methodical trance. Thank god EverQuest has a stat allocation pool instead of a random generator. All the while the role player Ian is dreaming of what he could become from the meager list of races and limited professions.
<br><br>
	Much credit can be given to those who wrote evaluations of each race and profession, as it gave us time to let the ideas start to sink in. So when we get stuck at the character generation screen, we have that many more images to contend with in our minds. I vaguely recall someone telling me that if you had your mind made up before you got to the screen character creation would be simple, but I am afraid I selectively forgot who said it and why.
<br><br>
	King Ak'Anon beckons me to join the Gemcutters, or to inhabit the arcane library in his city. I sample through variation of old men's faces on extremely small bodies. The powergamer Ian notes that the stats on one of these short fella's are almost par in some critical combat areas with their distant dwarven cousins. Heck, they are even faster than a dwarf. These guys are some pretty deceptive old men.
<br><br>
	Like the last image, this one fades and I click elsewhere on the race screen. The title-screen music has long since stopped and with the employ of a nearby stereo I sample some appropriate music for my current mood. Elven harp music plays as the yellow-robed High Elf animates before me. Ah, the halls of the Capitol of Felwithe. The role player Ian brandishes his fine crafted Elven blade and salutes the Great Mother. A High Elf Paladin I shall be, and I shall rid the land of the filth known as the Crushbone Orcs, and free the slaves held in those mines. The powergamer Ian pokes the role player in the ribs until he clicks on a different race more suited for melee combat. 
<br><br>
	Not yet in a magic-user mood nor listening to non-melee music, I ignore the power potential of a High Elf spell caster and drift to the neighboring city of Wood Elves. Ethereal tribal music plays as I walk the catwalks in the floating Tree City of Kelethin. Numerous professions seem appealing to me in this city free of Acrophobia. A Robin Hood Rogue, or better yet a Stephen Segal Ranger, or perhaps a Val Kilmer Bard, or a Bruce Willis die-hard Warrior. But as all Holly Wood invades my mind I cant help but envision Ewoks in the Tree City and Jedi Knights walking about. Time for a change of music.
<br><br>
	Oh, to march with the Irontoe Brigade. A bone crushing, Skorcher killing Dwarf Warrior I shall be.  I crack open the nearest substance to beer you can purchase in Utah Valley, which incidentally is 7-up, and tap my feet to the rhythm of the Dwarf war machine in my head. The powergamer Ian is very pleased with the combat potential of the short barbarian, and notes that the dwarf is easily as powerful as the giant warrior barbarians in several aspects, yet also possessing a greater variety of allies. Plus, who wants to run around in a skirt in the tundra?
<br><br>
	Somewhat tipsy from the soda, I tap my toes right into Neriak and start to examine the dark elf faces and stats. To hate and be hated, to embrace the wicked learning curve 989 imposed upon the children of the Dark Elves. Consistent with my past character choices I always fall in love with the black seed, and my mind reels with the possible roles to play. A Dark Elf Rogue stares at me, peering into my mind and playing on my darker side. The powergamer Ian clears his throat and I crosscheck the stats with the infamous Halfling Rogue.
<br><br>
	A period of blackness passes and I envision gambling on the second story of the Fool's Gold Inn, my sleek leather jacket and trustee stiletto handy as I bring to life the role of Kipp Goodleaf, a Halfling Rogue I created in a story long ago. I look away from the monitor, thinking of the adventures I could relive, and thinking of how I would have to meet up with my adventuring buddies who didn't care too much for the wee folk. The trouble of crossing the continent caused me to leave Kipp in the bar and think of something more central.
<br><br>
	Behold, Qeynos! Deep inside myself I have grown a distaste for the highly specialized racial variants in videogames, and usually fall back on the underdog human variant of the same profession. To be mortal invites a whole new pride, and a whole new drive to be the "best of the least popular." While EverQuest in no way forgot humans in the balance of the world, it gave a lot of that attention to the superhero Monk profession, while the rest of the human variants have little to show except being "well rounded" statistically. Well, for me this is attractive. It is an opportunity to show that stats mean very little, and that there is still a pride in being mortal, without being a Monk. I could live in Qeynos, or Surefall. The region is so well designed and developed it only makes me hope that one day the whole of Norrath will be as rich.
<br><br>
	Somewhere in my nostalgia over the long process beta has been through constructing the world I drifted back to one of my earliest test characters, a Barbarian Warrior. Yes, I ran around in a skirt, but looking back I realized no one could really actually argue with a Barbarian's sense of fashion. I clicked through and recognized the same face I had used, and started to consider going back. I wanted my two-handed sword again. Oh to feel the blood spray on my face. Oh to kick small dogmen around like puppies.
<br><br>
	I walk away from the computer and start to think about all the ideas I had before we knew very much about EverQuest. Ktzorak the troll, or perhaps an Ogre. The lands that the Ogres and Trolls inhabit are quite appealing to any type of player as they are vast and well segregated from the rest of the human-loving world. Tingles ride down my spine as I feel the vastly grotesque troll under my control smash ugly frogs and other various mud-sucking creatures.
<br><br>
	My other favorite written character summoned me from the swamps to Odus. What of Yvette, I wondered. Since writing her story my perception of the game environment changed dramatically and a lot of my friends moved on. I click through the various Erudites, both male and female, examining every aspect of each available profession. The Erudite seems to me the other possible Black Horse in the game, being easily identified as the worst possible choice for a melee profession, and arguably close to one of the best magic using races, yet a strange mystery surrounds the races apparent lack of a clear advantage. One of the most painful setbacks the Erudites have is the isolation from the rest of the world. What if my friends don't want to play an Erudite? I dwell on it all and discover that it is time to turn off the computer.
<br><br>
	At the end of this all, I was not left without a character. In fact come final I doubt I will have enough character slots as I could have easily filled at least 12 slots just trying to come up with a character I liked more than the last, or reminiscing over old favorites. While I cannot be certain just how many characters I will create in final, one thing is certain: each race and class is appealing, and there is something here for everyone; or at least for each of your RPG-born multiple personalities.
