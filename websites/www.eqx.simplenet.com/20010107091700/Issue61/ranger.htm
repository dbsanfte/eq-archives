The tale you are about to hear is not my own, nor in truth that of any friend of mine, it is a tale I heard once a long while ago while I was still plying my wares along the old trade routes between Qeynos and the mountains of Rathe.  
<br><br> 
It was a crisp autumn day and I still had a full cart and at least three weeks on the road to look forward to when I happened by a small town that looked as if it was on its last legs or just beginning to walk.  Rather than spend another wretched night camping along side the road I decided to call my day early and spend the night here.  It was with no difficulty that I determined the Tavern to be the moderate sized building next to the town's well.  Of course, the very garish sign hanging over the door proclaiming the place to be the Queen's Treasure (depicting a maiden hiking her skirt up in a most un-regal manner) did not hurt in my identification of the alehouse.  After tethering my horse and securing my possessions, I threw open the doors expecting to be greeted with the sounds of revelry but instead heard not but one man's deep voice resounding throughout the hall.  
<br><br>
I was quickly rounded upon by a stocky fellow who I later knew to be the owner of the establishment. He closed the door behind me, and  when I started to speak, he gave me such a glare that I knew silence was the only virtue to be had here.  Needless to say, I was rather taken aback by all of this, for a merchant's arrival in a villa such as this is usually accompanied by a impromptu party of sorts.  I am often called upon to tell the news of the kingdom, or just relate a tale as I am about to do, and even without that, people are ordinarily overjoyed to have my goods within reach, in case they are struck by the urge to purchase a unique item from realms as far away as Faydwer.  Never have I been treated in such a brusque manner as this, so I naturally assumed that something of grave importance was at hand.  So I quietly took a seat at the bar and turned my attention to a table near the hall's great fireplace.  
<br><br>
The whole of the tavern's patronage was watching that table and many had unabashedly pulled their chairs into a small circle around it.  Of the three men sitting there, only one was of any consequence. He was, I'd guess, around six feet tall and had the build of a bowman, broad muscular shoulders with large arms used as an extension of the bow to drive his arrows home.  He had very striking features and though it was not really a handsome face, it was certainly one you would not be likely to forget.  All of this was accompanied by a smile as broad as day and a laugh that could accompany the storms.  I instantly knew that I liked this man, and the resentment I was harboring for the town due to my ill treatment melted away when I realized he was the one who all were paying attention to.  At the moment he was describing something with great fervor and he was waving his arms around like a madman, but through some trick of the building's designer, I was only able to hear the tone and not the content of his voice.  Thus, I ventured closer tell I could hear him more clearly.
<br><br>
"...And as I looked into his eyes," he said with a quiver in his voice, "I knew him for my father."
<br><br>
Then the man took a long draught of ale and appeared ready to speak more when the woman seated in front of me stood up. "I am sorry, Sir," she said, " but my husband and I came late to your tale and do not understand the significance of this, would you be so kind as to elaborate, as I can see that this matter does weigh heavy on your soul."  
<br><br>
At this point I looked around and noticed that many others in the room were similarly bewildered by this man's passion, though there were a few who must have been attentive from the tale's beginning for their eyes were filled with tears and one man was openly sobbing over his brew.  I believe the man did also notice this, for he addressed us "Truth be told, my tale was near its end, but if you all wish it, I can begin again."  This brought a very enthusiastic cheer from the townsmen, and I found myself throwing my voice in, because at this point I was quite taken in by his charisma.  He made as to quiet us, and when he had our attention spoke again. 
<br><br>
"It is not often that I dwell on my past but..." at this point a harsh voice broke in on the man. 
<br><br>
"Do not believe a word of it," someone said, "He's a pompous windbag who just loves hearing the sound of his own voice."
<br><br>
I was sure that this statement was going to bring this infatuated crowd into a frenzy, but everyone just kind of fidgeted uneasily and waited for the man to act.  It was then I noticed the fourth man at his table who appeared to have melted out of the shadows.  His pale complexion and small frame marked him as a Erudite, and he was in all things the antithesis of his burly companion.  How these two came to be together must have been a tale worth hearing in its own right.  Still, the comment seemed to be made with every bit of malevolence as the words seemed to indicate, but then I noticed the sickly smile on the Erudite's face, and knew this is what passed as friendly banter between these two men.  With a slap on the Erudite's back, the man continued in his speech.
<br><br>
"As I was saying, it is not often that I choose to dwell on the past, but on bone- chilling days like these, an ale and the warmth of the fire draw such things out of me.  An introduction of sorts is perhaps in order, but for now you can all know me as The Ranger and nothing more.  Trust me, the need for obscurity will become apparent later, or maybe it won't. It does not matter."
<br><br>
Now the man we knew only as The Ranger began to tell the tale of his life, and it is the very tale I am about to tell you, just as I heard so many years ago.  I have not forgotten a word...or a pause of it since that day, and you can trust that if he were here now, he would know it as his own.  So I begin the TALE:
<br><br><br>

"I was born as most other children find themselves to be.  I, also, do not remember much of my very early years, but I am sure they were full of crying, diaper changing, and the occasional burping.  Believe me, this is where a rather mundane existence becomes something quite other, for unlike most children,  I had no name.  Or rather, I had No Name, which was my name.  They called me Emanon which is No Name backwards.  A not too clever a play on words, but then again, my fathers were not too clever.  This again was something different from the norm, for I had not one, but twelve fathers, all of varying ages, none of whom were related to one another, nor to me as far as I knew.  
<br><br>
If you look back on your childhood you probably have many memories of many things, but I bet one is always there in the back of your mind.  Your home.  In this too, you could say I was blessed (if you can look on such things as blessings) for I had many homes and almost never one more than once.  It was a very adventurous sort of life moving from town to town, and more often than not being run out of those same towns for some misunderstanding or other.  Another point which some may think is strange is that I am  a half-breed, born of Human and Elf, though this particular trait did not become an issue to me till very late in my life.
<br><br>
Now that you have a sort of generalized idea of what my life consisted of, I will tell you some of the details that make that life worth living.  From the day I could walk, my existence became a series of lessons in survival.  I was taught to hunt and to hide, how to weather the elements and seek shelter from the storm.  I grew with a great affinity for nature but also a great respect. I understood that it cared not whither it served me or destroyed me, only that I did not get in its way.  My fathers taught me some of this, and in other things I taught myself.  These men with whom I traveled were adventurers living off the land and very occasionally off the money they earned from all too infrequent jobs.  They were warriors gruff and crude, and I cannot remember a time when I was not aware of the baser things in life.  Needless to say, I knew that not ALL these men were my fathers.  I knew that I must have had one father and one mother as the natural order of things decreed, but it never occurred to me the other children I saw running and playing in town squares actually CARED about either of these two people.  For though I have called them my fathers, I only do so in retrospect, for at the time we were merely men of which I happened to be the youngest.  I never called any of them Dad, or any other such silly name of affection.  In fact, a few of them I knew only by their nicknames, which were hardly flattering.  To give you a kind of parallel to your own, however, I will amend an earlier statement by saying that it was more like having eleven uncles and an extremely close brother.
<br><br>
The man on whom I bestowed that honor was Siminal, who was not to say our group's leader, because we were more of a democracy, but he had more followers amongst us than any of the other "leaders" did.  He was a towering hulk of a man with a face so broken and twisted that it was impossible to determine what he might have looked like at one time.  If forced to make a judgment on appearance alone, no words such as kind, gentle, or anything of a loving nature would enter your mind, but he was all of these things and more to me, and I loved him.  He tried his best to care for me and raise me as he thought best, as did all the men with whom I grew up, but it was not exactly a proper child-rearing environment.
<br><br>
One of the ways they tried to teach me morals and etiquette was through a nightly ritual of story-telling around the camp fire (a practice never carried to the inn where women were more wont to hear their tales and reward them for it).  These tales were always of  brave knights in shining armor going out to do battle with some dragon, or troll... it hardly mattered which.  What did matter was that these knights were pure at heart and always triumphed over evil through righteousness.  I had at this time never seen a dragon or a troll, but as far as I was concerned there were twelve prime examples of knighthood right in front of my eyes, and though their armor wasn't exactly shining, it was nothing my imagination could not fix.  
<br><br>
So when I reached the age of thirteen and was finally able to pull back the string on my first REAL bow, I begged them to let me accompany them on the quests they were occasionally leaving me behind at camp to go off to.  To this request none of them could think of an adequate reason why I should be not allowed to go.  They were, after all, men of war, and it seemed only right that I should be in war as well.  In their defense (if you think they need defending which some would not) they were not going to allow me to enter the conflict with sword and shield, but with the weapon I had proved most proficient: the bow.  
<br><br>
I was told that we had been hired by local villagers to bring to justice a group of men ravaging the local countryside.  This seemed a very noble deed to me, though in the stories the heroes were never paid, but then again they were just stories, I told myself.  We were still righting wrongs and fighting for the good of man.  With a clear conscience I took my position on hill overlooking the site chosen for battle.  It did not seem in the least bit strange to me that the other side in this conflict had not shown up to arrange themselves as to make proper war. They were evil brigands and one could hardly expect them to behave properly.  At last I heard a noise in the distance and soon a group of twenty or so men came into  view.  They were arranged in what I assumed was a formation because I could not conceive how anyone could be so disarrayed by accident.  All the better I thought, for as Sim often said "A group that cannot stay in order outside of battle, can hardly expect to fight in it within."  As they drew closer to where Sim and the others were waiting amongst the trees, I began to wonder when they would show themselves and confront the villains.  This was to be the first of many blows delivered to my idealized depiction of these men, for when they did confront the brigands it was with swords swinging.  I sat there on the hill looking down at the slaughter taking place, stunned into inaction.  My friends were quickly and cleanly cutting these practically defenseless men down, but they were villains were they not?  I thought that perhaps they deserved this kind of quick justice, but I was sure this was never how it was done in the stories.  These doubts and many more were running through my head when a man broke from the fray and started running towards the forest were he was sure to lose the vigilantes.  Sim, still engaged in the conflict was unable to pursue, so he began to signal me to shoot the man down.  I was so preoccupied with my internal struggles that I did what I was taught to do: obey orders. I notched an arrow, pulled back on the string, aimed...This was to be another first for me, as I let loose my arrow and it found its home in the back of an unarmed man, I took my first step down the rode to dishonor.
<br><br>
The next few years of my young life passed quickly after that day.  I had lost the innocence that made the world worthy of remembering.  Each time we did our job, whether it be tracking thieves or the occasional merchant, I lost a little more of who I was, and wanted to be.  I had myself so deluded at this point that I almost believed Sim when he would tell me some lie about what miscreant we were bringing to the law this time. Even the few times the local magistrates came after us, I allowed myself to be convinced that they were really corrupt and deserved what we did to them.  I still believed that we were knights fighting for honor, though it was painfully obvious that I had become a mercenary just like them.  
<br><br>
When I was older and able to use a sword proficiently, they had me enter the battle with them, when my bow would not serve.  This is when I got my first taste of killing a man while being able to look into his eyes.  I threw up for three straight days after.   It was a dark time with no promise of a sunrise, but it was my life and I did not think to change it.  At least that I had not thought to do so up 'til that point, and truthfully would be doing the same today were it not for a True Knight, a Paladin in service of Erollisi Marr.  This man was able to pull me out of the ever-deepening trench I had dug for myself and restore my faith in the world, and I never even knew his name.
<br><br>
In fact, I only saw him on one occasion, but it was enough to change me.  I was on a high ledge overlooking the valley where we had set up camp for the past few days.  We were awaiting the arrival of a man who had angered the Freeport clergy enough to have them seek us out.  As usual, I was the company lookout, entrusted to spot our target, or someone who might be targeting us.  The road was a well-traveled one, so I could expect to see quite a few carts roll by every hour, and had taken to daydreaming about the valiant deeds I would accomplish, my life-long companions at my side.  After an hour or two, a large caravan came into view and at the head of it was the embodiment of all those old stories I still cherished.  For here was a Knight resplendent in silver armor on a beautiful white stead, laughing and carrying on with his fellow man.  Two things happened the moment I laid eyes on this man.  One, I did away with the tarnished image of Knights that Sim and his cohorts had created and forever replaced it with the perfect model of virtue before me.  And two, I knew that this was the man we were to kill.
<br><br>
Never in my life was I more determined to do anything than I was to save that man from us.  There was little I could do, however, if they continued on this path they would eventually pass by my friends, and be discovered with or without my signal.  That is why I decided that I could not allow them to go any farther.  So with my bow I set about devising a plan that was doomed to failure.  It was my hope that if I were to shoot at them they would turn back or at least stop and prepare for an ambush, and in a way that is exactly what happened.  With my first volley, the Knight stopped the caravan and sent half his men to accompany it some ways back to where they had come from, then he and the others rode forward to flush out their hidden assailant.  There was nothing I could do; these men were doomed.  Perhaps, with their full numbers and catching my friends by surprise they could have escaped the valley with their lives, but because of me they were courageously walking to their own death.  I tried to discourage them further with another volley, this time actually striking a few of them, but that only made them more determined to rush headlong into the forest to find me.  
<br><br>
By this time Sim had noticed the disturbance and I could just make out the company moving through the trees to the unsuspecting Knight.  Desperation gave flight to my feet and I was quickly making the hazardous journey down the hillside at full speed shouting for them to turn about.  Of course this, was the worse thing I could have done, for with my position undisclosed the Knight and his men turned on me leaving their backs unguarded.  Quickly enough they too discovered their error, for Sim and the others were on them in a second when they saw my life was in danger.  Still I thought I could perhaps save the Knight if I could only get to him.  Unfortunately, an armed conflict between thirty or so men, was hardly the safest place for a crazed boy to attempt navigating.  So I believe I was the only one surprised to find myself struck down by the back swing of the Paladin's mighty sword. Though he was certainly surprised to find someone else's sword sticking out of his chest when he turned from his opponent to see what was holding his weapon.  It was quite an image for my young mind to assimilate, for there I was looking into the dying eyes of my new hero while I myself lay dying, and the only person I could see to blame this misfortune on was the man who had impaled the Paladin:  Sim.  The look I saw on his face before my vision left me was distorted and frightening, and though I did not know it then, I was looking at the grief of a broken man, as the only thing he ever loved was quickly leaving him behind.
<br><br>
I awoke, which in and of itself was quite surprising to me, but that it was in a large bed in the middle of the most ornate room I had ever seen, was overwhelming.  After a few minutes of gawking at my surroundings, a tiny man dressed all in white entered the room and walked towards me.  He claimed to be a cleric of Rodcet Nife, The Prime Healer, and that I was in his care now.  I was much too weak to argue with him, and slowly drifted back to sleep, but I would never forget my first meeting with Rillian Vertu who was to become my mentor and friend.  Perhaps, if Sim had been there when I awoke instead of Rill, things would have been different between us, but as it was, I only saw him one more time as he was walking away from the Temple he had left me in, turned away at the doors by my request.  
<br><br>
Mayhap, this was a cruel act, but I was young, and to me not only had he killed a great man, but also abandoned me.  It was not until months after my slow and painful recovery that he and the company came calling to see how I was.  I did not know at the time that, although Rill would have treated me for free, the Temple elders set a very high price for their care.  The company was forced to work long dangerous jobs in order to keep me here, and they continued to do so long after I rebuked them.
<br><br>
My life with Rillian was quite unlike anything I had ever known.  Not only was I confined to the confines of the Temple walls unless with him, Rill also began instructing me in the ways of the gentleman.  That is to say, he thought I should be able to read and write, to which I greatly objected.  I had managed to avoid it for seventeen years of my life, and I hardly thought it was necessary now.  The old man had an infectious way about him though, and soon I was pouring over any piece of literature I could get my hands on.  That is how I stumbled upon the teachings of Karana which would guide my life for so many years.
<br><br>
Sim and his friends were not religious by any means, though they did occasionally call upon the gods in their cursing, but here in these texts that silent force that guided even them was given a name.  At first my interest was little more then academic, but soon I was craving to learn anything I could about The RainKeeper.  Rillian attempted to draw my attention to other things, and even on one occasion burnt all my notes in a fit of rage.  He thought I was wasting my skills on such an impetuous deity, and told me so often, and though I had far surpassed any of the other students at the Temple, he rightly feared that I would never become a master if I did not focus on Nife.  So it was that our relationship deteriorated at a rate that was only surpassed by my growing fervor for Karana.  
<br><br>
Despite all this, Rillian never asked me to leave, but when I accidentally created a thunderstorm in the library destroying many priceless tomes, staying was no longer an option.  So it was that I entered the real world, alone for the first time in my life, only my weapons, and the small jingle of coins in my pocket to keep me company.
<br><br>
I found a few odd jobs, and once I had enough money booked passage to Faydwer, where I hoped to study in the Great Libraries of Felwithe.  The voyage proved to be less of an adventure than I had hoped, though sea sickness was quite an experience.  Eventually, I found myself in the greatest city Norrath has ever known, home of the greatest snobs I have ever known.  It's not that the Elves were rude to me, it was that they were down right hostile.  It seemed as though they disapproved of my heritage, which of course I had nothing to do with.  Those who thought I was embracing my human side felt that I was betraying my elven, and those who thought the opposite took personal affront to what they felt was my intentional slur on their race.  It was impossible for me to find a place to stay, anywhere but the bad part of town which just happened to be the dwarven part of town.  Amongst these gruff tiny fellows I made my home, and when I wasn't working at some odd job or other, I was scouring the great libraries for secret knowledge pertaining to Karana. 
<br><br>
After a few weeks, I attracted the unwanted attention of some local unsavory types.  Let me right now dispel you of any preconceived ideas of the Noble Elven race and all their endless virtues, for I can shows you scars to testify that they can be just as mean spirited as any other race, and on my way home from the libraries one night I found out just this.  I was confronted and viciously beaten by a large group of elves calling themselves Tunare's Scourge.  Fortunately, I was left near death, and in possession of enough of my wits to collapse on the doorstep of a local healer.  When my wounds had healed and my debt to my benefactor repaid, I could not escape this land quick enough.  Once again, I found passage on a ship, this time bound for Freeport.  I had abandoned my faith in Karana, for like everyone, he had abandoned me when I had most needed him.  I was left with a great void that piqued in me a desire to know who I was, and where I had come from. 
<br><br>
Back in Antonica, I sought out Rillian in hopes that he might have information about my past.  I was twenty-four, five years had passed, and Rillian Vertu was three years in the ground.  The priests knew nothing of my past, and only cared that Sim had paid in full the exorbitant price they charged for my education and care.  I then realized that I had treated my only family much too harshly, and needed to make amends.  So I sought out the company's favorite taverns, and more importantly, their favorite wenches.  My search met with great success the very first day I began it, though it was to be downhill from there.  I had found a Barmaid who used to know the company well.  She told me that the Company had been involved in an attack on a powerful Noble, and the ones who hadn't been captured and hung were probably still in hiding.  I asked her why they would do something so fool- hardy and she told me that it was all because of some damn kid, who was the product of the unwanted attentions of a man, on his elven mother.  Of course, she didn't put it that nicely, and was rather berating of the child itself until she noticed the slight point to my ears.  Even if I had wanted to, I do not believe I could have spoken with her any longer, as it was I was so overcome with rage and guilt that I stormed out of the tavern and spent the night huddled in a gutter not caring about the world around me.
<br><br>
That was the longest, coldest night of my life.  I was wound up so tight in a web of hatred and self-loathing that many times my hand hovered over the dagger in my belt as I contemplated taking my own life.  With the birth of the new day, I was reborn.  As I watched the sunrise over the treetops outside the city, I know that I most make my home within their confines, and though I would not stop mourning what I had lost, I would never again look to the past for comfort.  I vowed that with each new day I would reinvent myself as nature intended all things to do.
<br><br>
I left behind the books, and other worldly things I had collected, and went out into the countryside with my bow, and the clothes on my back.  Thus I began my endless journey across Antonica, living off of what nature provided, shying away from larger settlements in favor of the symbiotic relationship between the world and its people that can be found in small villages everywhere.  In my travels, I did my best to help whomever was in need, and found myself embroiled in many conflicts against thieves and bandits.  I was beginning to feel a bit like the Knights I used to love so much in my childhood, and even had a bit of a reputation that was growing up around me.  The simple folk of the fields began to call me The Ranger, and with the title came a certain obligation that I felt was too big for my shoulders to carry alone.
<br><br>
That is when I began to search for others like me, in the forests, plains, and mountains of this world.  Sometimes they were great Knights or wise Druids, but mostly they were hermits.  Outcasts of their own making, our someone else's design, and though it was hard to convince them to give back to the world that they shunned, once they were converted to my cause, they became my staunchest of supporters.  Many chose to accompany me, even though I tried to discourage it.  I had no desire to lead, and even less to be followed.  Gladly would I have gone the rest of my days helping heal the wounds of the earth and in the hearts of men, but the gods wished to test my resolve one more time before they would allow me to rest.
<br><br>
Their cruel little game began innocently enough with a farmer asking us to take up arms against some theatre near his village.  I, accustomed to over exaggeration by now, assumed that a harmless bear had gotten lost and just needed to be guided back to the forest, but when I saw the dark billowing clouds of a fire looming in the distance I knew it was something more.  Along the way the farmer informed me that one of our number had gone out to speak with a large group of men who had chosen to camp in the village's wheat field.  Perhaps, the ranger was a little over zealous and attacked one of their number or the men took his suggestion of moving a bit harshly, but either way they were now burning the countryside and making their way towards the village.  
<br><br>
Upon our arrival, I was shocked to find the town's assailants were heavily armored and well disciplined soldiers, not the starving dissidents we usually dealt with.  Fortunately, they appeared to be preoccupied torching the fields and had not as of yet noticed the overturned oxcarts and other structures the villagers were piling up to serve as makeshift battlements.  I quickly set about the task of organizing the defense and within ten minutes had the fortifications drenched (to prevent burning) and the townspeople in position.  It did not take long for the marauders to notice that the town had become quite still and that its inhabitants did not appear ready to flee.  
<br><br>
The soldiers quickly surmised, as had I, that due to the river to the west and the rocky hills to the east, that only a direct assault would be possible.  I counted forty-five men, arranged in three groups of fifteen, with a large knight on horseback who appeared to be their leader.  We were not even half that number and only myself and the six men I brought with me had any sort of training.  Yet we did have a fairly defensible position, and their leader wanted to test just what our capabilities were.  When five men detached themselves from the main body of their force and charged our position, I had only three of my bows fire, and then at half their range, to give them a false impression.  To my surprise one of our arrows struck home, insuring that there would be one less assailant when the onslaught came.  As the other men dragged their fallen comrade back to the lines, I watched the commander prepare for the real attack.  
<br><br>
It came quick and furious, the Knight using his men like a battering ram trying to overwhelm us with sheer force.  Fortunately, when my bowmen began firings volleys, the order for retreat was given long before they ever reached the battlements.  The damage had been done though; eleven of their men would not rise to take up arms again.  Their next approach came after much deliberating and much more yelling by their commander.  When they finally did come at us again it was in two phalanxes with shields raised to ward off our arrows.  They slowly advanced and I had my men  shoot  at weak points in their wall of armor,  hoping to dissuade this tactic, but they were not so easily deterred.  The last thirty yards they lowered their guard and charged, hoping once again to overwhelm us.  I was prepared for this, however, and rather then let the whole position fall, I ordered the villagers to allow a hole to open up in hopes of funneling them through in one spot.  It worked for the most part, and between my archers and the pitchfork-wielding townspeople, we were able to make them retreat once again while only losing three of our own.  
<br><br>
The odds had grown a bit in our favor, but I knew that it would only be a matter of time before they were able to break through completely.  It was with this in mind that I decided to let them do just that.  I sent the villagers back to their homes to await my signal while the other Rangers and I took our places at the battlements.  From my new position I was unable to determine the enemy's next approach, but I didn't need to know for my plan to work.  At last I heard the roar of armored men as they made their way towards us, and finally with a mighty crash they were upon us.  The battlements collapsed in three places with the force of their meeting.  We held our post as long as we could, then began to fall back towards the center of the town.  When most of their men had broken through, and made their way to the square in pursuit, I signaled the villagers.  They burst through the doors of the hiding places and surrounded the startled marauders.
<br><br>
The battle was far from won, however, and as I made my way from one opponent to another, I saw my comrades fall under the blade of professionals time and again.  I was gashed severely in numerous places and blood was obscuring my vision when I saw the mounted Knight bearing down on me, a morning star swinging violently in his hand.  Just as he swung the spiked ball at my head I ducked and rolled bringing my blade up and into the chest of his steed.  The knight was thrown, and I heard a gruesome crack as his neck collapsed under the weight of his own armor.  As I turned around to make sure he was dead, I noticed a movement in the corner of my eye, and I rounded upon a large soldier and ran him through without a moment's pause.  As I cleared my eyes, I thought I heard someone cry my name, but the battle was all but over as marauders, their leader dead, surrendered or fled.  Eventually, I noticed my last rival struggling to stand, and I bent down to help him.  As I looked upon his face I knew him for Simian StormCrow, my friend, and as I looked into his eyes I knew him for my father.  He died in my arms a smile on his face, remembering the child I was, and proud of the man I had become.

I had for so many years striven to save the souls of others, but it was not till that moment I understood it was my own soul in peril, and it had just been redeemed."

The Ranger sat for a moment in silent contemplation,  then he raised his voice and cried "Enough of this sorrow, for I swear by my fathers name everyone of you will be merry with drink before the night is through!"  With that he took out a large bag of coins and lived true to his word.  Later in the evening I decided to have a chat with this fine fellow, but at some point The Ranger and his companions had slipped out into the cold night, and I never laid eyes on him again.
