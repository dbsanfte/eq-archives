<big><big>S</big></big>ince then, two channels have come and gone in popularity.  Sphere set up a channel on Undernet, and along with the blossoming popularity of the web site EverQuest Unspawned and the fact that Ian Ash and Dach were ops there, the channel became quite popular.  However, Sphere turned out to be less than whiter than white, and after a rather nasty incident (which can be seen as a story written by Ian Ash, see EQX Issue 2), the channel died a quick death.  The second channel was on EFnet, and was called #eqvault.  The channel was made just before the launch of EQVault, the current main unofficial EQ news site.  Someone at the site came up with the bright idea of organising a chat session with Brad to mark it’s launch.  The channel quickly became popular and active after that.  However, the bots that controlled the channel were part of a large group of channels whose operators were at war with a large group of other channels.  The result of the war was that it spilled over into #eqvault and resulted in regular nuke attacks against people chatting in the channel.  For those of you unfamiliar with the term nuke, it means that some immature little kiddie is using a programme to send huge amounts of unwanted information to your computer, which results in your socket connection overloading and your connection being cut.  The fact that chatters in the channel are constantly attacked has unsurprisingly resulted in the channel loosing a lot of popularity, which is a shame because it was a fun channel with sensible ops.

Who to look out for on IRC:<br><br>
<em>Ian Ash:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;On IRC a lot, however due to his job he has to disappear now and then for short amounts of time.  Ian is heavily involved with a 101 EverQuest things, he is an EQX writer, EverQuest’s first portrait drawer and he even has his own guild called Fraterni Lux which is rapidly becoming very popular.<br><br>
<em>Dach:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;The designer of EverQuest’s first ever fan web site.  He has been following EverQuest longer than any of us, and although temporarily side-tracked by Quake2, he is a great source of information and always more than keen to answer newbie questions.<br><br>
<em>Aradune:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;The producer of EverQuest.  The biggest challenge to face with Brad on IRC is to say goodbye in the time space between when he says he is quitting and when he quits - let’s just say that he’s not one for long farewells.<br><br>
<em>Wardragon & ChrisLDT:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;EQVault’s main news reporters, if you need to know the latest up to the minute info on what’s new, or you have a breaking story that should be on EQVault, then these are the people to talk to.
<br><br>
Other well known IRC names:<br><br>
<em>Magi:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our resident magic reporter.<br>
<em>Jaga:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;An EverQuest regular and a role-playing fan.<br>
<em>Zyxiwox:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives in Greece, and sleeps far, far to much.<br>
<em>Foxtrot:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scampers about a lot, and tends to pounce on people.<br>
<em>Sandralene:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wants a rose garden in EQ, but not as active in IRC as before.<br>
<em>DLX:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Very energetic chatter, and has been an EQ fan for a long time.<br>
<em>Btrost:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;EverQuest’s second in command, comes on IRC on rare occasions.<br>
<em>Kit:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yup, I can be found on IRC quite a lot too :)

So where should people chat?  Server-wise I would have to say that EFNet is the best place.  If you want to meet up with any of the well known fans of EverQuest that are listed above then you need to be on the EFNet server.<br><br>
What channels on EFNet do I recommend?  Well, #everquest is the original and still the most frequented EverQuest channel, however it is still under control of the Ultima ops and it can be quite difficult to chat there.  What is becoming increasingly popular is to have a window open in #everquest just to show your presence, but to be in another EverQuest related channel and be talking in the other channel.  I am not going to name other alternative channels because certain members of the group of Ultima ops that control #everquest (I’m not saying all, but certain ones) make a point of taking control and locking out the other EverQuest related channels.
Guild channels are also starting to spring up, the first guild channel to appear is run by Ian’s guild, Fraterni Lux.  Many more guild channels are likely to appear as beta nears and people make an effort to get to know each other before they enter the game.
<br><br>
As to the future of IRC, it’s hard to see it remaining very popular after open beta is reached due to the very social nature of the EverQuest in-game chat options.  However, until then, get chatting!
