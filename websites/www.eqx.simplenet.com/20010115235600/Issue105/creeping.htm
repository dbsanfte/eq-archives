<u><b>Gorliss</b></u>
<br><br>
Gorliss peeked around the massive cedar serving as his lookout post. Thirty yards away, High Elves had established a military field camp. The camp had become busy very quickly. Elven heavy infantry, mobile archer troops, and pikemen were assembling in the camp's central square, their military precision and orderly movement a thing of beauty and renown. 
<br><br>
Orc rivers had been aggressively raiding the Greater Feydark, pillaging Wood Elf, High Elf, and human villages alike. The High Elves, a stoic and aloof race, normally left the safety of the Faydark, a massive, heavily forested area encircled by young, sharp mountains, to their wilder cousins the Wood Elves. The Wood Elves were savagely effective in their efforts against the orcs. High Elven action in the Feydark now did not in any way understate the competency of the Wood Elf battalions. Rather, The High Elf high command had been pushed to action when a certain High Elf prince had lost his baggage train, a trunk of traveling money, his uncle thrice-removed, and almost his head to a surprise raid only ten miles from Felwithe itself.
<br><br>
Stirred to action, the High Elves had mobilized their army and begun a calculated campaign against the orcs. Unfortunately for Gorliss, the Feydark was now dotted with High Elf camps and outposts. 
<br><br>
Most travelers would welcome the protection of High Elf troops. But High Elves presented Gorliss with a particular, personal danger. Gorliss was a student of necromancy, a dark art unwelcome in most societies. To the High Elves, it was a foul act and warranted immediate execution. Gorliss had successfully avoided elven entrenchments for days, but his luck had run out. 
<br><br>
Gorliss had left Freeport weeks ago bound for the Steamfont Mountains. The Freeport necromancy "guild", if you could call it that, believed that the Steamfont Gnomes still researched necromancy openly in Ak'Anon, their home city. If true, it would be worth the trip to discover that they had retained most of the art in its true form. If he discovered that their research had surpassed his own, well then, it was worth risking an encounter with a High Elf patrol.
<br><br>
Gorliss hoped this camp had only recently been assembled. Despite the effectiveness of the High Elf military command, they still suffered from the initial confusion of settling into a new spot that has plagued armies since time immemorial. If the camp had been established for some time, however, then sentries were already posted in the trees and undergrowth. Gorliss was no ranger, so escaping detection so far had either been pure luck, or confusion on the part of the elves. Regardless, he was taking a huge chance getting this close, but he absolutely had to pass this camp to continue on to Steamfont.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the camp was alive with movement, soldiers running and forming ranks, and commanders barking orders. He was too far away to make out what was being said, and he understood very little of the singsong language of the elves anyway. 
<br><br>
The result of all the activity became clear as soldiers drew swords and checked battle gear while assembling into ranks. Gorliss admired the speed and efficiency of the elves, wishing he could instill the same discipline and control on the undead warriors he had produced in his six years as a necromancer.
<br><br>
The small army stood stiffly at attention for a few minutes, apparently listening to someone out of Gorliss' view. Then, with barely a sound, the elven company, forty strong, turned and ran straight at Gorliss. With a curse, Gorliss turned and bolted. 
<br><br>
Gorliss sprinted headlong back the way he had come earlier. He knew the elves were not after him; probably had not even known he was there. No, they were obviously moving in force to another rendezvous. What concerned him was their speed. 
<br><br>
Elves normally walked casually through the woodlands. They only ran in cases of emergency, or sometimes just for the sheer pleasure of it. These particular elves did not have the look of a partying crowd about them, so Gorliss could only assume orcs had been spotted and the elves were hastening to intercept. 
<br><br>
Gorliss' luck had changed from bad to horrid. It took all his energy to stay ahead of the fast moving troops, who even now managed to move through the woods with eerie silence. Had the elves been running at full speed, Gorliss would already have been overrun. Even so, they were still too quick for him to outrun and flank. He would be spotted by their advance troops within moments if he didn't find cover.
<br><br>
If the elves did not deviate from their path, then they, and therefore Gorliss, were vectoring straight into an orcish mob. Running through orcish ranks would be as deadly as running into the arms of his elven pursuers. They hated humans almost as much as they hated elves. Though they feared necromancers, Gorliss' skill was too weak to impress the numerous shamans in the orc ranks. Orcs only appreciated strength, and Gorliss' lack of skill would get him killed, after a goodly amount of torture, of course.
<br><br>
Gorliss ran on, trying to think of a way to slip through both skirmish lines without being spotted. He crested a small ridge, keeping as many trees between himself and the advancing elven vanguard. In the distance, he saw the orcish raiders, at least one hundred strong, advancing slowly through the forest, their wild battle yells floating over the trees ahead of them.
<br><br>
Gorliss stopped and crouched. The front lines were only a half-mile apart. The elves had undoubtedly heard the war screams by now, and had picked up their pace, preparing for a phalanx thrust into the middle. 
<br><br>
Gorliss knew both armies would have scouts out, maybe even fighting already. How he had managed to dodge either side's spies was worth a prayer of thanks, if there was a god he trusted, but now he needed a prayer of concealment. 
<br><br>
Thunk! An elven arrow buried itself into the tree he squatted against. He had been spotted!
<br><br>
Gorliss dove downhill as another arrow tore through the fringe of his grubby robe. Unconcerned with his dignity, he crawled, sprinted, and tumbled down the ridge, imagining the next shaft ripping through his ribs. 
<br><br>
Behind him, he heard the elven troops top the hill, the pikemen shoulder to shoulder behind a wall of footmen shields.  The hated enemies spotted each other and accelerated their advances. The orcish war screams climbed to a frenzy. 
<br><br>
Gorliss continued his mad rush straight at the orcish ranks. He hoped to sprint right past the orcs who, locked in blood lust for the elves, may fail to notice him. Three raiders passed him on the left, and Gorliss' spirits picked up. His heart sank, however, when an abnormally large centurion, his yellow fangs dripping spit, raised his war axe and came yelling straight at him.
<br><br>
The orc jumped into the air, axe overhead, and descended like a hurricane for the killing blow. Gorliss dove beneath the hairy legs while his assailant was still in mid-flight, and rolled shoulder to hip, coming upright and taking off in a dead sprint. He took one step before the ground gave way beneath him and he tumbled into darkness.
<br><br>
Above, the orc chieftain whirled to find his prey. He stood momentarily confused to find that the tall human had vanished. He knew no more as the front line of elven pikes gutted him from behind.
<br><br><br>
<b><u>Hulian</u></b>
<br><br>
Hulian stood at direct attention. Issius, the field commander for this detachment, was exhorting the troops to be brave and honorable in the coming battle. Hulian, sergeant of the Royal High Elf Army, 3rd division, 5th brigade, 8th battalion, 2nd company, 1st platoon, was deep in thought about the coming fight. He had advanced rapidly since swearing his commission twenty years ago, at the near unprecedented age of 95. His zealous dedication to the military, his training, and his willingness to take on even the most mundane of tasks had weighed heavily in his favor when the question of promotion was circulated among the officers. Hulian was very, very young to be an officer in the High Elf army. Even so, it was clear to those in charge that he had the will and the desire to command.
<br><br>
Hulian phased out the pep talk as he considered the task ahead. He had fought orcs before during a military exchange duty with the wild elves of the Faydark. His wood cousins were savage warriors, lacking the refinement of advanced military techniques that were common training for High Elf warriors. Despite that, the Wild Ones made a daily habit of hunting down orc warrens and attacking whenever possible. The exchange program was a great way for novice High Elves to get direct combat experience with minimal risk.
<br><br>
Hulian had not lead seasoned troops into prolonged battle before, but the attack plan was simple. Fast scouts from the northeast had spotted a band of reavers moving slowly south. It was a sizable contingent of about 140 orcs. Hulian's company would form a center assault to be joined by two other companies closing in from the east and west.
 <br><br>
The elves relied on speed for this attack. They were expert at moving silently through the woodlands, even in force. However, orc scouts would be about the area, ready to report troop movement to the horde. It was unwise for the High Elves to rely on their own scouts to locate and dispatch every single orc recon. 
<br><br>
Hulian returned to the present as his commander finished his speech. Hearts where astir and morale was high. With a final nod of approval, the commander turned and signaled the troops to move out. Though noisy to elf ears, the entire company turned with barely a whisper and started running north through the woodland.
<br><br>
Hulian set the pace for his platoon. He and his comrades were heavy infantry, armed to the teeth for the dirty work of close-in fighting. He kept his shield ahead of himself at all times to protect against unexpected arrows from orc skirmishers and spies. Should one footman fall in the advance, it could slow the whole company as the ranks reformed. 
<br><br>
Up ahead, Hulian's eyes caught a quick movement in the forest. He kept his eyes trained on the spot as they approached, wary of ambushes or traps. They reached the spot and continued without mishap.
<br><br>
<em>Must have been my imagination</em>, thought Hulian.
<br><br>
The elven company continued on for five more minutes. They could hear the orcs now, trilling their weird battle calls. Hulian's eyes caught the last shake of a branch on a bush directly in their path. He tensed slightly, again expecting a possible ambush from orc scouts.
<br><br>
When the suspicious area again passed without event, Hulian began to look even further ahead of their route, the whole time trying to stay focused on the forest path and the traitorous roots that reached for their boots. He could not directly see anyone or anything ahead, but he was certain that someone was falling back from the soldier's advancing line. If the retreating figure presented a danger to his men, he needed to make a decision quickly. The raiders were just beyond the next ridge. Upon sight of the enemy, it would be too late to call back the attack.
<br><br>
Hulian say no other signs of passage. In an instant, he dismissed it from his mind as the retreat of some forest animal, probably a deer. His company mounted the ridge, crested the top, and….
<br><br>
THERE! Hulian saw him. A human, and a tall one at that. He was sprinting headlong from the advancing elves straight into the orc horde!
<br><br>
<em>Fool!</em> thought Hulian. He immediately chastised himself for such ignoble thoughts. He briefly considered what the human had stumbled into. The Faydark was quickly becoming a dangerous area. The poor man was probably frightened, and from the look of him - thin, bedraggled, and dirty - he was probably scared out of his wits. 
<br><br>
Sadly, there was no time to call off the attack. The orcs had spotted Hulian's company, and already they were sprinting en masse to engage. Hulian would just have to hope that…
<br><br>
<em>Dear goddess!</em> thought Hulian. A giant centurion had spotted the gangly human and was attacking with fury. As Hulian and his comrades sprinted straight at the orcs, he noted with detachment admiration as the human rolled under the attack with the grace of a professional soldier. In an instant, the ragged man was on his feet, only to vanish.
<br><br>
Suddenly, there was no more time to think. Hulian charge with sword drawn and shield high as the pikeman he protected gored the giant centurion ahead of him.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Conjunction</u></b>
<br><br>
Gorliss raised himself into a sitting position. His head spun from a grazing blow he had taken in his fall. The area around him was pitch black. His hip was bruised and he was pretty sure his ankle had twisted. Reaching into his leather backpack, he pulled out a small, waxy lump of <em>chula</em>.  "Gkhlych," he rasped, and the chula began to glow.  Now he had a light source.
<br><br>
Gorliss peered around in the weak light of the <em>chula</em>, confirming that he had fallen into a cave. That explained why the centurion had leapt at him. It wasn't for show; the creature had been jumping over this cave opening. He brought the cold light to his ankle and investigated the damage. No bones or blood were visible. He stood, putting light pressure on his foot. The pain made him wince, but it was bearable. He could travel.
<br><br>
Rummaging through the backpack, Gorliss found enough rations and water for two days. He examined some bone slivers, and then replaced them. A skeletal warrior would provide some nice insurance, but his undead protectors seemed to have severe difficulties navigating the confines of most underground lairs.
<br><br>
Gorliss limped forward, holding the <em>chula</em> ahead of him. The cave extended forward (or backward?) with few obstructions besides the normal stalagmites and stalactites that accompanied basic cave construction. It had been cleanly formed, with no branching tunnels away from the central shaft. Further on, Gorliss felt, rather than saw, the cave open into a larger cavern. A dull reflection from one of the far corners caught his eye, and he made his way toward it. 
<br><br>
Scattered on the ground were picks, chisels, hammers, and various other mining tools. Judging by the decayed state of the tools, they hadn't been used in quite some time. The ground bore neither footprints nor markings of any kind to indicate recent activity.
<br><br>
Gorliss sat carefully and studied the tools. From what he knew about Faydwer, racial territories were clearly delineated. This mine was deep in elf territory, and the elves absolutely forbade mining of any type in the forest. If dwarves or gnomes had worked this cave, it must have been decades or possibly centuries ago. Untended mines decayed just like everything else, and many of the tunnels had probably collapsed by now. However, it was possible that a few still lay open, and, if he was lucky, he might find an opening into the Steamfont Mountains. At the very least, he needed an exit from this cavern, and he couldn't climb out the way he had fallen in. 
<br><br>
He was just settling down for a light nap when tumbling rocks and sand echoed up the tunnel he had just exited. The soft noise of boots on rock alerted Gorliss to another visitor to the mine. Using the <em>chula</em>, Gorliss found the deepest nook he could locate, and squeezed into it. Whatever was coming down the mine would have to look hard to find him. He dropped the <em>chula</em> into a pocket in his robe to hide the light.
<br><br>
Several moments passed without a sound. Gorliss waited patiently within his crevice, certain of the noise he had heard and what it announced.
<br><br>
Thirty minutes passed. Gorliss was just about to retrieve his <em>chula</em> when he sensed another presence in the cavern. It could have been a simple displacement of air, a change in the temperature, or his own paranoia, but he knew, he <em>knew</em>, that he was not alone.
<br><br>
Again, Gorliss fell into a waiting patience. Whatever it was that had come into the cavern was not moving, and he was certain that it was aware of him. He steeled himself and tried to remain calm. He understood that the intruder had come into the mine the same way he had, though probably not as clumsily. So whatever, or whoever was here, chances are that it had come to the mine for a specific purpose. 
<br><br>
<em>What if that particular purpose was to find me</em>, Gorliss wondered.
<br><br>
"Ilinea," said a voice.
<br><br>
Gorliss didn't know what the voice said, but the language was elven. His rudimentary knowledge of the language was limited to hello, goodbye, and "My name is…" Regardless, he knew the waiting game was over, and, taking the <em>chula</em> from his pocket, stepped out into the open.
<br><br>
"Hail," he said in common.
<br><br>
"Hail and good day to you, friend," responded the high elf, coldly. It was clear from his expression that speaking Common was distasteful to him.
<br><br>
Gorliss examined the soldier. He was tall and deceptively slender as were all of his race, his thin build masking strength. The elf was outfitted with fine leather leggings, and the soft leather boots that only the High Elves seem to be able to make. His arms were protected by studded leather poltroons and greaves, his hands encased in thick leather battle gloves. Gorliss did not fail to notice the fine mail shirt, nor the high quality sword, two items not normally given to elven foot soldiers. Though obviously young, maybe no more than 130 years, this elf apparently had connections.
<br><br>
"You gave me quite a scare," said Gorliss, adopting a casual tone.
<br><br>
The elf carried no light source, having a natural ability to see clearly in the dark. He stared directly at Gorliss.
<br><br>
"My troops saw the raider attack you," stated the elf. "We would have aided you, but, as you are aware, we were engaging the enemy and had no time to spare. When we failed to account for you among the dead, our scouts attempted to track you. It was our best guess that you might have fallen into this cavern."
<br><br>
<em>My troops.</em>
<br><br>
"I appreciate your concern, but for a few bruises, I made it through unscathed."
<br><br>
"I see that you are a long way from home, Erudite," observed the elf. "What brings a High Man to our shores?"
<br><br>
The elf still had not given his name. High Elves were insufferable sticklers for courtesies and manners. Withholding one's name when in conversation was tantamount to an insult… or an open act of hostility. Gorliss began to grow concerned.
<br><br>
"I'm on a research mission from Erud," Gorliss stated truthfully. "There are rumors of an underground city, possibly Gnomish, that existed here eons ago. I'm hoping that by finding it, I may be able to find some magical artifacts for study. My masters would be very pleased."  
<br><br>
The elf's eyes quickly scanned the necromancer, registering every detail in the blink of any eye: the filthy robe, the moldy sandals, the low quality dagger hanging from Gorliss' belt. Gorliss couldn't be sure, but he thought the solder's eyes lingered for a few milliseconds longer on his <em>chula</em>. Gorliss realized belatedly that the <em>chula</em> was a very uncommon magical light source. Depending on how versed this elf was in magical arts, the <em>chula</em> might even mark Gorliss for what he was. And necromancy was punishable by death among the elves.
<br><br>
"I see," said the elf. "I will need to report your activities to my commander, and the Sky Marshall of the Wild Elves will also want to meet you. Please be so kind as to accompany me back to our field command."
<br><br>
Elves do not lie. Gorliss knew their obsession with honor and truth prevented even the meanest of the High Elves from engaging in deception. That the soldier had not attacked outright meant only one of two things: he either didn't know that Gorliss was a necromancer, or he suspected but was honor bound to discover the truth from his elders before taking action. Regardless, walking into a High Elf military post would spell certain death for Gorliss. No High Elf military detachment ever left Felwithe without a standard complement of two battle wizards and at least one enchanter. He would definitely be brought before them for assessment. And either of those elves would know instantly what he was.
<br><br>
"Really, can't you just report my safety and business for me," whined Gorliss, affecting the tone of a put-upon scholar. "I'm perfectly safe here, and I may not be able to find my way back."
<br><br>
"A skeleton force of rangers will escort you safely back to this position later," replied the elf. "Now if you please."
<br><br>
The elf motioned back the way they had come. Gorliss was running out of options.
<br><br>
"Oh, please, are you serious? All the excitement has left me overtired and winded," said Gorliss. "I'll just stay right here. You can bring back your captain if you like, but I'm staying right here."
<br><br>
"I'm deadly serious, and I am afraid I must insist," stated the elf, his hand moving to his hilt. The steel in his voice was now unmistakable.
<br><br>
Gorliss examined the soldier. This situation was very dangerous for him. He weighed his options. Inhaling deeply, he looked the elf in the eye.
<br><br>
"No." he said.
<br><br>
"This is your last chance, mage," spat the elven warrior. "You will come peacefully, or you will come as my prisoner." The elf's eyes darted to the <em>chula</em> again. "You will not be allowed in elven territory without permission to explore these dead halls."
<br><br>
<em>Skeleton force, deadly serious, dead halls. His speech has betrayed him</em>, thought Gorliss. <em>He knows</em>.
<br><br>
"I will not leave," hissed Gorliss.
<br><br><br>
<u><b>Collision</u></b>
<br><br>
Hulian's sword left his scabbard with barely a whisper as he rushed the necromancer. He was quick, but Gorliss was quicker.
<br><br>
"Engulf," murmured Gorliss.
<br><br>
A cascade of silver mana rained onto Hulian. His knees buckled and he staggered forward, feeling as if he struggled against a raging river.
<br><br>
"Stop this," commanded Gorliss. "I would not be your enemy, fool."
<br><br>
The elf jerked to his feet, his military training shrugging off the effects of the debilitating spell. His eyes burned with hatred, his teeth bared.
<br><br>
"Join your abominations in hell, death mage," Hulian snarled. He swung his sword with force and sliced Gorliss across the breast.
<br><br>
Gorliss gasped at the pain and staggered backward. The soldier, overcome with the effort of attacking while under the influence of the engulfing spell, sagged forward and fell to one knee, unable to follow up his attack.
<br><br>
Gorliss clenched his teeth against the pain. He truly wished to avoid this battle, but he could not afford to toy with the enraged elf. The warrior surged to his feet again and rushed Gorliss, his sword upraised.
<br><br>
"Akhat," said Gorliss. 
<br><br>
Hulian gasped as a sickening green haze surrounded him. The impact of the spell stopped him for a few precious seconds, allowing Gorliss to put distance between the two combatants. Hulian stared with open-mouthed amazement as Gorliss' wound, visible through the rent robe, sealed over and healed.
<br><br>
"Give it up, elf," said Gorliss. "I only wish to continue travel unhindered. Don't make me kill you."
<br><br>
Gorliss watched emotions play over the face of the suffering elf. He knew the warrior honor bound to slay or capture him, but the young elf tasted the cruel edge of fear, Gorliss' most potent weapon.
<br><br>
Honor won. Hulian surged to his feet.
<br><br>
"Engulf," whispered Gorliss. The magical cascade poured over the warrior again. He struggled as against a windstorm, his movements slowed, his muscles weakening. Despite the suffocating effect of the spell, he closed with the necromancer and attacked.
<br><br>
Before Gorliss had transformed into a necromancer, he had, as a child, dreamed of becoming a holy warrior. For hours, he and his friends had "trained" to be warriors, doing mock drills, practicing sword fighting, wrestling, and refining their unarmed combat. Those days were many years past, but some things had never been truly forgotten. As the elven blade whipped down onto Gorliss, he dove forward and rolled under the attack, coming up behind the fighter. He jabbed with his dagger, forgetting the mail coat. The dagger ricocheted harmlessly off the armor.
<br><br>
Hulian spun and backhanded Gorliss across the cheek, sending him reeling. The studded leather gloves ripped skin from Gorliss' face, and blood spurted wetly down his jaw. He slammed into the cave wall and everything went dim.
<br><br>
"Akhat," yelled Gorliss, the need to focus making the adrenalin pump through him.
<br><br>
As his spell pulled the elf's life force into his body, Gorliss healed instantly and his head cleared. Hulian's sword clattered to the floor.
<br><br>
Gorliss watched with a detached pity as his opponent struggled against his magic. Two of his spells were working continuously against the soldier, ripping him apart from the inside minute by minute. Coupled with his life drain spell, which directly transferred a target's life into the caster's, Hulian was already half dead. There was nothing left now but to finish the job.
<br><br>
"Silyat," he said.
<br><br>
The elf curled up in pain as poison erupted in his system. Veins bulged purple and blue in his neck and forehead, and spittle foamed at his mouth. He looked up at the towering mage, feeling the horror of death so acute to one whose life is measured in centuries. One of his eyes had ruptured a blood vessel, and it seemed as if the Erudite was bathed in a fine pinkish mist.
<br><br>
Hulian could feel his life drain away. Images of his home began to swim in his eyes. He thought of his father, a humble merchant in a city of scholars, and his mother, a bookkeeper in the family business. He remembered his first day in the city guard, his parents beaming proudly to see their only son take his vow of duty. Upon graduation from basic training, his father had presented him with the chain mail shirt he now wore, a fortune's value in armor, and a moving statement of his father's pride in his son. 
<br><br>
Dying, it never occurred to Hulian to beg for his life. He was duty bound to protect and uphold the tenets and laws of his homeland. His suspicions of the tall mage had been true. 
<br><br>
When he had seen the stranger fall into the cave opening while charging to battle, his first concern was that a civilian, somehow trapped between the opposing armies, had injured or killed himself in some bizarre mishap.
<br><br>
The elves had easily routed the orcs, who fought like the disorganized animals they were. Platoons were reformed and began sweeping the forest for remnants of the orc horde. He had decided to take the initiative, however, and set about rescuing the civilian alone. Such behavior was uncommon among the methodical elves, but he had always been a little impetuous.
<br><br>
He tracked the mage easily enough, and had waited patiently for him to step out and announce himself. When the Man had not stepped forward, Hulian had called out a reassuring greeting to encourage him.
<br><br>
Gorliss' appearance had startled the young elf. He knew what humans looked like, and he had even seen an Erudite before when doing honor guard duty at diplomatic functions. But this Erudite looked like a wasted shell of a man.
<br><br>
The Erudite stood tall, as they all did, but his skin, normally dark, had somehow paled to a sickly bleached brown, like dried mud. His eyes were sunken and ringed, his veins prominent in his hands and neck. His disgusting, filthy robe hung in near tatters from his bony shoulders, and his lips were dry and cracked.
<br><br>
Hulian had dismissed the unsheathed dagger as the act of a frightened man, but he couldn't help but notice the glowing sphere of <em>something</em> the man held. It gave off a queer, cold blue light that hurt his eyes. The wrongness of it set his hairs on end and cast a discomforting halo about the man. Something had started clanging in the back of his brain, some vague reference from ghost stories of his youth, something to be worried about. He just couldn't remember.
<br><br>
As the Man had declared his intention to stay in the Faydark, Hulian needed to report his presence. He did not technically need to bring the Erudite with him, but the Man's appearance (and the glowing <em>thing</em>) made him doubt the wisdom of leaving him alone. When in doubt, he had reasoned, the best course was the proven one. In this case, it meant taking the stranger back to his commanders to let them decide what to do with human.
<br><br>
When the stranger first refused his offer, Hulian thought it was another stuffy scholar refusing to do anything that smacked of being ordered about. But as the conversation continued and the man became increasingly stubborn, Hulian's eyes returned again and again to the glowing <em>thing</em> in the man's hand. Each glance made the haunting memory clearer, a tale of something hateful and fearful. He remembered stories of evil mages and Tier'dal, coming in the night with ghastly servants, and all around them the eerie blue glow…
<br><br>
With the man's final refusal to leave, the elf's gaze shifted from the glowing blob to the man's eyes. At that second, everything clicked. He knew he was face to face with the abomination of the world, a necromancer.  
<br><br>
Hulian had fought valiantly, but he was overmatched. The death mage had used vile and profane magic against him, and it had proven too much. He would not die without honor, however.
<br><br>
Pulling his dagger from its sheath, he lurched headlong into the human fiend.
<br><br>
Gorliss, watching the young fighter die, was caught unaware by Hulian's frenzied drive. The soldier caught him full in the stomach and the two enemies fell to the floor. 
<br><br>
Hulian landed heavily on the mage, and Gorliss huffed as the wind was knocked out of him. The elf reared up and drove the dagger into the mage.
<br><br>
Gorliss wrenched one arm free and tried to deflect the blow. But Hulian was too strong and the dagger drove into his right shoulder.
<br><br>
Gorliss screamed from the pain, and, gritting his teeth, clamped onto the soldier's hand, refusing to let the dagger be withdrawn. Hulian's free hand was clawing at Gorliss' throat in attempt to choke off any magical words the mage may speak.
<br><br>
"Akhat," Gorliss croaked.
<br><br>
The elf reeled backward off of the necromancer and slammed into the cavern wall. Gorliss, recovering instantly as the elf's life force flowed into him, ripped the bloody blade from his shoulder and leapt atop his attacker.
<br><br>
Enraged, Gorliss landed bodily upon the weakening elf. The soldier was almost too weak to resist by now, blood bubbling out of his mouth from the internal damage the necromantic spells were wreaking on his system.
<br><br>
"Akhat," Gorliss yelled again, mentally weakening from the energy used to control the magic. At the same moment he yelled the spell, he plunged the dagger into Hulian's throat.
<br><br>
Blood and life force fountained volcanically from the dead warrior. A stream of hot blood arced directly into Gorliss' face. Hulian's spirit, entwined with the last bit of its master's life, shot directly into Gorliss' body. 
<br><br>
Gorliss stood above the body, breathing heavily. He could feel the elf's soul screaming in horror and rage through his system, howling its outrage. The sheer power of it made Gorliss feel supernaturally alive, his senses overloading with input from the air, earth, and ether. It was sickeningly intoxicating.
<br><br>
Even as Gorliss drank in the suffering spiritual residue, he recoiled from its cloying effect. His body healed completely including his lame ankle. But he felt sick at heart for having to destroy the young elf. He felt no guilt for living, for the elf, diametrically opposed to Gorliss and all he stood for, had left no room for bargaining. It had been an all or nothing encounter, and Gorliss needed to live too much to ever die.
<br><br>
Gorliss did his work out of necessity. His means were driven by his ends, and necromancy was the only path open to his ultimate goal, the defeat of Death. For Gorliss, Death was a corporeal being who could be found and confronted. The surest way to Death, he reasoned, was through Death's pawns and victims. Since the loss of his beloved Irina, his foot had been set irrevocably upon a gruesome path from which he could not waiver. 
<br><br>
But few were those who would listen to Gorliss' story. To many, he was evil made real, a hazard to be destroyed upon contact. And of those who did listen, they where either mad, or power hungry men and women, evil and petty. Gorliss, as necromancer, embraced all life in his need to defeat Death. And all life, in its need to embrace Death, rejected Gorliss.
<br><br>
Though mentally exhausted from the expenditure of mana, Gorliss willed the spirit out of him. The spirits of elves, under proper circumstances, became banshees, awful, haunted spirits filled with malice and very powerful. Gorliss would not risk a banshee forming within him. The results would be too terrible to imagine.
<br><br>
Gorliss sensed the spirit dissipating and withdrawing. Moments later, it was gone from the material world.
<br><br>
Gorliss looked down upon the poor elf. It's fair face and neck was covered in blood, it's eyes frozen in a stare of fear and hate. He shivered as he felt Death's touch upon the gory brow.
<br><br>
"I'm coming for you, Death," he whispered.
<br><br>
Gorliss bent and rent the elf's dagger from its throat. He carefully cleaned the blade on his robe and hooked the dagger to his belt. He cast one last look upon his dead foe, then turned and walked quickly away.
<br><br><br>
<u><b>Escape</u></b>
<br><br>
Gorliss moved swiftly down the silent tunnel. The elves would be looking for their missing comrade shortly, and their trackers would no doubt discover the cave. Once they discovered the dead elf, the hunt for his killer would be swift and intense.
<br><br>
Gorliss had recovered his <em>chula</em> and used its light to look for branches in the shaft. He passed three collapsed passages until he came to his first clear branch.
<br><br>
Gorliss paused and tried to get his bearings. He had no idea which direction he was facing, so any deviation in his path at this time would be a pure guess. The condition of the tunnels gave no clues for the dust was smooth and undisturbed. Gorliss shrugged and went through the right branch.
<br><br>
The tunnel continued unwaveringly straight again, this time with more frequent branches, all of them collapsed. A sparkle in the rubble of one of the cave-ins caught Gorliss' eye and he stopped to investigate. Sprinkled among the rocks and dust were fine flakes of gold.
<br><br>
<em>Gold dust</em>, he noted. There was still no way to tell if this mine was Gnomish or Dwarvish. Gorliss hoped fervently it was Gnomish, the better the chance that this mine opened to Steamfont.
<br><br>
Down the corridor, a nearly inaudible shout echoed. 
<br><br>
<em>They found him</em>, thought Gorliss. He stood and began jogging down the hall. Now that the slain elf had been discovered, the elven army would dispatch runners down the hall to trail the killer. Gorliss had fifteen minutes maximum head start, and that would shrink rapidly as the elves gave chase. He needed out of the tunnels swiftly.
<br><br>
He ran down the tunnel, taking none of the open branches that began to appear more frequently. The tunnel he was using appeared to be the main corridor to this mine. He was thankful that it was relatively flat and level. He did not know what he would do if the tunnel ended in a vertical shaft. Even if he could climb, the elves would feather him with arrows before he made good his escape.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the air seemed to freshen as he ran. Hope leapt in his mind as the thought of egress loomed large. He did not know how close the elves might be. They were much faster than he, and they ran silently. Gorliss was only sure that they had not yet spotted him, for is so, he would already be down with at least a leg wound from an arrow.
<br><br>
The tunnel's end came so suddenly he almost smacked into it. There was actually a fresh breeze here, but it was labored. The air came in through rough openings in yet another cave-in, this one nearly covering the tunnel entrance. In the upper left of the slag pile, Gorliss could see an opening to the outside, maybe just large enough for him to wiggle through.
<br><br>
Desperate, he climbed the pile and began wrenching out rocks. His hands tore on the rough stones, but he ignored the pain. He sent three small boulders tumbling before he quit tunneling. It had taken only minutes, but his beating heart and rising fear made it seem like an hour. He jammed his head and shoulders through the opening and wriggled through. 
<br><br>
As he tumbled head first out of the cavern and into the late afternoon, he heard the crack of an arrow splintering in the cave behind him. He completed his rolling tumble down the exit and landed hard. He looked quickly around and saw that the mine had exited midway up a high hill. The hill was one in a rambling series of hills that bordered the thick forest below him. Gorliss leapt to his feet and ran up the hill.
<br><br>
By running up the hill, he put himself out of the range of elven arrows shot out the exit he had created. The higher elevation also helped him get his bearings. He crested the high, sharp hill and took a good look.
<br><br>
The ridge he stood upon divided two thick forests. One was obviously Greater Feydark, which meant that the other was Lesser Feydark. He knew the entrance to Steamfont was in the western half of the Lesser Feydark. He looked at the sun. It was descending from the sky on his left, which meant he had to go right. Without hesitation, he began sprinting along the hills with the sun at his back.
<br><br>
Gorliss ran for an hour. The elves would struggle to escape the tunnel exit, but it would not slow them for long. Once through, it was only a matter of time until he was caught. 
<br><br>
Gorliss slowed to a walk as the tree line suddenly came up the hill. Pausing behind a tree, he looked through the growth. Just beyond the tree line the ridge suddenly opened into a gap. To his joy, Gorliss saw Gnomes traveling along the route formed by the gap. He had found the entrance to the Steamfont Mountains!
<br><br>
He was just about to step out and climb down to the gap when he noticed the elves. A heavily armed force of fifteen warriors and one wizard were encamped just below Gorliss, watching the moving crowd with eagle eyes. The markings on their battle gear identified them as members of the same company as the dead elf in the mine. He could not imagine how so many had arrived so quickly, but it didn't matter. There was no way past them without being sighted.
<br><br>
Gorliss sat and started thinking. He had one spell that could help him, but it was horribly unstable. If it failed at the wrong time, and it usually did, he was doomed. Unfortunately, his hand was forced, and he had nothing left to try.
<br><br>
Gorliss stood and cleared his mind. In his mind, he concentrated on darkness. Not a defined, crisp idea of a person or particular thing, but simply the idea of darkness, a vague, shapeless lack of light. As his mind clouded over to gray, then dark, he concentrated on darkening his own thoughts. The shapeless shade became black, then inky, then ebony, then jet. As the spectrum died, Gorliss willed the blackness to himself.
<br><br>
Had anyone been watching, they would have seen a strange thing. Shadows from under the trees began running out of the shade, swirling at the mage's feet. Dark tendrils of anti-light began to weave about his legs, a full cocoon of night slowly wrapping the spellcaster in its arms. The cocoon braided itself up the entire length of the man's body and over his head. Then, quick as a cat, the cocoon snapped shut into itself, so fast you could almost imagine it making an audible popping sound. And just as suddenly, the man was gone.
<br><br>
Gorliss opened his eyes and looked at his feet. He could see himself, of course, but he saw that he cast no shadow. The spell had worked and he was invisible. Taking a deep breath, he moved to the hillside of the gap, and began to climb down.
<br><br>
He made it safely to the bottom of the gap and blended into the flow of foot traffic headed back into Steamfont. Gorliss blinked back into view.
<br><br>
"Gaah!" shouted a startled Gnome as Gorliss appeared right in front of him.
<br><br>
The elves spotted him the moment he reappeared and surged forward. Gorliss ran, dodging merchants, mercenaries, and farmers as he headed for the Steamfont border. Suddenly, he blinked back out of existence.
<br><br>
The elves halted, scanning the crowd. The High Elf mage quickly cast a spell and their eyes twinkled cinnamon. Now they could all see into the invisible spectrum. Yards away, they saw Gorliss hauling tail to the border. Again they surged forward, tangling with the Gnomes as they tried to force their way through the crowd.
<br><br>
Gorliss blinked in and out of sight as his spell started to cave. He dashed around a corner in the twisting gap and stopped. He quickly reformed the spell in his mind, unaware that the elves would be able to see him anyway. He solidified the image of darkness in his mind and winked out of sight again.
<br><br>
The elves pushed their way through the crowd, all the time being pelted with obscenities. They rounded the corner and spotted Gorliss running, head down, to the opening at the far end. The crows had thinned here, and the fleetest of the elves sprinted for him.
<br><br>
Gorliss broke onto the plains and ran down a worn path. The crowd of Gnomes had thinned, but there was still plentiful traffic as they headed back to their homes within the Steamfont plateau. He veered to the outside of the stream of travelers and looked over his shoulders. He stopped full and grinned. The elves were nowhere to be seen. He had made it! Catching his breath, he continued down the dirt road to the city of Ak'Anon.
<br><br><br>
<u><b>Conclusion</u></b>
<br><br>
"Hold it, Elf!" shouted the Gnome warrior.
<br><br>
The High Elf soldiers pulled up short, their quarry dashing away before their very eyes. Blocking their path was a Gnomish border guard of twenty Gnome warriors, archers, and an enchanter. 
<br><br>
"Stand aside, Gnome! We are in pursuit of a wanted murderer!" shouted the High Elf enchanter, catching up to the swifter soldiers.
<br><br>
"No one passes into Steamfont without permission and that particularly means elves!" screamed the Gnome captain. 
<br><br>
"One of our own was ruthlessly butchered by a vile Erudite mage! He just now passed through your guard and headed into the plains!"
<br><br>
"Just now, eh? Stromp! Report!"
<br><br>
A grizzled Gnome warrior stepped forth. His metal chevrons marked him as a sergeant. 
<br><br>
"Sir! No Erudites or mages have been seen in the vicinity within the last month! Sir!"
<br><br>
"See?" said the short commander, turning to the fuming elves. "No mages here but our own. You must be mistaken."
<br><br>
"He was invisible," barked the elven spellslinger, his patience wearing thin. 
<br><br>
"Oh, is that so?" asked the commander. "Quite convenient, that. Well we'll keep an eye out for him."
<br><br>
The elf stared grimly at the gnome. They were not enemies, but the elf detested having his wishes overruled by this grubby little hill digger. He looked around at the gnome guardsmen, weighing the possibility of forcing his way in.
<br><br>
"Don't even think about it," the gnome growled. At the same instant, half a dozen mechanical war spiders rumbled to the gap and formed a rank behind the guards.
<br><br>
The High Elf glared at the unholy machines, and, shooting daggers with his eyes at the Gnome commander, gathered his retinue and departed.
