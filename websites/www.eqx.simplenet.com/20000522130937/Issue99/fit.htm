<b>Steamfont --</b> 
<br><br>
Unpleasant rumors have been coming from the home of the excitable little people called Gnomes.  For a while now we have been hearing that there has been a battle going on between the stout Gnomish guardsmen and invading Dark Elves.  Reporters have been to the boiling hills of Steamfont and have seen the results of these battles.  Small armored corpses have been seen littering the landscape.  And next to them, the less well armored bodies of other Ak'Anon residents.
<br><br>
"Us guards, we are here to protect the citizens, it's our job.  We do the best we can, and we're good at it.  But there just aren't enough of us.  Four or five of us have too much ground to cover, we can't travel in pairs in order to guard each other.  And it's more important to us to guard the people.  There a lot of rogue clockworks, slavers, and Kobolds in these mountains.  It's our job to keep people safe from them.  One of us can do that, and until recently that was enough..."
<br><br>
The Steamfont guards are too proud to go on strike, or even to demand an increase in their numbers.  After all, Ak'Anon does not produce warriors in any great number.  There is, however, an underground (pardon the pun) movement in the Library to provide assistance to the guards.  The rebels want to assign one member of the Library to each guard, to give them magical aid.  Library officials deny this movement, and stress that they are a learning institution, not any sort of militia group.
<br><br>
But there is an even deeper mystery in all of this.  Over several weeks of study, our reporters have discovered some disturbing information.  While many of the attacks on Steamfont guards were indeed initiated by Dark Elven assassins, there have been some attacks that are suspect.  Some reporters claim to have seen Dark Elves casting magics of the forest.  One claims to have seen one with a wolf as a pet, or perhaps as an ally...
<br><br>
The implications here are devastating.  The day that a Dark Elf learns to harness the forest and the magics of life is the day that I eat my very own hat.  And even if one such impossible Dark Elf did exist, I would not expect to hear tales of four or five such impossibilities.  And how would such a person, affiliated with life and Tunare, find it in their heart to attack Gnomes?  The more likely possibility is that there is corruption among the High or Wood Elves themselves!  For a long time there have been rumors of a powerful item that allows it's wearer to look like a Dark Elf.  What if such an item also made the wearer begin to <b>act</b> like a Dark Elf?  Perhaps it is time for the Elven lords of light to look into this matter, and take responsibility for the actions of it's peoples...
