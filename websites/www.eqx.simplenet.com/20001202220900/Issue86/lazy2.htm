<b>Endless Dreams</b>
<br><br>
Bristlebane the pain hurts!  I feel like I just got struck by some crazy wizard's lighting bolt.  I feel dispatched from my body, as if I am looking down on myself.  My back is bowed almost to the breaking point and my lips are curled back over my teeth.  I vaguely remember the man with the gray eyes.  He is all I can remember actually.  Those damn gray eyes.  Swirling like mist in the wind.  This pain, Bristlebane it hurts!  I roll across the hard stone floor and smash my nose into the wall.  My nose breaks as I hear a loud crack and blood spurts into my eyes and over my face.   I lay there on the cold floor for who knows how long.  Eventually I fall asleep, that is if the dreamscape I enter can be called that
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	I open my eyes slowly, as I still fear that pain which is so fresh in my mind.  My body feels sore, though there are no sharp pains.   I move my arms, then my legs.  Experimenting with each limb, each muscle.  I feel rather at ease, as if I have become more fluid.  I sit up and I grab my nose.  Was I dreaming?  It doesn't feel like I broke it.  I feel my face.  Yup, there is dried blood, but my nose is fine.  Weird, maybe I just thought I had broken it.  Well, no harm done.  
<br><br>
I stand and look around the shadow filled laboratory.  The book, which I was supposed to get for that weird man, is gone.   I guess I do just get to walk away.   I learned from my mistake, and I will actually live to use what I learned.  The treasure hunting profession is like that; you usually don't get to use what you learn from your mistakes.   Most of the mistakes you can make end with you being dead.  Funny though, I don't remember what my mistake was.  Now that I give it great thought, how the hell did I end up on the ground?  I place one foot in front of the other, making sure I can remember how to walk.  My mind seems to be filled with cobwebs.  Almost like someone has let looses spiders inside my skull to eat at their will, and to make their home in the dark recesses of my mind.  I walk around the room for bit, then I kneel where I had fallen.  I look for my belongings and pick up a few odds and ends, my picks and my lucky amulet.  I notice that blood coats the chain.  Must be from my nose.  Oh well, even the great ones falter once in a while, I say to myself as I head up the stairs and out of the house.   
<br><br>
The moon is still in the night sky as I fall from the window ledge.  I land hard on the ground and I begin to get frightened.  By the gods, my balance seems to have been thrown off.  I must have hit that wall really hard.  My plans are to report to the man with the top hat and explain to him that I cannot find the book he desires.  He has to get himself a new hunter, I am moving on to bigger deals.  I head down the alleyway where he said he would be waiting.  I come to a dead end and turn around.  There, silently, the man stands.  His hat sits slightly off tilt on his head.  
<br><br>
"Did you get the book?" he says, his hand extended.
<br><br>
"No.  I didn't.  Something happened.  The book was in my hands, then I fell.  I am not sure how.  But I woke up with a bloody nose, and the book was gone," I say.
<br><br>
"Come here, let me look at your neck.   Did anyone attack you?" he says as he looks closely at my neck.  
<br><br>
I push him away as I growl at him.  What the hell am I doing?  I just growled at somebody.  I growled!  Well look at that.  The man lay on his back a good twenty feet away from me.  He didn't move at all.  I didn't push him that hard, how in the gods did he end up all the way down there?  Oh well.  I walked over to him.  I leaned by his side and raised his head.  
<br><br>
"Hey!  Wake up.  I didn't even push you that hard.   What happened?" I ask, more and more confused.
<br><br>
He shakes his head and stands slowly, holding his head.  "He did get you.  I fear for you my small thief.   If I were you I would kill myself now.  That is, unless you liked that pain you went through."
<br><br>
I am shocked.  What the hell is this fool talking about?  Before I can ask any more questions he fades into the shadows of the alleyway.  I throw him out of my thoughts as a stronger urge fills my mind.  I have a desire.  A desire for blood.  But not just any blood, human blood.  I creep down the alleyway and into the streets, searching for my prey.  
<br><br>
My movements are almost unconscious.  I do not think to walk, I just do.  I think not of my movements, they just happen.  I look down at my outfit and can't help but think how ugly it is.  I will have to change that.  Then I see my prey.  A young man wearing an expensive looking outfit.  I am sure he has the blood of nobles, and the purse to match.  I cross the street and end up behind him.  I look around and see there is no one else on the street.  With shockingly fast movements we are both down an alleyway, his legs lifted off the ground by my super strength.  I bite into his neck with a sickening crunch as I enjoy the taste of his smooth blood.  My hand moves into his pocket with rogue-like reflexes and I remove his coin purse.  His body falls to the ground with a thud as I release him.  I moan silently to myself as I fall over backwards, passing out.
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
	I open my eyes as the ringing from a previously heard scream still fills my ears.  I am up and on my feet as I hear the familiar twang of a bolt being let loose.  I dodge and cling to the alley wall as if I was a spider.  The world turns to slow motion as I move with lighting speed, a look of pure shock on the guardsmen's face.  I am behind him before he can even turn to face me and I snap his neck as I wood a twig beneath my boot.   I turn and smile sadistically at the woman who called the guardsmen.  I begin to speak and I realize I have fangs where once were teeth.  That thought joins the other millions of fragments beating around in my empty skull. 
<br><br>
	" That was stupid my pretty."
<br><br>
	She can say nothing she is so frightened.  She only backs away in fear.  Ha!  I thought I was powerful before!  Now not only am I the best treasure hunter who has ever lived, but I have super race powers too!  I hear someone coming up behind me so I turn to greet my new opponent.  Another guard, they are too easy!  I grin wickedly at him as I raise my palms upward and shrug my shoulders.  He raises his crossbow as he takes aim.  I wave him forward with my hand and he lets loose the bolt.  The world stops as the bolt flies to within arms reach.  My hand flies up and I grasp the bolt out of mid air inches from my chest.  The guard drops his crossbow and turns to run.  My own feet carry my form next to his.  I grab hold of his belt and swing him into the brick wall, smashing his bones to mere dust.  Blood smears his face and the wall as he crumbles to the cobblestone road.  I turn and look for the girl only to find her gone from this place.  I smile to myself as I look around at my own work.  Ah, satisfaction.  I crouch and lick the guard's face, tasting his blood.  I smash his head down into the pavement and spit out his rotting blood.  I look down and stare at his corpse with disgust as I stand and feel the craving rise within me once more.

	It has been two weeks since that fateful night.  I have learned since then that I no longer appreciate the feel of the sun on my skin, nor do I crave regular food and drink.  My wine has since become blood, immediate vintage preferably.  I sleep and rest inside an old abandoned building, where I have no one to disturb my slumber.  I sleep by day, and hunt at night.  Though my tastes are for a richer climate then these garbage-strewn streets.  I have decided to steal aboard the next ship setting sail to Erudin. I hear they live fine, rich lives there.  On this night I will wait in the harbor for a boat of my liking, then I shall find what awaits me on the horizon.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	The boat's timber and rigging creak silently as it sails into the harbor of Erudin.  A pale moon hangs low in the sky and dawn is already suggesting itself on the horizon.  The captain and the tiller-man sit atop the deck, and not another soul is about.  The humid air clings to one's clothes even at night, and most are in their bunks.  I sit silently in my hiding spot, having been waiting for this moment.  I crawl out from behind the many casks in the cargo hold of the ship.  I swipe at my dingy clothes and promise myself once again to get a nicer outfit.  
<br><br>
Since my rebirth my mind has become clearer.  I can actually put coherent thoughts together and I have learned control over my cravings for the taste of blood, though it remains a powerful force.  I silently float up the stairwell, another useful skill I have since learned, and I find myself on the deck.  I cry out to the captain and tiller-man, both standing twenty feet from me.
<br><br>
"How do we sail my boys?" I say with a grin.
<br><br>
"Very well m'lord.  Is there any task you wish completed before our arrival?" the captain shouts back to me as I approach him and reply.
<br><br>
"No, no, everything is as it should be.  You and your men have served me well.  I am no longer in need of your services." With my final word I swipe my hand through the air and the captain collapses to the deck, the tiller-man falling atop him.  Every man in his bunk stops breathing as their short, yet fulfilling, undead life is brought to an end.
<br><br>
I turn and smile at the lights of Erudin, my fangs sparkling in the torchlight.  With a final look I am off the back of the boat and into the cold water of Erudin Harbor.  The boat continues to sail its straight course.  It slowly approaches the docks and the harbormaster comes out of his hut to meet the vessel.  A look of pure confusion moves across his face moments before the boat smashes into the docks, destroying them.
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
	It has been three weeks since my arrival in Erudin and I have found this place to my liking.  The humidity makes the blood of my prey taste sweeter, and the sweat on the neck gives my victims a salty taste I love.  I hunt at will, mostly on younger women.  But sometimes on men, for their blood has a stronger, bolder taste.  I keep up my treasure hunting skills every night.  Taking an outfit befitting my god-like stature from a tailor shop one night, rings and other jewelry from some pathetic spell caster on another.  My abilities to fly, move with lighting speed, and the strength of a hundred men have made me, Chibb, more powerful then I have ever imagined, and I love it!  I love it!  Far better then any wench found in any bar across any of the continents in Norrath, the feeling of drawing the blood out of a victim is so invigorating I find my mind cannot even find words to describe it.  I am unsure who or what this Galen Wilding was, but he sure did me one big favor.  With hind sight the pain I think I remember was definitely worth it.  I have plans, big plans.  And with my new talents, they will be accomplished.  I am Chibb!  Norrath beware!  For I am out this night, pray to your pathetic gods that I do not choose you as my prey.
