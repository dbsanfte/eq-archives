    <p align="left" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px"><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Go to your class guild master
    and get your jewel craft skill up to 21pts (you will be level 4ish, but don't forget to
    put one point into meditation at L4. It really sucks going all the way through L4 without
    meditation (believe me, I know). At this time, GET A TON OF MONEY, about 500 to 750pp.
    Jewel craft has no ceiling per level, so you &quot;could&quot; be a L4 grandmaster in
    jewel craft with 200 pts. Having 500 to 750pp you should be able to get your skill up to
    120 ish, only if your Int (raises skill quickly) is high enough and your Wis (reduces
    failure) is comparable. You will notice less monetary loss and maybe even a small profit
    if your Charisma is high enough.</font></p>
    <p align="left" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px"><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A couple other helpful profit
    ideas...A: sell to the vender of your race, and B: Get your charisma to 100. There is a
    Silk Tunic that can be picked up from a clothing vender in Qeynos for a few plat. This
    nice little evening shirt adds 5 Cha, get this and equip it whenever buying and selling.</font></p>

    <p align="left" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px"><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When making jewelry, you will
    need a few items. A Jewel kit, the jewel crafters book, a gem and a bar of metal. You do
    not need to enchant the bars of metal to acquire skill, you will not grow faster and it
    will sell for the same amount to the NPC venders, so save your time. When making an item,
    be sure these actions have been done...Jewel bag in 'inventory slot', Book in 'inventory
    slot', Gems in 'inventory slot', Bars of metal in 'inventory slot' ***NOT IN BAGS***.
    Place a single gem and a single bar of metal into the jewel bag then click the combine
    button. If your skill is high enough, you will be rewarded with an item of some kind. Know
    however, that even though your skill may be high enough to craft the item in question,
    there is always a chance of failure - destroying both the gem and the metal.</font></p>
    <p align="left" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px"><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You cannot choose what you
    want to make, the game will automatically generate the item. Rings, Necklaces, Bracelets,
    Earrings and Masks are all available for the jewel crafter's skill. The item generated
    will vary depending on the metal you use. The only 'real' pattern that I have seen, is
    whatever item is made with silver, will also be made with plat, and the same pattern
    occurs with electrum and gold. Listed below is the items created with the combination of
    gems and metal bars. You will notice four slots in your jewel bag but you will only ever
    use two. I heard a rumor that it was a small bag made into a combine item and Verant was
    too lazy to take out the other two slots. However, there is a rumor that the other slots
    may be used after an expansion - which one, I am not certain.</FONT><></p>

    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This is your Jewel craft
    table in its purest form. The info herein, resides the triviality, the end product of the
    gem and metal combination, and a rough estimate of what to charge your clients. As you
    create items you become better at your craft. You will notice after you make an item so
    many times out of a particular gem and metal, it will become remarkably easy for you to
    combine them, almost trivial. For example, when you pump all your points into jewel
    crafting and get up to 21, you will gain skill by making Cat's Eye Agate necklaces (cats
    eye and silver) but will gain no skill from Malachite Rings (malachite and silver). The
    malachite becomes trivial after a few skill points have been acquired. </font></p>

    know your &quot;chance&quot; of success, and also about how many of each gem you need to
    buy without over purchasing. It sucks having ten gems leftover that will grant you no
    skill. Not to mention the loss of hard earned plat. With this...I give you my Jewelry

    face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To create magic items, you will require
    an enchanted bar of metal. It has come to my attention; there is a mob, Queen Klicnik, who
    spawns quite regularly near the entrance to Qeynos. Unfortunately, she spawns very close
    to the entrance, and if you're not quick, the guards will get her first. Mainly because
    she makes a b-line for them. Why am I telling you about the Queen of all fire beetles? She
    loots a &quot;Giant Fire Beetle Eye&quot; (sometime two) which, for those jewel crafters
    who can't cast enchant metal spells, this little baby will offer a small, temporary
    solution for you. Place it into your melee, and use it. You will glow, and lights will
    swirl. When you check your inventory, it will be plus one enchanted bar of silver. IT DOES
    NOT ENCHANT A BAR OF SILVER. It summons a bar of enchanted silver. Please let me know, if
    you find anything that will summon enchanted electrum, gold or even...*drum roll*
    enchanted platinum.</font></p>
    <p align="left" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px"><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">For those of you jewel crafters who are
    enchanters, you might have a question along the lines of.... WHERE IN ALL OF NORRATH ARE
    MY ENCHANT METAL SPELLS? Well, rest assured they are out there, and unless you're a dark
    elf or reading this info, you will have a hard time finding them. They are sold in the
    Neriak library. There are a few ways you can get your spells without being slain by the
    evil residence within the dark city.</font></p>
    <p align="left" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px"><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A: Make a dark elf (mule character) and
    twink him a few pp. Then use him to buy the enchant (silver, electrum, gold and platinum)
    spells. Finally twink the scrolls back to your enchanter.</font></p>
    <p align="left" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px"><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">B: Go through the town while invisible,
    get to the library then find the vendor and buy the spells. After your done buying you
    will have reappeared, so don't forget to re-invis after the transaction has concluded,
    when done, get the hell outta there.</font></p>
    <p align="left" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px"><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">C: As an enchanter, at L12, you can
    illusion yourself into a Dark Elf, but if you worship any other god besides the dark
    prince, you will be slain anyhow (You might avoid slaugher if you are AGNOSTIC). So I
    recommend invis and the dark elf illusion.</font></p>
    <p align="left" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px"><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">D: Pay someone to do it for you. I don't
    recommend this particular path, but if you must, you must.</font></p>

    face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It is pointless to say you will rarely
    find anyone who wants an unenchanted item, so only make unenchanted items when you are
    practicing your skill up to a skill of 150. Then, enchant all the gold you practice with
    until your 200. When you make an item out of enchanted metal, and it's on the border of
    your skill, I don't recommend taking the risk of destroying your materials. Instead make
    &quot;trivial&quot; enchanted items. Sell your Enchanted items at retail. When you get
    your reputation up and gain a few regular customers, lower the cost a little, by about
    10%. Your crafted items should fly off your shelves...allowing money to come flying into
    those empty shelves, making you a seriously stinking rich EQ junkie.... err, lots o' plat.
    Auction items once every three minutes or so. When auctioneers broadcast more than that,
    they become rather irritating and listeners may go as far as to toggle their auction
    filter. If you have not sold anything in a 20-minute time period, consider moving over two
    zones and continue there.</font></p>

    UNLESS YOUR TRIVIAL IN THEM***REMEMBER***. I hear there's a good amount of gems which can
