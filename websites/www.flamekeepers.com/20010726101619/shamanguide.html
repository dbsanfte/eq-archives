    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Come, young one, and sit around the fire&#133;Ha! I got ye right there. A
    true barbarian would say, &quot;Bah! I do not need a fire fer ice runs through me
    veins.&quot; Ye are born unto the frozen north, the cold is yer friend where to many it is
    their foe. Take pride in the snow covered mountains of yer home fer often ye will find
    yerself laying yer life down to protect them hills.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">So, ye wish to walk in the path of The Tribunal? Well, there be much I can
    tell ye and much ye must learn on yer own, but sit anyways and I shall tell ye what I can.
    First, ye must be sure this be the path ye wish to walk. Tis not an easy one and it will
    test yer patience and will at many a time, but if ye follow the path well, someday ye
    shall be among the most powerful in all the lands. Before ye step in the tunic of The
    Tribunal, make sure ye have lots of wisdom, this be most important for a shaman. Make sure
    ye have all the smarts ye can, The Tribunal will grace ye with many spells to help ye with
    yer other areas, but yer smarts they leave up to ye. </font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Now ye have made yerself as smart as ye can, ye have vowed to serve The
    Tribunal and the next thing ye know&#133;wham! Ye wake up and yer nekid in a strange city
    and the snow is falling and the wind is howling and there be not hardly a soul in sight.
    Be not afraid, yer in Halas, the home of The Tribunal and now tis yer home. But don&#146;t
    go off runnin' around explorin&#146; just yet&#133;sit yer arse down quick like and pull
    out the spell book ye were born with and memorize those spells The Tribunal graced ye with
    before ye take a step. I would hate to see ye runnin' around and fall in the well and die
    and lose them spells. I know ye are itchin&#146; to get to the killin&#146; part, but
    there be other things in Norrath to do besides killin&#146;. </font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now ye got yer spells memorized, stand up and walk around Halas. No
    need to run just yet, runnin&#146; just get yer young mind confused. Walk around, look at
    the signs on the buildings, go inside and visit with the folks, ye will be speaking with
    them often. Remember where Mac&#146;s Kilts are, ye should do a lot of business with Cindl
    if yer smart. Watch out fer that well. Admire the wolves in their pens, someday when ye
    grow more and are stronger, they will be yer pets. When ye come across McDaniel&#146;s
    Smokes, remember that spot, tis a fine spot to have a drink with yer friends, the best in
    town in my opinion. Find the temple yet? It can be kind of easy to miss at first. It is
    not as grand as some in the land, it is run down, with pillars layin&#146; on the ground.
    Reason is there are so few willin&#146; to take the oath of The Six Hammers.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Once ye find the shaman guild at the temple, head inside and talk to the
    guild leader. Ye should have a scroll in yer posession to give to her, get that done. She
    will give ye a tunic to wear, it tain&#146;t much for The Tribunal is not long on funds,
    but be grateful none the less. Next thing ye need to do is get a little trainin' under yer
    belt before ye head out into the peaks. Shamus Felligan is my preferred trainer, but ye
    can use who ever ye like. I suggest puttin&#146; all yer trainin&#146; into yer one hand
    blunt in yer first circle, ye will get plenty of practice with yer spells and that little
    trainin&#146; ye get in that blunt will help ye beat them meanies down in the peaks while
    yer still a youngin&#146;. </font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">In yer wanderin&#146; around the city, ye should have come across the dock
    at one point, head back there now, and now be a good time to get yer arse in runnin&#146;
    mode. Once ye be standin&#146; on the dock, get yer club in one hand and yer candle in the
    other, yer about to head into yer first battle. Look out across the water, if it is day
    time ye might be able to see to the other side to the entrance where ye be headed. It is
    understandable if ye want to wait for the boat yer first time, but don&#146;t make it a
    habit. Fer one, it can be a long wait fer two, ye need all the practice swimmin&#146; ye
    can get. Now whether ye be boatin&#146; it or swimmin&#146; get on across that water and
    head on in. I hope ye got yer candle in yer hand, cause it be dark in that there tunnel.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Once ye get through that tunnel there ye be, in Everfrost. This is where
    all the action is gonna take place in yer younger years. Head on down that ramp and then
    stop at the bottom. See dem two big burly guys with big swords, dem are gonna be yer
    bestest friends while yer still young. When ye get into trouble if ye run fer them, they
    will kill whatever is on yer arse lickety split. Now that yer standin&#146; here, take a
    minute to cast those spells on yerself, always keep yerself buffed. Use the gifts The
    Tribunal gives ya, and don&#146;t be stingy with&#146;em. If there are others around ye,
    cast &#145;em on them as well. Ye can use all the practice ye can get, and it is a good
    way to make friends as well, those be handy too when ye get into trouble and trust me, ye
    will.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now, take a deep breath, pray to The Tribunal, then run yer arse on
    down. Once ye see where the peaks open up and go left or right, stop there. Ye don&#146;t
    want to be headin&#146; out into the thick of it just yet. Ye will see lots of critters
    roaming to and fro. Ye don&#146;t want to mess with most of those yer first circle, mostly
    skellies, they be good fer money as well. Money be important because ye need it to buy new
    spells. As soon as ye get some gold under yer belt, head on back to the shaman guild and
    get ye that fire spell. It be the only spell ye will ever have that will be fire based.
    Once ye get it, head on back to the peaks. Now ye don&#146;t have to go out into da muck,
    ye can just pick a critter and throw that there fire spell at it and watch it come
    runnin&#146; fer ye. Heh, all da warriors will be in awe because ye will be pickin&#146;
    em off left and right without ever havin&#146; to wade into it.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Keep up that killin&#146; and try to avoid dyin&#146; when ye can, takes
    an awful demn long time to memorize them spells. But the one good thing is The Tribunal
    sees fit that if ye die ye be reborn again, and yer first four circles they don&#146;t
    even get mad at ye and punish ye fer dyin&#146;. But after yer fourth circle, when ye be
    dyin&#146; ye be losin&#146; some of that experience, so get into the practice of not
    dyin&#146; while yer still young.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Also make sure yer lootin&#146; all them goodies off those dead bodies,
    and then sell them goodies. Ye need all the money ye can get at yer young age for yer
    spells. Each time ye get some gold, get another spell until ye have all yer first circle
    spells. Then keep a savin&#146; that cash, cause if yer killin&#146; good ye will be in
    yer fourth circle afore ye know it and it will be time fer new spells. Also, I told ye
    about Cindl, I hope ye be a talkin&#146; with her about them white polar cub skins, she
    can work out quite a deal with ye and afore ye know it, ye will be a walkin&#146; around
    not so nekid anymore.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Now there is not much I can tell ye past this point, like I said, a lot of
    learnin&#146; is gonna have to come on yer own, but I will give ye few pointers to help ye
    along. One thing to keep yer eye out fer is when one of them skellies be walkin&#146;
    along with a staff in his hand, kill it right quick like. Go ahead and use that staff
    until ye can find something better, that club ye start with tain&#146;t good fer much, so
    replace it as soon as ye can. Also ye want to remember to use all sorts of weapons,
    especially yer one hand blunt, two hand blunt and yer piercing. Reason bein&#146; as ye
    get older and stronger there be some mighty fine weapons for shamans in the lands that be
    usin&#146; those skills.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Another thing, is when ye hit yer 8<sup>th</sup> circle, run right quick
    to the trainer and practice meditatin'. Ye only need to practice it once with yer trainer,
    cause yer gonna spend plenty of time sittin' on yer arse practicin' this one, trust me on
    that. Soon after that, ye will be comin' upon yer 9<sup>th</sup> circle, this be when
    bein' a shaman gets interstin' for this be when ye get that Spirit of Wolf spell. Ye gonna
    be in much demand then, people be askin' ye all the time if'n they can have a SoW, get
    used to it. I don't go chargin' for that wolf spell as long as the people be askin' nice
    like, but when they is rude about it, I just either ignore them or ask 'em to ask nicely.
    Ye have to remember, yer a servant of The Tribunal, it is yer job to help but tis also yer
    job to keep people in line, just don't be goin' over board on that latter part.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Also, yer gonna find there be lots of things ye can do be yer a master of
    none. Ye can heal, but clerics can do it better, ye can melee, but warriors do that
    better, ye can nuke the critters, but magicians can do that better. But yer asset to a
    party is that you can do it all, heal, beat 'em down, let them feel the power of the
    frost, watch 'em fall to yer powerful poison spells and most of all, ye can buff the hell
    out of 'em and they likes that a lot. Every group ye get in is gonna need ye fer somethin'
    different. Sometimes ye be the primary healer, sometimes ye gonna be the main nuker,
    sometimes ye gonna have to beat on the critters, there is so much ye can do, ye never
    gonna get bored.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now fer the fun part. I know, I know, many will tell ye the fun
    comes from kill, kill and killin' more, but I have an opinion a bit different. There be so
    much other stuff to do in the lands and people be sometimes fergettin'. I find it fun
    after a hard day of killin' critters, to head to town and find a bar and tie one on.
    Remember McDaniel's I spoke to ye of, tis a great place in Halas, the best booze in town,
    plenty of room to get yer dancin' boots on, and even a few rooms upstairs if'n ye find a
    purdy lass or handsome lad that catches yer eye. Or ye can go sit on the dock at the
    Barbarian fishin' village in West Karana and toss yer line in the water a few times and
    see what ye get as ye watch the sunset. Ye can also take a day and go explorin', there are
    beautiful cities and underwater caves and people of all kinds to meet. And don't be
    fergettin' yer questin', ye can get all kind of goodies and experience. </font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Now these be some of the last words I am gonna give to ye, so listen to
    'em close. One thing to remember in all yer travels is respect. Remember yer representin'
    The Tribunal and Six Hammers wherever ye go. Also, remember to treat yer elders with
    respect. Bow before them when ye meet them, call them m'lady and m'lord, tis only proper,
    and don't be a beggin' from them, there is nothin' more disgraceful then that. Someday ye
    shall be strong and wise and powerful and will demand the same respect, so be sure to give
    it while ye are still a youngin'. Also respect get ye lots of friends, those friends be
    handy when yer runnin' fer life from one of the vengeful gang, and as fer yer elders, they
    may pull a giant off yer arse someday. So keep all that in mind, tis better to have more
    friends then foes.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Well, now my jaw is tired of jabberin' and there is much ye have to do. So
    be gone with ye. Keep these thoughts in mind and may The Tribunal watch over ye always.</font></p>
