          well they be just plan silly. There is much fun to be had in catchin' 
          yer first fish or sandal if that be the case. I am but a simple barbarian 
          shaman, but I find much satisfaction in reelin' in somethin' from the 
          water. And that tis why I am a writin' this. </font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Okay, first thing ye must be doin' is buyin' ye a fishin' pole. Don't have
    to be nothin' fancy, just a wood pole is fine. I got mine in Halas at the fish shack next
    to the docks, didn't cost me much either. Now once ye got yer pole bought, yer gonna need
    something to stick on the end of the line. This seems to help fer some reason, maybe them
    fishies don't like the taste of string. Grubs seem to work well for me, course them worms
    is not bad either and they is cheap which is also important. So grab ye a couple of cans
    of bait while yer getting' yer pole.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Now the next thing ye need to be doin' is findin' a fishin' hole. There
    are places to fish all over Norrath, whether it be at a dock, or at the ocean or at a
    pond, if there be water, there be some fishies to catch. Just find an empty spot and there
    ye be. Now ye gotta get yer fishin' pole in yer hand, this is very important as well.
    Another thing to keep in mind, is not to be standin' in the water, fer some reason the
    gods in Norrath won't let ye wade in the water and fish, I guess they think it's cheatin'
    or something. So make sure yer close to the water but standin' on the land or the gods
    come down and boom in yer ear, &quot;What's wrong with ye, tryin' to catch a land
    shark!&quot; or something like that.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Here comes the good part, get yer pole ready, pray to yer god (I ask The
    Tribunal fer a little luck) then cast away. See, that wasn't so hard. Aye, I know, ye
    prolly didn't catch anything yer first time, but tis okay, practice makes better, right?
    Now keep up the castin' and afore ye know it, yer gonna be better at fishin' and if'n yer
    lucky ye may even catch a few fishies along the way. Which is not bad, might even get a
    couple of silver fer them.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Yer gonna catch some other things when yer out there casting yer pole.
    Sometimes yer gonna get an icky sandal or even a rusty dagger or two. I don't know why
    them things would want to be nibblin' on no worms, but the gods did not mean fer me to
    know it all. What I do know is ye can sell those things too. Yer also gonna get some fish
    scales, now those things be nifty. If'n yer a caster, ye gonna need those to cast that
    spell that makes ye not have to breathe under water. If'n yer not a caster, well ye can
    sell those to people who know how to use them spells fer a purty good profit.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Another good thing about fishin' is there is so many other things ye can
    do while yer at it. When yer castin' yer pole ye can also try to figure out where yer at.
    They tell me that sense headin' can come in handy on occasion and when yer fishin' is a
    good time to practice it. Ye can also watch the sunset or rise depending on what time ye
    started or both if yer at it long enough and there is nothing like watchin' the sun come
    up or go down over the water, tis a purty sight indeed.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Heh, another fun thing to practice is yer drinkin', but don't tell yer
    mudder I told ye that, she liable to hunt me down and thwap me a good'n. What ye will
    find, is that when yer buyin' yer bait, that seller person usually has a few bottles of
    fish wine or the likes on hand as well, so real quiet like when yer mudder is not lookin',
    grab a few bottles of that. What is big fun is to take a drink, then cast yer pole, then
    try to figure out where yer at&#133;heh, before ye know it, ye will have a purty good
    rhythm down. But, be careful not to knock yer beer over, demn I have done that on a few
    occasion and me father always told me that be alcohol abuse and and when I was a youngin'
    he would thwap me good fer that. In case ye could not tell, me father and me mudder saw
    differently when it came to them bottles of fish wine.</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">Another thing to keep in mind if yer gonna drink and fish, is where yer
    fishin' at. Ye see, the more ye drink the drunker ye get, don't know why that is, but
    another one of them things I guess I'm not suppose to know. Anyways, the drunker ye get
    the more ye be wobblin' around and if'n ye been drunk ye know what I mean. So be careful
    if'n yer sittin' on a dock because afore ye know it, ye be sittin' in the water. Of course
    the good thing outta that is then ye get to practice yer swimmin'. And people say fishin'
    is good fer nothin'&#133;bah!</font></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"
    color="#FFFFFF">So there ye go. If'n ye keep doing these things I told ye over and over,
    afore ye know it, ye will be a master at it. Now how many of yer friends can say they is a
    master of fishin', eh? There will be a few hurdles to cross along the way, like when ye
    break yer first pole or ye spill yer first beer, but don't let those things get ye down,
    keep on keepin' on. If'n I could do it, anyone can. Now watcha waitin' on? Get to fishin'!</font></p>
