<br><br />
The Flamekeepers of Norrath is a guild based out of the Zebuxoruk server that strives for harmony and fun as a mid-high level, light role-playing guild. Coming from all over the lands of Norrath, and those of Luclin, and trained in all disciplines, we have been set loose upon society and have found each other. We will continue to strive not only to be a close-knit guild but also endeavor to earn the respect of those outside our guild. At the core level, we, the Flamekeepers of Norrath live by the tenants of: Friendship, Laughter, Adventure, Merriment and Entertainment! <br />

Policies <br><br />
<br><br />
In an effort to keep our reputation in high standing, there are certain guidelines any member already a part of the Flamekeepers of Norrath or those considering joining should keep in mind: <br><br />
--The most important aspect of the Flamekeepers of Norrath is to have fun and interact with each other and on each other's behalfs for the betterment of each individual as well as the guild as a whole. <br><br />
<br><br />
--We are a family-based guild and while the language in guild chat may not be suitable for all younger players, we ask that it be kept to a level appropriate to teenagers and above who are expected to have parental guidance. In no way are we going to try to &quot;parent&quot; the individuality of the guild, but we do ask for respectful consideration be given to your fellow members. <br><br />
<br><br />
--There is a difference between asking for a hand and asking for a hand out. This guild on the whole detests beggars and those who disrespect the time and energy it takes to help others. <br><br />
<br><br />
--Be sure to be respectful to those around us. &quot;Please&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot; go a long way. If one feels the need to ask for help, and the person you're requesting help from appears to be busy doing other things or expresses the desire not to help for whatever reason, thank them for their time and then find your own way. DO NOT pester someone who has already told you they can't help for whatever reason, even if that reason is a simple, &quot;No&quot;. <br><br />
<br><br />
--Disciplinary action and policy enforcement will be handled by, exclusively, the Elders. We do not feel that it is acceptable or necessary for guild members to police one another. If you, at any time, feel that a guild member is acting against the best interest of the guild or it's policy, and that it is serious enough, you may remind them once. Do not pursue the matter beyond the initial comment. Further action must be left to the Triumvirate. This can range from a quick discussion to removal from the guild, at the determination of the Triumvirate. <br><br />
<br><br />
--Our members are quick to help each other out, but because of everyone's willingness to help, there are those who may consider joining us for ulterior motives. Therefore, all new members will follow the path as marked by our recruitment policy. During that time, it will give us all a chance to see if the prospective member is the right fit for us, as well as give the new member a chance to see if the Flamekeepers are right for them. <br><br />
<br><br />
--In order to promote the family atmosphere of our guild, and to impart upon others the pride that we possess in our own clan, members are to refrain from going /anonymous in the lands at all times. /AFK and /rolplaying are the only acceptable alternatives. <br><br />
<br><br />
--While there are no set age requirements for the Flamekeepers of Norrath, your actions and words will speak volumes. Maturity level and overall personality can be determining factors for acceptance or dismissal as decided by the Elders. While it may be the official policy of SOE and it's associations that &quot;camps&quot; are not recognized, we, the Flamekeepers of Norrath do recognize and respect them. Should a time ever arise when claim of a &quot;camp&quot; cannot be resolved, do not involve a GM by way of /petitions, for they will not assist unless the problem specifically involves Kill Stealing, which they do recognize. Please contact an Officer or Elder should a problem ever escalate.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
--Actions that go against SOE's &quot;Play Nice Policy&quot; (Such as Kill Stealing, intentional Training, vulgar language and harrassment, etc.) will not be tolerated by the Flamekeepers of Norrath and will result in disciplinary action up to, and including removal from the guild.<br><br />
<br><br />
--Occasionally a high level member may wish to Powerlevel (PL) a lower member. This is completely up to the high level member, and should you choose to accept or reject a PL is in turn completely up to you. No member is to ask for a PL, much less beg for one. <br><br />
<br><br />
--There are certain benefits to being in a guild, and all members are to remember that they are priveledges, and not rights. Rezzes, ports, binds, corpse summons/locations, and general class-specific helps are not always available to members, and thus should not be begged for. If you can provide the help needed, please do so if you can. No guild member is to charge any other guild member for any of such services.<br /><br /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><br /><center><font class="pn-normal">This article comes from FlameKeepers of Norrath<br /><a class="pn-normal" href="http://flamekeepers.com/">http://flamekeepers.com/</a></font><br /><br /></center></td></tr></table></body></html>
