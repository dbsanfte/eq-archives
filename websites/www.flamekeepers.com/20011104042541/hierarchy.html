    open channels of communication. For that reason, there is no &quot;chain of command&quot;.
    Any member may approach an Advisor or Elder with problems, ideas, requests, or just to say
    &quot;hello&quot;. If ye feel ye have not been heard, do not hesitate to contact another
    Elder or Advisor.</font></p>

    together in all avenues. As members move through the posts, the Council of Elders expects
    increased interaction within all areas - from guild functions (planning, hosting,
    volunteering) to recruitment and everything in between. </font></p>

    all members must do the following:</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="2"
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Submit a written, in-character request to all
    members of the Council stating the post you are questing for. Remember - you may only move
    one step at a time. You may, however, submit two part quests to attain new posts. </font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="2"
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. If you are questing for your titled post, you MUST
    choose a special &quot;title&quot; which only you will hold within that post. Example:
    Cavalier and then name your special title for that post. Example: Cavalier Protector.
    CAVALIER PROTECTOR AND CAVALIER WILL BE THE SAME RANK - one is not 'higher' than the
    other. </font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="2"
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. You MUST decide upon a quest or swear an oath to
    perform some deed that you feel adequately represents the post/title which you have chosen
    to attain. The Elders will decide whether that oath of deed/quest is adequate (based on
    the post you are applying for) and then will inform you of their approval within 3-5 days
    of your submission. We will also offer suggestions if we do not feel that your proposal is
    adequate. You may accept, reject, or counteroffer these suggestions without fear of
    consequence until such a time when both parties (Member and Council) are agreed. </font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="2"
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. You will then perform what you have sworn to do, in
    order to obtain the post and title that you have chosen, with due proof of your work. Most
    likely, this will be the QuestMaster or QM Aides, who may &quot;visit&quot; you while you
    are doing so (and, in addition, you may choose to have witnesses provide testimonials.).</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="2"
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. The CoE will then convene and decide, unanimously,
    whether you have earned the &quot;step-up&quot; according to the actual performance of the
    oath of deed/quest that you have sworn to perform.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="2"
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may only step up one post at a time, but you may
    do so in a way that you see fit, as long as it is approved and proven. The Council of
    Elders also holds the right to deny your attainment of a post (if you have not performed
    what you have sworn to do.).</font></p>
