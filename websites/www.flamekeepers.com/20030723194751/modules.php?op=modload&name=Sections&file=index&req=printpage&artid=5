Each has their different personality, rules and guidelines, so study up before making your choice. <br><br><br />
<br />
If you are a guild, and are interested in joining the Alliance, there are several steps you need to do and they are listed below. <br><br><br />
<br />
First things first, make sure you have read over all of the policy and that you and your guild can agree to adhere to it. This includes, general, raid and loot rules. <br><br><br />
<br />
Once you have determined you agree with all of that, next thing to do is announce your interest in joining. Make a visit to <a href="http://www.flamekeepers.com/board" taget="_blank">our boards</a> and post your intent in the BFA General section of the board. <br><br><br />
<br />
Once your intent is posted, your guild will have 30 days to sign-up for BFA raids, group with members in the alliance and even just strike up general converstaion. This is so the people of the BFA can get to know you and your guild and get a feel for how you will fit in. The more interaction you have with the members of the Alliance, the better we can make a decision on allowing your guild to join. <br><br><br />
<br />
At the end of the 30 days, a vote will be held within the Alliance. The vote will be open for one week. At the end of that week, you will be informed if the decision was yes or no. If it was yes, you will be granted access to the BFA chat channel and be allowed to appoint a member of your guild to the BFA Council who will act as your voice concerning all BFA matters. <br><br><br />
<br />
If you have any questions concerning this process, please contact one or all of the Council.<br /><br /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><br /><center><font class="pn-normal">This article comes from FlameKeepers of Norrath<br /><a class="pn-normal" href="http://flamekeepers.com/">http://flamekeepers.com/</a></font><br /><br /></center></td></tr></table></body></html>
