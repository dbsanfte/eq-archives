<br>
One bright and early December morning a star was born.  I was among the last generation of gnomes born during the Ogre exodus.  The Dwarven and Elven Empires were in the mist of bringing the Ogre Empire to its knees even as I screamed for my first meal.  A dwarven warrior was helping my family move away from the battlefield before an onslaught.  He remarked he could fit my entire body in one of his hands.  He also commented this was good, because the noise I created was so loud it was necessary to hold me as far as possible from his ears. <br>
<br>
Some of my first memories were of dwarven allies rebuilding from the carnage.  My family moved into a home near a farming area in Butcher Block.  Trying to fit in we began to visit a nearby church on a weekly basis.  This is where I met a young Dwarf by the name of Hikanur. <br>
<br>
Even though we went to different schools, we stayed friends for most of our young lives.  We joined the scouts, sang in the choir, and joined the church youth group.  Sometimes we would meet outside the church or his father's nearby store to hang out and listening to music from Twisted Sister, U2, and Butthole Surfers.  Occasionally we would spend time getting into trouble, play a game of basketball, sneaking off to the beach, or helping Hikanur's dad on the farm.  Basically just a couple of butcher block brats. <br>
<br>
During this time Biddyn was working with Edril to find a place Emperor Carandri would allow the gnomes to call home.  When the plague dragon was defeated, Ak'anon immediately became my home.  I also joined the newly formed wizard guild under Master Tobon Starpyre.  Master Starpyre didn't keep me around long.  I'm not sure if he was tired of all my questions or if I truly was that good. <br>
<br>
Out in the real world my stomach rumbles made it necessary for me to find employment.  That is when I began taking odd jobs.  My favorite job was helping deliver the mail.  It allowed me to travel to most of the areas of Faydwer.  Once in a while I would even be given a few gold and a bag full of letters for Freeport.  I loved the sites and sounds of the big city. <br>
<br>
The League of Antonican Bards soon became my first personal ally.  This was helpful in many ways.  For example, my earliest visits to Qeynos.  Many merchants and people on the Qeynos side of the world will not help shorter people.  I figured they were just jealous; it must be hard for their hearts to pump blood to their heads with that distance.  My alliance with the bards made it possible for me to find merchants willing to deal with me in most cities in Norrath. <br>
<br>
One day as I was making a mail run to Kelethin I ran into my friend Hikanur who had become an accomplished warrior.  His response to my job was, &quot;MAIL?  Orcs are the big money.  Forget the mail.&quot;  I soon learned the location of orc hill and how easy a foe they could be.  After our first kill I heard Hikanur say, &quot;Take his belt off&quot;.  This chilled me to my bones; I didn't want to disrobe an orc.  Soon I learned the orc's ceremonial belts and shoulder pads could be exchanged for armor.  During my Kaladim visits I spoke to some local paladins and learned they also needed help.  They were recovering bones from the recently undead.  I didn't understand why, but they paid well and I'm sure they had good intention.  They are Paladins, I'm sure it has something to do with putting their troubled souls to rest.  <br>
<br>
Soon I strengthened my dwarven alliances with many bones and belts.  I found the armor rewards to be far too bulky to cast spells.  However, my mail routes gave me plenty of opportunities to sell my armor to many merchants all across Norrath.<br>
<br>
As my abilities grew, I learned alternate uses of the gate spell.  I used my new spells to transport me to many new places even quicker than I had imagined possible.  Always returning home to Ak'Anon and Kelethin because I had many allies but few friends I truly trusted. <br>
<br>
After one successful trip to North Karana I was talking to Hikanur about some of my adventure.  It was getting late and we needed to release ourselves from Norrath's grasp.  However, we wanted to do something to make the night worthwhile.  This is when we met Menludarja looking for a bit of adventure also.  He said he had met a father horrified to learn his daughters were heading a group of bandits working out of Lesser Faydark.  My experiences with Lesser Faydark had not been very good, mostly dealing with stupid brownies.  Menludarja said he knew where the bandit's camp was located and he could get us in and out without any problems.  The camp proved to be very easy target.  My attacks from above accompanied by Hikanur and Menludarja's ground attacks made things short and rewarding.  We were able to get the poor gentleman his proof as well as rid his family of bandits.  Hikanur and I added Menludarja to our list of friends and looked forward to seeing him again. <br>
<br>
This wait wasn't long.  I was asked to join him and his band of adventurers in Split Paw followed by giant hunting in Rathe.  I had never been to Rathe, it was interesting to say the least.  After a few more beers, I learned how to understand their logic. <br>
<br>
I was added to their number that night.  I have considered joining the small band of Whispering Scythe one of the finest mistakes in my life.  It has made life fun, as well as given me more help than I ever expected to have. <br>
<br>
With the help of my guild mates I have mastered everything from evocation to cooking to tinkering.  I have learned to swim like a fish and fish like an otter.  I can teleport and/or group teleport to 15 places different places all across Norrath.  I love helping and being helped by my friends. <br>
