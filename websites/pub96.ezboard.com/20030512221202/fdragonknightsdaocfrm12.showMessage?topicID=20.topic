<br>
Okay for the most part we are all pretty much aware of the fact no MMORPG is released fully functional.  The list as someone else posted is pretty extensive on what is not in SWG, namely space which we all know they have already said, promised and so on, that would be in the first expansion.  So, with all of this understood I was wondering if  we as DK should set up a date a few weeks later than the actual release date to get together and decide on the server we wish to join.  We can take into account things like server population and things of that nature if we wait a few weeks to actually form DK.  This will also give everyone time to get familiarity with the inside workings of the game before we start into the project of DK in SWG.  The only problem I forsee is that someone may make a character on the server we pick and that would put them way ahead of the game as far as the rest of DK is concerned.  I am willing to wait for the rest of my guildies to continue on the level treadmill if it is something we all can agree to do.  We can also stretch the time period to 30 days which is the point that everyone will have to make their first monthly payment or just not play.  Of course that is basing it off the assumption that all of the people that want to play will start on the first day.  This is just a recommendation, I am curious what others may think.<br>
<br>
On a side note the issue of the guildname and fitting it into the Star Wars theme, Dragons are in that theme there is a specific species referenced in the Star Wars Encylcopedia.  They are Krayt Dragon's.  Large and vicious meat-eating reptiles, they live mainly in the mountains surrounding the Jundland Wastes on the desert planet of Tatooine.  Krayt Dragons continue to grow throughout their lifetimes and do not become weaker with age.  Their skin is yellowish brown, and they have three huge horns on their heads.  They walk on four legs.  Their gizzards hold incredibly valuable and beautiful dragon pearls. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> StrayfeTheMonk</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFF00>(2/7/03 6:43:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   as if</span><hr size=1> First off....good thoughts. Second off....no way am I gonna play for even a WEEK and then switch servers.  I'm a hardcore gamer. VERY hardcore.  I plan to be well ahead of the pack a week into the game.  I think picking a server BEFORE the release is essential.  That way, we'll be able to help each other with getting started IN game as well as out of it.  This will benefit the non-beta playing people as they'll get to play with the people who played the beta and can offer us some tips. <br>
 As for the guild name...I see no reason to change it.  DK was never really a roll playing guild that I've seen.  I'm proud to be known as a Dragon Knight......and I'd be proud to be in a guild called Dragon Knights even in a MMORPG about Strawberry Shortcake or Carebears.  And what's this you're talking about some gay dragon with a pearl neckace around his gizzard? that's sick man..just sick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/bdragonknightsdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=waasak>Waasak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/7/03 9:02:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: as if</span><hr size=1> LOL<br>

Yeah, I didn't make the reference to change the guild name I was just putting the reference in there so people didn't think Dragons weren't a part of the genre.  So uhm, yeah!  I have pearl necklaces with Krolin written all over them! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/bdragonknightsdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ci>Ci</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>[GM]</span><br>  Posts: 903<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/8/03 11:26:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.dragonknights.org/ciaaran_head.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: as if</span><hr size=1> HAHAHA<br>
<br>
It is my personal opinion we can just select the server at random and play on it. The one thing we should make an effort to do is rule out servers that we know might be swarmed with l33tz etc.<br>
<br>
When DK started on Merlin I literally picked one at random.. I made a list, closed my eyes, and put my finger on Merlin. As it turned out it was THE server for the big guilds. Had I known that I would have avoided it. As it turned out it was perhaps the best server to play on in the game. When RvR was in high gear there was no better place to be than Midgard Merlin. So, I say we just pick one because the end result it impossible to predict unless we wait too long for the decision to matter.<br>
<br>
I think most will start day 1 and we should hit the ground running. Even as quick as we started DK on Merlin we were still only the 52nd guild to form (which aint bad I suppose if you consider that is probably top 20 in the realm). I don't want to race the server but I do want to explore on our own and learn some things the hard way - that is where the fun is IMO. <p>===================<BR>

When it gets down to basics all of these game are just copys of each other. Hack , Slash, loot , Repeat into nausium. Only real high point is the exploring and doing that with all the great people in DK. <br>
Krolin mentioned that DK wasnt much of a RP guild. I suppose that is true but there are a few of us who do like to RP. I know that I would like to do more of that this time and less of the hard core lvl grind. This time around im in it for the fun and the Uber side of things just dont even matter. I cant wait to take on one of the Dragons Krolin mentioned but im sure not gonna power my way there in a week or a month...if it takes awhile to get there so be it.<br>
<br>
Anyway just some thoughts that sprang to mind as I read the posts hehe. More fun less grind and Those Rebel terrorisets must be brought to justice.....Damn disterbers of the peace....cowardly bomber attacking inocents from the shadows...Death to all terrorists!!!! <p>Durshock<br>

But seriously, I said DK was never much of a RP guild, but I didn't say that it couldn't be one.  Some people are hardcore gamers, and some are more into it for the overall experience. For me, hardcore gaming IS the fun.  But as long as we're all together, I think we'll all have a blast either way. <p>~Strayfe~EQ<br>

I'M OUT!<br>
<br>
As always, I will be fashionably late to the gang.  So, save all those lowbie goodies for me when I roll in.  Probably late summer.  The penguins are putting up a good fight and refuse to let us get out of here anytime soon.  About the only good thing is this is my last trip.  Once I am home, I don't forsee any trips at all, so I should be able to be all about hardcore gaming again, unlike Krolin who just likes hardcore midget porn.<br>
<br>
It is tough getting internet access down here this year, so it is difficult to follow most of the threads here, but I plan on jumping wholeheartidly into this feet first.  I am even going to drop 3k on an Alienware or Falcon system to get me right back into the swing of things.<br>
