Allow me to reflect on last night's raid. First off, I think we did Quite well with the forces we had there, I had my doubts we could take em but we did, including Lord Ghoisk. People listened well, few tips: stay behind leader, do not move up unless told to, NEVER move past leader/puller. CoM is nasty to people in low to mid 40's cause you get nasty agro most 50+ can single pull as shown.<br>
<br>
Anyway, They are epics, they are not supposed to be easy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Reavers are not gonna be taken out of the game anytime soon as far as I know so don't act as if its over. Not to mention, the people who help you with your epic 9 times out of 10 are not just guildies they are friends, so just because you don't have enough #'s in guild does not mean you are lost. In my old guild we were able to get 3 shamen epics, 2 rogue epic's, monk epic and druid epic, All done with friends from other guilds cause our numbers could not provide what we needed.<br>
<br>
Death's on raids are a given, Puller's will usually die, Chanter will for sure and it should be expected *shrug* that's what those rezzes are for. <p><p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~stklassy1/gharsig.jpg"><BR><p><Font size ="2"><B><I>Gharbad<Font size ="2.5"> "The Mighty" </Font><Font="2">Champion Of ~Saryrn~

I got a lot of flak for last night. I am not sure if I want to do this again will be easier to buy it then to listen to how mad ppl were at me becuase they were not getting xp, because they dead, becuase I did not have a big enough group. I was very happy at the beginning of last night just to be going but there were a lot of things said to me in tells that took away from the night. I won't point fingers or get into details but I will just quietly go about finishing my Epic without too much more bother. <br>

Gharbad and I were discussing the possibilities the night before and we both agreed it would be carnage. And hello WTF people. At this level you should be too experienced to expect to level on a raid. The only reason I gated is because Aaeerwen told me too and I though I was causing too much argo. Plus I was wasting cleric mana (thanks Charless because of you I only lost 2 and a half blue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
With the exception of people trying to tell me how to do my job (and don’t do that again please or no buffs for you) I thought we did really well. This area wipes out groups all the time. We got Lord Ghoisk!!!! Do you have any idea! I was giving play by play to a friend and he freaked when I told him someone had argoed Lord Ghoisk. Then he freaked again when I told him we took the Lord out.<br>
<br>
Until I started reading this thread I thought we did well. Room for improvement sure but what raid goes perfectly. And Aaeerwen we will get you the piece. I think next time we should schedule when we have more time however.<br>
<br>
Only two complaints from me I should have been grouped with the main assist/puller and the main healer. The other is don’t you ever spam me again. I told everyone buffs were incoming that should have been enough for you. If I ever get spamed for buffs from you again I will remove you from the guild. Ten times in a row is ridiculous and I will not put up with it. Here is the chanter buff priority list for future reference your behaviour has placed you at # 7:<br>
<br>
1. Clarity on myself and the main healer.<br>
2. Haste on the main puller, the main assist, and myself (only way to keep track of when the buffs drop without clogging the raid chan with requests)<br>
3. Haste on any monks and rouges (level order)<br>
4. Clarity on all other casters (healers first level order)<br>
5. Haste warriors<br>
6. Haste and Clarity to hybrids <br>
7. Jerks who spam for buffs<br>
<br>
BTW I have a picture of my corpse at the NK druid rings for anyone who doesn’t believe there is a bear faction.<br>

And yes you should have been in the Main group and not the Extra group.  It would have been a lot more helpful to them.  I thought we did a great job, like Fizelle I figured I would die many times over.  I want to again thank everyone for getting the pieces I will need in the near future, even though it was the purpose of the raid.  That we had under 10 deaths, guessing, is great.  I just felt bad because Fizelle died twice and Aaeerwen did not get his piece.  I did not mean to start a string like this just wanted Aaeerwen to know that I was more hopeful that we could get his piece last night.  And I always feel bad when someone dies in my groups, even if it is during a raid.  For the complainers and the people who where spamming, it is hard enough to raid in a place that is dangerous....it makes it 10 worse when you have all the other garbage do deal with.  I feel bad that both Fizelle and Aaeerwen had to put up with that last night.  I agree very much with Fizelle.  Well, Hope to see most of you when I get back from vacation.  Sorry about Last night Fizelle.<br>

Reavers are NOT easy.  I was stubborn and refuse to by mine, so yes I have been through the camping process of them.  It can be a very short camp OR it can take days, just depends on your luck.  It took me about 3 ot 4 raids to get me 1.  If you have 2 groups of 50+'s, they can be done easily.  But some requirements for this type of a &quot;Raid&quot; is like no other raid in the game.  Most raids you can get away with about anything.  For the reavers, I found it is almost a MUST to have a 55+ tank and a 55+ cleric.  And as far as you people that want to spam others and specially the GUILD LEADER AND THE OFFICERS, well then dont even come next time.  And if you do come and start to complain about petty crap like that, then I will follow what Fizelle posted, YOU WILL BE REMOVED  ASAP!  Most of you complainers need to stop and think a minute.  You are helping a friend that has helped you in the past at one time or another.  EXP should be the least of your concerns.  Do you ever want your epic?  Do you want people not to help you cause they wont get exp?  If that is the case, why do I have Daliner help you all out?  9 time out of 10, he dont get exp anywhere.  Think about it for a bit before you go running your mouth complaining about crap that may affect you down the road.  Aaeerwen is a great leader and a great person, I can tell you all that you help him out now and you will benifit it down the road.  Dont believe me?  Take your chances.  Heck who knows, a drop that you may want or need while on a epic raid,  you think you will get it if you are a baby about stuff like that?  I wont give it to you and I loot most items on a raid when I am there.  A guild is supposed to be for teamwork and to help others out that are supposed to be your friend.  And in return a guild will help you.  You ever die at the end of a dungeon that only has 1 exit?  Who are you going to expect help from if you dont help others?  Well ok I am done now I guess.<br>

What did I notice you ask? That post, although done in a funny way, is not far from the truth. Follow those rules and you will get far in this game, break them and you'll be hated and probably won't get invited on many raids. <p><p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~stklassy1/gharsig.jpg"><BR><p><Font size ="2"><B><I>Gharbad<Font size ="2.5"> "The Mighty" </Font><Font="2">Champion Of ~Saryrn~
