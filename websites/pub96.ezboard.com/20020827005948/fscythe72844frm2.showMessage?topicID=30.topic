A look of hunger appears in his eyes.  &quot;You know&quot;, he says softly, &quot;I am torn between my desire to stay home with my family, and a need to adventure and journey with you fine mates.&quot;  A knowing murmur filled the room as others of the Whispering Scythe nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
Arrington filled Elmpe glass with mead.  Elmpe continues, &quot;My hope is to reach a level of skill to be an asset to you fine people on future journeys whenever I can join you.&quot;  <br>
<br>
He looks up at the wall filled with portraits of past Heroes of the guild.  &quot;I am getting close to that level of expertise.&quot;  Elmpe smiles, &quot;I will return to this Hall and announce to you all when I have achieved my goal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elmpe stands and waves good journey as he strides out into the dark night.<br>

His heavy shoulders seem unable to allow his arms to hold his small hands above his waist.  Mournfully his voice cracks a little as he begins to speak.  &quot;Is this a see you later?  Or just goodbye?  In the past the monthly dues of around 12 bucks have taken my friends away.&quot;  Kicking a stray log into the fire he adds, &quot;Of course the evil King Verdant wants his due.&quot;  <br>
<br>
With a slightly happier stance he begins talking again.  &quot;I do not see our friend Giligan very often.  However, it makes the times I do see him even happier.  Same goes for Querkus and Hikanur.&quot;   <br>
<br>
With a movement of his hand and the loss of a bat's ability to fly he begins to float.  The gnome Runs out the door to the guild house.  Standing on the platform in front he screams, &quot;Don't make me do it.  I will do it! !&quot;  He jumps and softly floats to the ground.  <br>
<br>
A small summer storm appears as if summoned by a wish or a spell.  Arrington uses this opportunity to hide the feeling that seem to flow from his eyes.  <br>
<br>
/ooc Hopefully you will still be able to join us only less frequently.  When football season starts I will be missing a lot of EQ time myself.  I have tickets for 7 games to see ECU play, all on Saturday.  This will mean no playing on Saturday and little playing on Friday and Sunday, my biggest 3 days of playing.  However, after Thanks Giving I will return to playing more and maybe start getting levels again.  <br>
<br>
However, real life is much more important than a game.  If you need to go then I wish you well.  Just remember, you will be missed.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

He wonders how his guild mates are faring?  He knows he will see them again and that thought makes him smile.  &quot;When I am stronger Jaggedpine will be visited&quot; he vows.<br>
<br>
Elmpe shifts his gaze to his diary.  &quot;If only I had more time I could help my friends more often&quot; he thinks to himself.  He begins to write a tale of adventure and loyalty that does not end, but just moves at a slower but still powerful pace.  &quot;Sort of like the river that flows in Surefall glade&quot; he sighs.  <br>
<br>
With that Elmpe drifts off to sleep awaiting the next adventure that will gain him the experience he needs to assist his mates in the Whispering Scythe.<br>

She sighs again knowing that her goal of achieving her Epic is going to take away her time from her guildmates and from raids with the other guilds that have been befriended.

I have been doing VERY well in Tenebrous Mountains with Quelar.  With the new ports on the moon including one to Twilight Sea we are able to get there quick.  Also Katta Castellum is right beside the zone so we have access to merchants and a bank.    Maybe we can get some almost raid level people bound in Katta Castellum and work on getting them up.  <br>
<br>
My brother said he could solo there around 42th with his druid.  The MoBs are way underconned for their exp.  Quelar has gone from 30 to 34 and a half in the past 4 days.  However, he did have a little help.  A Beastlord friend went from low 45 to 47 and my brother's Druid went from mid 44 to almost 47.  Therefore I would not suggest someone in their low 30s going without some support.  At 46 some stuff is turning light blue to my brother's druid so they may only stick around for another two levels or so.  <br>
<br>
However, if I am there you are welcome and when you get to know the others I am sure you will be welcome even when I am not there.  Yesterday during the busy time there were 9 people in zone and we were 4 of them.  Until the word gets out this should be a great place to hunt.  <br>
<br>
Just FYI, you will HAVE to be OK with the guys of Katta Castellum.  I have seen some Ogres there so I am assuming most will start at least dubious.  <br>
<br>
For the people who need money, there are almost always high levels killing guards at the bank.  After a few kills they can't use the merchants or the bank anymore.  They just leave their corpses around and don't seem to mind others looting them.  Quelar looted corpses for about 20 minutes and got 180 plat.  If the guy hunting the guards is good then you can easily make 600 to 700 plat an hour just being a scavenger.  Just make sure you don't buff them while they attack the guards.  Quelar accidentally buffed one during a fight and got the faction hit when the guard died.  Now I am apprehensive in the city.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
