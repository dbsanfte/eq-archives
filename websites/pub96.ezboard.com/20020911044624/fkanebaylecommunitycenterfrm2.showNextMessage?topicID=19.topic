If they /movelog and the ppl who move from AB see that its ALL lvl 60's again with the same @#%$ up scenario as AB was, they will start to quit one by one, again lost revenue. /movelog is a short term fix to an already dismal server named Antonius Bayle. Besides why would you need to LOAD test a /movelog server anyway? Move ppl over at a rate of 1000 per week til its full, fix issues as they arise and dont add more ppl til its fixed. SOOO many things point to it not being /movelog but then again Verant has never gone with whats normally accepted by the masses anyway so we are prolly all screwed and it wont be a new blue. /rude VI! I am reminded of the overwhelming demand for a Roleplay server that Verant had to BETA test useless code forcing the masses to ignore the new Beta Test Gift of Firiona Vie. Whats funny is that after so long ppl figured BUGS/Workarounds to the nerfs there to exploit rules hehe.

All the Europeans I know want it to be a fresh blue.  <br><br>As someone said on the other board, if KB was to be /movelog it's highly unlikely to be restricted to just AB players in fact its more likely that they would restrict a /movelog to all blue servers but AB.  We had two chances to move to AB and one chance to leave it and its still a relatively new server.  <br><br>But lets just say it is a movelog and they allow all blue servers the chance to go to KB (including those from AB).  Well there's at least two of the top 4 guilds from AB that will move, I know of another 3 -4 2nd or top guilds from other servers that will move.  Add to this all the other guilds that I'm not aware of and a whole host of 55-60 lvl players who think they will get a better guild/chance on the new server add to this numerous other players who want to move for a whole bunch of reasons and you will end up with mass overcrowding and a lot of unhappy people.<br><br>Also why would Sony want to do this?  Sony are a company not a charity.  What do they gain by giving people who already have a subscription the chance to move to a new server?  Servers cost a whole lot of cash, then there's the link to the Internet to pay for, staffing in Amsterdam ?  <br><br>Most of the people calling for a movelog will no doubt still play if it isn't, either on their existing server or start new on KB, so Sony will lose little revenue.  If its a new server, sure people that have accounts and want to start new will go to KB, which gains Sony nothing, but they have stated that Europe is an emerging market still. They obviously hope to gain new customers in Europe and if this is the case Sony will probably make this or another server a new non movelog.  <br><br>If you were starting new on EQ would you like to start on a server already overpopulated and where lots of people have equipment that you can never hope to gain (Ntov/Sleepers), I know I'd rather start somewhere where I had the same chance as everyone else of playing the top end of the game, where I would have a chance to get in a guild where I could do Ntov.  If you think you can do this on a server with a high 60's population then go try it on one of the established servers and you will have little chance to ever compete at the top end.  <br><br>On established servers, high end guilds are usually closed to recruiting most of the time and if they are open its only for specific classes.  They generally want people who know the end game already and have good high end gear to enable them to participate effectively.  New players to this sort of server will probably never see the end game and as a new customer if I knew this I wouldn't want to start.  <br><br>I can't say what Sony will do any more than the rest of you but making kb a movelog will certainly not attract much new business or retain any new subscribers once they realize that kb is a 'one horse' race that they can not win.  If Sony know what they are doing either this or the next Euro server will be new imo.  If KB isn't a new server they will probably lose more customers, people like me who do want to start afresh, and by the time the next server is available most of those who have left will have found something better to do and won't come back.  If I had to bet on it I'd bet it will be non split, but then as you all know Sony can be relied upon to mess up. <br>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/usllackblader.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sllack Blader</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 6:04:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fkanebaylecommunitycenterfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NOOO - hope this CSR guy is wrong!</span><hr size=1> I changed my mind.

Do you have some insider information you'd like to share?<br><br>The only evidence I can see supporting /movelog is a few posts, mainly by you.  AB was chronically overcrowded the day the /movelogs happened...if VI didn't care then I find it hard be believe they care much more now.<br><br>If it's a /movelog server, why haven't VI started the application process yet?  They gave people plenty of warning to get guilds ready to /movelog as a unit.  The last fresh server, Vazaelle, was announced and brought live within two days.<br><br>The European marketing push:  EQ demos on magazine coverdiscs, EQ Gold's release, double-page adverts in the gaming press; VI seem to be targeting the new player market in Europe.  This doesn't mean it will be a fresh server, but it certainly points towards it.<br><br>I can't see VI putting many man-hours into the newbie zone revamps if they didn't plan to release a fresh server in the very near future.<br><br>Of course, VI logic doesn't usually resemble our earth logic, so it's still possible KB will be /movelog.<br><br>It's also possible that the day /movelog KB goes live, a fresh server will be brought up also.
