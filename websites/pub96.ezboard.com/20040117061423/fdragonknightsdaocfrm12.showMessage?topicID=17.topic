More wonderful news from the IR dude...............<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just so you don’t think we are unaware of or are ignoring the “big” questions, here are the best answers I can give you right now. I’m sorry we can’t give you the solid answers on some of these things yet, but you will find out the final answers in the next several months (we are scheduled to release 3 months from tomorrow  ). Feel free to quote me in posts that ask these.<br>
How much with the subscription cost?<br>
This information is still being reviewed by the developer and publisher. Don’t expect an answer until we are closer to release. Please note, this is extremely commonplace to not make pricing announcements until the product is available to purchase.<br>
<br>
When will the product release internationally?<br>
The publisher, LucasArts, is still in negotiations with their international distributing partners. As soon as they have cemented their plans, they will make the appropriate press release.<br>
<br>
Final word on MCS/SCS?<br>
Like all decisions, things could change before release or even after release. Currently we are still planning on SCS. This isn’t new news by the way. We are still discussing options internally. <br>
<br>
What are the Minimum System Requirements?<br>
We are still testing that in Beta. We’ll let you know as soon as we are confident in the answer. We have a number of testers dedicated to compatibility testing with different hardware configurations.<br>
<br>
Since I can window SWG, can I open up a second iteration on the same computer with a different account?<br>
The last word I got from the lead client programmer was no, the client will bring up a dialog box stating, &quot;Only one instance may be running at a time.&quot;<br>
<br>
What is the final feature list for initial release?<br>
We’re getting that together. Expect an announcement early February. We will completely update the FAQ then. We’ll also discuss a little bit of our plans for the post-release update schedule. I’m working on getting another Dev Chat together to coincide with it. <br>
<br>
When does Beta 3 start? How many people will it include?<br>
When Beta 2 ends and as many people as we need to sufficiently test what remains – meaning, we don’t have a date to announce yet.<br>
<br>
When will we get more screenshots or a video?<br>
Sometime this month I hope to put up some more. I’ll also likely post some images that were only seen in magazines last month. I don’t have a date for another video yet.<br>
<br>
What about specific information on systems like P.A. member limits, etc.?<br>
We still have several weeks of Friday FAQs to fill. Please don’t make us reveal all of our info right now and have nothing later.  Truthfully though, you have most of the overview of the game now. Don’t expect any new systems in the Friday FAQs, they will likely be additional info that we have tested such as how many people can be in a Player Association.<br>
<br>
Blah blah blah blah Jedi?<br>
I’m certain we will release some more information on Jedi before the game comes out, but don’t expect much. We want to try to maintain the mystery of Jedi for now. Like all systems, we are making tweaks during implementation and internal beta testing. Since you don’t know much about the system, there is no point in mentioning the tweaks. (Ok, I know, I’m just being cruel now, I’ll stop).<br>
<br>
Have any NDA breakers gone to jail yet?<br>
In the few times that the NDA has been broken, we’ve tracked down all the information we could get and handed it over to our legal department. It is not appropriate for us to talk about it beyond that. <br>
<br>
What about MY question that you didn’t answer above?<br>
Did I miss any big questions?<br>
<br>
I know this truly didn’t answer any of the questions, I just wanted keep you up-to-date with the current answers.<br>

 What happened to the Shub??<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Rankin64, the shrub, brace yourself because it is not a happy tale, was reported as a bug. Every week we dedicate one day for each team member to fixes as many bugs as they can. In order to ensure the safety of the terrain artist, I’m not going to name names, but the Shrub was grounded. I’m sorry. <br>

 since beta 3 has been changed to more of a try before you buy stage rather than a true beta, does that mean more people will be allowed into beta 2?<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
SithAdvocate, we haven’t changed our goals of Beta 3. We’ve just recognized that not everyone will come to it understanding its purpose, so we need to make sure it has certain things a little more polished. <br>

 QUESTION: I have 2 boxes capable of running SWG in the same room using the same IP (through a hub). Will my buddy be able to play with his own purchased copy while I play with my own purchased copy? ie different serials, just same IP. Thanks<br>

 is broadband required for beta?<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Daddar, due to the size of our patches, it has been a requirement of Beta 1 and 2. I’m not sure if it will be of Beta 3, but I doubt it will be.<br>

What about a criminal faction for release Q?<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
R2TinCan, we would like to include the Hutt Faction at some point, but it is not scheduled for initial release.<br>

 Will Sony Station Store Sell SWG, and will I able to do preorder on SWG there? Like I do /w EQ:PoP… Or I must look for other Online Store?<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Stratege, I’m not sure if our agreement with LucasArts allows us to sell it on the Station Store. You will likely have to buy it at another outlet.<br>

 Will Max be somewhere in SWG?<br>

JediTool, I haven’t heard, but if I had I wouldn’t be allowed to talk about “easter eggs” because then they wouldn’t be “easter eggs.”<br>

 In my opinian your lack of a answer on the MCS/SCS question is just a &quot;cop out&quot;.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
MetalRogue, I have given you a very direct answer. I am not trying to stir the pot or string people along. SCS is the decision. People keep pressing us for a “FINAL, END ALL, NEVER CAN CHANGE” answer. That doesn’t exist for any design decision. <br>

 When does Beta 2 End?<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
CommanderRamius, Beta 2 ends in…waitaminute, you are trying to trick me… Seriously though, beta 2 ends when all the things on the list of “this must be completed before Beta 3” are checked off. This list includes things like new player tutorial working, servers stable at a certain percentage of the time, code stable enough that we won’t have to do character wipes during beta 3 (or at least infrequently), etc.<br>

Sorry if the answers sound like a politician. I really am just trying to be straight with you and there are some things that we can’t talk about just yet.<br>

All right, TDO_Cas, I can’t take the pressure. I tried to hide the truth behind the shrub by saying an artist moved it to the ground. Fine, I’ll admit it. The Force Sensitive Sheep ate the floating shrub! We thought to would be safe off the ground, but the sheep, well they have force powers you know, so they were able to get to it. There was nothing we could do.<br>
