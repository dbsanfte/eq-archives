I am Menludarja, the Guild leader.  We would certainly enjoy grouping up with you to see if you have shed the evil ways of the Iksar Empire and indeed seek to pursue the standards of good shown to us by Tunare and Brell.  The best way to get to know members of the guild is to attend our guild night on Friday nights from 9:00 EST till the last member falls asleep.  I realize you are too young for some of our targets, but perhaps we can arrange an outing where you can meet some of our younger members.  I believe Elmpe is the youngest current member of the guild.  Post a note in the Heartwood Tavern letting us know the next time and place you will be ready for an adventure, and I will try to make sure some folks of similar level will be there to meet you, perhaps one of them will want to be your sponsor.<br>
<br>
Thanks for stopping by, I look forward to meeting you.<br>

Hail, Ssartilian !!  Come join us for some drink and tell us of your deeds, both good and ill.  I, for one, have dispatched many of your kind, albeit for their evil ways.  But I will embrace you as a brother should your heart prove true to our ways.<br>

Maybe they are following me.  I wonder if Menludarja ever thought of that?”  <br>

We always welcome a new comer.  If you want twinking then you will be disappointed.  However, an ally to the trustworthy will always be found here.  Solusek Ro is neither good nor evil.  I have helped the Iskar and fought with the dwarven warriors.  The only difference is after the fight the dwarves still call me ally.  It appears the Iskar are harder to sway.  <br>

As for the orcs, my faction standing with them cannot get worse no matter what i kill. I can enter kelethin but alas, due to my races previous actions the merchants will not sell or buy from me..The banker as well still scowls at me as well as my guild leader Heartwood master for their pure hate of my kind..but besides these 2 all other wood elves only look at me dubiously which is a start but the guards will not help me either...therefore after 5 seasons in crushbone i returned to the Field of Bone for i still do hold strong ties with my race plus i need the money for my never ending weapon quest..But as i mentioned there is no desire in my heart to be &quot;twinked&quot; i just ask for help when convienent. As for dwarves the scattered guards in butcherblock naught but glower at me but i have not yet entered kaladim itself having no need to. I am currently in the lake of ill omen windmill at level 15 fighting goblins to gain faction with the city of the soft skins fironia vie as i would like to be an explorer as i have been up to now...Unfortunately i do not plan on leaving kunark itself  for quit some time because of banking and money reasons however i will willingly go anywhere i am needed and would like to build my high elf faction as i have heard it is a difficult task and my human faction as well as soon as level 20 in the blackburrow of the gnolls who i too dislike..although i may speak their tongue do not let this deceive you i would like to be on good terms with all races except for the dark elves whom i cannot trust...(/ooc however my playing time is again limited to weekends and fridays)  ....and one more thing friendsss i am afraid i will never abandon the legion of cabilis or the great god cazic-thule as i have to buy and sell and bank but also because i think he is still quite great in power... ( glancing at the human, ssartilian continues) even if he has let a few measly fighters vanquish him it is surely because he wants them to have a false sense of security..<br>
