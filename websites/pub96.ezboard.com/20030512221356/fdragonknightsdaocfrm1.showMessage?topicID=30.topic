<br>
I apologize to some of you up front having done this out-of-character. I wanted to get it out in Epic dialogue fashion but I'll do another take when I PL to a respectable level... Epic takes so damn long  <br>
<br>
Some of what follows has and will evolve over time as the guild grows and matures. If you haven't done so already I urge you to read the Charter at www.dragonknights.org.<br>
<br>
First and foremost this is a guild of friends. We help each other, we fight together, and we generally have as much fun as any game we happen to be playing allows. The really cool thing for me personally is that we have molded &quot;Dragon Knights&quot; from a very small guild almost 5 years ago and expanded the friends to include people from all over the world. When I say &quot;we&quot; I mean capital letters because I am only one of a very cool group of people.<br>
<br>
DK has evolved and gained strength. Now, to several of us, I know the guild title truly means something. To be DK means something. <br>
<br>
Dragon Knights are:<br>
    Fair<br>
    Just<br>
    Generous<br>
    Knowledgeable and skilled<br>
    Rational<br>
    Don't flame on boards or in game<br>
    Close knit<br>
    Kicking butt and doing things others want to do<br>
<br>
One thing about MMORPGs is that they really are persistent. Players that KS and generally act like jerks have to live with the reputation as long as they play that character. I've seen several cases of &quot;if so-and-so is included I will not.&quot; My list may even seem a bit silly, But without everyone in the guild respecting these values we end up as a guild that falls short because reputation can start with a single person in the guild and hinder us all.<br>
<br>
So how does this relate to bringing in new members?<br>
<br>
If we invite in a new member that doesn't live up to our ideals what happens? Look at the list again and think of the potential consequences if someone doesn't demonstrate the values of DK... What amazes me is the number of people who don't.<br>
<br>
As a guild based on friendship it is my intention to always try to include friends - especially real life friends who want to join. It is a major reason DK grew so fast in Camelot and will likely continue to do so. It is also a reason games are so much fun. <br>
<br>
At the same time we need to ensure that new members fit into the DK chemistry and we are a good fit for each other. NewMember01 meet DK, DK meet NewMember01. <br>
<br>
So, I'll cop out a bit and do a cut and paste from an original Charter section I wrote some time ago... Part of it is out of date since it was EQ, but this should help. Also, it was written when we were getting rather large and also well known with lots of applicants.<br>
<br>
&quot;<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
Joining Dragon Knights<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Times change... What once was, is no more - and in its place we strive to achieve something greater. We strive for something more complete and whole, more perfect...<br>
<br>
The Dragon Knights now stand as a proud symbol in our land. What once began as a small unity has risen to a mighty roar. The name Dragon Knights inspires many to rally at our side and push the evils of our land deeper into the shadows. Brave souls from across our world have proven their bravery and valor in battle. These warriors have proven devotion to our cause and have been welcomed into our fold where they proudly stand with us. In number we are numerous and with our unity we are strong.<br>
<br>
Now reaching to greater achievements we strive to mold and temper the steel of our friendship. This, so that we may pull even closer together in spirit - creating a bond no war, nor death, nor evil god may pull apart... With increased size is achieved strength - to a point. And at that point additional size becomes a weakness. A weakness that is, until the core of the warrior is again placed on the forge to be tempered even stronger still. <br>
<br>
In recognition of this cycle we are now choosing to severely limit additions to our guild so that this necessary part of the cycle may be fulfilled. All is not bleak however - for many weary travellers well deserve a place in our midst. A new cycle for acceptance has been enacted and, though the journey may be longer, still provides light in the lonely darkness.<br>
<br>
For those wishing to gain acceptance a Dragon Knight sponsor must be found. Our members do not take this responsibility lightly to be sure. I will leave it in your care to determine the best way to achieve this friendship and trust. Dragon Knights hold certain values in very high esteem, such as honesty, and it is these values which provide a basis for acceptance.<br>
<br>
Once a sponsor is found you should feel free to post your application on our message board. Be sure to include the sponsor and any information about yourself. As was custom before, it is still required that potential recruits join us on the field of battle. In battle the true nature of the warrior is revealed and it is the core of the individual we wish to know. <br>
<br>
As a sponsored applicant you are encouraged to attend raids and make every effort to team with our members. Actively seek Dragon Knights for company so that we come to know each other. In this rely upon your sponsor to make your introductions. If your sponsor is not available seek a member of the High Council. During this time our members will be invited to comment on your worthiness to join us. In this arena your past deeds may come to boost your effort or deny it. There is no set duration for this process except to say when we know you well enough your application will be decided. <br>
<br>
Please take heed, we take these steps to limit those who would join us. Few will succeed where others may lose interest. We do this for those reasons I have mentioned and no other. If you are denied acceptance it may well be that we open our doors to you in times yet to come. For those who choose to endure this process the rewards are great and in our midst may you find peace.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Sponsors<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
As a Dragon Knight you know the fabric that binds us and the quality of people who now fight at your side. Through the pain of battle you have learned to trust us, even though death may encroach steadily nearer. Even in the most dire of times we stand as one and endure. We seek the greater good in all things. <br>
<br>
Perhaps you find these qualities in another, not of our guild. If you come to trust them as you trust us, if you see the true heart of a Dragon in them - then you may stand proudly at their side as a sponsor. It is the wish of the High Council that you carry the title of Dragon Knight for at least one month before becoming a sponsor and that you only sponsor one person at a time. As a sponsor you are asking us to depend on them as we do you. <br>
<br>
In becoming a sponsor you are also accepting additional responsibility. A sponsored applicant likely does not know many of us - so we ask that you introduce them to others. <br>
<br>
If the appplicant is to attend raids or general activities they must know of such things. Please keep them informed and make every effort to include them as appropriate. Ensure that they understand our charter and that any questions they may have are answered. These things we place in your care until the application is decided.<br>
<br>
<br>
-----------&lt; end cut and paste &gt; -----------------------<br>
<br>
The process can be shortended depending on how well the applicant is known to our members.<br>
<br>
Here is a quick sequence of the process…<br>
<br>
1) Applicant posts interest in joining.<br>
2) For a period of time they group with DK and get to know us.<br>
3) During this time members are invited to comment and &quot;vote&quot; on the person in a password protected section of the board which is deleted when their application is decided. Generally they can vote yes or no and if no they are asked to post why.<br>
4) The members vote is a strong suggestion to the High Council but is not the final vote. Officers can decline to vote or vote yay or nay. A single nay from an officer is enough to decline the applicant.<br>
<br>
The scenarios for this can be as varied as the applicants, but it usually holds up as defined above. For example, a brother of a member is treated a little differently than someone completely new.<br>
