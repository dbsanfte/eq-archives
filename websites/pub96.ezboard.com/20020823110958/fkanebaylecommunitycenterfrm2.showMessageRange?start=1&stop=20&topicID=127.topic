I get a tell from one of my officers and they tell me they were KSed by a member of IV.  SO I go and get all the information from them and send a polite tell to IV's guild leader.<br>
<br>
I  inform him that I was told that one of his guild members was being accused of Kill Stealing the Ancient Cyclops.  He says he has not heard anything about it.  So I stated that would be because I didnt want to make it public and felt the two of us could fix this situation.  I inform him of the members name from IV and all I get in return is...ok.  Nothing else.  Basically brushed off.  <br>
<br>
Mind you if this was on Rallos Zek, this wouldn't be an issue. I'd have just found the guild member at that point and blasted his happy go nutty arse to his bind point.  But since this isnt PvP I have to use tact.  So I petition along with the guild members from TA that were involved.  A Guide comes on finally, and states that they will check the log.  They find that Those in my guild had initiated the fight with the AC before the IV member attacked, meaning, yes folks IV member did bad.  Now, the IV member has been forced to MQ the ac ring with one of the TA guildmember.  <br>
<br>
So, question is...if the Guild is all about rep, why wasnt this dealt with?  Is IV that type of Guild where KSing is acknowledged as a good thing?  I had heard some bad things about IV, but I heard some good things too.  This doesnt sound like a good thing to build a reputation on.  Any comments as to this?<br>

This I believe was a valid question. Might have fit better in Guild Discusion, but hey... Also could have dropped the guilds name to promote more discusion, but we are talking about IV here. :-) I believe you handled it properly for your side as the officer of TA. It would have better if it could have been handled without the guide, but that is their job. Krimzin should have forward the issue to another officer if he was busy. I think it is good that he has responded and is willing to make ammends. On the reputation issue... IV is not about making a reputation, but being the top guild on KB. Reputation is good, but not necessary. This does not mean they will not try to keep a good reputation, but that it is secoundary. Their reputation is mainly that they are at the top and the rest of use are not. (This is partially subject. This is a game and I try and keep a health life outside the game. Even if I could, I would not put the ammount of time into EQ to be in IV) What it seems to come down too.. IV is known as the ubber guild and when they are not busy with leveling/raiding (which is most of the time, Krim you are hard to get to in the game even when you are on), they will try and take the time to make things right. I have not had much dealings with them, but so far they seem ok. Mostly I hear people bad mouthing them just because they have gotten so far so fast. <p><strong><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=222206" target="_blank">Draznar</a></strong><BR>Halfling <a href="http://pub50.ezboard.com/beqdruids24038" target="_blank">Druid</a> on <a href="http://pub96.ezboard.com/bkanebaylecommunitycenter" target="_blank">Kane Bayle</a><BR><a href="http://pub84.ezboard.com/btruealliance76506" target="_blank">True Alliance</a><br>Tradeskills:

Why even start this thread? Are you trying to get more attention on the subject? Despite you not even naming the person who KSed you do name the person's guild and the leader. Its obvious who this thread was trying to be aimed at.<br>
<br>
You just seem to be upset that someone &quot;brushed you off&quot; so you start a thread to try and prove your worthiness. Who cares how you handled the situation, your guild member gets the MQ. What more do you want? Do you want a freaking medal?<br>
<br>
No I dont play much and I am not in a big guild or anything but I had to take a shit the other day and I did it on the toilet. Did I handle that right guys or should I have done something else?<br>

I have to admit that hunting him always makes me nervous.<br>
When he spawns for whatever reason the feeling seems to be he is FFA and in this case defined as he who does most damage.<br>
I have had guild leaders argue this with me telling me he is the exception to the rule.<br>
Sadly many Guides and even GMS agree with that.<br>
On Vazaelle the GMS there informed my wife more than once that the AC was open to who ever does most damage and we had to go to customer service to get it cleared up.<br>
The AC tends to bring out the worst in people, drop in, kill him, loot the ring, and then gate out hoping no one gets your name I think.<br>
There are guilds that keep people constantly in Sro farming him for their guildees and this creates quite a hardship on smaller guilds which cannot afford this luxury, so perhaps that is a big part of the reason this happens, not sure.<br>

He says he has not heard anything about it. So I stated that would be because I didnt want to make it public and felt the two of us could fix this situation. I inform him of the members name from IV and all I get in return is...ok. Nothing else. Basically brushed off. <br>
<br>
Mind you if this was on Rallos Zek, this wouldn't be an issue. I'd have just found the guild member at that point and blasted his happy go nutty arse to his bind point. But since this isnt PvP I have to use tact. So I petition along with the guild members from TA that were involved. A Guide comes on finally, and states that they will check the log. They find that Those in my guild had initiated the fight with the AC before the IV member attacked, meaning, yes folks IV member did bad. Now, the IV member has been forced to MQ the ac ring with one of the TA guildmember.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That looks like a fucking flame to me sir. You want to kill some members.. you trying to compare yourself to them, forget it. <br>
<br>
Also, what else did you want from the Guild Leader? A fucking cookie? Bake your own!<br>

You just got pwned! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/ublazoashaman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blazo Ashaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1135<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 7:54:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fkanebaylecommunitycenterfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How would any of you have handled this?</span><hr size=1> slight mild pwnage, but not quite 'pwned!' <p><p align="center"><b>-Blazo-</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Level 30, Heck Level Poster</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 9:09:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fkanebaylecommunitycenterfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Stax,<br>

You need to understand that there are different types of guilds out there, and they have different priorities.<br>
<br>
When you contacted Krimzin, not only was he leading a raid, pulling the raid -- and IV pulls faster than any guild you've seen -- he's also the leader of very active guild and has to deal with guild issues in tells constantly.<br>
<br>
If Krim took the time to explain to everyone sending him tells that he doesn't have time to respond, he wouldn't have time to do what he needed to do at the time.<br>
<br>
When contacting someone like Krim, the best thing to do is ask if they have a minute.  If you're ignored, you know that they don't, and you should try again later -- but not between 6PM-2AM EDT or you'll be out of luck on most days.<br>
