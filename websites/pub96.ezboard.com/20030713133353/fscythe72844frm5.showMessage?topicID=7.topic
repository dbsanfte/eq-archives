Basilone</span><hr size=1> Since i cant log on to EQ (error 0023)THought i might tell a story i got out of Leatherneck magazine magazine of the Marines about the real John Basilone.<br>
                      Story written by Bill Lansford a former Marine that served under John Basilone.<br>
<br>
 If my only purpose was to resurrect a hero,to glorify him for posperity,i would start by saying that John Basilone had a sense of destiny.But this would be silly.He had no feelings of destiny.No lofty speeches ever came from him to match his deeds, because he spoke directly &quot;dem's&quot; and &quot;dose's&quot; of a grade school education romped through in New Jersey.He was a good boy,became a better man and eventually acheived greatness.<br>
 I first met Basilone after the balance of our war in th Pacific had shifted.A victrious Marine Corps (Guadacanal,New Georgia,Bougainville,Tarawa)was adjusting to offensive tactics,which meantweapons like the 30. caliber machine gun.In 1944 after two years overseas with Carlson's Raiders,I was assigned to the formed Fifth Marine Division at Camp Penleton,Calif.,and it was there i learned that &quot;Manila John&quot; Basilone,Medal of Honaor winner,would be our &quot;gunny&quot;.By then,Basilone wa already a legend to all Americans.It's matter of record that a surprised first sergeant logged me in three under my 30-day furlough-and it was worth every day.<br>
 I'd suppose i'd formed some mental picture of Basilone.I can't clearly recall now,but there was a sense of brute strength and determination that went with thae famous name.Certainlyhis citaion suggested this.Everyoneone in America knew the story of that fantastic night on Guadicanal.<br>
 It had begun on Edson's Ridge in the final hours on 24 Oct. 1942.The daoly rain had ended,and having just completed a check of his guns,Basilone sat in his foxhole kicking off his shoes and socks because his feet were soaked and itched like hell.Suddenly the field phone hissed.Someone at battalion was blowing in the mouthpiece to attract attention.Basilone picked it up.&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br>
 &quot;Basilone? There'a a large jap force massing in front of your position.They outnumber you about a hundred to one.You've got to hold till we can reinforce.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Sure,&quot; said Basilone.As he hung up,the men around him raised there heads to catch the drift.Basilone slapped one on teh helmet.&quot;See ya in the funnies,&quot;he said,and without putting his shoes back on,he slipped out through the mudto pass the word.<br>
 The night was eerily quiet as Basilone rechecked his machine-gun section. All was shipshape.&quot;Basilone's boys&quot;knew how to use thier ponchos.The trick wasn't to stay comfortable,but to stay alive.The gunners were soaked, but their guns and ammo were dry.On th 'Canal an M1917A1 heavy machine gun with a cycle rate of 400-600 rounds per minute was a boy's best friend.It was Mom and Dad,and it beat the girl next door by a country mile,even if she baked teh best apple pie in Raritan,N.J.<br>
 behind Edson's Ridge lay Henderson Feild,about which the enemy had grown very touchy.For months,ever since the Yanks had pinned an &quot;Under New Management&quot;sign on it,the Japanese had kept livening up nights around the area.The night of the 24th promised to be even livlier than usual.<br>
 As darkness covered the jungle the jungle liek a blanket,Basilone's gunners squatted in their muddy hoels.Civilians influenced by the media invariably pictured the &quot;steaming jungles of Guadacanal,&quot;but many who served there still recall the cold discomfort of thier dungarees plastered to their bodies by chilly rain and the icy metal of their weapons as they lay in slimy mud waiting for the enemy to move.<br>
 Japanese tactics weren't varied,but they were spooky as hell. They'd start by toooting horns and whistles and shouting parroted threats likr &quot;Marine you die!&quot;Next they'd lay down a pattern of motar and artillery fire,and when that lifted,you knew they were ready ro bonzai.<br>
 Basilone recalled that night for me later<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> onchos off,machine-gun water hoses checked and tightened,new rounds chambered.And as the fires lifted,the Japanese broke cover,charging uphill in a full-scale frontal assault.<br>
 &quot;Awright,&quot;Basilone yelled.&quot;Give it to 'em!&quot;<br>
 Leatherneck machine guns thundered along the line,lighting their muzzles with tongues of fire,In the darkness below,the muzzle blast of Hotchkiss and Nambus replied, while from the slopes and ravines Arasakis flashed like fireflies.<br>
 After what seemed like hours of savage fighting,a runner stumbled in with bad news;Basilone's extreme flank was crumbleing.Both gunns were jammed.Only two rifle men remained alive. Yelling for his two runners to &quot;keep shooting!&quot;Basilone wrapped several belts of ammo about his neck and shoulders,grabbed a reserve machine gun and yelled,&quot;You other guys,come with me!&quot;<br>
 Trotting down a trail dodging small arms fire and grenade blastes,Basilone ran into an enemy patrol. Almost without a pause.he chopped them down and kept going.<br>
 Reaching the flank,Basilone set up his gun and begane a one-man fight that would last all night.Covered by his team.he repaired his guns under repeated attacks.When the Japanese broke through he used his pistol.Fireing one machine gun,Basilone would stop the charge,rollover to the next gun and stop another.<br>
When the water keeping the gunes cool ran out,Bailone had his men fill the gum jackets with urine.By midnight he was again down to only two riflemen,but he kept fireing until 0330 when his ammo ran out.&quot;You guys hold here!&quot;he yelled.<br>
 Shoeless and shirtless,Basilone drew his pistol and started up the japanese infiltration ridge to his battalion(1st Bn,Seventh Marine Regiment, 1stMarDiv)command post. Pelted by rain,covered with mud and amid mortar and small arms fire, he returned carrying nearly 100 pounds of ammo.&quot;That lousy last 100 yards!&quot; he use to say.&quot; I thought it would never end!&quot;<br>
 Rejoining his men,Basilone found that reinforcments had arrived.But the over-used guns had fired so long that the barrels were bburning out.&quot;Keep fireing!&quot; Basilone ordered as the Japanese launched a last,desperate attack.The machine guns glowed cherry hot,but he kept fireing,punching holes in the charging ranks.Finnaly it was to much for the Japanese.<br>
 As the faint light filled the slope on Edson's Ridge,evidence of the incredible battle began to appear.The feild was piled with enemy dead and discarded equipment.Around Basilone's gun lay 38 bodies,killed point blank.It was later estimated that 3,000 Japanese had thrown themselves at the Marine defenses,trying to plow their way into Henderson's Feild.Not since the Edson's Raider's battle of 12-13  Sept. 1942 on that very same ridge had anything like it been seen. A Japanese regiment had been all but annihilated.<br>
 The following June,Mr and Nrs Salvatore Basilone of Raritan recieved one of those rare letters from their Marine son.It was characteristaclly short:&quot;Dear Mom.Iam very happy,for the other day i recieved the Congressional Medal....&quot;<br>
<br>
Hehe I will have to finish the story later because i type very slow and it took me over and hour just to type this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Will finish the rest later.<br>
