<br>
The Darkstar Elite is a level 30+ light guild for all classes and both genders, dedicated to the assistance and advancement to the light races. DSE has many allies.  Our most important ally is Vindico.  Vindico was formed by Datajinx, the previous leader of DSE and now led by Walanie.  Vindico is our strongest ally and considered to be part of our family.  We in DSE, above anything else, we play with honor.  Any light race being persecuted by the dark races will be vindicated. Any DSE member PK’d by an unprovoked attack by anyone will result in retribution bearing down on the attacker(s).  We are here to experience the game of Everquest and see the many places, while creating friendships and loyalty to our comrades along the way. The added dangers of the dark just add a little extra enjoyment. <br>
<br>
<br>
Darkstar Elite Code of Conduct<br>
<br>
• Each member will respect and value the opinions of the other members of the guild, and present honor and integrity to the enemy and all other players.<br>
• X-teaming or grouping with an x-team player or guild is not allowed and is a guild removeable offense.<br>
• Power leveling for money or helping any dark or xteam player advance their character is not allowed and is a guild removeable offense.<br>
• Each member should be aware of the loot and scoot rule if PKd.  Retribution for being killed without cause will be allowed. Once retribution is delivered, the issue is over. Let the victim be and go your separate ways. Always act in honor and avoid gloating, badmouthing and other immature behavior.<br>
• Camping a corpse, bind rushing or purposefully experience killing a player will not be tolerated and is a removable offense.<br>
• There is a chain of command, use it. Learn it and follow it. You can expect orders to be given; leadership will expect them to be followed. Our future will depend on how well we work together and learn what your teammates will do before they do it.<br>
• Each member is required to read the guild motd everytime they enter into game.  A lot of important imformation is relayed to the guild this way.  There will be no tolerance for ignorance of what is written in guild motd.<br>
<br>
Darkstar Elite Raid Conduct<br>
<br>
There is an entire thread with the sole purpose of further explaining our Raid Conduct in the Attention! Message from your Guild Leaders section of our message board.<br>
<br>
• You will be ready in a timely manner PRIOR to a scheduled raid, either getting yourself to the raid or waiting at a reasonable spot for Wizard/Druid transportation.<br>
• You will be prepared as much as possible:<br>
1. Studied and/or printed maps of the zone or plane<br>
2. Brought plenty of rations, drink and reagents needed.<br>
3. Have the appropriate gear for the zone.<br>
4. Brought buff items such as stones as compensation for requested buffs or resurrections.<br>
<br>
• You will follow the orders given by your Raid Leader<br>
• You will use /Assist as instructed at all times. Have your /Assist hotkey prepared and ready to go.<br>
• You will be patient<br>
• You will not have wandering feet during downtime, have a seat and have a drink.<br>
<br>
New Raid Commands have been developed by Verant allowing us to have a single Raid group, instead of multiple character groups. All communication, loot and experience will be shared. Group leader will become obsolete and the Raid leader will have sole command of the Raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
Darkstar Elite Rules<br>
<br>
Most of these are going to be common sense folks, but are required to ensure the security and future of our guild. The good of the guild is more important the anything or anyone else, even your leader. Placing your guild mates before yourself is the highest form of honor and class within any guild. <br>
<br>
• Each Guild Member is required to make an EZBoard account for the Darkstar Elite Message Board with a name as closely resembling their DSE main character name as possible.<br>
• Giving your EZBoard password to anyone outside the Guild can be a removable offense.<br>
• Grouping with the enemy for experience or PKing will not be tolerated and will be grounds for immediate and irrevocable expulsion from the Guild.<br>
• Leaking or giving out sensitive Guild information is a removable offense.<br>
• Any action made which endangers the security of a raid or planned event by an enemy guild is a raid removable offense.<br>
• Letting non-guild members log on your character in DSE may result in action taken. Members of an enemy guild can and will use your character to spy, so please be careful of who you give access to. <br>
• DSE members will keep their Guild tag up at all times. The only time it may be down is you are in a zone that would cause you to be PKd because of your guild tag.<br>
• DSE is free to engage and PK any Dark or member of a Guild that harbors darks, i.e. Indignation, Pandemonium. PVP is a choice, not a requirement in this guild.  No light is to be killed unless you are defending yourself, your guild, your group or an ally. A retribution killing of a light in answer to an unprovoked attack on you will be allowed but must be announced.<br>
• Harmless communication will not be governed and is allowed at any time.<br>
• Begging is not allowed in Guild Chat<br>
• Linking gear and equipment to Guild Chat for the purpose of bragging is prohibbited.<br>
• Consorting with any character or player is allowed in any non-combat zone, i.e. Nexus, Bazaar, and Plane of Knowledge.<br>
• DSE Druids and Wizards may accept payment from any character for the purpose of porting and may group only for this brief reason.<br>
• All DSE Classes can Buff for pay in neutral zones.<br>
• DSE Clerics may accept payment from any character for the purpose of resurrection. Grouping should not be needed.<br>
• Honorable actions towards all characters are expected. If a dark requests a SOW for a CR and is naked and not a threat, show respect and assist. If an armored Troll Warrior asks for a Tumultuous Strength from a DSE Shaman, do not hesitate /Shrug and move on.<br>
• Minimum level to join DSE will be 30 for all classes.  Exceptions can be made for classes that we are low on and this rule can be changed by the Guild Leader at any time.<br>
