Well, let me answer that question. <br>
Our plan right now is to allow one character per galaxy and up to 8 characters on an account. We’ve taken this route for a few different reasons, the primary ones are to reduce the amount of muling in the game, as well as an attempt to reduce the number of characters made for the purpose of griefing.<br>
<br>
Muling is where a player will make an extra character just to hold stuff. They log in, they collect stuff from their primary character, and log out. We’re not big fans of muling - if we wanted you to have more objects, we’d increase the size of your inventory! But because other games give so many characters per server, it reduces the perceived value of the character slots, and encourages people to become packrats. <br>
<br>
Second, one of the common ways to grief another player is to create a throw-away character, harass your target, then delete the character. Because we’re allowing only one character per galaxy, it means that this type of activity will be greatly reduced.<br>
<br>
In both instances, what we’re trying to create is a more immersive environment. Reducing muling and griefing characters helps us towards this goal, and we think this will be an important step in accomplishing that.<br>
<br>
We realize one of your concerns is that you can’t try other professions but that is not true with our advancement systems. We don’t lock you into one path. You can chose many different roles. <br>

<br>
I have played a lot of Star Wars themed games, MUD's specifically and those also had the same thing.  1 character per player.  The reason they did this was because of spying and the ability to gather intelligence.  This also limits the number of force sensitive possible characters per server and ensures the character that a person is currently playing is a force sensitive one.  It would suck if someone had a force sensitive character holding all your garbage so you can sell it.<br>
<br>
There is another point that I agree with the SCS portion.  That end game politics where all you have is your honor will be even more important.  You can't just make some low level toon and go grief some other player.  I know we won't have troubles with a lot of the problems that stem from multiple character servers but it's a good way to protect the low level population and I think it's a good step.<br>
<br>
I do believe that their take on advancement really doesn't limit you on what type of character you play the only limitation is on what race you choose at the beginning be ready to stick with it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/bdragonknightsdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=terrelwildwood>TerrelWildwood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br>  Posts: 380<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/6/02 5:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Anti-Muling</span><hr size=1> This is actually the best thing I have heard so far.

<br>
And although they stated their reasons to the community which I believe have some legitimacy.  I believe the real reason for this is two (while not directly albeit) encouraging multiple account ownership to drive up revenues.  Which as a business model is not a bad thing.<br>
<br>
I just hope all the whining this one will cause will not have them buckle and give in.  Let's face it, even DAoC went from 4 to 8.  However, going from anything greater than to one to something else bigger is less of a change than going up from 1.<br>

<br>
quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I know many of you are very very upset by the announcement that we're planning on allowing only one character per server. So I thought I'd break this down for you a little more.<br>
The reasons to have more than one character per server are:<br>
<br>
In order to try out different playstyles and skill sets without giving up your past achievements.<br>
In order to treat multiple characters as one collective entity.<br>
In order to allow multiple members of the same family to play together with only one account.<br>
In order to be competitive with other games out there.<br>
<br>
The reasons why we intend to do single-characters per account are:<br>
<br>
<br>
In order to encourage interdependence.<br>
In order to reduce the impact of &quot;dabblers&quot; on certain professions.<br>
In order to reduce storage requirements.<br>
In order to reduce misbehavior and improve customer service.<br>
In order to block certain kinds of misbehavior more easily.<br>
<br>
Now, you may agree or disagree with each of these, but I thought I would explain each one from the devs' perspective so that we can have a more constructive discussion.<br>
<br>
MCS is needed to try out different playstyles and skill sets...<br>
<br>
We've gone to very great lengths to make sure that you can try out different playstyles--and even engage in multiple different playstyles simultaneously. You get 200 skill points right now. That's enough to fully master three separate professions plus half of another one. Put another way, it's enough for you to be a Master Image Designer, Master Marksman, and Master Gunsmith--actually, probably enough where you could go beyond Marksman and master Rifle Specialist or Pistol.<br>
<br>
If you instead chose to go for breadth, that's enough skill points to master the bottom half of every single skill tree available to a newbie. That would let you at least try pretty much every activity in the game except running a shop or factor, smuggling, or bounty hunting.<br>
<br>
In addition, you can always surrender skills and change the direction of your character. The only irrevocable choice right now is your character species, and the differences associated with that (which aren't THAT many, though there are some). If you're the sort of gamer that seeks to optimize everything, then you'll probably be frustrated that you made a Bothan, and he's never going to be as good at hand to hand combat as a Wookiee, true. But you CAN make that Bothan into anything that Wookiee is.<br>
<br>
...not without giving up your past achievements!<br>
<br>
Ah, the crux of it. There's many who have cited the idea that they get bored with their character, and want to go try something new, so they make an alt. But when they get bored with their alt, they want to return to the main character.<br>
<br>
Basically, this says &quot;I'd like to play the game starting over, but I want you to keep around all the past data that a character makes up.&quot; Well, that's storage space that someone else doesn't get to use, for one thing. It sits, inactive and unused, until you want to come back to it. Yes, other games have offered this. But it isn't as expensive for them as it is for us.<br>
<br>
You see, our characters are much more expensive to store than those of other games because we have a much higher degree of customizability. There's a ton of data just in storing your customized face. On top of that, there's more equipment slots that hold items. There's a datapad which holds data objects, which is a whole second inventory other games do not have. There's the inventory itself, which is larger than that of most games. There's the fact that we allow placing of structures on the map--and a single player can currently have around a dozen of them. And each of those can be furnished--which is more items. And what's more, they might have a vendor in them, which calls for a character with customization data and inventory and shop stock and price data and whatnot stored too. Oh, and you can run multiples of those. And let's not forget that each item is customizable as well--unique stats, custom colors, custom names. Plus you can have a pet that grows over time and that we need to store data on to. Plus a commodities market that is an in-game auction system, with all associated data.<br>
<br>
I'll say it flatly--a character record in SWG is FAR larger than you think. There's a business reality to see here. We share fancy databases over multiple servers. Said fancy databases cost $X up to a certain size. Then they cost ten times that if you go over that limit by one byte because you have to buy the &quot;next size up.&quot; As it already stands, our programmers are nervous that we're storing too much data per character. Heck, we got asked, &quot;You can live with 20 items in inventory max, right? 150 items total per character across the entire game?&quot; Do the math on the items stored with a character above, and start getting scared.<br>
<br>
I've seen some saying, &quot;Well, then instead of 1 character on each of 10 servers, how about 3 characters on each of 3 servers?&quot; Which leads us to the next major point made...<br>
<br>
MCS is needed to treat multiple characters as one collective entity.<br>
<br>
I have great sympathy for this point. In MMORPGs a character is like a &quot;mask&quot; you put on. You wear a different avatar based on your mood that day, what you feel like expressing to others. You play an evil PvPer when you've had a rough day and need to let off some steam, you play your tavernkeeper when you want to hang out... I definitely understand this.<br>
<br>
We should make clear that this has little to do with roleplaying--rather the opposite, in fact. Most of the people who argue this point are not going so far in their daily gameplay as to keep their alts secret. I've actually been down that route--I used to maintain a separate email address for an alt of mine, separate web address, and maintained fictional friendships and the works, but it was for the reason that I was a mud admin at the time, and really really didn't want people to know who my alt was.<br>
<br>
I also know that human nature is such that this is unusual. In practice, people do what many have said here: run multiple characters in one player association or guild. They play these characters as one person--the true identity behind the masks is known to everyone. Some of the samples I have seen posted here (and I am not picking on anyone, I am merely citing a few cases) are things like:<br>
<br>
<br>
keeping an alt around for a specific roleplay purpose in some tinyplot<br>
running a family of crafters to maintain a one-stop-shop<br>
running crafters or medics or the like to benefit a guild<br>
keeping alts around so that a guild can still have a full roster of characters for a high-level raid encounter<br>
With the exception of the first one, these are not roleplaying reasons, and we should stop pretending they are. They are all forms of muling, and they have various impacts on other players. Running a family of crafters to maintain a one-stop shop almost certainly means pooling storage capacity, for example, and it also means multiplying your production rate, thereby crowding out more casual crafters. Running crafters or medics to benefit your guild means that some dedicated crafter player with less time to play loses out on a market. Keeping alts around to flesh out a guild's roster means that less active guilds show inflated memberships (which keeps them from being forcibly disbanded for inactivity, btw) and also means that the guild has less need to expand out to more people, which means more guilds need to be made on the server (also increasing storage...).<br>
<br>
I've seen several people saying &quot;10 on one server is preferable to 1 on 10 servers.&quot; Human nature as embodied by the above examples tells me that with single-character servers, most characters will not max out their storage capacity. With 10 on one server, I bet they'd all be full up. What's more, stats on EQ show that people will fill up lots of character slots--the AVERAGE works out at almost 12 characters per player. How many of those do people actually actively play? Very very few. The vast majority of them--seventy percent--are level 10 or below. Obviously, a lot of these are legit. But a heck of a lot of them are certainly used primarily for storage.<br>
<br>
...but the rich can still mule!<br>
<br>
Yes. They can buy another account and mule away. And in turn their extra fee can help pay for the extra database server they're obliging us to buy. Is this a crass businessy thing to say? Maybe. But I'm being honest and realistic here.<br>
<br>
MCS is needed to allow multiple members of the same family to play together with only one account.<br>
<br>
This one strikes close to my heart. Believe me, I can relate.<br>
<br>
Now, looking at the legal reality, the fact is that the EULA disallows this. It disallows it in most of the games. Why? So that we can tell who actually did something bad. So that we are forming a legal contract via the EULA with one individual who is legally responsible. I don't know if you have any idea how much a pain in the neck it is to deal with a family whose account is cancelled because the 14 year old harassed somebody, thereby forcing us to ban grandma, two aunts, six sisters, mom and dad, and his elder brother who is away at college. Arguing this issue with the poor people involved over the phone probably not only eats up their entire monthly fee, but that of a half dozen other people, just in the CS costs.<br>
<br>
The fact is, if I want cable TV in another room, I have to pay for an additional cable outlet. If I want a phone for my daughter or heck, for myself in my office, I have to pay. If I want a second cell phone on my family plan, I have to pay. I have multiple computers on my home network, and I pay for the extra IP addresses. These things do incur extra costs for the service providers. The question is always &quot;are the extra free services going to garner more subscriber revenue than charging for the extras?&quot; Many are saying tonight that no, it's not, that we will lose more subscribers than we will gain extra purchased accounts, making this a net loss.<br>
<br>
Well, if it is, I guarantee it'll change. Biz realities are unforgiving. You either adapt and compete, or you die. Many have commented that MMORPGs are probably far too CHEAP for the market they are mining; when UO launched and set the monthly flat fee at $10, it probably lowballed the amount people would be willing to pay by a factor of two or three. Would all the subsequent games have gotten less subscribers? Yeah, probably. But the games would have been far more profitable, and that would have resulted in better customer service, more development attention, more content, and eventually, more and more diverse games for the customers. It's not all about moneygrubbing. Instead what we're seeing is that you have to get 100,000 copies sold to make your game viable in this marketplace at the $10 price point, and that is very hard to achieve--especially for boutique developers when the entry cost is in the millions of dollars and the recoup time is so long. But I digress.<br>
<br>
Multiple family members on one account, which does violate current EULAs, would in fact be people who are not actively playing together. It's not really analogous to sequential use of the one cable-connected TV or sequential use of one phone line, because individual characters do incur separate storage records. And what's worse, in order to circumvent the issues like the family with one person misbehaving we'd need to track each character separately--that's overhead, right there. Or heck, have you heard the stories about the eight year old who logs onto the game on the parent's account and get harassed, and then the parent calls us up? It doesn't MATTER that the parent shouldn't have let them in. Once they're on the phone, it's our problem and our dime and our CS queue getting filled up costing YOU your customer support.<br>
<br>
So if they're playing sequentially, and are in different age groups, odds are pretty decent that they have different social groups, and different play hours, and are in fact basically independent entities in the game. Well, the proper way to treat independent entities in the game is for them to be unique accounts. But failing that, separate servers isn't that onerous if the multiple players do not in fact have huge overlap.<br>
<br>
Let me state that I LOVE the fact that there are parents who play this game with their teens. I hate doing anything that gets in the way of that. <br>
<br>
MCS is needed to be competitive with other games out there.<br>
<br>
There's a different analogy that some people are using. That it's like having a cable TV that only gets one channel, and that if you want more, you have to pay extra.<br>
<br>
Curiously, that's exactly how my cable works. I currently pay extra so that my kids can watch the Disney channel and so that I can get Bravo and Sci-Fi. I've chosen not to pay extra to get HBO because I'd rather watch Sex and City or The Sopranos on DVD season box sets anyway. <br>
<br>
I'd like to think that SWG, as compared to other games, will have a wider array of &quot;channels&quot; that you get as part of your account. You can't &quot;watch them&quot; all at once, it's true, but you CAN switch between them. We're trying to offer a more diverse array of playstyles and activities within the game than other games offer. Maybe we won't hit the mark, I don't know. But we're sure going for it. Those playstyles and the increased degree of flexibility that SWG offers mean that it's simply more expensive to provide the service, in many ways.<br>
<br>
We're seeing other games move to a model with fewer characters. Allowing people to pile up 8 characters per server,as EQ does, is already obsolete--I believe all the newer games have launched with limits on the total number of characters. After all, nobody can actually PLAY 12 characters legitimately, there's not enough time in the day, so there's no way that isn't using up space and money that could be put to other purposes.<br>
<br>
Limiting people to fewer characters per server is also an industry trend. The notion of having alts is a fairly hardcore practice to begin with, and as games push out into the more casual market, and past the perceived entitlements of the harder core playerbase (and mind you, I am not saying that negatively, the perceived entitlements are perceived precisely because they WERE offered as part of the basic service for games) we'll find fewer people who need or want alts, or who think that paying extra for higher tiers of service is unfair.<br>
<br>
Speaking frankly about the competitive landscape--the next generation of games TERRIFIES me. SWG is actually being made pretty cheaply compared to other major MMOs that are forthcoming or which have already launched. (At least one MMO that has already launched and is doing somewhat poorly cost literally twice as much, well into double-digit millions; another forthcoming MMO has a dev team of over 100 working on it right now). The amount of effort that we have to expend to match the feature set of the games that are already out is incredibly daunting. And this generation of games is just going to raise the bar. If I started work on a new MMO tomorrow, I’d need to compete with what SWG has become three years from now.<br>
<br>
Not only do I not know how to do that in only three years, I’m POSITIVE that it will cost bucketfuls more money to do it.<br>
<br>
So I’ll tell you right now the industry trends I foresee: expect MMOs to get more expensive. Expect lots of ancillary revenue streams to appear: comic books, character upsells, special premium servers, action figures of your character, extra money for additional storage space on the servers, extra money for less populated servers or more real estate or whatever. Many of these things will be suggested, many of them will be tried, and I don’t know which ones customers will go for. I’m positive that people will say they’re being gouged, and I’m positive that many things will be tried that destroy game balance and allow the rich to dominate the servers, too. But without this extra revenue, and far greater penetration into the marketplace to widen the revenue stream, SWG is going to be as good as one of these games gets.<br>
<br>
So, competitive? Heck. MMOs are heading for movie-style budgets and movie-sized teams—with the audience size of half that of the lowest rated TV show on network television.<br>
<br>
OK, this sucks. Is there any upside?<br>
<br>
Sure. I gave a list of upsides we see, anyway. Now, mind you, I realize that many of these will not persuade you in the least. They’re intangibles, or they require that you trust us. Let me tell you, as a player I’d like multiple characters per server too. Unfortunately, I don’t get to look at things from only one side of the fence anymore. Hopefully, after reading the above, you are getting a glimpse of life on the other side, and the grass isn’t always greener.<br>
<br>
One character per server can encourage interdependence and interaction. <br>
<br>
“Agh! More forced grouping!”<br>
<br>
I’d prefer to think of it as a chance to get to know your neighbors. The fact is that something like 90-95% of you are unable to tell me the names and occupations of the people who live in the eight homes that lie adjacent to you: three across the street, three behind you, and the two on each side. In fact, a very large number of you have social circles that are built around your school or your job. Not only is this unnatural for humans, but it means that the groups you form are extremely homogeneous.<br>
<br>
As any biologist can tell you, homogenous populations go extinct very readily. As any teacher can tell you, exposure to different modes of thought makes for better citizens and better thinkers.<br>
<br>
“But this is a game! I’m here to relax!”<br>
<br>
Yes, you may be here to relax, but no, it isn’t just a game. It is a new medium of entertainment with its own rules. The fact that it is currently marketed as a game and sold to gamers is merely an indication that it’s still in its infancy. Massively multiplayer virtual environments are going to be bigger than the entire game industry (they may actually swallow up the game industry).<br>
<br>
But even seen as just a game, it’s the richer for the diversity of population. But a diverse population doesn’t help very much if every PA is self-sufficient because of its stable of mules, which leads to…<br>
<br>
One character per server can reduce the impact of &quot;dabblers&quot; on certain professions.<br>
<br>
In SWG’s case very specifically, we’re trying hard for a robust economy. Among the features we have provided is the means for players to reduce tedium by mining and mass producing goods while offline. A thing to therefore realize is that a mule is equally competitive in terms of extraction and production as a full-time crafter. This means that every mule means one fewer fulltime crafter who can actually ply his trade; the mule not only can compete in terms of goods, but has a captive market because he sells to himself.<br>
<br>
The result: the true crafters are frozen out of markets. Not having these alts means that there is room for more fulltime crafters, healers--basically, every role aside from combatants—and helps make these roles more profitable.<br>
<br>
Mind you, even with our current skill cap, you can check out and even master something like Image Designer on a whim, while still climbing all the way to Master Crafter or Master Rifle Specialist. We’re not at all limiting people to be “pure crafters.” There’s enough skill points there for you to easily do more than one thing with a character.<br>
<br>
One character per server can reduce storage requirements.<br>
<br>
I think I talked about this a lot already.<br>
<br>
One character per server can reduce misbehavior and improve customer service.<br>
<br>
Identifiability of a character goes a very long way towards preventing misbehavior. People are less likely to grief when it is their sole character at stake. People are more likely to trust others when there’s an established identity. Anonymity is the enemy of community ties. It’s as simple as that. This increases the link between a person and their actions, creating greater accountability.<br>
<br>
This should (and I say “should” because it’s not proven at this scale, though it has been shown to function this way in muds and the like) result in fewer calls to customer support. Fewer incidents of harassment. And that translates directly into shorter call queues, and less time before you get answered on YOUR CS call. In other words, better customer service. That’s the hope, anyway.<br>
<br>
Many are stating “but grief players will just use one of the character slots on another server to harass those people.” True, but that is already the case with multiple characters on a server as well. So it’s a wash. Will the incidence of it rise? Well, we don’t know, honestly. But I personally doubt it, because grief players are opportunists, and grief players are also people with networks of friends and the like. Just as you are stating that you will rarely venture to other servers because it’s too much hassle to shred your community in that way, so will grief players rarely venture to other servers for the sole purpose of harassing complete strangers. That’s my prediction, anyway.<br>
<br>
Then again, given that the average number of characters per EQ account is larger than the number of slots allowed on a server, I would venture to say that more people play on multiple servers than we tend to think.<br>
<br>
One character per server can block certain kinds of misbehavior more easily.<br>
<br>
I can’t block someone from getting a second account and still muling. I also can’t block someone from getting a second account, pretending to be your friend, getting permission to access your house, and then trashing the place because they were actually a member of a rival PA or an opposing faction and was doing it just to make your life miserable. (Something VERY similar to this recently happened to the lead designer of The Sims Online—go look back through their beta journals and dev digests!). I can’t prevent someone from having two accounts, one Rebel and one Imperial, and them using the one to support the success of the other via crossteaming. I can’t prevent people with multiple accounts from building an uber-PA, or someone with a second account botting one of their characters.<br>
<br>
But if they actually have to PAY to do this, then at least I’m collecting money from them to help pay for all the havoc they’re causing and the customer support headaches they are generating. Plus, I tend to think fewer people will do it, simply because they would have to pay to do it.<br>
<br>
Why do I always end up with a worse game because of the bad actions of others, or of some tiny segment of the playerbase?<br>
<br>
Ah, Virginia, I wish it weren’t so. Think of what we could offer you if none of the above problems ever applied. If multiple characters per server were never abused. If bandwidth and storage were free, and manna fell from heaven. Gnothi seauton said the Greeks, know thyself. We humans don’t work that way. And we developers have to work with the canvas given us.<br>

But here is my first impression and why I am so concerned..<br>
<br>
I spend a LOT of time developing a chr. I really do want to try a different profession but I DO NOT want to screw up my existing. So, in this scenario what do I do? I start a chr on another server...<br>
<br>
How hard is it going to be grouping with friends and getting everyone on the same server later on when we have all achieved higher levels?<br>
<br>
DAoC Scenario: <br>
Brin tell the guild, &quot;Is Thangore on?&quot;<br>
guildie tells the guild, &quot;Yeah he is playing Soullus&quot;<br>
Soullus tells the guild, &quot;Heya Brin&quot;<br>
Brin tells the guild, &quot;You wanna get Kalafax and come help us in DF?&quot;<br>
Soullus tells the guild, &quot;Sure let me log him on.&quot;<br>
<br>
SWG Scenario: Same conversation...<br>
Brin tells the guild, &quot;Is Thangore on?&quot;<br>
guildie tells the guild, &quot;Not seen him in several days.&quot;<br>
Brin drops the DF raid for lack of healer support.<br>
Meanwhile Thangore is actually just dinking around with a different character on another server somewhat bored and wishing for something to do like raid DF.<br>
<br>
In other words... HIGH potential for lack of needed classes, small groups, lack of guild cohesion and overall fun.<br>
<br>
Like I said I didn't read the whole post yet but I forsee this as my #1 concern in this case.<br>
<br>
I definitely don't buy the argument that its too much storage for more than 1 character - what a crock. <p>===================<BR>

As long as there is a consistent group of people playing together, they could make lots of combinations of characters on different servers.<br>
<br>
Trading accounts temporarily is another way to try different characters if you trust someone enough to do it.  I bet they will have a lot of problems with people trading accounts with people they don't know and getting ripped off.<br>
<br>
It might also cause a lot more selling of accounts since people will want to sell a character rather than just delete it and start over.<br>
<br>
They must have gotten a ton of complaints to warrant that war and peace explanation of the whole thing.<br>

And yeah the reply to that post got to like 17 pages before it locked there were tons of people unhappy with it, but about equal numbers happy with it.<br>
My only real concern about this game is I am getting the feeling it will be too easy, games are trending towards too easy and I dont like that at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=11.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=11.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.threadControl?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub96.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm4">Application to Join<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm1">General<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm10">Anarchy Online<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm12">Star Wars Galaxies<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm5">Character Updates<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm16">Planetside - General<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm17">Planetside - Members<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm19">EQ - General<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm20">EQ - Members<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm14">SB - Public<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm15">SB - Members Only<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm8">Events<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm2">Members<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm9">Captains<option value="dragonknightsdaocfrm3">Officers</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/bdragonknightsdaoc>Dragon Knights</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm12>Star Wars Galaxies</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3e<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
