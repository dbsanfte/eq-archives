What should I be putting my IP points in early as a Fixer. <br>

I'm guessing Range Int, Dodge CI evade, SMG, Burst, sense, AGI STR, STA<br>

How about Run or duck? <br>

How about the nano skills or nano defense. <br>

That one is KEY get it to 151 as soon as possible so you can grid and you should be able to have a max NCU of 104 with that same comp lit which is pretty decent and will get you into the low 80's.  Hopefully Brin will give you some advice on the fixer since he played one.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, hey Brin, I picked up my Yalmaha for 7m the other day, this was probably the single most game enhancing experience in ANY game.  It takes all the work out of getting from point A to point B.  I found one the next day for 5m but I can't complain, I love it and it only needed 233 AV to equip.  Now on to the 11m for the paint job. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/bdragonknightsdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vvidovvmakr>vvidovvmakr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/25/02 8:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Making a Fixer</span><hr size=1> <br>
K, gain some levels today, got a nice SMG in a mission and now I am just kicking butt. <br>
<br>
Question about armor though.. <br>
<br>
Say I get a helmet that requires me to raise Psy  to 25. Should I or is there another way I can get something to buff it up? Or is just raising it easier?<br>
<br>
I play on rebel side, but could reroll another character on the Corporation side. Though they remind me too much of Microssoft. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I kind of scrwed up and raised some skill to use a nano I got, then found out the hard way it was for soliders only. <br>
<br>
Doing missions seems more fun that tasks more camping a spot in DAOC and just leveling. <br>
<br>

<br>
In general don't spend IPs unless you are doing it to use something you have.. I always have many IPs available just in case I need a couple points to use a new cool item.<br>
<br>
Hmm let me see... Max SMG/Burst every level.<br>
<br>
Are you solitus? What is your character name? I can log in and help you with questions np - in fact I'll log on when I get home and see if I can find you if I know the name.<br>
<br>
One thing to decide as you shop and find items is what type of armor you want to end up wearing. Most armors have 2 stat requirements and it really helps conserve IPs to max as few stats as possible. If you wear a patchwork you will run out of IPs FAST.<br>
<br>
Personally I use Steel-Ribbed in its multiple qualities.. Obtru Steel-Ribbed is very nice stuff. Actually I have many extra pieces you are welcome to - we can easily find a neutral place to meet and do a trade. <br>
<br>
Yes you want comp lit for Grid access. I also like Map Navigation for loading maps and seeing mobs etc on radar.<br>
<br>
You might have noticed also that you likely have at least 1 respec point already. So if you mess up you can recover.<br>
<br>
Your hardest trade off as a fixer is spending points on Nano skills. As a Solitus all of them are blue - meaning expensive. Hmm can't recall the other class off the top of my head but its the skinny one - they have cheaper nano skills but less hit points. I am told that Solitus is better for the end game because you end up with good nano skill and good HPs, whereas for the skinny class you end up with points available for nano that you dont need and still can't max HPs.. So its a trade off for earlier levels.<br>
<br>
I personally use the Heal-Over-Time, SMG buffs, and run speed the most. For Blitzing missions there is no better combo than HOT and run...<br>
<br>
Evades are very important to you. Though duck is lowest priority of the lot. I am not sure if you have figured out implants yet but implants are the best way to boost blue skills and free up points for cheaper skills.<br>
<br>
I am just rambling I think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'll log in and see how I am spec'd - I have never used a respec since it was my 2nd fixer and he seems to be done nicely. I'll post the important stuff. <p>===================<BR>

<br>
Like take the Atrox Enforcer for example.<br>
<br>
His Str/Sta are green, so that's a good choice for armor.  His weapon skill as 2HB also rely on Str/Sta, Brawl rely's on Str/Sta as well.  This is why the Support Beam using Atrox really does well because he can be very efficient with his IP's as it takes care of both his armor and his weapon skills keeping everything maxed out.  Now the Atrox Enforcer does suffer with Nano skills but because of the above efficency he isn't totally gimped when it comes to the Nano skills because he has so much IP left over to spend on that sort of thing.  You put that same Atrox into duel wield one handed weapons and have them use fast attack and he is pretty gimped as those one handed weapons probably use those darker colored skills.<br>
<br>
Whenever I look at new possible combinations now, I try to look at the breed for what abilities are green/light blue and see if there is a weapon skill that matches it.  Doc's really don't have much of a choice of weaponry same with some of the other professions.  Whatever you use finding that light blue/green combo is a good idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/bdragonknightsdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ci>Ci</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>[GM]</span><br>  Posts: 851<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/26/02 2:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.dragonknights.org/ciaaran_head.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Making a Fixer</span><hr size=1> Ok I'll show my spec by skill tab... And remember I am a Solitus..<br>
<br>
Abilities: <br>
I am max in Agi/Sense (for armor) and Int and Body Dev. I max Int because it is a cheaper way to get my nano skills higher (raise them all a little instead of raising each one w/ skill points). I have almost nothing in Psychic - I would have zero if it didn't affect, in some way, other skills. Str/Sta are about 2/3 Agi/Sense. Different armors require different abilities.. I chose Steel-Ribbed so I have Agi/Sen.<br>
<br>
Body: <br>
Nothing trained at all...<br>
<br>
Melee:<br>
Nothing trained at all...<br>
<br>
Misc Weapons:<br>
Nothing trained at all...<br>
<br>
Ranged:<br>
Max SMG and Burst - nothing else trained.<br>
<br>
Speed:<br>
Ranged Init is high but not quite maxed.. I have several implants to help boost it. Dodge/Evade/Duck - all trained pretty high but using implants also. Dodge is highest, then evade, then duck lowest. I have decent points in Nano resist but I know this used to be bugged - not sure if it still is. It might not be worth training. My run speed is rather high but that is personal preference.<br>
<br>
Protection:<br>
Perhaps some values to shoot for.. At level 81 my resists are all over 2000 with the exception of Radiation. Imp/Proj is highest with 2444.<br>
<br>
Trade &amp; Repair:<br>
Only thing trained is Comp Lit.... Though over level 120 I hear it is easy to free up points for trade skills - and I always wanted to do weapon smithing and related skills to make my own guns.<br>
<br>
Nano &amp; Aiding:<br>
All my nano skills are pretty high except MattCre which is pretty low. I don't need it except for one line of nanos and will need it for Grid Armor if I EVER get it. In which case I would respec a couple abilities since I would no longer need them for armor.  Keep treatment high enough to equip implants for your level - 100.. The implant station will give you the extra 100 when needed. Plus the heal packs are nice to have. I have average points into First Aid for combat heals. I would go higher but my HOT does a nice job.<br>
<br>
Spying:<br>
I have decent points in Break&amp;Entering but not many of the others. They are fairly low - just never saw the need. B&amp;E is useful for opening locked chests and other assorted things like cracking open weapons and doing your Fixer Grid quest.<br>
<br>
Navigation:<br>
Don't train Vehicles unless you actually buy one.. Even then shop around and save for a Yalmaha <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would work up Map Nav for the add-ons like monster location on radar etc.. <br>
<br>
That's Ciaaran the fixer.. Give me a tell in game if you happen to see me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>===================<BR>

<br>
It sure sounds to me like Ci should have gone Opifex with that setup he has there.<br>
<br>
You are right with the abilities boosting things, and that's how people get into higher level armor and weapons, there are many ways to do it.<br>
<br>
But if you go over your skills by too much it will make whatever you have equipped turn red and it will only function at 75% of the equipment rating.  If you over equip REALLY bad it will be a 50% penalty.  The people that really understand how the stuff is done will over equip so that when they self buff that are just barely getting into the equipments maximum usage requirements.<br>
<br>
There are many ways to buff and you may see some people shouting it or in the shopping channel.  There are some ability buffs that each profession may have different ones of, there are Wrangles, and Mochams, wrangles buff all weapons abilities by up to a maximum of 137.  Mochams will buff the nano skills not sure exactly what those amounts are.  There is also implants making a set of implants just for one skill so you can put on a weapon or making them for some abilities so you can put on higher QL armor without looking for the right profession to come buff you.<br>
<br>
Over-Equipping really is an art in this game knowing what all you can do to max things is pretty complex. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/bdragonknightsdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ci>Ci</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>[GM]</span><br>  Posts: 852<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/27/02 8:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdragonknightsdaocfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.dragonknights.org/ciaaran_head.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Making a Fixer</span><hr size=1> Yes buffs will take you over max.<br>
<br>
The combat nano's I most use are (in order of priority):<br>
<br>
MG/SMG (supressor line)<br>
Burst (just general expertise is all)<br>
HOT (heal-over-time)<br>
Damage Add (like venom modification and nano boost)<br>
Run Buffs (which also add evades)<br>
<br>
After that my priority is in implants for extra evades and AC. Also, your damage output is based on your abilities (try shift-left clicking on MG/SMG in the Ranged skill tab).<br>

Try using a software tool called clicksaver - just search for it in google will probably find it. This will help you find god mission rewards and locations.<br>
<br>
2) Mostly I just go on stats. As for the strange items - no idea.<br>
<br>
3) Not sure.<br>
<br>
4) Oh first cool thing for fixers... Go to any store and buy a Nano Programming Interface and a hacker tool. I forget the exact order, but try picking up the hacker tool and shift-right clicking it on the programming interface. You should get an NCU Hacker Interface. This is a fixer only item that you right click on to make it progress to your level. It goes in your HUD2 slot - very nice item. Every time you level just right click on it and advance its level. Hacker tools are also used to remove the restrictions on items. For example, you might find a blister pack with an adventurer only buff - you can hack it (using same method I mentioned above for the programming interface) and remove the class restriction so anyone can use it. You can also open weapon receptacles (mission drops) which can later be turned into working weapons.<br>
<br>
And Ovarrd is right, my stats are more for Opti than for Solitus... So I might have some nice armor for ya <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
