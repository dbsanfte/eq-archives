Because I think it's time for a change. The NBG system, as it stands, is unacceptable. Everyone knows the most fair system is complete /random. In /random, everyone has the equal probability of getting an item that drops in a group. Unfortunately, we all want privledge. We all want the ability to say, &quot;Hey, I need that item. Give it to me.&quot; when something drops that we could really use. In most cases, I think everyone likes to see those people get the items, too. It feels good to know your group just outfitted another character and helped them attain something that they will use for a while.<br><br>Unfortunately, though, this system has its flaws. First, when people use the need before greed system (as it stands), those people get an extremely unfair probability of attaining an item to someone that doesn't need anything from the zone. If everyone needed one item from the zone, sure, the probabilities even out (if we say all the drops are completely random and of the same level of rarity). Unfortunately, this is not often the case. Let's take Velketor's for example...<br><br>In the upper spiders camp, some decent items can drop. A rogue piercer, decent wis caster shield, CC armor for melee types, and Crystalline spider eyes for casters (not including gems because of the fair equillibrium of drop). If we were to assign a NBG system to this camp, it is obvious how easily a tank could attain an item vs. a caster of any type. A majority of the pieces that drop are CC gear, so they have the highest probability of attaining an item, where as casters have the lowest. Yet, when the division of loot occurs, if no pieces for a melee type dropped, they still have the same chances of rolling as the other classes on extra drops at the end. I'm tired, so this isn't coming out well, so let me use an example.<br><br>A group of six in upper spiders consisting of a warrior/monk/rogue/wizard/cleric/enchanter exists. At the beginning of the group, each class says what they need. Awarrior03: I need any CC piece<br>Amonk04: I need any CC piece<br>Arogue02: I need the piercer<br>Awizard01: I need CC eyes<br>Acleric06: I need CC shield<br>Anenchanter05: I don't need anything<br><br>As it pans out, if a shield drops, cleric auto gets it, piercer, rogue auto gets, CC armor, melees get with roll if only 1 drops, and eyes, wizard gets. In each of these instances, it is as though the group rolled and in such case as the person needed the item, they rolled a 100 roll (in case of the melee with only 1 CC dropped, their roll would be a tie with necessity of reroll). Unfortunately for the enchanter, there is nothing he needs, so he has no preassigned 100 roll. Again, this makes little sense, so let me demonstrate with the group again.<br><br>GroupABC hunts in Velks for 3 hours. In their trials, 2CC shields drop, 1 piercer drops, and 1 eyes drop. Cleric gets a shield, rogue the piercer, and wizard the eyes. Then, in the current system, the group would say, &quot;For the three that didn't get anything, roll for the extra shield.&quot;<br><br>It is in that instance where I have the biggest problem. Had any CC armor dropped, those tanks would have gotten the armor no questions asked. Their probability, though no armor did drop, was higher than the enchanters for getting any drop. In this situation, I would have the piece defaulted to the enchanter. Why? Because his probability of getting anything was so far below the rest of the groups, that in order to balance it out, the enchanter should get the extra item.<br><br>Now some might say that this is unfair. In actuality, it is much more fair! Had it panned out that another CC piece dropped and not another shield, the enchanter would have had no chance on loot, whereas the tanks would have had the chance to roll. In not calling Need on any item, it should be that character who attains any extra drop. Were there more than 1 character to not need anything, those each would roll. Going back to our example, if 4 shields dropped, the piercer, and the mask, then everyone in the group would get a loot, but the default would be to go to the person with the least need called.<br><br>So in essence, what I am saying is that the person without need, gets priority on extra items. Why? BEcause their probability of getting an item is soooo low. I used an enchanter because it's what I played, but the same can go for any character. HAd I panned it out in the Hole and there was a race that wasn't able to use IGS, and didn't need any weapon drops, that person would have gotten the first default item had someone called need on the IGS's. <br><br>IMO, this system is much more fair than the current NBG system. The probabilities are still not as even as with pure /random, but they are smoothed out a little. I'm tired, so I don't know if I rambled, but I would like imput on whether people believe this system is more fair. I believe if you ponder it for some time, you will find it does have the ability to still accent the wonders of the current NBG system, yet allows those who normally get the shitty end of the loot spectrum a little higher chance to go away happy...<br><br> <p>Cheers,<BR>Zedd</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/umengina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Men Gina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Level 13, Advanced Beggar</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/02 4:41:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fkanebaylecommunitycenterfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG - Is it time for a change?</span><hr size=1> this is the type of greed that gets people into arguments.

Say we are grouped together in the Hole. Obviously an enchanter could use just about any piece. We fight there for about two hours, and with some strange luck, no loam drops but two Imbued granite spaulders drop. I'm not sure what race/class you are, but let's say the main tank can use the item, but no one else. Everyone knows an enchanter can use about any piece of loam from the Hole as decent gear at some point in time. Would it be right for the enchanter to roll on the spaulders? In the current NBG system, yes, the enchanter could roll. Yet everyone knows that same enchanter will be in the Hole again, and chances are much higher that a piece of loam is gonna drop the next time. In the system I'm trying to word out, the enchanter would not be able to roll on the extra IGS. Why? Because the chances of him getting an item were so high that the probability of any other melee class of getting an item drop was miniscule. By disallowing the enchanter from rolling on something other than what he called as 'need,' loam in the case, it would balance out the mathmetical probabilities of all classes having a fair shot at loot. Nothing to do with casters whining, or my greed for items or anything of that sort.

This system IS NBG! Yes, NBG! It just allocates the extra items to those who have a lesser chance on loot. My post was so long to try to logically explain this, as a proof may be in mathmatics, but that sums it up. NBG, with extra goodies going to those without a chance on loot rather than an all out random for extra goodies at the end.<br><br> <p>Cheers,<BR>Zedd</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/ubunnieburner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bunnie Burner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Level 2, Generic Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/02 12:14:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fkanebaylecommunitycenterfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> life can be worse</span><hr size=1> here's an idea,<br>accept what the group is doing.<br>Even if you're surprised to find out its FFA when you were hoping to get that FBSS, suck it in.<br>Because if it weren't for that group, be them greedy or not, you wouldn't be there, looking at a dropped FBSS in the first place.<br><br>Thank life that you're there, in a group, having a chance at an item you want...<br><br>Instead of being dead, deep down in Chardok due to a bug, and not having any GMs online and your necro friend died somewhere in DL and he's spamming you tells about finding his corpse because he's bound in PoM.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/ublazoashaman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blazo Ashaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Level 40, Thread Ninja</span><br>  Posts: 273<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/02 1:21:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fkanebaylecommunitycenterfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: life can be worse</span><hr size=1> yeah bitches, Im lfg like 346928364 hours a day, be happy you are grouped =(  <br><br>id love to see a rusty dagger drop, id shit myself silly~~ <p><p align="center"><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=221124"><b><font size="3">- Blazo Asha'man -<b/></font></A><BR><b>Lvl 29 Ranger of Tunare</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub96.ezboard.com/urian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Level 2, Generic Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/02 2:30:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fkanebaylecommunitycenterfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www2.netdoor.com/~mmerck/thirt.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: life can be worse</span><hr size=1> There isn't any rule that will always apply. <br><br>Loot award guidelines should vary depending on who you're grouping with - their class, group members' relationship to each other, how long members have been in the group at your camp, how much they contribute to the group's success, etc.<br><br>Full-out random is hardly fair in every situation, though it is completely fair in some.
