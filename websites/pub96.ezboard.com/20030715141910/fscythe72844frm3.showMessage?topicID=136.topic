On the MT Calender for May 29th, 8pm and posted in the gob raids forum. I scheduled us 72 hrs behind a Mithril Ankh PoF raid so if they clear the zone (named and all) everything should be up for us at start time. I will track some of them down the day after and make sure they did. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Major kudos to Halai for running a fantastic raid and to Eimi who had to have died at least 10 times and was only getting a 90 percent rezz each time.  I owe both of you big time.  Let me know when &amp; where, and I am there for you.<br>

Congrats Mojarda, time for us to start thinking about CoM. So, whats the minimum we can do the new Lord Rak with, will it require full gob support or can we get a cotl/ws/cm gang together? The last time I did him we had 30 or so and it seemed like major overkill, but I dont know for sure.<br>
<br>
Thank you Eimi for your tireless effort last night, I am glad we finally got to slay your new golem enemies that really liked striking you down from a safe distance for some reason. I am sorry for any exp you lost. The real success of the raid is definitely due to you and your pull team, you never brought more than we could handle and got the named to us in without adds, you all did wonderful!<br>

I never pulled Fear before and that was only my third time in the zone.  The dying was no problem.  It was not because I did anything stupid but it was all to help out Mojarda get along with his Epic.  I was actually laughing since it seemed to happen so often <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I had great fun and I learned quite a bit about the zone!<br>

<br>
I am sorry I missed out.  I will be able to raid on Thursdays starting in July, after softball season has ended.<br>
<br>
I am mixed on the Lord Rak question.  If we try and fail, we lose the tear.  So perhaps overkill is not a bad thing.  I am guessing around 18 folks with an everage level in excess of 55 would suffice.  Mojarda would know better given his extensive research on the subject on the Shaman boards.  With the advent of PoP and new abilities and levels, it seems some of the old world boss mobs are not so bossy anymore. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:maroon;font-family:comic sans ms;">Your Vicar,<br>

<br>
As far as Lord Rak'Ashiir I have been on 5 kills.  2 of the kills have been since they nerfed the ability of the fire pet to take him.  In all 5 kills, we either had a lot of overkill or we wiped.  Mostly because of his AoE DoT killing off support before the kill.  In taking him, you have to throw everything including the kitchen sink at him.  The key is to kill Lord Rak'Ashiir as fast as possible.  <br>
<br>
The first problem is Lord Rak'Ashiir has a damage shield.  I think it is a fire damage shield.  Still, a damage shield is unresistible damage for each hit to all melees.  To counter this some, attacks have used damage shields on the MA.  I never can remember which damage shields stack.  I know the crappy wizard damage shield is useless.  Maybe get a Mage/druid/shaman(?) thing going.  When done perfect, I think you can get your damage near 40 points a hit on the MA.  <br>
<br>
The MA needs to get agro FAST and keep it.  The wizards, clerics, and rogues will pull him off if agro is not gained and kept.  Remember, he has to die quick so the MA can't wait to get agro, they need it ASAP.  If he starts with a AoE and then the MA takes 15 seconds to get agro allowing a second AoE then the support people are hit twice with AoE for up to 3400 hitpoints of damage.  Every second counts.  Not to mention many a shaman has died at the begining to be rezzed for their epic drop.  This may have to happen, but if possible it would be nice for Mojo to see him drop.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The third and biggest problem, mentioned above, is his short lived AoE fire DoT. AoE's exact name is FlameSongOfRo. It is a short DoT that does 850 damage per tick for 2 ticks. In other words, when he firsts casts the AE, you lose 850hp, then another 850hp 6 seconds later. That is all, but only for each AoE. He AoEs every 15-20 seconds. It can be resisted. Resistance check is SVF.  Therefore, fire resistance is the key.  Many times the overkill simply means enough support people live to insure the kill quick.  An AoE every 15 seconds means the quicker the kill, the fewer AoEs, the fewer deaths.  <br>
<br>
One of the posts on Allakhazam addressed resists and the issue of Mage Fire-Pets being used to tank Rak.  During the September 4 2002 patch where they changed resistance across the board (including the pet using the owner’s resistance).  They also made FlameSongOfRo a -100 resistance check as opposed to baseline 0 resistance check.  Therefore a 100 fire resistance becomes a zero fire resistance against this guy.  I checked Lucy’s spell site and she agrees, there is a -100 resist check now.  Just an FYI.  <br>
<br>
Like Balomar said, overkill will help so we do not have to go back to Fear.  That AoE DoT is a wild card that can make him a single group kill or a full raid wipe.  I am a passionate supporter of  overkill.  The odds were 100 to 1.  And we killed the crap out of that stupid S*B.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Some claim that they have fought him within the last month or two using the fire pets and it worked fine as long as we BOA/HOV and FOS/HOS them first.  Others state that with a good 60+ tank can tank him just fine now with the new gear from Luclin, POP and LOY.  In this case, they suggest fire resist gear for everyone and a bard singing resists.<br>
<br>
I'd say post it and get as many to turn out as possible.  Raid buff everyone.  Cleric hits me with a CE and then I do turn in.  I stand there hoping not to die.  No heals on me but my own.  Send in the tank and fire pets.  Bard starts to sing.  MA makes assist call, and the melees engage.  At 50%, MA makes Nuke call.  No long range attacks  as we can't have him ping-pong and hurt the clerics.  Knock on wood, I'm looting my scale with five minutes of the turn-in.<br>
<br>
Next, I dance a little jig, vomit, then pass out from wave of emotions that'll hit me like a ton of bricks.  About five hours later when I wake-up, I go to EJ and do turn-in to Spirit.  And then...well, I go kill lots of things with my new weapon.<br>
