We all have a great opportunity to complete this portion of our epic, by nature of the spawn we can do this over and over for as many rangers we have that are up to this part of the quest.<br>
<br>
We will be passing Jaeil the Wretched on the way to the Shammie/Enc mob, and if we make it that far Jaeil the Wretched will be no problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This will be a triggered spawn, and you will need to be prepared to fight him.<br>
<br>
Jaeil the Wretched whimpers pathetically as his reflection catches his eye. He turns and stares pitifully at the ceiling.<br>
<br>
Jaeil the Wretched shields his eyes from his reflection in the water, occasionally gibbering as he scratches at a flapping, rotted patch of skin on his sunken face. In his arms he cradles something. He seems to emanate an aura of power.<br>
<br>
Stand behind Jaeil the Wretched to make him indifferent to you, then give him the Shiny Tin Bowl so that he will see his reflection.<br>
<br>
Jaeil the Wretched howls in anger, his body seeming to suck energy from the walls around him as he sees his reflection. He pulls a hammer from the bundle in his arms and swings fiercely at your head.<br>
<br>
Jaeil the Insane spawns and attacks. Kill Jaeil the Insane and loot the &quot;Soulbound Hammer,&quot; which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf. Jaeil the Wretched will still be there <p>

I still remember that i called this raid mainly for Clarrissa and Hurrk´s epic, and it went like this.<br>
started with 11 ppl, yep, thats not even 2 full groups. We had 2 chanters, one left at middle of raid, one monk (riphen who did a great job, and i never thanked him, sry Riphen hehe =P), 2 or 3 ranjahs, 1 warrior, 1 pally, 1 wiz, 2 clerics, and mr shammy.<br>
ok, we made our way down till the ranjah epic guy, took about 2 or 3 hours to get down there, and we were reduced to 7 ppl if i am not mistaken by the time we finally arrived to first goal. Clarrissa triggered her epic spawn, who btw took a major woop ass, i didnt even had to CH tank once.<br>
Then we proceded to the castle ent, took some more minutes, and this is where we made our fatal mistake.<br>
Instead of pulling the fort from inside to outside for the paladin epic guy, we entered the front yard, we holded there all the crazy roamers, btw we killed many many roamers there, they simply didnt stop coming for us, enc eventually ran oom, and everything broke apart.<br>
CR time...me and hurrk had allready scouted the zone with our bristlebane asslings (i would like to tell you, that u can go with the lvl 1 asslings all around the zone, even past rats and undead), so we logged into them again and pulled everyones corpses to the ent for rezzing.<br>
All in all, it wasnt that bad considering the resources available. But looks like wither i failed one of our main Goals, either Benadan was not in Guild at the time or didnt even know of this important accomplishment. Clarrissa and Hurrk were very reluctant that we could even get to the first spawn with only 11 ppl and no mage to CoH, but they trusted me. It is very sad that you now wish to mobilize much more ppl than what it takes to do it, and even worse, for your own personal profit.<br>
Well after some reading looks like Elomar still remembers what we did down there, he may teach you.<br>
About the epics, Clarrissa was the first EH member to get her both epic swords, unfortunatelly she left the guild very very upset the day when some Guild members refused the fact that they would need to give up of exp grinding in order to make guild advance. Then i moved to AB as i had told Hurrk and Kajira that i would, shortly after i see that the roster was very different, and unfortunatelly not for the better.<br>
The worst enemy of this guild is the mentality of their members, and the lack of class balancing, namelly clerics and available encs, the best of it is that some few members really love this guild above personal ego and gear, and i miss that part, for it is quite unique these days(The ppl i am talking about know who they are).<br>
<br>
Sidenote to Terranya....<br>

<br>
First, I was in the guild when hurrk made his trip to the Hole, but had RL commitments that would not allow me to make the meet time for the raid. <br>
<br>
Second, we currently have no one in the guild with their Epic. The plan is to increase activity on gettng Epics for the guild members. Before I started moving forward on mine I put it to the other officers for approval. The main reason mine is moving ahead is because of how close I already was to finishing it. <br>
<br>
Third, because of my background I plan raids in a military fashion. The primiary objective being Krin on this raid. Secondary objective is the Enchanter epic mob right there by Krin. Trinary objective is the Ranger Epic mob. I rank them in this fashion for one main reason spawn times. The Ranger mob is a triggered spawn while the other 2 are 4 hour spawns. My plan is to go in get Krin, then see if we have an Enchanter ready for that step of thier Epic, if so we get that mob while there. Then on our way out we stop and camp Jeail for all the rangers that are ready for that step. <br>
<br>
Fourth, we may be going higher than we need with the numbers, but you seem to be missing the fact that we also do not have the higher level people that went on the trip with Hurrk, so I am countering the lack of levels by increasing our numbers. <br>
<br>
Fifth, Hurrk did not get what he needed that trip. He in fact had to go back with Agony to get it. <br>
<br>
Sixth, Elomar did provide some good information and that has been added to all the research I have done on this raid. My rogue has traveled the route to Krin twice now, and I have spent time watching the wanders to confirm the route shown for them on my maps.<br>
<br>
Seventh, if it was not for the moral boost that getting an Epic back in the guild would bring I would not be moving forward in this manner. If anyone else were closer to getting thiers, I would be planning raids for thier Epics not mine. <br>
<br>
Eighth, I am assuming your mention of the castle is refering to the tower. The castle is before you enter the city, btw. You don't pull the tower. Instead you use ITU or sunskin and move past the ground floor, and up to where the epic mobs are. Then kill the room where Krindle ( enchanter mob) is. From there you pull the room across the hall. ITU or sunskin again and go to the room behind Krin killing everything there. You now have all the aggro mobs down and can take Krin and Kindle without adds. <br>
<br>
Ninth, I would suggest that had you done more research and planning you would not have failed no the raid you folks did in this zone.<br>

<br>
<br>
&quot;I rank them in this fashion for one main reason spawn times. The Ranger mob is a triggered spawn while the other 2 are 4 hour spawns. My plan is to go in get Krin, then see if we have an Enchanter ready for that step of thier Epic, if so we get that mob while there. Then on our way out we stop and camp Jeail for all the rangers that are ready for that step.&quot;<br>
<br>
From what i see of the groups we have we have one shammie, one chanter, one ranger. Ranger epic mob is on the way to both chanter and shammie mob. To me it makes more sense to do the Ranger mob first, then work up to the other mobs. we will not be waiting for respawns as there are no other chanters or shammies attending atm. <br>
Plus to pass and easy epic mob and not take it down with the risk of tpw getting to the next mob dosen't make much sense to me? <br>
And are we fighting out of porting out? again there is no need to hang around for respawns of chanter and shammie epic mobs, as we have none extra of those classes so why hang around?<br>
<br>
Maybe i'm being biased seeing I am the sole ranger it seems, but regardless to me it makes more sense to take mobs out in that order.<br>

That reason is we typically get alot of people just showing up at the raid who did not sign up in advance. We will get one shot at Krin and Kindle because of respawn times. The ranger spawn we can sit there and trigger repeatedly. Given the make up of the guild I see a very strong likely hood of additional rangers just showing up which means we will need to hit Jeail more than once, provided that is that they have the bowl to turn in. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That ordering is not set in stone though. If you are the only ranger present that is ready for that step then we will hit him on the way in.<br>
<br>
Hope that clears up why I took this approach.<br>
