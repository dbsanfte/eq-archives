Get an American Flag and tie it on your car or oustide your home to show your patriotism. My girlfriend incidentally bought a car near the 4th of July that came with one of those American Flags that attaches to your window. Shamefully, the flag was sitting in our closet as probably most people have a flag sitting somewhere. So I decided to put it on my car this morning. I work for a major financial company, you can't get into the parking lot now without ID. Well, this morning after the security guards checked my id, they were pumping their fists in the air when they saw the flag attached to my car, I have also had people shouting USA at me and beeping their horns. I know this might sound corny to some, but it was great to see the response of the people, and then I saw others including schoolbuses with flags attached to them. It was great to see the patriotism at hand. I consider myself to be pretty rugged, I grew up in what is considered the ghetto of Philadelphia, needless to say when I heard on the radio that they pulled 5 firefighters from the rubble 2 days later and I heard people cheering over the radio, I pulled over and just broke down crying (tears of joy that there were still survivors). <br><br>PS. Elstaf, don't worry, I am 27, my brother and all his friends are 19 - 20, we have not all lost our patriotism, as a teacher I hope that you are trying to educate the students on how important it is.<br><br>PSS. I used to date a Russian girl who works 2 blocks from the WTC, She used to say that the American Flag skeeved her because she saw it as a symbol of rich white protestant capitalism. I sent her an email today and asked her what she thinks of the American Flag now?<br><br>PSSS. As I was writing this, someone knocked on my front door to ask me where they could buy a flag.<br><br>Steepcrawl Scalestealth , SK of the 42nd Season    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1478A2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/utorgan1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torgan1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/14/01 8:52:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My post on the VCC</span><hr size=1> Its hard to think of something to say after events like that.
