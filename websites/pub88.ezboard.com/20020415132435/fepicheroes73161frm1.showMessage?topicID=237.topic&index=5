Was in a group in the Frenzy camp with my warrior when the server went down. When I finally could get back on which was about 2 hours later I logged into the area just outside frenzy room. There was not a soul to be found near me. So I called the train to zone. Being a warrior and not having a SoW there was but one way out, Run it. As I hit the jail area near safe hall there was a ranger who logged in and had his own train from near the lord room. All of these aggroed on me too. There was not a executioner group nor a bedroom group. Just one group at the zone. So to make a long story short, my froglock train started outside of frenzied room, had about 9 adds from ranger who died in jail, I ran through executioner camp area, passed ass/sup, passed the gargoyles and wizards on the ledge, passed skeletons, through bats and bedroom all the way to zone.<br>
<br>
Even though I called a train the zone group did not zone, they waited in hopes of getting a nice mob there at the zone. So as I went passed them and zoned they were anxiously waiting. The train was so large (one of the zone members said at least 40 frogs) that they filled the area between the zone group and the zoneline keeping the zone group from being able to zone out. They all had a horrible and quick death. Fortunately some of them had a good sense of humor since I called the train and congratulated me on the largest train they had ever seen.<br>

We were on a guild raid, i was one of the few melees left who couldnt invis them selves, so i got a invis, and started running. Lost invis by the time i hit near the pit where the skeletal monk, and the dark elf are.  Trained every frog from there to the zone, unfortunately, i died right near the zone area <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#7c96b9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/bepicheroes73161.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=graylance2>Graylance2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Pawn</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/21/01 11:22:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=237.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Epic Trains....Mwhahahahaha</span><hr size=1> Well my biggest train was... well not even caused by me lol. I was lvl 7 as my FIRST CHARACTER EVER (wow thats a long way back) and I was in CB. I was hunting peacefully by the enterance with my group when a shout goes out &quot;Train to zone!!! WATCH OUT!&quot;  Well, being the stupid n00b I was at the time, I shouted in reply &quot;Really? Does it cost anything for tickets?&quot;  Then someone shouted &quot;He's a goner!&quot; And I shouted &quot;Who's a goner?&quot; And at least 3 peeps said &quot;/sigh&quot; So I'm waiting by the zone for about 30 seconds, and suddenly I see what looks like a black cloud approaching me. Well, let me just tell you what was in that train. Actually its not that hard to explain. As a joke, the people went around the ENTIRE ZONE and aggroed EVERYTHING, including Dvinn the trainer the royal guard... the works. So I started typing &quot;Well theres the train, but why are Orcs riding it....&quot; but before I could finish my sentence, I was trampled in literally .000000000001 seconds. Ever have one of those times when your standing there and then the next second your laying on the ground watching endless amounts of mobs trample over your poor pathetic corpse? Well that was one of those times!  And it doesn't end there, no! My torture continues. I run back to CB and zone in only to find that gigantic train waiting at the zone for me. There was at least 50 corpses around the enterance to Crushbone, and I was marveling at the amount of Orcs and bodies when I heard &quot;Orc Stomp, Orc Kill&quot; blah blah blah. Well needless to say, I died. And by the end of that hour, I was level five again. What an adventure that was! But hey, I learned something useful that day! I learned what a TRAIN really is.<br>
   The only problem is... there are railroad tracks right down my road. Ugh!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=237.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=237.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=237.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=237.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.threadControl?topicID=237.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=237.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=237.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub88.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="epicheroes73161frm1">General<option value="epicheroes73161frm2">Guild Policies<option value="epicheroes73161frm10">Applications<option value="epicheroes73161frm21">Raids<option value="epicheroes73161frm14">Tank's Saloon<option value="epicheroes73161frm15">Caster's Library<option value="epicheroes73161frm16">Priest Retreat<option value="epicheroes73161frm28">Opinion Polls<option value="epicheroes73161frm3">Members Only<option value="epicheroes73161frm30">New Roster<option value="epicheroes73161frm18">Dragon Planning<option value="epicheroes73161frm7">Guild Events<option value="epicheroes73161frm6">Trade Skill Update<option value="epicheroes73161frm22">Epic Weapons<option value="epicheroes73161frm17">Flame Furnace<option value="epicheroes73161frm24">Epic Heroes Calender<option value="epicheroes73161frm8">Strategy<option value="epicheroes73161frm9">Quests<option value="epicheroes73161frm13">New Applicants<option value="epicheroes73161frm26">Wednesdays Warriors<option value="epicheroes73161frm4">Officers Only<option value="epicheroes73161frm20">Raid Leaders<option value="epicheroes73161frm27">Polls<option value="epicheroes73161frm5">Roster Update<option value="epicheroes73161frm31">Recruit Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/bepicheroes73161>Epic Heroes</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.epic-heroes.com">Epic Heroes</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
