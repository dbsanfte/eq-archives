Hitsmode Tutorial<br>
<br>
<br>
This latest patch introduced a wonderful thing, You can now move some of your battle damage out of your main chat area and into 3 separate areas. This in itself is a wonderful thing, especially for those that either have extra spam already (bard in particular) of for those that don't speed read fast. So I was quite excited to see how it worked when I was finally able to get online. What I found was more than a little confusing and the documentation in the Manual they provided was... sparse. After about 30 minutes of fiddling with it I was indeed able to understand it and get it to work for me. But I still have guild mates and other people that are asking me how it works.<br>
<br>
So, I am going to try to do a better job explaining How to use the /hitsmode. There are limits to my knowledge. I did not try to exclude arguments, for instance. Nor did I really explore the effect of the font size (seemed self explanatory to me) not the BG (background) argument. I am going to start with a general description of the what /hitsmode does and is like. Second I am going to (hopefully) define more clearly each of the term that Hitsmode uses. Finally, I will describe the process I used to get the widows up and running and where I wanted them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Description:<br>
<br>
To start with /hitsmode only effects 3 types of combat messages. It effects my hit messages (what the game says when I hit a mob), It effects my damage messages (that the game does when I get hit) and it effects the messages I see when others (players, NPCs) are hitting another (player or NPC). Your misses will still appear in the Chat window (unfortunately) but it still is better than nothing. YOU WILL NOT ALWAYS SEE THE HITSMODE WINDOWS! They will appear when you have messages in them. The messages will start at the bottom and slowly scroll upwards. I kind of like this feature myself, since I can put them in areas that I normally like to keep clear so that I can see more. However it makes fine tuning your placement real annoying since you need to either be in combat as you do this (and combat with something that can hurt you) or you adjust, go kill something, adjust, go kill something, rinse and repeat. I believe that it also only effects melee damage and not spell damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Definitions:<br>
<br>
Ok here is the main line for the manual's hitsmode explanation:<br>
Usage: /hitsmode &lt;my|me|other&gt; &lt;on|off|m2|m3|m4|m5&gt; &lt;X&gt; &lt;Y&gt; &lt;COUNT&gt; &lt;FONTSIZE&gt; &lt;HEADER&gt; &lt;BG&gt; &lt;WIDTH&gt; &lt;FORCEDRAW&gt;<br>
<br>
Each of those Items in the &lt;&gt; has to have something and it also has to have a space between each item. <br>
<br>
&lt;my|me|other&gt; The first Item is what messages it effects. As far as I know, you cannot have all three types of messages in the same window. You have to place them separately.<br>
&lt;my&gt; is the window that shows my melee damage to others.<br>
&lt;me&gt; is the damage that is being done to me. (this is still in red by the way.)<br>
&lt;other&gt; is what damage everyone else is doing to everyone else. be it mob to mob, player to mob or group member to mob.<br>
<br>
&lt;on|off|m2|m3|m4|m5&gt; The second term determines 3 things, first it determines where the messages are even displayed. It also sets whether the messages are in the chat window, or on the hitsmode windows. The third thing it does is determines how much info is shown within the hitsmode windows.<br>
&lt;off&gt; no melee messages of that type are displayed.<br>
&lt;on&gt; the melee messages are displayed in the old way in the chat window.<br>
&lt;m2&gt; puts same messages you used to see in the chat widow in the hitsmode window.<br>
&lt;m3&gt; Puts the Messages in the hitsmode window using a shortened form. The main difference between m2 and m3 is m3 leaves off the &quot;points of damage&quot; at the end of every message, making them shorter.<br>
&lt;m4&gt; Only displays the Numbers of the damage, not the type of damage<br>
&lt;m5&gt; only works for the damage you are doing to the mob, and just shows the type (crush, slash, pierce, punch) and the damage amount. Since you know what you are hitting, you don't really need more.<br>
<br>
&lt;X&gt; &lt;Y&gt; The third and fourth term I will talk about together. They are the Coordinates for where the window appears. These are in Pixels, I believe. If you are using 1024x768 screen mode, your screen is 1024 pixels wide, and 768 high. these are measured from the top left corner of the screen. The first term &lt;x&gt; is left right, the second &lt;y&gt; is up down. I have mine about one third up from the bottom, on the left side with just enough between it and the edge to have my spell gems along the edge of the screen. The coordinates I used were 55 510 meaning 55 pixels from the left and 510 from the top.<br>
<br>
&lt;COUNT&gt; The Fifth term is how many lines of the messages you want to see. In effect this determines the height of the window. You can show only one row (which will be scrolled off as soon as another hit happens) up to 10 rows. Like I said the messages start at the bottom and work their way up as new ones are added to the bottom.<br>
<br>
&lt;FONTSIZE&gt; Sixth comes the size of the font. It appears that this is relative to your main text font. Size 0 was really small. Size 1 was smaller than my main text, but still readable. Size 2 was the same size as my main chat text.<br>
<br>
&lt;HEADER&gt; Seventh is the argument for the Header. This will put at the top of the window a line saying what it is displaying. To me, this is overkill. we don't have the headers for any of the other windows in the game, why do we need this one? The Damage to me widow still has the text in red, so you won't mistake that for another. And you will be deciding which goes where, so you know what is what. Needless to say, I left the headers off. a Zero turns off the headers and a 1 turns them on.<br>
<br>
&lt;BG&gt; Eighth is the BG term. I believe that this decides whether you will see the widow shaded when you turn on the Full Screen Polygons. This is a nice feature, though not essential. I set it to on since it is a bit of a bummer having gone through all this work to set the text and not being able to read it.<br>
<br>
&lt;WIDTH&gt; The Second to last term is how wide the window is. As far as I can tell, this only effects the width of the window that is shaded when the Full Screen Polygons are turned on. I still see messages extending beyond the length of the background polygons that I have set.<br>
<br>
&lt;FORCEDRAW&gt; Finally we have the Forcedraw Term. (this was added after I wrote much of this tutorial) It makes it so that the background for the windows is always able to be turned on whenever you have the Full Screen Polygons turned on. This should make it a whole lot easier to adjust your settings, since you don't have to go into battle to see if you like the changes you made. I haven't experimented with this, but I expect it to be zero has this option off and 1 to have it on. Personally I am going to leave this off, since what I liked about the hitsmode window was that I didn't have to see it all the time and thus could put it closer to the center of the screen. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Process:<br>
<br>
I made socials to do the settings. Placing the windows is a trial and error process even since they added the Forcedraw. Forcedraw makes a lot of this obsolete, but I am going to leave it intact, so you can see the process. You will need to guess at where you wanted it, try it then adjust it again. I find, when doing this type of thing, that I forget what I had set last time. So I made a social for each window. The Command easily fits on one line of the socials window. As I adjusted I would type the new setting on the next line, so I could compare what I had done to what I am doing. Start with just turning the window on, I suggest trying these settings, just to start with:<br>
/hitsmode my m3 150 300 5 1 0 1 100 1<br>
<br>
Now that you have the first one started, go kill something. Notice where it is and how it looks, and decide what you need to change. Probably you need to move the window. So you go into the social and make a second line:<br>
/hitsmode my m3 100 400 5 1 0 1 100 1<br>
<br>
Now erase the first line and try it again. You will need to click on the social to run the command, of course.<br>
<br>
Go kill and try again. If you can find a mob that you barely hurt and does not really hurt you (at 30 I used a willowisp) you can even make a few adjustments during the battle. just be careful you don't get killed while typing in the social.<br>
<br>
I found that the hardest part was getting the window to the place I wanted it to be at. It was a trial and refine process. Try something and then refine it so that it was closer to where I wanted it. Try it again. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89090">Six</a><br>
