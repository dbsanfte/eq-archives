I will respond to Guyas post here.<br><br>Here are the events of last night as I saw them. <br><br>I logged in to BW right at Giant Fort where I camped the night before. I looked around and no one was at that spot. I did see a druid way around the back of the fort fighting a giant. <br><br>I buffed up and started to pull giants out of the fort. <br><br>On my second or third pull I noticed that Guyas was sitting near Maribrun. I assumed that he was just medding up for more pulls. (This is where I probably missed some communication from him, since all of his later communications were in /say and the white text does not draw my attention to the other computer screen as easily as the purple /tell text does.) <br><br>Then, Guyas starts pulling Giants again and roots one very near Maribrun. It was not close enough to attack her but it was making me nervous. (Also, I remembered that the previous night a druid rooted part of his train next to me, in attack range, as I was medding, and I thought this was the same person. If they weren't, the names both started with a G.)<br><br>I went to get another giant with Agrun, and when I come back Guyas has sat down to med right where I had been fighting. His giant is still rooted and dotted. I fight my giant in the same spot that I had been. Very close to Guyas, but I never lost aggro.<br><br>After those fights are over, he flames me in /say. (OK, if I missed some communication from him before, then I can understand some of his frustration, but at the time these were the first words I heard from him.)<br><br>I thought he was mad because he wanted to camp the giants and I started pulling from there. I explained that I had been fighting there for a while, over a month really, and it was common for more than one group to pull from fort. In fact, I am often the only one at fort pulling, and it is routine to have other groups come up and start pulling also. It never bother me. It just does not seem to be &quot;camped&quot;, because the respawn rate is fast and there are plenty of wandering mobs nearby to pull as well.<br><br>Guyas explained that it was OK for me to pull, just don't pull right on top of him. Now remember when I logged on, no one was at that spot, and I had killed a few mobs before he came back. (If he did initially address me politely and ask me to move it must have been in one of the /says that he said near Maribrun when Agrun was off pulling.)<br><br>At this time I decided to ignore him. I did not put him on /ignore. I just was not in the mood to argue, and from my side it was him that decided to sit and med right where I had been pulling.<br><br>He continued to pull Giants and root very near Maribrun and do his medding right in my path to pull from giant fort, and my annoyance was rising.<br><br>After a while of this I see Gullerback nearby on track and decide to kill him. I knew that there was a good chance that Gullerback would give Guyas a whack if he was medding near my pull spot. I routinely kill Gullerback for exp and occasionally Maribrun gets whacked when medding, then Gullerback goes right back to Agrun, so I knew it would be no problem to kill Gullerback without anyone dying.<br><br>The next sequence of events is kind of funny in reflection. Agrun pulls Gullerback in. Gullerback whacks Guyas on the way in. Gullerback reaggros Agrun. Guyas runs away from Gullerback and must have gotten out of aggro range of the giant he had rooted near Maribrun. Root breaks. Giant starts beating on Maribrun. By the time the giant is taken care of there is no time to heal Agrun. Agrun dies. Gullerback goes after Guyas. Guyas dies. Gullerback goes after Maribrun. Maribrun dies.<br><br>Maribrun is bound in Feerot near PoF portal. Agrun is bound in Field of Bone near Kaesora.<br><br>By the time Maribrun gets back to Burning Woods. Guyas is already rezzed and immediately flames me. We have an exchange of words. There was no swearing on either side. It was actually pretty civilized considering how mad we both were.<br><br>Now to wrap this all up. I will admit that I was stubborn and made some mistakes, but I do not think all of the blame of what happened is mine. We were both being stubborn and our deaths were a combination of both of us letting our pulls get too close to the other group. Some missed communication was also invloved in there as well.<br><br>I apologize publicly to Guyas for my part of what happened.  I am putting this incident behind me, and I wish you well.<br><br>Agrun/Maribrun <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1478A2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/uterranya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Terranya</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.henrythelab.com/terri/8anidot5b.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Admin/Officer/Webmaster</span><br>  Posts: 1599<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 6:48:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=471.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE: Last Night</span><hr size=1> Ack <br>It does indeed sound like miscommunication ag <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Sorry you all died though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><br> <p><a href="http://www.henrythelab.com/terri/sig/index.html"><img src="http://www.henrythelab.com/terri/sig/MediaQueen3.jpg "</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=471.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=471.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=471.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=471.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.threadControl?topicID=471.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=471.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=471.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub88.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="epicheroes73161frm1">General<option value="epicheroes73161frm2">Guild Policies<option value="epicheroes73161frm10">Applications<option value="epicheroes73161frm21">Raids<option value="epicheroes73161frm14">Tank's Saloon<option value="epicheroes73161frm15">Caster's Library<option value="epicheroes73161frm16">Priest Retreat<option value="epicheroes73161frm28">Opinion Polls<option value="epicheroes73161frm3">Members Only<option value="epicheroes73161frm30">New Roster<option value="epicheroes73161frm18">Dragon Planning<option value="epicheroes73161frm7">Guild Events<option value="epicheroes73161frm6">Trade Skill Update<option value="epicheroes73161frm22">Epic Weapons<option value="epicheroes73161frm17">Flame Furnace<option value="epicheroes73161frm24">Epic Heroes Calender<option value="epicheroes73161frm8">Strategy<option value="epicheroes73161frm9">Quests<option value="epicheroes73161frm13">New Applicants<option value="epicheroes73161frm26">Wednesdays Warriors<option value="epicheroes73161frm4">Officers Only<option value="epicheroes73161frm20">Raid Leaders<option value="epicheroes73161frm27">Polls<option value="epicheroes73161frm5">Roster Update<option value="epicheroes73161frm31">Recruit Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/bepicheroes73161>Epic Heroes</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.epic-heroes.com">Epic Heroes</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
