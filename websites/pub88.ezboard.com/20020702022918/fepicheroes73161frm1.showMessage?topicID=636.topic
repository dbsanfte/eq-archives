The last part is turning the casket of bones over to Simon Alcotte, at the WC lakeshore.  After multiple tries, by several people (we all know how well the dialogue system works), all failing to initiate the dialogue with Simon, I decided just to give him the casket.  Ten minutes of trying, what can I say.  All that happened is that I got the casket back and it was empty.  All the bones inside were gone.  I petitioned it, no surprise.  Myyanki answered the call after a bit and said the quest may broken, he would have a GM check it out and I could expect to get the bones back.  When, he didn?t know.  At that time the Simon NPC disappeared and we all wondered if it was being reset.<br>
<br>
For three days, I heard nothing.  I did re-petition to talk to confused guides who could only say they would move it forward to a GM.  Of course, without a dedicated GM for the server, who knows when a GM would get to the issue.  Sunday I finally went straight to a GM on-line, one Gm called Szaroka.  Amazing enough, he/she was capable of going back through the logs ( and they say that they can?t tell what was said or done? perhaps you should make a log at the time of the event?.) and told me that the quest works and that I failed to hit combine on the casket.  He/she then told me that NPCs do not return contents of bags, etc. and to kiss off, end of discussion.  <br>
<br>
Needless to say, I wasn?t happy.  What would it take for them to return the bones?  How much of my time must I waste going back through the journey across several continents and then once again into Phin?s lair?  Their lack of consideration was a real irritant and their demeanor in displaying it was even worse.<br>
<br>
Monday, I received the following email.<br>
__________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Greetings, <br>
<br>
I am Game Master Admin Jannaka. I see you have spoken with a GM about this issue. I wish you the best of luck in your adventures. <br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
 <br>
<br>
_______________________________________________<br>
Simply said? Kiss off, we have no concern over this issue nor are we bothered by your time investment.<br>
<br>
I am very tired of their poor customer service and their general attitude towards players.  Their game design is rudimentary, their support is poor, patches that work only partially or cause other problems, and they expect us to put up with it even though we are paying them.  So, I sent the following response.<br>
<br>
_____________________________________________________________________________________<br>
To Jananka, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
I thank you for the automated &quot;Go to Hell&quot; message. This is a fine demonstration of customer service your organization is renown for. Too bad it wasn?t automated, at least then your organization could have had some excuse for the customer service provided.  It is to this, that I would like to offer a bit of a commentary.<br>
<br>
For the most part, your customer service staff are petulant and dismissive, and on occasion, insulting.  The word ?condescending? is quite appropriate when talking about your staff and their relationship with the user base of your game system.  Upon occasion they are deceptive, but I hear that is more a policy to avoid having to help players with the games inadequacies.  The admission of aberrations or problems was never their strong suit. I would and could go into all the reasons I have come to this conclusion, but simply said, it has been derived from the actions of your staff, and from their conversations.  Far too many examples could be detailed, each in themselves giving proof to all I say. To do so would expend too much of my time without any benefit, as your customer service has been to date.  Your organization appears to have quite a perverse sense of customer support and little to no idea of player entertainment.<br>
<br>
I cannot include all your guides and GMs in this statement, because I have had some contact with, or have been told of a few GMs/Guides that recognize what their role needs to be.  Though, from what I have seen, and from what I have been told by current and former players, this is not the norm.  The majority of your staff does not understand that their role in the maintenance of the game is to be towards smooth playability and continued entertainment. Or is it the guidance of your company?s policies, and/or the game design, that is the true failure?  I wonder.<br>
<br>
It seems that most of your staff are either unqualified, untrained, or do not have the demeanor and troubleshooting skills required for customer service.  Perhaps, it may even be that they get so little support from the rest of the organization.  Who is to know all the causes for poor service?<br>
<br>
With over a decade of professional experience in such issues in the IT industry, I am sure can render a reasonable judgement.  From what I have surmised, from conversations with your staff and with other players, your organization constantly misleads the user base on their ability to resolve issues for them, refuses to maintain entertainment levels with simple support, fails to understand the motivation for most of the player base, considers factors that have no real bearing on the game, has a complete disregard for the user base investment of time, and in general, treats the user base with disdain.  More than likely I have missed many things here, but I am sure other players have commented enough that your organization can fill in the blanks, and I have little inclination to expend more of my time doing so.<br>
<br>
The only thing your organization is interested in fixing, is problems that stop a player from playing, such as events that deprive the player access to his avatar.  The inadequacies of your system are dealt with from the point of view ?Too bad, so sad?.  Instead of concerning yourselves with playability and maintaining the entertainment levels of your users, it seems that your customer service staff are only concerned with eventually removing the petition from the queue.  Although, I can?t understand why, since your organization has automated the deletion of petitions from the user base.  It is nice to know you are interested in your user base.<br>
<br>
Now, assuming that you get a response before you have to log or the petition timer runs out, Guides are relatively useless as their only interaction seems to be to tell the player that they will note it and perhaps the player should wait for the GM.  Seeing that the GMs are fewer and fewer these days, it seems like players are looking for things to do while they wait for a response.  A response which will unlikely be timely, nor will it be positive, as it will likely require more time on the player?s part to achieve what the time investment should have done in the first pass.<br>
<br>
Is this all some insidious machination done to increase the time a player must spend playing your system, and thus, paying more for nothing?  To me, this seems like it would cause the reverse.  More players will quit because of the lack of customer service and for the poor support of weak game design.<br>
<br>
I wonder if your staff has quotas for petitions/problems that they have to resolve?  It could explain for the fly by night attitude, where dismissal with some poor excuse about game balance, economy, etc. is used.<br>
<br>
I also hear that your organization is having staff problems.  Is this the reason for so few GMs and the to movement to one GM for multiple servers?  Talk about downsizing customer service.  It can?t be the money considering the sheer volume your organization takes in and the recent increase to that with the increased charges put in place.<br>
<br>
I find it is interesting that the quality of service your organization is providing would lead me to send off this commentary.  I have run across various things in my time using your system, most I just write off to playing your game, but some have perturbed me and the cavalier attitude this time around is irritating.  This recent problem could have been solved easy and with positive response on my part, if your customer service was customer service. The resolution to my problem was simple, and yet, the tardiness of your organizations response and the demeanor of your responses, made it an even bigger issue.<br>
<br>
The solution should not been beyond the grasp of your staff.  The statement your staff should have made was the following. ?The declare functionality of the return of goods by NPCs does not work completely or in all circumstances. Given that a mistake was made in the initialization of the last phase of the quest the casket was returned empty.  Had the instructions been provided by the NPC, and you followed the instructions to press combine on the casket, the quest would have worked.  Since our patch to return goods incorrectly given to the NPC doesn?t work in such situations, where the goods are contained within a container, we will update your inventory to make allowances for this.  We are seeking to rectify this in the future.? Simply said, your patch does not work in all cases, the one case declared by your GM, Szaroka, being the contents of bags given (who knows how many other failures there are), and you should returned lost inventory in such events. Regardless of anything else the inventory items should have been returned.  Instead your GMs, were dismissive and told me essentially ?Too Bad, So Sad.? I would say GM Szaroka, and the person who sent this email, Amy McCrary, aka. GM Jannaka, failed to provide the appropriate customer service.  <br>
<br>
Customer service has failed when a user perceives that his time has been wasted, both in playing the game and in attempting to reach some level of achievement that has been denied, and in waiting for a response that is negative.  Overall, I wold say that dealing with you customer service begins with negativity and ends with negativity.  Any expert will tell you that customer service cannot be considered successful with negative conclusions.<br>
<br>
Beyond customer service, what evaluation of your game system could I offer?  After a year and a half of playing and with years of exposure from my friends playing your system, I can say that your system appeals to the lowest levels of the RPG genre.  Your overall design is typical of the genre twenty plus years ago, circa 1978 to be precise.  I can speak from a position of relative expertise, from being in the genre for over two decades.  Even some off my friends are published and well known in the RPG industry.  So I can say with reasonable certainty that you should expect see a mass migration from your game if any competitors make any advancements. <br>
<br>
I cannot say that your game does not have any redeeming features because that would be unfair and not entirely true.  It helps that you were amongst the first in providing this state of product and that the competition is so weak as to look to only match what you have done.  More than likely that won?t last.<br>
<br>
But I will say that your game system has many problems and the attitude of your staff compounds them.  Is your organization, an organization that relies on its customer base to be suckers for punishment?  Do you think that people are addicted to playing and won?t respond to poor treatment?  Your current direction of customer service would suggest that.<br>
<br>
It is for all these reason that many of my friends, and a few acquaintances, have quit your game.  Primarily they have quit because of your customer service. The failures of your game system they could have dealt with otherwise.  Without customer service there was little to moderate those failures. I find it quite interesting that your organization has such a bad customer service attitude considering the money you receive from the user base patronage. <br>
<br>
Given your organization's track record and my current experiences, I must admit I am contemplating the same.  Before I do so, I had wished to present this commentary, on principle and without any expectations that your organization will change, or even respond.<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
<br>
By the way, I am making the content of this email available to the many people I know who play your system as a consequence of your attitude as an organization, and the general lack of professionalism and uselessness of your client support staff.<br>
