I've played on Rallos Zek for most of the time and just recently started Eyandin on Vazelle. <br><br>Symbols<br>Everyone wants them. I've been in group where the whole group would want me to give them one. The fact of the matter remains though is that not all of them need a symbol. At the upper lvls when you receive Naltrons and Marzins Mark each cast costs you almost 10pp (more for other clerics that are not as sexy as I am). The only people that need the symbols would be your main tank and the enchanter your with. The enchanter pulls aggro like nobodies business and the extra hps it can give your main tank will help make CH more mana efficent.<br><br>Death Pact line<br>I've never had much of a use for these spells and haven't ever been in a case where I've seen them worked. In concept it could potentially save your pullers life or your main tank or enchanter. I'd say only cast this when your going into an iffy fight each cast costs a pearl (4pp) <br><br>Heroism line<br>All I can say is when I received Heroic Bond it was a godsend. Just one cast and bam everyone was buffed it only gets better as you get your group symbol spells and AC.<br><br>Shield line<br>These spells cost hella lot of mana to cast so I usually only bother to cast it on the main tank myself or my enchanter<br><br>Healing<br>This is where we shine of course. CH is a useful spell but almost all clerics will have backup heal aside from CH such as superior, remedy, divine light (my favorite), and celestial line. At 54 my cleric keeps up CH, Divine Light, and either celestial or remedy. Just a reminder though with CH its not always good to let your tank get down to 1 bub of health before you start to let it go. I've waited this long only at times and an unexpected turn of events like a mob add came in and doubled the damage on the poor tank and then there was no chance to get off the CH or anything else for that matter. If mana is a problem go ahead and wait till hes 1 bub, but if you have a bard or enchanter with you giving you mana regen go ahead and heal the tank at 2 bubs of health just in case something does happen.<br><br>My cleric on Vazelle is now 36 and closing in on 37 I've slowed down quite a bit in my lvling finding it hard to get groups. I've found that the Dreadlands is where mostof the players congregate. I've gotten numerous groups there but the xp is slow. I guess I'm just used the days on RZ when I was lvling grimcrag in lguk and solb all day long getting the good xp. If any of you have any suggestions on a good place to hunt at 36 go ahead and leave a reply here to my message. Well thats my 2 coppers worth and if you happen to see one of the Starbreeze brothers online give us a tell and say hi =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1478A2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/ujoseydm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Josey DM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cleric Officer</span><br>  Posts: 498<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/3/02 9:43:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few helpful suggestions</span><hr size=1> I totally agree with all your points Eyandin.

When not grouped if not when grouped anyways?<br><br>reason i ask is that sometimes the wizard in the group could root, but hes trying to burn down the adds fast, the enchanter died mezzing, and that druid over in the corner is afk like always.  Also while i know cleric nukes are not the most effecient, but having a stun up to interrupt a spell or having a nuke up to get the mob to run range (hopefully snared) would seem to me to be more mana effecient than only healing.  Also when you look at cleric nukes, from what ive seen they have a slightly longer cast time than others their level, and a largerecast.  This seems to me to indicate a once a fight nuke designed to save mana, instead of a fast-cast, normal recast time that is used in chain casting. <p><hr><br>Sladen Moonbeam the Wizard<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46929>Mana Gear</a>  <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65652>Resist Gear</a><br>Master Teleporter<br>Husband of Filya Moonbeam<br>"A Wizard is never late... nor is he early.

In my opinion stun &gt; nuke for a cleric. When a mob is stunned its taking damage and isnt beating on your tank. If I'm FM I will toss a stun in almost at the start of the battle and another when it recycles. I've found while chaining I would use 1 Sheal per 1 1/2 pulls. I use less mana chain stunning for those pulls than I would healing. Resists are what get you here though. One resist throws everything out of whack and most likely gets you aggroed. While travelling I keep gate,root and atone up all the time. Root, atone combo is wonderful for the travelling cleric. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#7c96b9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/bepicheroes73161.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hatchetface>hatchetface</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Pawn</span><br>  Posts: 164<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/02 10:54:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few helpful suggestions</span><hr size=1> Also in the rare instance I solo, its usually against undead.

We now have a faster cast time on all nukes and a longer refresh time. Overall we cant nuke any faster or slower but this does mean we have a greater chance of channelling our nukes if we ever get into a situation where we have to do so. Undead nukes were not changed for some reason.<br><br>CHeal is the devil pure and simple. Words cannot express how much I hate that spell. Though its a necessary evil I'm told... bleh.<br><br>I only ever stun when the mob is at 70% or below the higher level stuns have evil taunt and though they are a DD really dont last that long for their level IMHO. I don't understand how lvl 49 Paladin can stun for 10 seconds and Sound Of Force (49 cleric stun) is at best 6 seconds. Also some people really hate you using these spells as they have a knock back component. I'd use the lvl 9 stun if it was worth loading it for the 3 seconds that its effective. If you are fighting casters then just let a tank bash them its often far more effective since casters generally resist stuns more anyway.<br><br>Root/Enstill/Immobilise are a line of spells that should never be unmemmed by a cleric in my opinion. Both when grouped, travelling and soloing they will save your life. All have an even chance of &quot;tick breaking&quot; (as stated by VI) so it really doesnt matter which you use as they all cost bugger all in the way of mana. Oddly enough Immobilise (he higher level one) has the shortest cast time and the longest effective duration.<br><br>One other thing about roots. When you do root a mob make sure everyone else knows it so they can move out of the way. Also if someone is still beating on your rooted mob make sure they know that they are now a mana sponge and will be getting no more heals until they assist the MA and let you get on with your job.<br><br>There's nothing worse than someone switching targets and gaining aggro with the wrong mobs in order to &quot;try&quot; and save the cleric. Thats what we were given root, DA and DB for in the first place. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28162>Daerv Karasu</a><br><a href=http://www.epic-heroes.com>Epic Heroes</a><br><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/bepicheroes73161>EH EZBoard</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#7c96b9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/ueyandin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eyandin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/7/02 5:56:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few helpful suggestions</span><hr size=1> I would recommend keeping Enstill memorized. Immobilize is fast bust I find it gets resisted very often and it breaks early constantly. Enstill I like because it seems to park the mob very well and doesn't break all to often. I don't usually have a stun memmed but sometimes I will have my nuke memmed and if I have enough mana will plant a nuke or two on the mob just for fun. As far as melee skills are concerned I would recommend keeping these skills up just for when your soloing and the mob is low health and you just need a little more damage to kill it while its running away. oh btw I always keep my Divine Aura and Divine Barrier. It seems once you cast these on yourself you instantly lose the mobs aggro and it goes and beats up on your tanks. So it saves your life and lets the tanks do their job of taunting and building aggro on the mob. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1478A2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/usladenprismbeam.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sladen Prismbeam</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Evocationist</span><br>  Posts: 744<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/7/02 9:12:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few helpful suggestions</span><hr size=1> Enstill parks for a while and is lower level so resisted less.

While both root, immobolize and fetter all have about the same duration (not referring to tick timers, which are random), the chance of breaking on a specific damage nuke is smaller.<br><br>The enstill/paralyzing earth line gives a MUCH longer duration, but will break usually if anything over a 100dmg hit is given to the mob.  These spells are good for parking adds, which will not be hit until ready, and also for DoT work, as the initial damage on most DoTs, especially splurt type DoTs, is small at the start and the subsequent ticks do not factor into the breaking of the root.
