<br>
Meeting site will be outside unrest at 12 EST (9am PST)<br>
I appologize if people think I am being a hard a$$ on this one, but this zone has to many unique dangers for people to go blindly into. Last time Lasalle and I took a large group into this zone it was chaos, because of a lack of knowledge about the zone.<br>
<br>
Communications: Raid and group leaders will be using OOC for commands and communication, stay off it. General conversaions between group members will use the shout channel so the leadership can filter it out and prevent alot of scroll. If you have questions ask your group leader, they will answer the question or relay it to the raid leadership. This is mainly to prevent a flood of tells which slow things down.<br>
<br>
Filters: Everyone should have the following settings for the raid. these will help prevent lag and LDs.<br>
/serversidefilters on<br>
/showspelleffects off<br>
3d sky off<br>
<br>
Supplies: The 2 big supply items that will be needed are peridots for the clerics, and fish scales. <br>
<br>
The plan is to place groups in the following locations:<br>
Bubbles Room ( 3 )<br>
Estrella's temple ( 8 )  <br>
Temple of Prexus ( 9 ) <br>
Seahorse caves ( 11 ).<br>
<br>
<br>
The items this little hunt is likely to yield are:<br>
9. &quot;Temple of Prexus&quot; with Undertow who drops <br>

<br>
The purpose of this raid is to get as much as we can for the membership. The raid is being limited to the areas the hunting group has been working in and has gotten to know. <br>
<br>
This raid will be open to all 35+, we will take people below 35 as well BUT that is at thier own risk! I want to stress the risk for casters under 35, since while medding you cannot see your buffs, and will have no warning if your book is covering that blinking Endure Breathing icon. <br>
<br>
Everyone should take the time to read <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.allakhazam.com/Phreekittys_Ultimate_Guide_to_Kedge_Keep.htm">Phreekitty's Ultimate Guide to Kedge Keep </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
Some of the key points from the guide are:<br>
You must get used to &quot;thinking vertically&quot; while in kedge. Access to rooms are often through the ceiling or floor, and when entering a room for the first time, be sure to check overhead, as danger may be hiding in the ceiling. <br>
Kedge is like no place you have hunted before, there are problems you will encounter, and tactics that must be employed, that are unique to this underground dungeon. <br>
<br>
FIGHTING IN A &quot;VERTICAL&quot; DUNGEON <br>
<br>
Kedge Keep is a &quot;vertical&quot; dungeon and is unlike anywhere else you have fought in Norrath. A few words should be said about this at this point, because it is an extremely important point that should not be overlooked. The addition of a third dimension poses many unique and unexpected problems for newcomers to Kedge. One of the most common problems, and potentially the most deadly, is the way spell effects and monster aggro is calculated along the vertical z-axis. <br>
<br>
Some of you may have had some experience with this problem if you spent any time during your 20's fighting in the Aviak Village in Southern Karana. The problem would usually manifest itself in this way. You sneak up on a solitary Aviak Rook, who is minding his own business just outside of his hut, high up the ramp to the main tower. Luckily, the other ten players who have also spent the last three hours running up and down the ramp looking for something to kill, are nowhere to be found. It is just you and the Rook. You sneak up behind the Rook, give him a slap, and turn to run down the ramp to your waiting party. Suddenly, however, you stop in your tracks. Looking down at your text window you see that you have been stunned by an Aviak Avocet , yet its just you, the Rook, and some druid named Dorkle, way up high on this section of the ramp. As you run to the Lake Rathe zone exit with your new bronze breastplate shining in the Karana sun, you come to the realization that creatures on the ground can aggro you and hit you while you are on a platform hundreds of feet above them. <br>
<br>
This little wrinkle in the physical laws of Norrath applies in Kedge as well. Because Kedge is a &quot;vertical dungeon&quot;, this could pose problems for you if you are not careful. If you are in a room with a tube in the floor, such as the EAST ROOM on the second floor, be aware that an area of effect song could pull things from the rooms below you. Area of Effect spells have their place in Kedge, just be aware what is above you and below you, and you will be fine. <br>
<br>
There are, however, no runners in Kedge. Instead, the problem of runaway pets manifests itself in a slightly different way in Kedge, though the results are just as deadly. It is rumored that Verant nerfed the Kedge inhabitant's ability to run, and disabled all fear spells in Kedge because of the pathing problems that exist there. What Verant failed to do, however, was to disable the player's ability to charm the inhabitants of Kedge. Herein lies the problem, and a dilemma for those with the ability to charm. <br>
<br>
FEAR - The inhabitants of Kedge Keep are immune to fear type spells, and never run from a fight. Therefore, summoned pets work well, as you do not have to worry about them chasing down a runner, and pulling the whole zone upon you. There are some spells that are not in the fear line of spells, but have a secondary fear/flee effect. They include spells such as Flash of Light and Sunbeam, which temporarily blind your enemy and cause them to run. These spells should be avoided when in Kedge, as they can override the ban on fear and can cause some of the largest trains you will ever see in Kedge. <br>
<br>
Kedge dwellers are immune to cold based spells, and seem to be less resistant to electrical based spells, though this later fact may be superstition based on the belief that water conducts electricity well. Fire based spells work very well in Kedge Keep. Area of effect Spells can be very dangerous and are generally avoided in Kedge, unless you are aware of what is in the rooms above and below you. <br>
<br>
LOATHING - Quiz time. What single inhabitant of Kedge Keep is capable of doing 10,000 points of damage to a group of twenty five Level 50 characters in the blink of an eye? Phinigel Autropos? Estrella of Gloomwater? No, not even close. [bold]The only creature capable of this kind of mass destruction is that cute little Shimmering Sailfin that you occasionally see swimming around the various rooms of Kedge. These innocent looking little fish sometimes explode upon death, causing 400 points of damage to all players within radius of the blast. [/bold]Kill one of these during a close fight with Phinigel and see how often you are invited back to Kedge Keep. You have been warned. <br>
<br>
There are various types of Sailfin in Kedge Keep: Cobalt, Cerulean, Emerald, Crimson, and Shimmering. The chromatic Sailfin are under level ten, while the Shimmering Sailfin are in their low thirties, and will occasionally pick a fight with low level characters or their pets. All sailfin drop fresh fish and the all important fish scales. For this reason, they are harvested by players who need to continually cast Enduring Breath. If you plan on killing these fish for their scales, be aware that they are place holders for the rare spawning wandering Stingtooth Piranha. If you continue to kill sailfin, you will eventually see these tenacious piranha patrolling the corridors in place of their less sinister cousins. If you are hunting for experience, you can use this to your advantage by causing xp-giving Stingtooth Piranha to spawn. Just be sure to avoid the Shimmering Sailfin at all cost. If someone in your party engages one, have everyone else move away to avoid being caught in the area of effect blast. <br>
<br>
Everyone on the raid needs to make a social that says<br>
<br>
ENDURE BREATHING!<br>
ENDURE BREATHING!<br>
ENDURE BREATHING!<br>
<br>
Three lines minimum, all 5 lines is perfered, just so it does not get lost in any scroll. <br>
<br>
[bold]A point that cannot be stressed enough is that Kedge is underwater! AFK = DEATH. If you have to go AFK, don't walk run, and have some one refresh your EB before you do just to be safe. Rezes if needed will be very tricky. We need to have some one ready to cast EB as the person pops in, so coordinate any rezes carefully.[/bold] <br>
