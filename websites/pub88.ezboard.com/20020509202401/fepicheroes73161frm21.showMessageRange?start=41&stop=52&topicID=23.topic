I am extremely sorry for the misunderstanding.  The raid is scheduled for tomorrow, November 3, Saturday.  I was looking at my schedule book for next week for essays due in school when I posted it.  I am so embarassed!!!!  <br>
I have updated the heading of this post.  To all those who need to back out, please post promptly, we'll remove you from either list.  Once again, the guild raid on Kedge Keep will be THIS SATURDAY, Nov 3, 2001, at 9pm EST; we'll be meeting at the Gfay/bb zoneline (in Gfay, to bind).  <br>
<br>
Lasalle<br>
&quot;I'll make it to zone, np!&quot;<br>
A Blood Reaver hits YOU! For 450 damage!<br>

Access to rooms are often through the ceiling or floor, and when entering a room for the first time, be sure to check overhead, as danger may be hiding in the ceiling. <br>
Kedge is like no place you have hunted before, there are problems you will encounter, and tactics that must be employed, that are unique to this underground dungeon. <br>
<br>
FIGHTING IN A &quot;VERTICAL&quot; DUNGEON <br>
<br>
Kedge Keep is a &quot;vertical&quot; dungeon and is unlike anywhere else you have fought in Norrath. A few words should be said about this at this point, because it is an extremely important point that should not be overlooked. The addition of a third dimension poses many unique and unexpected problems for newcomers to Kedge. One of the most common problems, and potentially the most deadly, is the way spell effects and monster aggro is calculated along the vertical z-axis. <br>
<br>
Some of you may have had some experience with this problem if you spent any time during your 20's fighting in the Aviak Village in Southern Karana. The problem would usually manifest itself in this way. You sneak up on a solitary Aviak Rook, who is minding his own business just outside of his hut, high up the ramp to the main tower. Luckily, the other ten players who have also spent the last three hours running up and down the ramp looking for something to kill, are nowhere to be found. It is just you and the Rook. You sneak up behind the Rook, give him a slap, and turn to run down the ramp to your waiting party. Suddenly, however, you stop in your tracks. Looking down at your text window you see that you have been stunned by an Aviak Avocet , yet its just you, the Rook, and some druid named Dorkle, way up high on this section of the ramp. As you run to the Lake Rathe zone exit with your new bronze breastplate shining in the Karana sun, you come to the realization that creatures on the ground can aggro you and hit you while you are on a platform hundreds of feet above them. <br>
<br>
This little wrinkle in the physical laws of Norrath applies in Kedge as well. Because Kedge is a &quot;vertical dungeon&quot;, this could pose problems for you if you are not careful. If you are in a room with a tube in the floor, such as the EAST ROOM on the second floor, be aware that an area of effect song could pull things from the rooms below you. Area of Effect spells have their place in Kedge, just be aware what is above you and below you, and you will be fine. <br>
<br>
There are, however, no runners in Kedge.  Instead, the problem of runaway pets manifests itself in a slightly different way in Kedge, though the results are just as deadly. It is rumored that Verant nerfed the Kedge inhabitant's ability to run, and disabled all fear spells in Kedge because of the pathing problems that exist there. What Verant failed to do, however, was to disable the player's ability to charm the inhabitants of Kedge. Herein lies the problem, and a dilemma for those with the ability to charm. <br>
<br>
 FEAR - The inhabitants of Kedge Keep are immune to fear type spells, and never run from a fight. Therefore, summoned pets work well, as you do not have to worry about them chasing down a runner, and pulling the whole zone upon you. There are some spells that are not in the fear line of spells, but have a secondary fear/flee effect. They include spells such as Flash of Light and Sunbeam, which temporarily blind your enemy and cause them to run. These spells should be avoided when in Kedge, as they can override the ban on fear and can cause some of the largest trains you will ever see in Kedge. <br>
<br>
Kedge dwellers are immune to cold based spells, and seem to be less resistant to electrical based spells, though this later fact may be superstition based on the belief that water conducts electricity well. Fire based spells work very well in Kedge Keep. Area of effect Spells can be very dangerous and are generally avoided in Kedge, unless you are aware of what is in the rooms above and below you. <br>
<br>
 LOATHING - Quiz time. What single inhabitant of Kedge Keep is capable of doing 10,000 points of damage to a group of twenty five Level 50 characters in the blink of an eye? Phinigel Autropos? Estrella of Gloomwater? No, not even close. [bold]The only creature capable of this kind of mass destruction is that cute little Shimmering Sailfin that you occasionally see swimming around the various rooms of Kedge. These innocent looking little fish sometimes explode upon death, causing 400 points of damage to all players within radius of the blast. [/bold]Kill one of these during a close fight with Phinigel and see how often you are invited back to Kedge Keep. You have been warned. <br>
<br>
There are various types of Sailfin in Kedge Keep: Cobalt, Cerulean, Emerald, Crimson, and Shimmering. The chromatic Sailfin are under level ten, while the Shimmering Sailfin are in their low thirties, and will occasionally pick a fight with low level characters or their pets. All sailfin drop fresh fish and the all important fish scales. For this reason, they are harvested by players who need to continually cast Enduring Breath. If you plan on killing these fish for their scales, be aware that they are place holders for the rare spawning wandering Stingtooth Piranha. If you continue to kill sailfin, you will eventually see these tenacious piranha patrolling the corridors in place of their less sinister cousins. If you are hunting for experience, you can use this to your advantage by causing xp-giving Stingtooth Piranha to spawn. Just be sure to avoid the Shimmering Sailfin at all cost. If someone in your party engages one, have everyone else move away to avoid being caught in the area of effect blast. <br>

<br>
I think it was a valuable learning experience for all involved.  I'd like to thank Benadan in particular for helping me with the planning and coordination of this whole thing.  We had a great turn out:  over 30 people showed up.<br>
<br>
We quickly learned that 30 people was simply too many folks to safely creep through Kedge Keep together.  At one point we had 7 groups in one area at one time.  In particular, this large number of folks actually complicated matters: the re-spawn time for the Estrella's temple mermaids is incredibly fast-- and they cause alot of damage.  As soon as we managed to snuff out the 6 spawned mermaids, they'd re-pop again by the time everyone took care of rezzes, heals, and enduring breaths.  Also, we discovered that 30+ people in one area (at least in Kedge) is quite an aggro-nightmare.  <br>
<br>
&quot;How did people die, if you had so many Heroes?&quot;<br>
It was quite difficult for many Heroes to SEE the mob they were supposed to be targeting, even if they used /assist-- there were simply too many Guildmates around the mob.  To be fair, there were a GREAT number of adds, which were generally dealt with efficiently.  The anxiety of having spell-casting adds, in an unfamiliar zone, was great for some people.  Its easy to get claustrophobic in Kedge.<br>
<br>
One thing I must tell all of you: we had one excellent, incredible cleric.  Josey, hats off, /bow, and /salute.  She did an excellent job, rezzed quickly, buffed, and healed with remarkable precision.  She maintained a positive attitude, as well!  One cleric, for over 30 people- and she didn't complain or become negative the entire raid!  <br>
  <br>
All but one corpse was retrieved and XP-rez'd before everyone logged for the night.  The only reason we were unable to retrieve that corpse was because the player went LD before /consent'ing us.  The platinum required for that corpse's coffin was deducted from the raid loot.  <br>
<br>
Notable drops?  We didn't make it in far enough to get to the seahorses, and, the golden haired mermaid was getting her beauty sleep (probably with phinny as well, who also was down at the time).  After killing Estrella, a ruby crown dropped.  Not sure on the stats of it just yet, we'll have to wait for group leader Abbreve to log back on so the officers can decide what will be done with it!  Additionally, numerous gems such as fire emeralds and fire opals dropped.  These gems will be sold by the officers to provide the guild with platinum in order to buy spell-gems for player buffs during future raids.  Two lamentation blades (no, not Lamentation.. these are 2hs Lamentation Blades) dropped, which were rolled on after we zoned out of Kedge.  <br>
 <br>
Benaden and myself are going to be putting together some regular Kedge hunting parties- this is an under-utilized zone that has some great drops, once we get far enough in.  We also have some epic items to get- I apologize to those people who got their hopes up to get these items tonight; there is already a plan on how to remedy this situation based off of our experiences this evening.<br>
<br>
Considering that an eight person level 50+ group can take down phinny, future KK &quot;raids&quot; will consist of the following:<br>
<br>
           If Large # of Heroes show up:<br>
There will be multiple well-balanced groups, and each group leader will be required to be familar with the zone, as well as underwater navigation.  Instead of creeping through the zone as a large group of people, each individual group will be assigned to a particular camp spot in the zone.  This will make aggro's less of an overall problem, and will allow players to have more action and less waiting around.  The assignment of camp sites will be based on current level and class of group members, as well as experience with Kedge itself.  I feel that this will be a much more productive use of everyone's time, mana, and fish scales.  <br>
<br>
           If Small # of Heroes show:<br>
If we have two full, well-balanced groups of 40+ players, it would be feasible to SLOWLY creep the zone as we attempted tonight, particularly if a couple members of each group are familiar with the zone.  Although it will be likely that there will be downtime, the overall risk for aggro's will be less with a smaller grouping, provided group members are aware of <br>
mobs' &quot;aggro cues&quot;.  <br>
<br>
It was a great time grinding XP, and, I was really impressed with the number of Heroes who showed up.  <br>
Thanks all for a fun evening!<br>
