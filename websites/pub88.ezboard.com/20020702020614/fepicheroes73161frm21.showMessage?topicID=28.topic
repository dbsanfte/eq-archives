<br>
I was really amazed at the turn out. We had 7 groups going in. That says alot for what we as a guild can do. <br>
<br>
We had alot of people who did not know the zone, and had not read the guide to the zone. That compounded the problems of trying to move such a large group through the narrow tunnel that are so common here. I am very happy to say we did not have train problems on the raid and that was a major worry I had. Dealing with the mermaids we had a few deaths with the larger encounters but these were on the order of 4 or less each time they happened. Estrella and Shellara both went down with ease. <br>
<br>
One of the biggest problems I had was trying to keep track of everything. This was a problem because people were chatting in OOC alot. I had designated that channel for raid and group leaders, so I could filter alot of the other stuff out. it may not seem like a big deal to most but when stuff scrolls of before you can get reports from a group, its hard to track what the status of the various groups are. <br>
<br>
We only had one cleric which slowed us down alot for Rezes. And some of the groups did not have enough healing power, those were primarily groups 5 and up which were formed at the meeting site as pick up groups. <br>
<br>
Group 3, Veldar's group, did a great job as artillery. Thier timing was right on the money. No mob stayed up for very long once they opened up. <br>
<br>
Group 4, Amanar's group, handled the job of controling any added casting mobs well. Any time there were more than a couple Mermaids they were right on the additional add to keep it from healing the one we were fighting.<br>
<br>
All in all I am happy with the job everyone on that raid did. In my opinion this was a learning raid and as a guild we took away several lessons and some good experience. it is not easy to fight when you have to watch up and down in addition to around you. Add to that lots of narrow twisting passages and you have a tough place to fight. If we can learn to fight well in this kind of an enviroment there is no place we can't fight. <br>
<br>
We did have one death from drowning in the raid, which alone says alot about how well we did in there. I won't mention the persons name but they could cast EB. <br>
<br>
I would like to get a group or two together on a regular basis to hunt this zone. The XP in here is pretty good even into the low 50s. And that will give us our future group leaders for raids into this zone. I know our Mages, and Druids have parts of thier Epics in here, as well as Wizards, Rangers, and Paladins all having quests that involve this zone. <br>
<br>
In closing I would like to say I welcome any and all comments people may have that were on this raid. I think the feed back will be a help in the planning of future raids here.<br>

<br>
Getting that out of the way I must say that I had a lot of fun on the raid last night.  Even though it went quite slow, we did it so that it was very safe.  We had a few fights were they were like 4 mermaids, and it got pretty intense.  But then again considering we had a huge number of people it didn't really matter.  I mean 7 groups! Damn.  I'm sure I had a more pleasent time than others due to the face that I just got my new Fishbone Earring (yay!)  All in all I had a great time and was actually a very good raid.  Lasalle did a very good job of pulling and Bauldor did and ok job as the main assist =).  It seems like a great place to start more raids and grouping.  I've got to get my Epic piece from there eventually!  And by the way, I left the place with 5 extra blues bubbles into 49...=)  Hope to join you all again!<br>

<br>
My thoughts on the Kedge raid.<br>
<br>
I think it was a valuable learning experience for all involved.  I'd like to thank Benadan in particular for helping me with the planning and coordination of this whole thing.  We had a great turn out:  over 30 people showed up.<br>
<br>
We quickly learned that 30 people was simply too many folks to safely creep through Kedge Keep together.  At one point we had 7 groups in one area at one time.  In particular, this large number of folks actually complicated matters: the re-spawn time for the Estrella's temple mermaids is incredibly fast-- and they cause alot of damage.  As soon as we managed to snuff out the 6 spawned mermaids, they'd re-pop again by the time everyone took care of rezzes, heals, and enduring breaths.  Also, we discovered that 30+ people in one area (at least in Kedge) is quite an aggro-nightmare.  <br>
<br>
&quot;How did people die, if you had so many Heroes?&quot;<br>
It was quite difficult for many Heroes to SEE the mob they were supposed to be targeting, even if they used /assist-- there were simply too many Guildmates around the mob.  To be fair, there were a GREAT number of adds, which were generally dealt with efficiently.  The anxiety of having spell-casting adds, in an unfamiliar zone, was great for some people.  Its easy to get claustrophobic in Kedge.<br>
<br>
One thing I must tell all of you: we had one excellent, incredible cleric.  Josey, hats off, /bow, and /salute.  She did an excellent job, rezzed quickly, buffed, and healed with remarkable precision.  She maintained a positive attitude, as well!  One cleric, for over 30 people- and she didn't complain or become negative the entire raid!  <br>
  <br>
All but one corpse was retrieved and XP-rez'd before everyone logged for the night.  The only reason we were unable to retrieve that corpse was because the player went LD before /consent'ing us.  The platinum required for that corpse's coffin was deducted from the raid loot.  <br>
<br>
Notable drops?  We didn't make it in far enough to get to the seahorses, and, the golden haired mermaid was getting her beauty sleep (probably with phinny as well, who also was down at the time).  After killing Estrella, a ruby crown dropped.  Not sure on the stats of it just yet, we'll have to wait for group leader Abbreve to log back on so the officers can decide what will be done with it!  Additionally, numerous gems such as fire emeralds and fire opals dropped.  These gems will be sold by the officers to provide the guild with platinum in order to buy spell-gems for player buffs during future raids.  Two lamentation blades (no, not Lamentation.. these are 2hs Lamentation Blades) dropped, which were rolled on after we zoned out of Kedge.  <br>
 <br>
Benaden and myself are going to be putting together some regular Kedge hunting parties- this is an under-utilized zone that has some great drops, once we get far enough in.  We also have some epic items to get- I apologize to those people who got their hopes up to get these items tonight; there is already a plan on how to remedy this situation based off of our experiences this evening.<br>
<br>
Considering that an eight person level 50+ group can take down phinny, future KK &quot;raids&quot; will consist of the following:<br>
<br>
           If Large # of Heroes show up:<br>
There will be multiple well-balanced groups, and each group leader will be required to be familar with the zone, as well as underwater navigation.  Instead of creeping through the zone as a large group of people, each individual group will be assigned to a particular camp spot in the zone.  This will make aggro's less of an overall problem, and will allow players to have more action and less waiting around.  The assignment of camp sites will be based on current level and class of group members, as well as experience with Kedge itself.  I feel that this will be a much more productive use of everyone's time, mana, and fish scales.  <br>
<br>
           If Small # of Heroes show:<br>
If we have two full, well-balanced groups of 40+ players, it would be feasible to SLOWLY creep the zone as we attempted tonight, particularly if a couple members of each group are familiar with the zone.  Although it will be likely that there will be downtime, the overall risk for aggro's will be less with a smaller grouping, provided group members are aware of <br>
mobs' &quot;aggro cues&quot;.  <br>
<br>
It was a great time grinding XP, and, I was really impressed with the number of Heroes who showed up.  <br>
Thanks all for a fun evening!<br>

This was not my raid so i tried to sit back, clearly the raid leader had this very well planned out.  If there was a time i wanted to get more involved, and sometimes did, it was for this purpose:  <br>
<br>
If you come on a raid. . . . you simply cannot say whatever you think, whenever you think it, and subject the entire raiding party to this.  There is always room for funny banter and good times, of course not on the group leader channel, but in others channels it is fine, we are there to also have a good time.  BUT, complaining, second guessing the raid leader, objecting to decisions made. . .that just can't happen.  Think about it. . . . we had a very large number of people.  If everyone did this, omg, it would be crippling.  So once again i introduce you to the chain of command in a raid. . .if you can't abide it, then you will not be welcome on the next raid. . . simple as that.  <br>
<br>
Raid leader is dah man (or woman)<br>
They call the shots. . . .that is their right as raid leader. . it is their raid. . they have planned it out and offered to take us along for the ride.  You go where they say, you do what they say, and you support what they say.  Anything less than this is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
Raid leaders 2nd in command.  Assume they are speaking for the raid leader.  If he isn't then you can be sure the raid leader will address that with him privately and work that out.  You go where he says, you do what he says, you support what he says.  Anything less is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
Group leaders.  Look up in your group box, the persons name in yellow is your group leader.  You address all questions, comments, complaints, ideas to your group leader.  Who in turn can pass it on to Raid leader if it is pertinant.  Dont' skip this step.  Don't take this role if it was not given to you.  Show your respect and support to your group leader.   Anything else is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
Officers.  There will most likely always be an officer present.  If you have a problem that needs to be addressed do so in a private tell to an officer, they will do their best to help you get it resolved.  Don't skip this step, don't take matters into your own hands.  Anything else is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
You have to remember that you are a part of a team on a raid.  There are roles.  There are rules.  There is a chain of command.  Some raids are more casual than others but in a place like kk, where there are dangers all around, this is not a causal raid.  <br>
<br>
I think last night was fun, i think it was a great learning experience.  We need to learn that zone, it will take some time.  But we need to enforce good raid practices so things go as smoothly as possible for everyone.  This will elimante so many headaches and hassels, and even unnecessary deaths.  The officers will be policing this and if you have to be repeatedly called down it will be noted and you will face a possible xlocate.  I think if someone has to be xlocated, they jeapordize their spot on the next raid.  There will be some raids that we will need to take fewer numbers for safety.  At times when people will need to be chosen, your actions and attitudes on previous raids will of course be taken into account.  <br>
<br>
Most of you follow this very well.  You are seasoned and experienced raiders and it shows.  Some are newer so we want you to know what is expected of you, required of you on raids.  Soon we will all have this down to a science and think what we can accomplish then!  Rise up to the challenge Heros, it is in your grasp if you want it.<br>

Especially the Paladins who had a great oppertunity to grab the dusty finger while Phinny was down. <br>
<br>
I made the call to pull back and I will take the heat for it if you want to dish it out to someone. Here is what I was thinking at the time so you can better understand my reasoning. First, the raid party had devolved to an unruly mob, and had done so in a dangerous location. We were getting deaths because of that fact. I felt it better to pull everyone back to a safer location and restore order to the raid before proceeding deeper. Second, We had a fair number of people LD at various points during the raid. Each time I was aware of an LD we as a whole waited for that person to get back. A few times the raid group was chomping at the bit because of the wait. In those cases I was setting 2 groups to wait for and protect the LD, while the rest of us moved forward. By the time we got back to the second level of Kedge, it was obvious that order was not going to be restored so I called the raid at that point. Several people had Xloced or ported out already by that point. <br>
<br>
I purposely stayed in Kedge until the last of our people were out to make sure no one was left in that dungeon. Thiose people who did meet up at unrest, the designated meeting point after we left Kedge, did roll on the items. It was there that Denkar was given sufficent money to purchase a coffin so he could summon Assim's corpse, which we had not been able to find. Unfortunately Assim was not on line at that time and Sunday evening Denkar was not online while Assim was so we purchased a second coffin and Bam summoned the corpse. <br>
<br>
My personal feeling about leading a raid is very simple. I do not want any unnecessary deaths on the raid PERIOD. I know deaths will happen in a fight it is part of the game. But to go into an area that is hazardous with a group that forany reason is questionable about being able to handle those dangers is asking for unnecessary deaths.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#7c96b9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/ukajirafirelite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KajiraFirelite</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://members.tripod.co.uk/redhotant/icons/iconoc01.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br>  Posts: 459<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/5/01 12:05:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sonic.net/~rodney1/wolfblue.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kedge -the aftermath</span><hr size=1> wise choice. . .totally supported it<br>

I mentioned it several times in ooc, but got no response. Personally i think a lot underestimate the power of shrink and its ability to save space... During the raid i just took a swig of my potion so i could maneuver better which helped  alot. A good example is hate. We NEEDED shrink pots on hate bad that one weekend raid, not just for big people, but average sized and semi small too, we just all need to be able to be as small as possible when fighting those small mobs. Stuff like dragons are easy because you can hit them from a mile away, but small guys you really have to be close to hit (heck the fact tunare was so small added to her unkillability for some point). Anyways thats just my opinion<br>

Kedge is probably the hugest zone that most people avoid because it can be such a pain in the ass, and aggros can come from so many directions it's hard to always be ready.  I like the idea of exploring and becoming more familiar with this zone, I personally will make an effort to do so.

That is the reason I want to get the regular hunting group together and have them know the zone backwards, forwards and sideways so we can take the large raids in there and do it safely. When I did a listing of the major drops in this zone it was 1 and a half printed pages, and that does not include the quest items. There are 7 to 8 camps this zone can be broken down into. I would love to start a raid in there on a weekend early in the morning and put a couple 3 groups of heroes at each of those just to see how much we could walk out with at the end of the day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#7c96b9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/ubeltalek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beltalek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/6/01 12:01:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Kedge  - The aftermath</span><hr size=1> The shrink potions for everybody except raid leader and group leaders sounds like a wise tactic (perhaps expensive, though). That way, even if they don't lead by communication, you can at least see who to follow without having to resort to autofollow (which is useless in Kedge due to Z axis). Of course, if you have bad communication you're just going to go around in circles anyway... <br>
<br>
Group leaders - please relay instructions you receive from the raid leader to your groups. This will allow raid leaders to use /tells to give instructions and will cut down on blabber-scroll. Group leaders on normal xp runs are usually just a member of the group who happened to invite first -- raids are different. You need to LEAD! Please SAY you are moving from one location to another before you do it, and make sure all of your people are formed up and READY to move. In some places, where aggro is insane, this can be a life saver. People on a raid naturally want to help and, in a command vaccuum, may actually do harm by &quot;volunteering&quot;. If there are seven groups on a raid and the leader is targeting a mob that needs two groups to kill (s)he may send in three with a safety margin and hold four in reserve for pops and to prevent confusion. TELL your people you're in the reserves if you receive a group-order to hold back, and to report additional pops if they see any. Keeping track of group members and keeping them informed is critical to ensure good cross-class coordination.<br>
<br>
Perhaps having group leaders assigned in advance and briefed in a pre-raid leaders' only meeting might be useful?<br>
<br>
These are just my thoughts. I hope somebody finds them useful.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1478A2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/ubenadan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Benadan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/6/01 8:11:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Kedge  - The aftermath</span><hr size=1> Some real good points there Bauldor.

As for shrink, a shaman in each group or even moving group to group can take care of that one. Hmm not sure if I can shrink gnomes dwarves or halfings though, they might diappear if they get any smaller. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Tells can be a handful on a large raid to relay instructions. What I try to do is use the different channels and the filters, that way there can be clear channels to communicate with and you don't get excessive scroll.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#7c96b9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/ulasalle77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lasalle77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/6/01 9:40:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Kedge  - The aftermath</span><hr size=1> <br>
I like all that's been said so far about things.  I just wanted to add something else- I think that attitude goes a long way.  I wanted to take the opportunity to make everyone aware of how people's anxiety management in Kedge Keep can either help or hurt the entire action.<br>
<br>
As the assistant raid leader for this, I can tell you that getting /tells from non-group leaders asking me superficial and unimportant questions (i.e.&quot;why are we doing this?&quot;) definitely distracted me from attending to the seven different group leaders, as well as guild officers, with whom I was in constant communication.  I don't mean to trivialize everyone's concerns-- nobody's going to be happy 100% of the time, and I recognize that.  When I say &quot;superficial and unimportant&quot;, I'm referring to statements that are more comment based, &quot;you shouldn't have done that&quot; (which is not only vague but out of place), as well as those that do not directly benefit the raid.  These types of comments and questions are quite normal to make during many raids-- but kedge is different.  It is crucial that raid leaders, group leaders, and group members maintain maximum focus and attention in Kedge.  <br>
<br>
I propose requring everyone to disable guildchat once they are in the zone, as well- I noticed several group members chatting away in guildchat-- some of these were people that we ended up waiting for at various points during the raid.  If guild help is needed, it will be the raid leader's responsibility to solicit non-raid guild members for that help.   <br>
<br>
    Most of us, I'm sure, respond to /tells by hitting, &quot;R&quot;, and this can be particularly useful when the person you are responding to has a very long name.  I was using this strategy on the raid, to respond extremely fast and immediately to group leader and guild officer concerns, so that each group would know what to do next, and when to do it (while keeping in mind that the next room spawn may be perhaps 50 seconds away).<br>
<br>
    However, since one or two group members decided to /tell me what they were thinking every step of the way.. &quot;why are we doing this, we should do this, we should do that&quot;... the /tell floods definitely interrupted my rhythm of keeping track of everyone at all times.  I had to then re-type the group leader's name, respond to that person... then respond efficiently to the non-leader's innappropriate comments to keep morale up and be a respectful leader.<br>
  During this 15 second interval, I have a back-log of about 4 or 5 other /tells from the appropriate people, that could have been responded to immediately (many of them needed to be responded to immediately)-- this, I guarantee you, was another reason why we seemed to be &quot;idle&quot; for a minute or so after a fight ended and rezzes + heals were completed.  <br>
<br>
The moral of this is: please do not send a /tell to a Raid Leader or Assistant Raid Leader, unless you are designated as a Group Leader.  There are a number of things that we are doing, while you are waiting.  I did my best to juggle the tells, as well as make frequent /ooc announcements to let people know that I appreciated their patience.  I will communicate with all members on a raid through /ooc-- as well as Group Leaders if it is a general course of action.  /tell is used to give a specific direction to a group.  In extreme cases, /tell will be used to alert a group member that they will be xloc'd out if they continue to severely disrupt the progress of the raid, the safety of raid members, and most importantly... the overall enjoyment level of the majority of people involved.  That's what all of this is about for me-- if people die, they're not having fun.  I'm doing everything I can to prevent this.<br>
  <br>
   It follows that there are a few people who were on this raid that I have serious concerns about-- with regards to attitude, most importantly.  To these individuals, it seemed like they weren't having fun-- and they made this abundantly clear by abusing the /ooc channel (which was reserved for group leaders anyway), as well as /tell flooding Benadan and myself.  I will not publicly expose these people, I don't think that's right to do-- Raids are all about learning.  Warnings have been issues, from what I understand.  I think Kajira's post above is quite appropriate on this issue.  Please, I understand that everyone wants to get their loot, level, and have a great time doing it!  But it only takes a few negative people to spoil everyone's good time. I hope that shedding some light on WHAT Benadan and myself were doing defuses a bit of the mystery that surrounded our functions on this raid.  <br>
<br>
In order for &quot;/shout Epic Heroes rocks Kedge!&quot;, we need to function as a well-oiled machine-- any rust that the water has created along the way must be dealt with before we head back in.  If not, our ability to function will grind to a halt.<br>

I too got an invite to that little party we had in the desert back in 91. What a joy it was 135 in the shade and there ain't no F***ing shade!<br>
<br>
My personal thought is that every raid should get a thread like this one so we can examine what went right and wrong on the raid and refine our strategies for raiding. Our numbers alone can make us the best raiding force on the server. Add to that the ability of our members to function as a well oiled machine in any zone and no other guild could touch us.<br>
<br>
It seems a major issue here is communication during the raid. So to that end I propose this protocol for communications, in Kedge specifically, and possibly for other raids as well.<br>
1. Guild chat to be turned off at the start of the raid by all but the raid leaders. <br>
2. 2 channels be specified by the raid leadership, one as a command channel and the second as general chat. (such as ooc for command, and shout for chat)<br>
3. The use of tells be minimized. Even using r and tab to scroll through the names it can be very time consuming to have to reply to everyone individually.<br>
4. Voice any concerns to your group leader. They will pass them to the raid leader or ask you to send the raid leader a tell, based on the response they get from the raid leader. if you don't feel your concern was addressed properly during the raid, voice it here on the message board when things are more relaxed.<br>
5. if you are truely unhappy with the way a raid is going you can ask for a tranlocate.<br>
6. Raid leaders and group leaders do a pre-raid wal thru of the zone if possible. <br>
7. Utilize shrink as much as possible to aid in making leaders stand out a bit.<br>
8. Movement to be down in 1 or 2 group teams, instead of the entire raid moving at once. <br>
9. 2 group teams consist of a melle group and a caster group. <br>
10. Allow folks below the listed level to attend the raid if possible, but at thier own risk. <br>
<br>
I would like to explain point 10 in a bit of detail at this point. We had a lvl 30 shaman with us in Kedge, sorry I forget the exact name. She did an excellent job healing the Caster group! Allowing these folks to join us if they are willing to take the risk provides them with excellent experience in raiding, if not in terms of game xp as well. If they are getting game xp they are in effect getting PLed a bit by it. My one reservation on this point is Kedge specific though. I am very nervous about allowing any caster under 35 on these raids. The reason is medding, they cannot see thier buffs while medding and could easily have EB run out on them without warning.<br>
<br>
11. One or two groups, depending on the dangers in the area, be designated to guard LDs locations until thier return.<br>
12. Use of a social with the /assist (MA) is manditory.<br>
13. Kedge Specific, A social that contains all five lines saying Endure Breathing in /gsay. Five lines simply to prevent it from getting lost in battle scroll. <br>
14. Kedge Specific, Water stones. One or more Mages are essential to this zone for safety. Everyone should have 2 water stones on them at all times. After using your EB hotkey, if you still do not have EB cast upon you my the time you are down 2 bubbles on your breath bar, use a water stone. Then when the situation permits let your group leader know you are going to a mage to get a replacement. Drowning is totally unnecessary in this zone if we are smart.<br>
15. Corpses, will all be recovered if possible before the raid leadership leaves the raid site. This may involve a meeting outside the zone being raided and arrangements being made for coffins, then a re entry to the raid zone.<br>
16. In the event of some one logging before thier corpse has been recovered. A team will be designated to return with the person the next day to recover the corpse.<br>
<br>
I think this sums up what has been covered in this thread.<br>

I think another thing is extremely important regarding corpses--  as SOON as someone goes down and is popped back at their bind spot, they should immediately /consent their group leader, and the raid leader(s) as well (only if all of the people to be /consented are in EH).  This is a personal decision, and should not be a requirement.  However, it will aid in the speed of CR's-- instead of taking 2 minutes to figure out who to /consent, that time could be better spent retrieving the corpse.  Particularly this will be useful when a member goes LD shortly after they die.  <br>
<br>

your group leader<br>

additional consents can be given at request.<br>

Only other thoughts are that raid goals be posted or stated prior to raid, I had a hard time getting heads up on this during the raid itself.  Seemed that it was a ranger based raid last go around which is cool, but I think if we know in advance there will be a clearer focus on the aim and fewer disappointments =).  Also, it would be great if we gave a big thanks to all non - guildies that participate at ends of raids.<br>

Chiani, The original purpose of the raid was to kill Phinny.

Chi- The past raid wasn't quite ranger-based.  Although I think a few of us were keeping an eye on track for our spawn, we were quite far away from the mermaid who drops the ranger bow quest item.  The ultimate goal (which should have been more clear, I agree) was to creep our way down to phinny.  The fact that UP already took him down, and he is an 8-hour (??) spawn definitely screwed us up.  We had our raid time and date posted on the vazaelle community center calendar- I think it was rude of them to run the zone and destroy our chances of taking down the 8-hour mob boss.  <br>

I know, I'm the new(er) chick...but I would like to add my 2cp.  = )<br>
<br>
I've been on a few big raids and was at the big Kedge raid and the one thing that makes me totally nuts about too many raids is the lack of organization.  I swear, too often the mob goes down out of sheer luck or sheer numbers of people wildly casting and bashing without any intelligence behind it all!  I was terribly impressed with the organizational efforts of Benadan and Lasalle in what was an organiziational nightmare for all the many reasons already stated. Although I did leave the raid early, (I was getting frustrated- like many were - at the lack of progress and realized there were simply too many folks there.) I considered it a success for myself, personally, because of all I learned.  = )<br>
<br>
I guess my only constructive criticism would be of those that seem (to me) to be overly focused on items and the 'what are we getting out of this' attitude.  As has been said, without doing things like this for virtually no other reason than the learning factor, we will never be able to be the best that we can be.  = )  Sure, items are nice and I definitely have a personal interest in learning Kedge Keep, but the main reason I went was to learn to raid underwater.  And I did learn a ton!  There is nothing wrong with erring on the side of caution.  I mean, compare the time it may take to organize well and clearly know your role in your group and the raid as a whole to the time it takes to continually have to stop the raid for rezzes!!  No contest.<br>
