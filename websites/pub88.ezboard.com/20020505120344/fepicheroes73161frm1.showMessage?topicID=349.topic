High end guilds are monopolizing the end-game. Everyone reaches it eventually, everyone will hit level 60 with at least one character. More people are now, than ever. What happens when they do? What happens when people who can't play 8 hours per day bump into the people who can?<br>
<br>
What will happen to those casual players, when they realize all the high-end mobs are hogged by the elite few with endless time to devote to the game? What will happen when they are given a choice: race other guilds for mobs after patches, or don't raid at all?<br>
<br>
Unless this is addressed, this game will see a *lot* of people leave over the next six months. Many are simply unwilling to put up with the bias shown towards hard-core players at the high end of EQ.<br>
<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
The Death of the High End Game, or, The Death of EQ's Casual-Raid Playerbase<br>
<br>
Pick a title, they both apply.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has played EQ for any length of time notices there are differences in attitudes between those playing. On the left, those who play for the social aspect, and on the right, those who play just to see stuff die. Most play for a mix between the two. How far to the right or left they are generally depends on their age, and how much time they can devote to the game. Therein lies a *huge* problem with the way EQ is designed.<br>
<br>
EQ is populated with static mobs, on static and slightly varying timers. The boss mobs (mobs designed for raids to take down) are definitely no exception. Most of these mobs, like the rest, tend to pop up right after a patch, which are usually held early in the morning. What does this mean? It means that guilds made up of teenagers, college students, asians, or other people whose lifestyles allow them to jump out of bed at 5am and take down these mobs right after they've spawned, tend to monopolize all the high-end encounters. Until recently, this hasn't been a problem, as only a handful of players had the dedication to get to 60. No longer.<br>
<br>
Casual players haven't stopped playing. Actually, they've kept playing right through kunark, velious, and continue playing now in SoL. While other guilds took mere months to get most of their members from 50 to 60 after kunark, the casual players take much longer. This has given the &quot;uber&quot; guilds a lot of time to themselves at the high end of EQ, but their time is almost up.<br>
<br>
Eventually everyone gets to 60. This is a fact. Casual players are beginning to arrive, and arrive in numbers. With the addition of light-blue con mobs, and revamps of Velketor's and Chardok, camping experience got orders of magnitudes easier. No longer is everyone forced to grind in sebilis with massive competition, there is breathing room. You can log in, and generally get a group or find a place to solo without sitting hours at a zoneline LFG, the bane of the occaisonal player with less time to play.<br>
<br>
Casual players tend to have jobs, social lives, and families. Now that they're 60 though, the drive to advance by camping experience lessens a LOT. They want to start doing the mobs we've all heard about at the lower levels, the dragons, the giants, the high-end encounters. They want to raid the big mobs, and here's where it gets messy.<br>
<br>
People with real life committments *can't* drop what they are doing at 5am, and go clear NToV after a patch. They need time to arrange for babysitters, for time off work, for their kids to be asleep, etc. In other words they need to be able to plan ahead.<br>
<br>
EQ's high end game isn't designed for that. It's designed on a first-come first-served basis, where whoever gets there first gets the mob. The guilds who can field 40 players immediately after a patch to clear the high-end mobs, thereby depriving other guilds of things to kill. Depriving *casual* players of things to kill. The &quot;uber&quot; guilds are not to blame entirely for this, the developers must take a share of the blame, for developing a game that forces players to compete for mobs in EQ like rats in a cage for food, survival of the fittest. That's not the making of a good game, it's a cluster[f***] waiting to happen.<br>
<br>
Simply put, casual players need mobs they can plan around being up. Some of them need at least a week of notice to arrange to play EQ for more than 4 hours, and when they make all those arrangements only to find another guild has taken the mob down or cleared the zone a day before, or a few hours before, it wastes their time, and puts them down on the game. It creates conflict, it divides players, and it ruins the fun, period.<br>
<br>
Casual players are a *huge* part of EQ's subscription base. No one with a brain is going to dispute that. I don't have exact numbers, but just from the amount of guilds on a server, and the small portion of which are level 60 raiding guilds, you can begin to form an idea. Designing the end game totally and completely around the top 10% of people whose lifestyles allow them to play EQ for 8+ hours a day is unfair, and a simply criminal way to reward people who have taken 2 years to reach the end game. They pay the same $10/month as everyone else, and deserve high-end content designed with them in mind.<br>
<br>
I don't purport to have all the answers, but clearly there has to be a better way to handle this problem than simply dumping everyone into a few key zones, and saying &quot;kk it's a free for all, have fun&quot;. Throwing more and more static mobs at the players is how Verant has attempted to address this problem in the past, and it is simply not the answer. All it is going to do is create more conflict among the players over the new mobs, and make the old mobs, with older loot, less desirable.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, here are a few short-term solutions.<br>
<br>
1) More dynamic, random-spawn mobs in the spirit of Gorenaire, Wuoshi, etc. Things that the guilds with lots of time on their hands can jump all over to keep them busy. I'd suggest adding random-spawn dragons on RANDOM TIMERS to select Luclin zones, with loot to match. Things that don't repop automatically after a patch, but on a somewhat random delay of 1-3 days. You got the Kunark dragons half right, finish the job.<br>
<br>
2) Revamping NToV mobs to respawn randomly after a patch. There is a huge issue on many servers with japanese or SE asian guilds jumping the patch and clearing the zone before the american/canadian/european players are even out of bed. Spread the spawn times out, random within 36 hours, so that both areas of the world have an even shot at the mobs.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see patch-jumping eliminated altogether. It is simply unfair to everyone with a life and job to have to sacrifice a night of raiding in EQ because one guild can clear a zone before you can, or wake up earlier than you can, etc. Most casual players can live with a FFA rule on mobs, but the bias towards that top 10% of hardcore raiders must end.<br>
<br>
No, I am not a casual player, I play 8 hours a day usually. I have no life and no job. I'm just tired of seeing the broken hearts that come when people with real-life commitments reach level 60, only to find the raiding game is *dominated* by guilds without them. Casual raiders need more content built for them, or they are going to lose interest in this game, and we are going to lose a *lot* more people than we are already.<br>

<br>
However make the triggers the result of a long and involved quest so that said mobs cannot be spawned and farmed.<br>
<br>
Make mobs that only people of a certain class/level can spawn.<br>
<br>
More long involved triggers would give guilds more of a definite goal/path and would remove the ability to patch jump stuff and farm it.<br>
<br>
Also instead of having a 7 day spawn time on certain mobs just make them much more difficult and only engageable by certain lvl people a la Naggy and Vox. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28162>Daerv Karasu</a><br><a href=http://www.epic-heroes.com>Epic Heroes</a><br><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/bepicheroes73161>EH EZBoard</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=349.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=349.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=349.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.threadControl?topicID=349.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=349.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=349.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub88.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="epicheroes73161frm1">General<option value="epicheroes73161frm2">Guild Policies<option value="epicheroes73161frm10">Applications<option value="epicheroes73161frm21">Raids<option value="epicheroes73161frm14">Tank's Saloon<option value="epicheroes73161frm15">Caster's Library<option value="epicheroes73161frm16">Priest Retreat<option value="epicheroes73161frm28">Opinion Polls<option value="epicheroes73161frm3">Members Only<option value="epicheroes73161frm30">New Roster<option value="epicheroes73161frm18">Dragon Planning<option value="epicheroes73161frm7">Guild Events<option value="epicheroes73161frm6">Trade Skill Update<option value="epicheroes73161frm22">Epic Weapons<option value="epicheroes73161frm17">Flame Furnace<option value="epicheroes73161frm24">Epic Heroes Calender<option value="epicheroes73161frm8">Strategy<option value="epicheroes73161frm9">Quests<option value="epicheroes73161frm13">New Applicants<option value="epicheroes73161frm26">Wednesdays Warriors<option value="epicheroes73161frm4">Officers Only<option value="epicheroes73161frm20">Raid Leaders<option value="epicheroes73161frm27">Polls<option value="epicheroes73161frm5">Roster Update<option value="epicheroes73161frm31">Recruit Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/bepicheroes73161>Epic Heroes</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm1>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.epic-heroes.com">Epic Heroes</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
