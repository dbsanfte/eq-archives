The bad luck started when I was still medding when the fight started. Four Gaurdian Imps were pulled/trained( not complaining, these things happen) to the group. I beleive 2 of the Imps went straight for me cause I was sitting while the other 2 imps stayed with the tanks. The Imps were taking lot of hp from me so I stood there awhile then ran past the tanks to the other side of the room. As the Imps passed the Tanks they stayed with them and left me alone. At this point I am on the other side of the Effreeti Room from everyone else. My regen, HP and AC buffs have Faded, no time or manna to spare to redo them. I am at 2 bubbles of health and see Snaake is going to need a heal soon. Four Imps are still up, resisting the enchanters mezzes. <br>I know I am going to get aggroed again when I cast Superior Heal on Snaake so I want to Heal myself some first. <br><br>I cast Greater Healing on myself, and 3 Imps peal off and come right at me. I try to cast Greater Healing again as 3 Imps are beating on me but I am interupted of course and die. What happened to the rest of the group after that I don't know. <br><br>For my situation, how could I have gotten out of this alive? Cause if I had been there for heals I think we could have taken 4 imps. I have some ideas I will experiment with. <br><br>1. Root each one as they are aggroing on you and step away from them, then root the next , etc. until you are free. <br><br>2. Cast a blind spell on each one.  This is a fast cast and has saved me many times in the outdoors but I am reluctant to use it in a dungeon because the mobbs just run away at high speed like under a fear spell. Who knows what they will bring back with them.<br><br>3. Stand there and take my lumps hoping the enchanters mezz them, or the Tanks taunt them, or another healer heals me. This is what I did Saturday and I died quick cause the Imps hit hard and fast.<br><br>Does anyone have ideas about how to successfully deal with this kind of situation?<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/uruuka100.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruuka100</A> at: 7/23/01 2:40:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1478A2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/uhurrk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hurrk</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Leader</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/01 3:51:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Healer agroed by 3 lvl 45ish mobs - what can you do?</span><hr size=1> If you get a bad pull (overpull) of mobs that are so high MR the encs have a hard time mezzing, there isn't much you can do.  However, there is one thing that does help in this situation.  You were in a multi-group scenario.  In this scenario, the healers in the two groups can make emergency heal hotkeys:<br><br>/target &lt;player name&gt;<br>/cast #  where number corresponds to the spell gems, top one is one to bottom one which is 8.<br><br>Now, a second hotkey to raise the alarm<br><br>/tell &lt;player name&gt; HEAL!<br>/tell &lt;player name&gt; HEAL!<br><br>etc until all the other healers are on the same key.  In this way you tell them all at once.  Finally, you all agree to use GH in response to this emergency request, if there are more than two, or SH if two or less.  So, you don't over heal too much and waste too much mana.<br><br>Its a little complicated, but multi-group strategies pay big dividends when you use them.  By doing this, you don't have to run, you stay right there in the same spot, take the beating, let your tanks help when they can, let your encs help when they can.  Everyone else keeps you alive.  What the heck, if the mobs are hitting you, then your tanks aren't takin much damage.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Hurrk <BR>Heroes!

I would be interested to know what classes you had in the group.  With the high MR on Imps your root would not have stuck for very long.<br>If the enchanters cannot mez most likely you would have been in trouble also.  Blind never works in the zone unless you gate or are zoning and need time. <br>Being at 2 bubs of health left you were screwed.  That is when you have to think of yourself I would think.  On a bad pull I don't really risk the heal cause I know I will die.  If the group was well balanced there should have been someone that maybe could have parked the things, but the Efreeti room is kinda small so you would have still maybe got hit.  I think there should have been someone healing you though, depending on your role.  For instance if you had a pally they could have done laying of hands.  The tanks should have taken the aggro and someone else maybe healed.  If everyone was going down fast someone should have evaced the group and the decision be made.  I believe the imps quad hit for like 120 don't they and there would be no way to heal yourself in that situation.  To be honest I think that the situation was created with your low health and you sealed your fate with the heal.  The situation was not anything that you could have controlled with the healing, but you did create the finally aggro on yourself....<br>Just my opinion <br>Rascalan Jaspers <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/urascalan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rascalan</A> at: 10/29/01 11:52:37 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.showPrevMessage?topicID=9.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.showNextMessage?topicID=9.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.emailToFriend?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.threadControl?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub88.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="epicheroes73161frm1">General<option value="epicheroes73161frm2">Guild Policies<option value="epicheroes73161frm10">Applications<option value="epicheroes73161frm21">Raids<option value="epicheroes73161frm14">Tank's Saloon<option value="epicheroes73161frm15">Caster's Library<option value="epicheroes73161frm16">Priest Retreat<option value="epicheroes73161frm28">Opinion Polls<option value="epicheroes73161frm3">Members Only<option value="epicheroes73161frm30">New Roster<option value="epicheroes73161frm18">Dragon Planning<option value="epicheroes73161frm7">Guild Events<option value="epicheroes73161frm6">Trade Skill Update<option value="epicheroes73161frm22">Epic Weapons<option value="epicheroes73161frm17">Flame Furnace<option value="epicheroes73161frm24">Epic Heroes Calender<option value="epicheroes73161frm8">Strategy<option value="epicheroes73161frm9">Quests<option value="epicheroes73161frm13">New Applicants<option value="epicheroes73161frm26">Wednesdays Warriors<option value="epicheroes73161frm4">Officers Only<option value="epicheroes73161frm20">Raid Leaders<option value="epicheroes73161frm27">Polls<option value="epicheroes73161frm5">Roster Update<option value="epicheroes73161frm31">Recruit Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/bepicheroes73161>Epic Heroes</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16>Priest Retreat</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.epic-heroes.com">Epic Heroes</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
