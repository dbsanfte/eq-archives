Prior to about level 35, people would rather have a Druid or a Shamen in the group because their heals are about as good, and they have SoW.  From 35 to 49, people like your heals, but everyone, of course, would rather have a level 49 in the group because of the rez.  Also Clerics are the slowest players in the game and do not have the all important invis, so even crossing zones alone is difficult.  They are also always broke because FFA loot is never fair to casters and clerics.  Clerics are also, at lower levels, generally expected to provide their own gems for the symbol spells.  Therefore on several occasions I have ended up with less money after a night of fighting then I started with.  They can solo next to nothing, and what they can solo (undead) normally drops absolutey nothing except bones.  This is why so many people delete their Clerics before getting to 49.  <br>
<br>
After 49 people love you.  In fact as soon as you log on, you can expect to have at least 4 invitations to PoH or Seb, and at least 6 requests for a rez.  <br>
<br>
But do not get discouraged, you have been around EQ for a while and Josey is my first character.  Thus, I'm thinking you can handle it much better, and will just push through the hard times and get to 49. <br>
<br>
I'll give you spell and tactical advice later.<br>

I have come to love my Cleric, Eliania all most as much as Rainangel! Even at 40, her heals are quite awesome, and I cannot see groups preferring a Druid's heals over mine.<br>
<br>
And my Buffs I can offer, I can add over 500 HPs to any tank, and what about an extra 30 AC as well. Now that I think about it, Eliania should be Power Leveling Rain!!<br>
<br>
I do agree on the Symbols though, as the gems do get quite pricey. My static group I'm almost always with shares the money we make. One person loots ALL, then sells at the end of the night, then while still grouped uses the autosplit command. (/split x x x x - Nice command to have available to us, but does take some trust)<br>
<br>
When I finally hit 39, and got the 50% EXP Rez, I have had quite a few requests for Rez. The only thing I ask in return is, Bring corpse to a convenient spot for me to rez, and to Invis me if I need it afterwards. And if the Rez is in a different zone, I ask to be picked up, and returned. I do not ask or expect any type of payment for a Rez. I will except donations if offered, but will NEVER ask for any type of payment.<br>

I do not charge but will accept donations.  I like the cash though and need it to support my addiction to SoW potions.  I try to Rez all I can, but when I'm in a full group or late for a raid, I have to turn people down.  They are not happy, but what can you do.  <br>
<br>
I loved using my stun line of spells in my 30's and 40's.  It seemed to save mana.  When the mobs are stunned they are not hiting the melees, and stun takes a lot less mana.  Are you using this tactic?  If so, is it working for you? After getting celestial heal at 44, however, my lack of mana problems seemed to abate, so I don't stun as much.  <br>
<br>
Also, I have never used atone or pacify for anything.  Do you have any idea as to when they are useful?<br>

But I do work my skills and the only ones really lacking are Conjeration and maybe Sense Heading a bit... I do need to work her skills abit more, as in the last 5 levels or so, I have neglected to do so. (I was so excited to get my 50% Rez!!)<br>
<br>
Yes I did use my stuns a bit in the 30's... but now she mainly focuses on Heals and Buffs. Grouping with Warrithun and Nuriel havent required me to do anything much more then Heal and Buff. As for atone, well she is a master at wiping NPC's hate lists!<br>
<br>
As for Pacify, I used it once and it didnt work, and got immediate aggro... So much for thinking it was anything like Rain's Harmony spell...<br>
<br>
In alot of ways Im still learning all she is capable of, and at the same time I know her limits. I still cannot wait till she hits 46+ and I can start taking her to raids... She is so different then Rain, and the possibilities with her just seem endless right now.<br>

It does work like a single target harmony in the lower levels with the one difference...<br>
<br>
If it gets resisted you are in the schtuck.<br>
<br>
I like to think of harmony as a rather handy cloud of dope smoke that just chills the mobs out for a bit. Pacify and its line are more like the Jedi Mind trick...<br>
<br>
&quot;You really don't want to attack me nooooooow...&quot; whispered softly in the ear of the mob. If it sees you you're screwed.<br>
<br>
I stun a lot and I mean a lot right now. I only ever load my DD when I'm travelling usually since 210 pts of dmg is 4-5 rounds for a tank (ie. not worth it). Even dismiss undead seems a pretty poor upgrade.<br>
<br>
As for symbols I only ever cast them when required. If a group is doing well they simply don't need them. If people ask for them and they aren't people I know I will ask one question...<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you willing to pay for gems I will use to cast a spell which isnt even required in our current situation&quot;. Especially since symbol spells seem to last a way shorter time than other buffs.<br>
<br>
Don't think I ever cast my spell which required a bloodstone in the time it took me to get the next symbol spell. <p>Daerv.<br>

<br>
Then there's the DA line.  I was told that these spells are very important in Plains, Kael, Seb etc., to keep you alive until a Tank can taunt a mob off of you.  My problem is, I never remember to use them.  I think I only used them once when trying to run from a goon in OT.  The spells effect is so short that I died anyway.  My question is; do you ever really use these spells?  It would seem that 2 are required to be kept (DA and DB) up for them to be of any use.  Let me know your thoughts on this.<br>

<br>
As for the DA line I keep both Divine Aura and Divine Barrier memmed at all times. I can't count the times I've needed to cast both on myself in order to control the aggro I get. Only use them when I have about 5 mobs on you though since we can usually take enough hits to get the buggers mezzed up.<br>
<br>
Thats probably me being a bad cleric but when I'm cracked up 18 seconds of sitting on my arse drawing a mobs attention away from a tank can mean more heals for the tank.<br>
<br>
Divine barrier also has a regen component but takes longer to cast so gets interrupted a lot.<br>
<br>
Using both these spells I managed to drag an SG half way across the oasis before getting with 9 or so health left <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

As I see things, lvl 34 up clerics ownz all, nuff said.<br>
All the other wannabe healers envy our sup healing and have no means to stand a change against us.<br>
But it even gets better, at 39 clerics get the allmighty heal spell, the only one u will keep memmed all the way to 60 and beyond (if it ever gets possible), and this is the spell that cast the real clerics from the wannabe clerics. Use complete Heal extensivelly and wiselly, its the most efficient heal you have when used properly, personnally i allways aim to land it at one bub of life, sometimes lower or upper depending on mana (some warriors that dont know me usually scream a lil on the first couple CHs, but they get used to it, and they are happy to keep the chainpulling going).<br>
About the gems, well, untill you get Complete heal they are useless if u are good enough, usually ppl only ask for symbols if they are used to dieing a lot, since they dont die with me they dont complain, and to be true, i never bought any symbol spell before lvl 44, and never needed any of it anyway.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps any future clerics, remember that mana efficiency is our best bet to keep the blood pumping on everyone. <p>********************* <BR>

 I love my cleric. And yes it is true that no one wants you when your a young cleric. Because of this I was forced to solo and through this my 1hb has gone up considerably. I am lvl 26 now and my 1hb is 105+, thats the last I checked. When I went to train at my guild it was at an excellent. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for being PL'ed, HA! I'm less twinked than most of the newbie clerics that started after me. Furthermore, the noobs that have began a cleric alt/main are now wwwaaaaayyyyy ahead of me, why? Because fellow guildies are willing to PL them and not me. No one offers to PL me and I feel asking anyone in the guild to PL is just a waist of time.<br>
<br>
I will state that due to sharing a puter it did limit my time on EQ.<br>

I don't know of any guildies that have cleric alts that have been PLed to be honest. PLing a cleric who will be raiding/grouping is generally a bad idea since they will fizzle the higher level spells more often than not due to lack of practice. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28162>Daerv Karasu</a><br><a href=http://www.epic-heroes.com>Epic Heroes</a><br><a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/bepicheroes73161>EH EZBoard</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#7c96b9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub88.ezboard.com/uiamwhatiam82.showPublicProfile?language=EN>iamwhatiam82</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/17/02 3:45:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub88.ezboard.com/fepicheroes73161frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics</span><hr size=1> <br>
