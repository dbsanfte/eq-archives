The sum they quoted was 100 000 cp.  Not a bad Idea really, to encumber him.  We all know what weight does to a monks AC.  You could have 10 folks each give him 1000cp.  10k ought to encumber him enough that his AC suffers, even at lvl 62.<br>
<br>
seb, as I said, I'm not a member of this guild so I can't speak to the help you have or haven't received doing any of your monk quests.  But I can tell you this, I received little or no help, except for Raster, when my 46 chanter wife stayed there to haste me.  I did all of the headband quests and all of the sash quests TWICE, the first time at mostly level appropriate levels.  Big Deal?  I'm an Iksar.  Doing the faction work to get the brothers and sisters in both Freeport and Qeynos to listen to me, let alone getting the guards not to kill me first, was a very big deal.  And I did that alone.  Point is, aside from a few elements at the very end, most of our epic is easily doable alone or with a regular group.  It's a pain, but it's doable.  And after all, it is OUR epic, not theirs.<br>
<br>
As far as how good our epic is, well, the clickable haste is a joke.  It's 40%.  By the time you get high enough to have your epic, you should be grouping with chanters capable of casting a 50% to 66% haste that will override the epic anyway.  HOWEVER, the fact that it turns our fists into 9/16 beasts is awesome.  It is for that and the status that I will someday wear the Celestial Fists.  Besides, I like the graphic. &lt;grin&gt;<br>

<br>
I have to apologize for not hailing brother zephyl when he finally popped  =(  I had not heard about that until it was too late and my assumption had been that it was only needed to hold him in place (as with Hasten who can be held in place by hailing him) however brother zephyl is much worse than Hasten.  not only will brother zephyl continue to wander if not hailed but he will actually despawn in about a minute if not hailed!  When i teleported out of rm I was omw to get the encumbrance cash at bank and then pickup benedan from CS.  I had no clue that I was needed to track brother zephyl and lead limbino there or that i should hail Brother zephyl.  I had actually started tracking brother zephyl after he popped because I was curious but then i remembered that time was short for nuttin and limbino and that ben was already available for pickup and I had already said I was omw so I repressed my curiosity and teleported out to misty for banking.  Anyway the moral of the story is that if you pop this guy don't go anywhere or do anything.  Track and hail or he is gone forever.<br>
I also would like to suggest that any time we get this guy to pop we should as a guild head out to kill him unless deep in another raid.  I think using the encumbrance and crappy weapon tactics we should be able to take him down with our usual evening numbers so long as we are willing to drop things long enough to try it out.  I am hoping we can try again after the dragon raid on saturday unless we kill him so many times friday that no other monks need the drops he has.<br>

They must have had some other reason for killing him or they could have just waited about 1 (one) minute for his despawn.   no joke, that is about how fast he despawns.<br>

I think he may have disappeared off of limbers tracking randomly as happens from time to time with druid tracking.  Steepcrawl and I saw him walking around RM for a good long time without despawning a few hours after Limbino, nuttin and I first spawned him.  We even gave him a 4/60 2hb pos but he would not use it.  Presumably race restrictions must matter for npc weapon usage as the staff that limbino asked me to keep earlier *was* used by brother Z.  Both weapons were monk useable but only the second weapon was human useable.  He'll probably still be using it when the raid starts tommorow as I don't think anybody will kill him between then and now.  I will look for a human monk useable uber huge delay 2hb late friday night for us to use on the next attempt (hopefully Saturday after our weekly dragon raid if I can get him to spawn again).  a rusty two handed hammer looks like a good choice.  How many monks do we have who are ready for this step of their epic?<br>

I've now gone back and seen that another one of our melees are doing this Vox thing too. I'm not sure what kind of guild I have joined here, I've never seen this kind of thing happen before... Posting a guild event on the calendar and the people you need most, bailing on you to do a raid with a group on non-guild people. It's gotta be one of the most selfish things I've ever seen, and I'm mad as hell right now. What can I do about it? Well, That remains to be seen but needless to say, it will not be forgotten by me. Yeah, I'm upset and I'm speaking my mind because what is happening here goes COMPLETELY against my belief in what a guild is and what I thought I was joining. This is the first time I've asked for the guild's help, and this is what I get. Not kewl, not kewl at all. Maybe this will turn out for the better, maybe enough people will be there tonite, but if I'm short a few people that happen to be off in Vox land and I have to cancel to keep from a senseless TPW, I'm gonna be even more angry than I am right now.<br>
