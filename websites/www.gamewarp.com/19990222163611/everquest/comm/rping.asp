<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How art thou?  Fare thee well?  Might I buy thy wares?  We've seen these and even worse attempts at roleplaying.  Does spouting off a few sentences (via macros no less) of "olde English" make you a roleplayer?  No, no more than being a kewl d00d pk0r (PK is player killer, someone who kills OTHER players rather than computer controlled monsters and people) makes you evil.  Roleplay involves much more than that.

True roleplaying is very hard to find on any "online" game, most people are too busy amassing wealth and fortune and not busy interacting with everyone around them.  In Ultima Online (UO) this was painfully evident.  Most people were actually distrustful of other people (the rampant PKing probably didn't help much).  

What is involved in roleplaying?  What can you do to make a better more "alive" character?  <BR><BR>

Building your history.<BR><BR>

The first thing to assuming a role is having a history, how will your character react to a situation is determined by his past experiences.  Your history can be made up, like a story, or it can be rooted in past gaming.  My "main" character that I take from game to game is Grimster, borne of death, he's the ultimate chaotic machine.  Most times he's ruthless and cunning and totally devoid of compassion, but his chaos is real, some people have met him online and been given rare and exotic items, been helped thru a particularly foul place or helped out in various ways, only to meet him later and be ruthlessly slaughtered.  Grimster started in DSO after "his parents" were killed by PKs (my other characters) so Grimster came into being as an avenue for revenge.  To say he's hated is an understatement.  This also happens to be my overall online persona as well.  His history is rooted within the games.  Then you have another of my characters (I only roleplay with at most 3 characters at one time ever, any more and I feel I'm being spread out too thin) known as QuickSilver (or other names) he's your typical rogue.  His history began in UO and is only now beginning to become "game rooted" as opposed to "created" in my own mind.  He's flamboyant, usually has tongue firmly in cheek, and is typically liked by many (except for those who had their purses lightened by his nimble fingers).  As time goes on and I move from game to game (EQ is next it seems) his history will flesh out more.<BR><BR>

Some people will play under name after name after name, when asked "who are you" in a chat channel (IRC) they'll list off a dozen names.  How can you roleplay this many people?  How can you invest the time and effort into building this many "lives" without the obvious affects of sleep deprivation getting you fired from your job?  Sometimes people seem incredulous that I only play under 2, sometimes 3 names.  I will often have "mule" characters since the game of UO required it (DSO didn't really require mules), these are strictly automatons and have no history and serve only as slaves to my "real" characters.  Hopefully Everquest will not require this breach of roleplay integrity on my part.<BR><BR>

Staying in Character<BR><BR>

You just left the dungeon with bags bulging, and out pops a PK and waxes you post-haste, bye bye loot.  Your first impulse is to begin bitching in a most furious manner, threats against his life, family, his dog, hell, threats to hunt him down and kill him are not unheard of.  This is wrong wrong wrong, you just left your roleplay far behind and are now being, basically, an asshole.  Sure it's fine to be mad, heck you just spent 3 hours chasing orcs all over creation to lop off their heads and now some punk has taken it all.  But keep in character and keep the insults in character. 

It's far too often we see totally OOC (out of character) chatter, I've been guilty of it myself, I'm not here to preach the holier than thou message.  I'm trying to point out how this totally blows the roleplay veneer away.  Whenever possible keep your online persona "in tune" with how he should be.

This also includes using knowledge one character gains to benefit another character you have, such as, your thief stumbles upon a rival guild's guildhouse so your mage just happens to visit them a mere twenty minutes later, this is bad roleplaying (yes guilty) and should be avoided.  But sometimes the information is just too juicy to not use, by all means use it, but at least attempt to justify it.
<BR><BR>
Interaction<BR><BR>

If you roleplay in the forest and no one sees, is it still roleplaying?  Think about it.  You must interact with others else you aren't roleplaying, unless you consider roleplaying with the computer roleplay.  Other PEOPLE need to get to know your character and not just computer controlled AI characters.  Get out, join a guild or hunting party.  If you're in a guild get into IRC and talk shit in your hated rival's messageboard (keep as many insults as possible "game related") and maybe visit their IRC channel and have a nice game of "flame pong" with them in real time.  All of these forms of interaction build your character's persona IF you use this interaction in a roleplay setting.  Calling up the guildmaster of your rival guild and cussing him out is NOT roleplay, just in case this wasn't clear.

You don't have to spout off thees and thous all the time but try to make your character "talk" in his correct persona as much as possible, if your character is a sweet elf princess, dog-cussing the PK that just offed you is probably NOT in character, but if you are a burly Dwarven warrior, the screen should positively melt from the vitriole you spew at the asswipe that just severed your bearded head from your neck!<BR><BR>

The Future<BR><BR>

It's a bleak one, more and more kids join the internet everyday, and, unfortunately, many of them think Quake and Quake II are part of the RPG genre.  What can you do?  Keep your head up, most games have an ignore feature, use it on people who obviously have no interest in roleplaying at all.  Bare in mind, they'll most likely quickly bore of any true RPG game and get back to racking up frags and leave you in peace (for the next k00l dewd to piss off).  Maybe, someday, an online game will make a TRUE effort to enforce its age restrictions.  But this is a bit unfair to the younger players as many are great roleplayers and don't deserve to be lumped into the same festering group as the aforementioned l33t d3wdz but the law of averages seems to be against them.

Online RPG's have come a long way, and at the same time, haven't improved at all.  Awesome graphics and neat music doesn't make us better roleplayers.  I can't suggest strongly enough to get some dice, some paper and pencils, and find a group of other roleplaying individuals and do some old fashioned roleplaying.  Sunday afternoons are made for dice!
