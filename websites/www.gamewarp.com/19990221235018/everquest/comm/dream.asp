<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of Norrath is still a mystery to us all.  We do not know what the new land will hold for us.  But just the tiniest hope of finding a new life to live, causes us to drop what we are doing, and gobble up all we can about this promising new place.  Why do we find ourselves entranced by these games?  Sony's game could be a complete flop, or turn out completely of what our dreams are.  Yet we still spend hundreds to thousands of dollars on new equipment to play these "revolutionary games".  

<P>I found myself doing all of the above over the past few months.  I myself am finally upgrading my fossil of a PC to buy the markets best.  I find myself lying in bed at night, dreaming of the possibilities of this new game I will be immersing myself in.  I stop and think of games in the past; what went wrong, why did I lose interest, what makes this different from all other games.  Anyone who is an avid online game player knows that they make speculative statements about a new game coming out.  One good example is one that everyone else seems to be basing their ideas upon is Ultima Online.

<P>Ultima Online was the God sent for the online gaming community.  Everyone speculated about what it would be like to be free to run through the streets and to go adventuring with friends, and to live the life that you cannot in the real world.  The days of speculation came to an end when Origin released the beta version of Ultima, and the gamers weren't let down.  Ultima was revolutionary because of all the barriers it was breaking.  People thought they could do anything!  Alas, the days of testing ended too quickly due to impatient gamers wanting the final version of this wonderful game.  People gathered together, and talked late into the night telling their goals and fantasies in the new world.  The game arrives, people find CD's missing from boxes, early subscribers not getting their games until after it hits the stores, threats of death to OSI and all of their dreams crushed because they had to have their way.  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The game begins filled with bugs and problems, which lead to people being able to make it to the highest rank in certain skills without even working at it.  Without the need to work towards something, people turned to player killing.  Throughout the game, bands of killers would use their skills to kill others for the fun of it.  This was frowned upon by the Origin staff, and many precautions were made so that the player killers would have to live the lives of true murderers; away from society, and everything in the world, left to their own devices and hated by all.  This did not stop most, who just killed more.  They could easily keep on living without any problems.  Origin was befuddled at what to do, and has recently created a new reputation system, almost completely wiping out the chances of being a player killer.


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;So many things went wrong with UO, what makes us think that Everquest will be any better?  I, for one have an active imagination and have been dreaming of all the things I want to do in Everquest.  My friends have told me to stop thinking that way.  We got our hopes up about Ultima and then look what happened.  I have to agree with them in that aspect of the argument, Ultima Online really did let us all down, but being the optimist that I am, I believe that Everquest holds a whole new world of new possibilities for the online community.  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To state all of the aspects of the game would take forever and I don't really have the time, but I think that anyone who is interested enough to read this will know what the possibilities are.  We are left with the ever-burning question of, "What makes a good game?"  I, for one, am a dreamer and love the idea of building a new life in Norrath.  I dream of questing with my friends into deep dungeons and fighting dangerous creatures and building a reputation as whatever I want to be.  This is what makes Everquest special to me.  The idea of having a game where I have to work to get powerful, where I don't have the choice of macroing my character while I go to bed and come back to find myself gained 25% in a skill, where I don't need to worry about killing a few people and being labeled a Pker and being ostracized by society.  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But lets look at the entire picture here.  I am one person, and do not speak for the entire online community.  Of course there will be people out there who exploit bugs, and kill mindlessly and do not think twice about mentioning their problems with their computer while sitting in a local tavern.  The "Quake" generation that has spawned in our land is an unfortunate problem.  The people who kill unmercifully and without thought, just for the fun of the kill.  I, for one am a player killer, but I am not in this sense.  I kill for the purpose of Rping, and I know that many others do too.  People can make up all the excuses they want so they can be a mindless murderer.  "I RP a player killer" a term often heard around the lands of Britannia.  Rping a mindless killer is not Rping.  If you are a dastardly warlord who has a band of warriors who pillage, rape and destroy then you are Rping, but if you come in with a name like Imanewbie or The Undertaker you should be rethinking what game you are playing  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;So who is to say what Everquest will bring to us.  Will it be another Ultima?  Will we have fun in Beta, and have the Gamemasters turn on us and build a protective forcefield around the few goody goodies who scream murder whenever they are killed?  I don't believe so.  Sony was extremely smart to put in their PK switch.  I can't think of a better way to limit Pking.  If you want to live it up and have some fun, you flip the switch on, but if you want to live your life as a guardian of good, then you leave it off.  Simple as that.  No notoriety systems, or all powerful guards of death, they solved Origins problems before the game is even out.  Now I could be jumping the gun, predicting no one will have a problem with the PK switch, but from my years of gaming experience, if you let the people be free, while making rules that are fair and do not take away from the experience, you are going to make the "Ultimate RPG".    

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;So my friends, all we can do is wait.  Soon beta will start, and all the secret doors will magically open and we can explore to our hearts content.  Nobody knows if the game will turn out the way they want it too, but to tell you the truth, you cannot blame the problems on other people.  Blaming others is just a way of avoiding the situation and not dealing with it yourself.  Instead of crying to the GM's about problems with other players, fix it yourself.  Don't make the GM's have to put in stat loss, and immortal guards!  Make your own group of powerful protectors of the land.  Create an army of good who fight against evil, and who will protect the lands from the evil doers.  You and only you hold the key to making the dream come true.
