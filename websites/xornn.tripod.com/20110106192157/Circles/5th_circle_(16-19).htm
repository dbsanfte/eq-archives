<p><em>Xornn stood and concentrated.&nbsp; His brow furrowed as he tried to call upon the
gentle touch of mana all around him.&nbsp; The effort was difficult--it felt unnatural,
and his emotions kept getting in the way.&nbsp; Master Takk had always said he was too
emotional.&nbsp; Even more upset now as his ego began to fight to the surface to argue
that point--emotionally charged, Xornn gave out a short curse.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Try again, Xornn,&quot; exclaimed Rhedd, a look of concern on her face that
she was trying to hide with a flippant smile.&nbsp; Xornn could read the beautiful
fier'dal with ease, and she had never seen the young high elf find difficulty casting a
spell.&nbsp; Xornn turned his back to her, partially from embarrassment, mostly out of
anger--with failing.&nbsp; As her hand snaked out and gripped him by the elbow--more
firmly than he though Rhedd was capable--and Xornn shot an icy glare over his shoulder at
her, the mongrel dog warning the demure feline to watch where it played.</em></p>

<p><em>Then she smacked him--hard.&nbsp; There was an audible clap as her flat hand
snapped him across the cheek, spinning him completely around to face her.&nbsp; His
shrowded, dark blue eyes, trained veils of his character, failed.&nbsp; His body was in a
near convulsion of war between shock and rage, and something more deep-seated... regret.
&nbsp; &quot;You want to give me that glare again!?&quot; she demanded.&nbsp; &quot;I'll
sit here and slap you around if that's what it takes for you to look </em>at<em> me and
not </em>through<em> me!&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Xornn was dumbfounded.&nbsp; Rhedd had never said a harsh word to him, ever in the
years they had traveled together.&nbsp; Now the fierce druid stood here, a foot shorter
than the high elf, but towering over him in stature.&nbsp; &quot;I didn't...
m-mean...&quot; he stammered, but Rhedd interrupted him as she lunged into his chest,
curled her arms under his back, and on her toe-tips pressed her soft lips to his own.</em></p>

<p><em>Whatever semblance of composure the high elf had, it was gone as their lips parted.
&nbsp; Rhedd's eyes were bright and excited, but her cheeks were flush and crimson.
&nbsp; After a moment of silence, she spoke softly, though a stone block may as well have
fallen from the sky and landed on the hut beside them, as well as she cut the silence.
&nbsp; &quot;Now... cast.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Xornn needed a moment to remember what spell he was trying to cast.&nbsp; Her kiss
was so unexpected, and already the high elf missed it.&nbsp; Just then, as he began
clearing his thoughts, a cool breeze struck him--from within.&nbsp; And the floodgates of
mana opened upon him--Rhedd smiled quietly at him, &quot;About time you figured that out.
&nbsp; Now come on, we're late for meeting the others.&quot;&nbsp; The wood elf turned on
her heel and began running along the beach to the north, leaving Xornn standing
dumbfounded to contemplate the meanings of lips pressed recently.</em></p>

<font face="arial, helvetica">

<p></font>Take a moment to pat yourself on the back now.&nbsp; You have reached the
transitional Circle now.&nbsp; It just keeps getting better from here on out.&nbsp; You
now have access to <em>all</em> the tools of our craft, and I'm going to show you how to
use them to maximum effectiveness.&nbsp; The Fifth Circle not only completes your line of
spells, but leaves you holding <em>many</em> key upgrades which you will come to live and
die by:</p>

<p><strong>Breeze - </strong><em>That's right, patient ones, the first in the Clarity
line, added when Ruins of Kunark was released.&nbsp; Increases mana regeneration by 2
mana/tic.&nbsp; Mana regeneration to the best of my research is like this:&nbsp; When
standing, each &quot;tic&quot; you receive 1 mana.&nbsp; If you are sitting this number
increases, I'm guessing to 3 per tic, like HP do (since HP are 1/tic standing also).
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Meditating, you receive (Meditate / 10) per tic, or you Meditate level
per minute.&nbsp; So at 16th, with a Meditate cap of 85, you receive 85 mana per minute of
meditation.&nbsp; However, Breeze gives you 2 mana each of those ticks, whether your
sitting, standing, running, or casting a spell.&nbsp; Breeze gives you 20 mana per minute,
for 27 minutes, all at the bargain price of 35 mana.&nbsp; If you don't run with /roleplay
on, expect a lot of requests for it.&nbsp; I </em>never<em> had this spell not buffed on
me once I got it.&nbsp; (Bought from enchanter merchants in Firiona Vie or The Overthere
strongholds.)&nbsp; When Breeze is buffed, you receive 3 mana/tic standing, 5 mana/tic
sitting, and 10.5 mana/tic meditating.&nbsp; The effects of the clarity line are most
visible when not meditating obviously, as Meditate truly dwarfs the mana regen of Breeze.
&nbsp;&nbsp; However you see the difference over time still.&nbsp; A level 16 enchanter
with 150 Intelligence has around 480 mana.&nbsp; It would take 57 tics for them to regen
to full mana, or 45 tics with Breeze buffed.&nbsp; That means you saved 72 seconds, or 12
seconds per bubble of mana!&nbsp; When in a group, shaving 12 seconds of your regen time
for a bubble of mana is a huge impact, especially when you need mana to re-mez!</em></p>

<p><strong>Chase the Moon - </strong><em>Super-fear.&nbsp; Lasts up to 36 seconds, and I
swear I cast this spell more than Breeze at this level.&nbsp; Has no recast time, unlike
Fear, and resists less, holds longer, and any necromancer to see it in action suddenly
likes reverse-kiting with enchanters!&nbsp; You will use this spell for a long time to
come, especially when partnered with a druid/necro/ranger.</em></p>

<p><strong>Disempower - </strong><em>This impressive debuff affects the target with -20STA
-15STR -9AC cap by 34th.&nbsp; This spell sits near the back of my spellbook.&nbsp; I've
explained the usefulness of debuffs already, and believe me I've tried both ways... Ebbing
Strength + Disempower + Choke is about the equivalent of just casting Languid Pace, if
that, and one of the debuff spread always resists.&nbsp; It's just not worth the time, the
mana, </em>or<em> the spell slots taken up to memorize them all.&nbsp; Still, if there is
someone else in the group to slow the mob's attack speed, lowering the mob's AC will help
the tanks hit it.&nbsp; But attack slow should have priority.&nbsp; Researched from
Tasarin's Grimoire Left &amp; Right page 24.&nbsp; Also purchased in Shaman Guilds.</em></p>

<p><strong>Enchant: Electrum - </strong><em>Turns an electrum bar into and enchanted one
for use with Jewelcrafting.</em></p>

<p><strong>Enthrall - </strong><em>Upgrade to Mesmerize.&nbsp; For 50 mana, it holds the
mob for 48 seconds.&nbsp; This becomes awesome in later levels as fights begin lasting for
up to two minutes.&nbsp; I don't use Enthrall all the time, only when I know I need the
mob to sit still for awhile.&nbsp; Will also be useful at higher levels, as it has no
recast delay, unlike Entrance or Dazzle at 39th and 49th.</em></p>

<p><strong>Identify - </strong><em>It's supposed to tell you stuff about Lore items.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the last page of my spellbook, and it's never worked on any Lore
item I cast it on.&nbsp; To be fair though I only tried about four items..</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Barbarian - </strong><em>You're tall, blind, and have face-paint of
some sort.</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Dwarf - </strong><em>You're short, have infravision, and have
face-hair, regardless of gender.&nbsp; (Correction:&nbsp; Apparently only one female dwarf
face has a beard.</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Tree - </strong><em>Just like Minor Illusion, you get fairly neutral
faction with this illusion.&nbsp; Often times, Tree is better when there is nothing to
turn into nearby, or you want to look inconspicuous while hiding.&nbsp; I stayed a tree
for an hour in Mistmoore Castle one night while watching one train after another just trot
by me, killing the poor bastard next to me who's invisibility broke.</em></p>

<p><strong>Invisibility vs Undead - </strong><em>Very powerful spell, though I only use it
to traverse across Kithicor Forest.&nbsp; Does exactly what it says, must target group
member.&nbsp; For some reason, your pet classifies as undead too, because he commits
suicide when you cast this.&nbsp; (After more checking, I've found this spell less useful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In dungeons of undead is very useful, but for the occasional wanderer
you can't keep both invis and invis to undead up at the same time.)&nbsp; Maximum duration
(random) of 27 minutes.</em></p>

<p><strong>Levitate - </strong><em>Another very handy utility spell, requires a Bat Wing
for spell regent.&nbsp; Mobs cross elevation slower than levitating people, so actually
useful to flee in hilly areas.&nbsp; Allows you to stay above most water, and you drop
slowly rather than plummet from cliffs.&nbsp; I use this spell in chasm areas, deserts,
and crossing large bodies of water.&nbsp; Encumberance won't affect a levitating person as
badly, either--but it's not a massive aid.&nbsp; Researched with Tasarin's Grimoire Left
&amp; Right page 23.&nbsp; You can also buy this in any Shaman guild.</em></p>

<p><strong>Mesmerization - </strong><em>This is the big-dog.&nbsp; Area Effect Mez.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The area is pretty large, and you need to just experiment to figure it
out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason you need to discover the range well is because it's
possible to catch yourself in the AE.&nbsp; No one in your party need worry, but catching
yourself is very embarrasing.&nbsp; During dungeon-crawls, if the puller brings in 4 mobs,
after they arrive and swarm around the tank, I target the tank, then fire off
Mesmerization, and watch four &quot;&lt;mob&gt; has been mesmerized.&quot; messages scroll
up, followed by one yellow indication of mez breaking.&nbsp; (That's the mob the tank is
fighting.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of the mobs politely sit still for 24 seconds, at
which point I re-mez them before it breaks and calmly return to meditating.&nbsp; </em>This<em>
spell is what defines the enchanter as you advance through the Circles.&nbsp; Mesmerize,
Enthrall, and Mesmerization do </em>not<em> stack, and you must let one expire before
putting on another.&nbsp; For example, if you have been AE Mezzing three mobs, and you
want to switch to Enthrall on them, you'd best root them or something while they're under
the AE mez, and when the effect breaks quickly Enthrall them.&nbsp; I recommend just
layering the AE mez on until there's only one mob.&nbsp; You want to have a massive CHA
for doing crowd control in groups, as mezzing four mobs at once leaves you very likely to
get a resist on one, which means you have a pissed off mob trying to show you how much he
appreciates you trying to stun him.&nbsp; This can be bad, and learning to calmly Color
Flux/Enthrall that mob becomes critical to you not dying, quickly.&nbsp; Researched from
Tasarin's Grimoire Left &amp; Right page 26.&nbsp; You <strong>must</strong> research this
one folks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See below for notes on researching.</em></p>

<p><strong>Quickness - </strong><em>We got Languid Pace to start off the attack speed
debuff line, and now you have Quicken to start of the the attack speed </em>buff<em> line.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting out at 28% haste at 16th, and capping at a 30% increase to
attack speed by 20th, you will quickly find your pet </em>shines<em> with this buff on.
&nbsp;&nbsp; (The actual formula EQ uses for this is somewhat of a mystery, but with a pet
swinging 40 times per minute normally, Quickness will give 12 extra attacks in that time
period!&nbsp; 30% attack speed increase is literally a 23% decrease in attack delay,
changing from 3.0 seconds to 2.3 seconds.)&nbsp; Only has a duration of 11 minutes, but
it's well worth the cast on your pet or tanks, and will become vital to every group.
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a group that has three tanks, keeping Quickness on all of them, swinging
2.5 times every 2.5 seconds (180 attacks per minute, 60 per tank) will result in 54 extra
attacks!&nbsp; With a mana cost of 80, for 240 mana every ? minutes (it's a duration that
increases as you level, just time it) you've just added a 4th tank to the group that never
needs healing!&nbsp; That's indirect damage at its best.</em></p>

<p><strong>Rune I - </strong><em>This is a targetted damage absorber.&nbsp; It will cause
the first 27 damage the receiver takes to be absorbed at 16th capping at 55 damage by 21st
level--though it will not prevent stuns and interrupts--before the shield fades.&nbsp; You
need a Cat's Eye Agate to fuel this spell, and quite frankly mobs do 55 damage in two
swings at this level.&nbsp; It's really not worth it to use in most cases.&nbsp; But some
enchanters keep it memmed in their &quot;swap slot&quot; (usually the eighth slot, where
you mem your different buffs for casting, and frequently change the spell--enchanters are
the only class that </em>truly<em> needs a swap-slot) to drop an emergency rune when the
Cleric is trying to heal.&nbsp; However, I don't mean to write this spell off.
&nbsp;&nbsp; During soloing, that Rune will often last two or three fights, and your loot
off one mob will usually cover the cost of the gem.&nbsp; I wouldn't drop it on the pet,
but it's worth considering putting on yourself, as that's hit points you don't normally
have.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sanity Warp - </strong><em>We finally get our upgrade to Chaotic Feedback!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This spell starts off at 88 damage for 75 mana, and finishes at 95
damage by 23rd level.&nbsp;&nbsp; More efficient that Chaotic Feedback, it has a our
magic-induced stun attached, and also has a casting time of 2.75 seconds, with a recast
delay of 8.0 seconds.&nbsp; Still, it's an improvement that was sorely awaited, and only
wizards and mages are nuking out of our league at this point.&nbsp; This spell is a
heavy-duty taunt, especially compared to most classes' primary nuke.&nbsp; It's a
side-effect of the stun.</em></p>

<p><strong>Shalee's Animation - </strong><em>Axe and shield still, needs 2 Tiny Daggers to
cast it.&nbsp; I've seen this pet hit for 12 to 20 damage now--I've been informed that the
16th level pet hits for 20, leaving a level range of 12th-16th level--and double-attacks
much more commonly now!&nbsp; It's strikes (and all pets from 12th on) are magical, and
combined with Quickness you will just shrivel at the damage it can put out.&nbsp; The hit
points are nothing to celebrate though, so get used to making fights either very fast to
keep your pet alive, or find a way to keep it from getting hit.&nbsp; I highly recommend
resummoning pets till you get a good one now (18 to 20 point hits), as Tiny Daggers aren't
expensive--however as long as you get 16 or better (fairly common) you should be alright.</em></p>

<p><strong>Shielding - </strong><em>The next in the line of self only buffs all pure
casters get, +46HP +12AC +12MR at 16th, capping at +50HP by 20th, and +14AC by 21st level.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Really getting impressive now, and you should always have it buffed, 50 mana
to cast and a 36 minute duration.</em></p>

<hr align="center">

<p>Before preparing to level, you should do the following:</p>

<p>If solo, you should have Breeze, Mist, and Shielding up, and your pet should have
Strengthen, Mist, and Quicken.&nbsp; You'll need to keep Quicken in a spell slot most
likely, as you'll be renewing it a lot.&nbsp; Optionally, keep Rune I up on yourself all
the time if you might get hit.&nbsp; That little buffer can really come in handy.</p>

<p>When grouped, plan on keeping Breeze on all casters at all times, and Quicken on the
tanks, this mana load may seem prohibitive, but it's the most efficient way for you to
affect the combat--mana regen and haste effects are the enchanter's realm of mastery, and
you should start getting used to throwing out short duration, high casting cost haste
spells repeatedly.&nbsp; I suggest getting some sort of timer to keep at your computer for
timing when you have 1 minute left in the haste duration.&nbsp; Strenghten and Mist will
need to go around as usual, though there's usually someone else to handle those buffs if
your group has any size at all.&nbsp; It's hard to discipline yourself to keep Mist and
Shielding on yourself at all times, but when that resisting mob rushes you after a mez
gone bad, you won't regret having taken the time.&nbsp; If mana is tight, Mist can fade,
but Shielding is a <em>must</em>.</p>

<p>One thing you need to learn now; if you're not casting or targeting, you need to be
meditating.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; Mana management is what you're going to have to get <em>very</em>
good at as you progress in levels, especially when you're out of mana, you just enthralled
the stray mob that can kill you in ten seconds, and the group is taking another two
minutes to kill the current mob.&nbsp; You have to find the mana to re-enthrall that puppy
at least two more times, and the only way to do this is meditate and watch those
mana-tics, 6 seconds a tic.&nbsp; When you hit 6 tics, stand up and re-mez, then drop down
and start watching.&nbsp; If you time it right, you can even sit again before the next
tic.&nbsp; Every 36 seconds allows you time to recast on a resist, or to let the party
know you're about to need some <em>serious</em> assitance.&nbsp; Okay, enough of this, on
to the strategies, the most familar ones first:</p>

<p><strong>Kamikaze-Solo - </strong><em>The animation just keeps doing more and more
damage.&nbsp; (I was calling him Mr. Quiet Guy at this point.)&nbsp; Tashan pull, Languid
Pace, and your Quickened pet proceeds to just </em>wail<em> on the thing while you lob in
Sanity Warps.&nbsp; Color Flux/Root is a wonderful tool to get the mob attacking your pet
again, and outside of Quicken making your pet do more than its already impressive damage
output, Kamikaze-Solo doesn't see much change.&nbsp; Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Sanity Warp,
Choke, Color Flux, Root, Enthrall, Languid Pace, Tashan, Swap Slot</em></p>

<p><strong>Reverse-Kite-Partner - </strong><em>Replace Fear with Chase the Moon, and
upgrade to Sanity Warp for the nuke.&nbsp; Pretty much the same drill otherwise.
&nbsp; Reverse-Kiting blues is a joke with a partner, as you and your pet could handle
that easily; however, if you can find a steady supply of blues, you will see about the
same xp because of low down-time as opposed to white/yellow mob, which are also viable
options.&nbsp; Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Sanity Warp, Choke, Color Flux, Root, Enthrall, Chase
the Moon, Tashan, Swap Slot</em></p>

<p><strong>Group Tactics - </strong><em>I've covered all of your roles in group--AE Mez is
the huge change to the battle plan.&nbsp; Note that having AE Mez doesn't mean the party
should depend on it; it means that you can take 3 to 5 mob pulls.&nbsp; Remember that when
mobs resist </em>you<em> are the first to get attacked for it.&nbsp; Demand that the
healer keep you at full health all the time, and anyone able to Root/Snare/Stun is
responsible for helping you gain control of stray mobs.&nbsp; Landing mez on a pissed off
mob is possible, especially with Color Flux--but what if it resists </em>that<em>?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to fear because the wizard just rooted it for you so you can drop
Enthrall on it and get back to medding.&nbsp; In situations where you don't have several
mobs to mez, you drop that Languid Pace and meditate, because you need to always be
raising your mana back up.&nbsp; Try to stagger your buffing, say dropping Quicken on the
tanks, next Breezing everyone, then after the next pull dropping Mist around if needed.
&nbsp; That way you can manageably keep the buffs on people without having to hold up the
pulling of the group while they wait for you to get mana.&nbsp; I usually buff myself
before buffing the party (unless something like Quickness) so that when it starts flashing
on my screen I know it's time to refresh.&nbsp; The tanks love it (as well as the casters)
when Quicken stops flashing before they can inform you it's fading.&nbsp; With a spell
like Quicken that has a a short duration, just get used to how many pulls it lasts, and
have them send you a /tell when time to renew if you haven't caught it, or keep an egg
timer or something nearby set to 1 minute minute before in will fade, and start rebuffing
in that last minute--this saves spam on the party, and makes you look really good too,
since they never see anyone asking for buff renewals.&nbsp; If you can do </em>all<em>
this buffing, keep crowd control mezzing in order, and find the time to drop Languid Pace
once and awhile, the groups will beg you to stay when you decide to go.&nbsp; When I was
19th level, I had groups volunteering to pay for teleports if I would come group with
them.&nbsp; Many times I didn't even know more than one person in the group.&nbsp; A bad
enchanter leaves a horrible taste upon the group that they long remember.</em></p>

<p><em>But a great enchanter leaves something rich that they will never forget.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enchanters make the group fight faster, safer, better, and against odds
that would normally flatten the party.&nbsp; Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Sanity Warp, Choke, Color
Flux, Root, Enthrall, Languid Pace, Swap Slot.&nbsp; If you want to put damage on the mob,
Choke is usually the best idea to avoid aggro, but sometimes a good Sanity Warp is what
ends the fight.&nbsp; Just be sure you have the mana free to do this.&nbsp; Charm and/or
Mesmerization are great spells to put in place of Choke.&nbsp; You don't want DOTs around
with Mesmerization anyway, and with Charm it might be a good idea to have a heavy hitting
nuke prepped for launch.</em></p>

<p><em>Bear in mind it is not only acceptable to have no offensive spells ready (save
possibly Charm) while grouped, but advantageous.&nbsp; Your job in a large group is almost
always crowd control, buffing secondary.&nbsp; The more options you have available, the
better you will do.&nbsp; Leave nukes and DOTs to those more suited (wizards, mages,
necromancers)--your going to be keeping the party alive, not the mobs dead.</em></p>

<p><strong>Charm-Solo - </strong><em>Let me explain in the simplest terms what the goal of
charm soloing is, just to level a bit of reality on you:</em> 

<ul>
  <li><em>Find a mob that you probably can't kill without seriously helping your animation.</em></li>
  <li><em>Cast a spell that makes the same mob your pet for a </em>random<em> duraton.</em></li>
  <li><em>Attack another mob that you can't kill without seriously helping</em> <em>your
    animation.</em></li>
  <li><em>Pray that the first mob stays your pet long enough to kill the second mob.</em></li>
  <li><em>Make the first mob no longer your pet </em>on purpose<em> (making it ultra-aggro to
    you) and kill it.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>That's all there is to it, really.&nbsp; Charm sometimes holds for 5 minutes.
&nbsp; Other times it holds for 5 seconds.&nbsp; Just for those of you who aren't math
wizards, if charm breaks during the fight, that's </em>two<em> very aggro mobs rushing
you.&nbsp; Now I'll tell you how to get through a charm-solo, </em>planning<em> on the
charm to fail.</em></p>

<p><em>You first find two mobs to make fight each other.&nbsp; Charming a mob and then
looking for something to attack with it is just increasing the chance for the charm to
break right in the middle of the fight, which gets you killed.&nbsp; Very often, this is
unavoidable, but that's your own risk you must take upon yourself if you so choose.</em></p>

<p><em>To summarize again, Charm-Soloing involves one of three stages:</em> 

<ol>
  <li><em>Gaining control.</em> </li>
  <li><em>Re-Gaining control.</em> </li>
  <li><em>Re-Gaining control.</em> </li>
</ol>

<p><em>And really, this is it.&nbsp; You must get control of your pet and start the fight.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fight itself is a joke--because you don't care if your pet wins or not
really.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it should actually die for some reason, it will have severely
crippled the other mob for you to finish it off.&nbsp; The mop-up of the fighting isn't
the hard part--it's dealing with Charm breaking.&nbsp; If you can stay calm in the face of
certain death and regain control of your foes, you're ready to charm-solo.&nbsp; For more
detailed disussions, read Tactics--Charm.</em></p>

<p><em>Spell Lineup (volatile):&nbsp; Sanity Warp, Charm, Color Flux, Root, Enthrall (or
Mesmerize), Mesmerization, Swap Slot (Rune).&nbsp; The reason I moved Charm and put
Mesmerize lies under two motivations.&nbsp; Firstly, DOTs on a mob you might have to mez
are bad.&nbsp; You close down our safest escape route that way.</em></p>
