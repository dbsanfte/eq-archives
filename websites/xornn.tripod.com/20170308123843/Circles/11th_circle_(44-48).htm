<p><em>&quot;She's beautiful,&quot; replied Rhedd, enraptured by the majestic demigod's
sweeping strides and underlying grace of power.</em></p>

<p>I've spent some time playing around in the Eleventh Circle, and now I'm ready to share
the news of what you should expect to encounter!&nbsp; First off, let's examine our new
spells:</p>

<p><strong>Arch Shielding - </strong><em>The last in the line of our personal shieldings,
and a damned impressive one at that.&nbsp; 200 mana to cast, thats alright because it
lasts for 72 minutes, granting +144 HP, +26 AC, and +20 MR at 44th.&nbsp; +150 HP by 50th,
and +27 AC at 48th.&nbsp; Actually very difficult to renew before it fades, unless you
have the spell memmed already.&nbsp; Spells &quot;blink&quot; for about 16 seconds, and
the casting time on this one is 12 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Took me awhile to get used to
holding still for this one to finish casting.&nbsp; My trick is to buff Shade, then wait
about 30 seconds to buff Arch Shielding.&nbsp; When Shade starts to blink I know it's time
to renew Arch Shielding.</em></p>

<p><strong>Boon of the Garou - </strong>Targetted<em> werewolf illusion, must target group
member.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; First off, everyone in the group will want this spell, just get
used to it.&nbsp; Secondly, it's a great buff for the tanks, but they must be 44th to get
the spell.&nbsp; Besides making them look like a werewolf, it also gives +100 DEX and +50
ATK, and a proc effect of Lifetap for 27-28 damage.&nbsp; The spell costs 100 mana, has a
1.5 second cast time, and a 3 minute recast delay.&nbsp; The duration is your level times
6 seconds, so 4 minutes and 24 seconds at 44th, capping at 6 minutes by 60th.</em></p>

<p><strong>Brilliance - </strong><em>If getting INT and CHA both to 200 seemed like an
impossible goal, this targetted buff will really help a lot.&nbsp; Caps out at a 14INT
6WIS raise at 52nd, starting at +12 INT at 44th.&nbsp; Every point of INT you have (or WIS
for WIS-casters) gives you your level / 5 in mana.&nbsp; That's 140 mana above your normal
cap at level 50 for other casters, but if it starts fading at a bad time, you've got room
to recast it, because they've got to hit full mana before they truly benefit from this
spell.&nbsp; I'm most pleased with the spell as it made reaching the 200INT 200CHA barrier
much more attainable.&nbsp; [Note: I've since abandoned the 200 INT/CHA line, though I can
hit it rather easily now.&nbsp; I've become more concerned with AC/HP/Mana now.&nbsp; CHA
impacts my charming, and little else, so INT is only looked at in terms of how much mana
it yields me, basically.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Color Skew - </strong><em>A third AE stun spell to use, finally!&nbsp; It's an
8 second stun according to the spell data, but I just don't really pay much attention
anymore..&nbsp; At 60 mana, this is the same as dropping the other two stuns on a mob.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, </em>total<em> stun locks are now not only possible by
chaining all three spells together, but really easy.&nbsp; At 44th level, with 200 INT, I
have roughly 1720 mana to play with, or about 352 mana per bubble.&nbsp; Roughly 3
complete rounds of stun-locking with all three spells will be about 1 bubble of mana.
&nbsp; Getting the timing right, that means the mob is held locked for 51 seconds. &nbsp;
I've got mixed feelings on dedicated stun locking right now.&nbsp; Many times I use
Flux/Shift on a double pull of the same mob type so I can get a look at which one is
losing life without the tanks getting wailed on.&nbsp; I've gone up to Flux/Skew now for
that purpose, and while Shift/Skew will actually allow a total stun-lock, I find that when
devoting to the task I'd rather just Flux/Shift/Skew.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far it hasn't taken
more than two cycles, which ended up to be about half a bubble of mana spent after taking
Clarity into account.&nbsp; Great addition to the lineup still.&nbsp; However, I still
haven't been able to cast Cajoling Whispers, even with it up.&nbsp; I suggest using
Mesmerize to hold the mob still while you re-charm.&nbsp; Research Nitilims Grimoire page
115 &amp; 116.</em></p>

<p><strong>Discordant Mind - </strong><em>Long-awaited DD upgrade.&nbsp; 6.1 second
casting time is getting huge now, but the 508-528 direct damage (at 48th) is just awesome.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 220 mana our nuke is on par with mages again... who are tossing
580-600 for 250 mana at the equivalent levels.&nbsp; The recast however, at 8 seconds,
isn't on par with anyone but the enchanter you see standing in the mirror.&nbsp; Anarchy
becomes the new filler for the recast delay, and with a good damage level, isn't bad.
&nbsp; While of course our new nuke isn't going to see a ton of group usage, solo and
partner capabilities are going to vastly improve.</em></p>

<p><strong>Extinguish Fatigue - </strong><em>35 mana targetted stamina regen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refreshes the whole bar, and as Celerity has probably started so show
you, these tanks really do start running out of stamina.&nbsp; Don't let this spell slip
too far back in your spellbook because you're likely going to use it.&nbsp; Still, clerics
will usually be casting this before you, but there will be times the healers are busy
healing, and you've already done your jobs for the battle.&nbsp; Go ahead and give the
tanks their stamina then... they've earned it.&nbsp; Research Nitilims Grimoire 351 &amp;
352 or buy from cleric vendors.</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Werewolf - </strong><em>Mwuahahahahahaaa!&nbsp; This is our last
illusion, and the damned coolest one you're going to see.&nbsp; Seems to be the same KoS
factor as the elementals are, and I've </em>heard<em> that you will get friendly faction
from the Frontier Mountains mountain giant fortress.&nbsp; Haven't had opportunity to test
this yet.&nbsp; Besides looking totally cool looking, and scaring the crap out of newbies
when you rush at them, this gives you up to 61 to your ATK rating, and a 40% haste buff.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can even combine it with Celerity for some mind numbing swing
speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is no practical use for swinging in a group, when
you're being rushed in a solo situation, what would it hurt to just hit the mob once as it
arrived?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I use Werewolf + Celerity when I want to train my
one-handed blunt during reverse kiting.</em></p>

<p><strong>Incapacitate - </strong><em>Upgrade to Listless Power.&nbsp; Truly amazing
amounts of debuffing now... for 150 mana, this 8 minute duration spell will drops -49 STR,
-49 AGI, and -22 AC from the mob at 44th, capping at -55 STR &amp; AGI, -24 AC at 50th.
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the AC drop will be slightly beneficial, the rest has little impact on
the mob for the mana spent.&nbsp; More on the debuff spread later.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pillage Enchantment - </strong><em>This sees an extreme amount of use with the
commonality of damage shields on higher level mobs.&nbsp; Kills 4 buffs on a mob with
virtually no failure rate.&nbsp; 70 mana a shot.&nbsp; Research Nitilims Grimoire page 35
&amp; 36.</em></p>

<p><strong>Rune IV - </strong><em>Hmmm.&nbsp; Well... this one costs 236 mana, compared to
149 mana for Rune III--58% more mana cost.&nbsp; Stops 394 damage max at level 50,
compared to 230 for Rune III--71% more damage stopped.&nbsp; Looking good right?
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spell regents... Peridot, 10.5 platinum for each one, or Rune III's Jasper at
0.787 platinum--that is correct, 1234% increase to cost of the spell regent.&nbsp; (I know
the percentage looks goofy, but it's correct.)&nbsp; So... if you cast Rune III </em>fourteen<em>
times, you've finally exceeded the cost of Rune III.&nbsp; Rune IV </em>will<em> stop more
damage, but the cost for the damage stopped is staggering.&nbsp; The primary advantage of
Rune III is that I've looted well over 8 gold each time I have to renew the rune, whereas
this new rune won't last 13 times as long as Rune III.&nbsp; Therefore I'm not looting
10.5 platinum each time it runs out.&nbsp; Not even close.&nbsp; I won't be using this
one, not for awhile anyway.</em></p>

<p><strong>Shiftless Deeds - </strong><em>Upgrade to Tepid Deeds, amazing spell.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Single handedly the most effective passive damage stopper we have (stun
locking doesn't allow you to meditate).&nbsp; Costs 200 mana to cast, with a 6 second
casting time, will decrease attack rate by 49% at 44th level, capping at 65% by 60th.
&nbsp; A mob with an attack delay of 30 will swing every 6 seconds after this lands.
&nbsp; Halves damage output of the mob, flat-out.&nbsp; Research page 300 &amp; 301.</em></p>

<p><b>Summon Companion - </b><i>A spell added during the class balancing days of
EverQuest, most pet classes get this spell, and luckily the enchanter qualified
as a pet class.&nbsp; Casting this simple spell will cause your pet to teleport
to you from anywhere in the zone, as long as it's hate list is clear.&nbsp; If
it's fighting something, it won't work.&nbsp; Very handy if you should lose
track of Mr. Kamikaze, especially while either killing greens in a dungeon where
pathing can make him wander off, or after running across a zone faster than the
animation can move.&nbsp; As a side note, because the animation tries to sit
northwest of you at all times, if you sit in the northwest corner of a room, it
will typically move to the center of that room and &quot;freeze&quot;.&nbsp; I
refer to this as &quot;chanter guarding&quot;.</i></p>

<p><strong>Tashania - </strong><em>Another upgrade... to Tashania.&nbsp; 30 mana and 1
second casting time, unresistable and -31 MR at 44th, -33 MR at 48th.&nbsp; Do you need to
hear anything else?&nbsp; Old World Coin quest in Temple of Solusek Ro to get spell.</em></p>

<p><strong>Weakness - </strong><em>Next in the Weaken-line, upgrade to Insepid Weakness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -59 STR at 44th, capping at -65 STR by 50th.&nbsp; Used in conjunction
with Incapacitate and Suffocate, we're talking about staggering levels of debuffing.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Snaring mobs like this </em>is <em>possible, but it needs some finessing to
work... more later.&nbsp; Sucks up 120 mana for its 6 minute duration.</em></p>

<p><strong>Yeogreff's Animation - </strong><em>Only one more pet left now... this one uses
two Tiny Daggers, and need 250 mana.&nbsp; This will provide a level range of 30th
(hitting for 36 max) to 34th (hitting for 44 max).&nbsp; Now at 44th level, a 33-34 mob is
blue, which means only 40% of your pets are going to be blue now.&nbsp; While I was
repeatedly reading and being told that our pets would be quad-hitting by now, I'll tell
you what I've seen.&nbsp; Typically double-hits for near maximum damage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally a triple hit, but not real common yet.&nbsp; I've seen a
few &quot;quad&quot; hits, which were actually a double attack with the primary weapon, a
dual wield attack (try to hand it blunt objects so I can see which weapon is hitting),
followed by a bash.&nbsp; I have never seen a true &quot;slash slash crush crush&quot; in
one round of swings.&nbsp; Whether or not I will in the Twelfth Circle remains to be seen,
guess I'll find out in five levels.&nbsp; I'm still pretty happy with this pet, outside of
how low level it is.&nbsp; The level cap for 39th was a 31st pet, and after hitting 44th I
find out the 34th is the best I can hope for.&nbsp; I suppose that's been the real
dissapointment for me is the hit points.&nbsp; Our animation dies so </em>easily<em> now,
especially with how hard mobs are hitting at this level.</em></p>

<hr align="center">

<p><strong>Buffs-Solo - </strong><em>On myself sits, Clarity, Augmentation, Shade, and
Arch Shielding, plus I often have Rune III up.&nbsp; The pet always gets Celerity, Shade,
and Feedback.&nbsp; I also make sure to carry around a few lightweight weapons to hand the
pet, to maximize his attack rate.&nbsp; It can't take much damage, which is why</em></p>

<p><strong>Buff-Group - </strong><em>Add Brilliance to the INT casters when you've got
spare mana.&nbsp; Same issue of being extra mana for them when they hit full, so consider
it one of the lower priority buffs to toss on people.&nbsp; You'll be dropping Celerity
like there's no other spell at this point, even keeping three to four tanks hasted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are the mainstay of your fighting force, and Celerity makes a huge
impact on the passive damage... look at it this way.&nbsp; If you have two tanks in the
group, casting Celerity on both of them is like adding a third tank.</em></p>

<hr align="center">

<p><strong>Kamikaze-Solo - </strong><em>How did you know this would be my first area
covered?&nbsp; The new pet didn't blow me away on it's level, but I'm not complaining
about the damage it puts out--too much.&nbsp; Shiftless Deeds is great for prolonging the
animation's life, which I can't describe how needed it is now.&nbsp; The pet takes very
little damage before making a heart-wrenching death gasp now.&nbsp; The success of
Kamikaze-Solo right now lies in a stronger pet and freshly upgraded nuke.&nbsp; Tashania
pull, Shiftless, Discordant Mind, Root, Discordant Mind, and quite honestly it's about
time to loot the mobs or watch the pet finish them.&nbsp; One thing I've started doing
against hill and sand giants is opening with Root, Tashania, Shiftless Deeds,&nbsp; and
throwing Discordant Mind till Root breaks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives my pet a nice head start on
life when the melee begins.</em></p>

<p><em>Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Discordant Mind, Anarchy/Rampage/Rune III/Suffocate/Color Skew,
Color Shift, Root, Entrance, Shiftless Deeds, Tashania, Swap Slot.&nbsp; As you can see,
that second slot has a multitude of choices.&nbsp; Anarchy for chain nuking, Rampage or
Rune III for pet heals, Suffocate for the slow DOT, or even Color Shift for trying to keep
the stun-lock on.&nbsp; (Just requires some creative backpedalling to make time for
Discordant.)</em></p>

<p><em>Against mobs it works on I mez them first then debuff, and finally I've started
soloing casters like the Great Oowomp in Timorous Deep using...</em></p>

<p><strong>Mez-Kiting - </strong><em>I've just started fiddling with this one, mainly when
I'm bored or want to camp a caster like a spectre in Feerrott or the Great Oowomp in
Timorous Deep.&nbsp; I think this method would actually work from level 8 on, but I'm not
going to list it till someone tests this out and proves it works.&nbsp; Casters have low
hit points but shell out extremely fast damage with nukes.&nbsp; Thus the danger in
fighting them, as we have low hit points and shell out... well... fast damage without the
recast delays.&nbsp; So I load up to fight the Great Oowomp, a nasty ogre shaman by the
Bloated Belly pickup docks.&nbsp; He drops some nasty spells on you, mainly the dots is
what can tear you up.&nbsp; The first time I fought him (level 34 mob by the way) I used a
pet, Tashania hit, and pet is in.&nbsp; I may or may not be DOTed by now, depending on
resists, and Discordant Mind slams home, sucking away almost half his life in one shot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No need to slow a caster, because it won't be swinging at you most of
the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I have to Root him and let him start nailing the pet.&nbsp; The
next Discordant Mind lands, and nearly kills him (sometimes it does because of the pet).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fight over, and pretty easy, depending on what spells landed on me.
&nbsp; His disease based DOT chews away over half my life sometimes.</em></p>

<p><em>So I unsummon my pet, determined to do better than that.&nbsp; When he pops again,
I just cast good old level 4 Mesmerize on him.&nbsp; Bam.&nbsp; Got him, and 24 seconds to
play around now.&nbsp; I drop Tashania followed with a Discordant and watch his life
shrivel away.&nbsp; He begins casting, but Mesmerize lands before he finishes casting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he doesn't cast and rushes me, Flux/Mez locks him back up.&nbsp; The
second Discordant sends him packing, but I re-mez him anyway.&nbsp; Each time I have a
seat for 2 mana tics then stand and blast him again.&nbsp; The mezzing is cheaper than the
mana I get back actually.&nbsp; I chuck Anarchy and loot him, 2 bubs of mana spent, and no
hits taken.&nbsp; Okay... maybe there's something to this mez-kiting thing. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Something I'm going to try next time is Eye of Confusion.&nbsp; It's about the most
amazing way to duel someone, so I'm curious how a casting mob does.&nbsp; If it will just
keep it from rushing straight at me, I'd use it on everything. &nbsp; Mez/Blind/Nuke,
rinse/repeat as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll see soon enough if it works or not.&nbsp; Spell
Lineup:&nbsp; Discordant Mind, Anarchy, Color Shift, Root, Entrance, Mesmerize, Tashania,
Swap Slot.&nbsp; [Note: Eye of Confusion would make the mob wander a little on the way too
you sometimes, but usually it just ensured they will cast on you instead of charging, so
it definitely wasn't worth a spell slot.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Reverse-Kite-Partner - </strong><em>Discordant Mind and a stronger pet, plus
Tashania make this form of fighting extremely easy now.&nbsp; Just pull in the bad guys,
tash/snare/fear and drop a brain-melting bomb on the mob.&nbsp; AE Kiting is very viable
now, if you get a good partner and time the nukes well to make sure they don't split back
up.&nbsp; Two AE-nukers can do some amazing things.&nbsp; Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Discordant
Mind, Suffocate/Gravity Flux, Color Shift, Root, Entrance, Invoke Fear, Tashania, Swap
Slot.</em></p>

<p><strong>Charm-Solo - </strong><em>Color Skew allows you to finally get Cajoling
Whispers cast, NOT.&nbsp; I suggest instead using Mesmerize to cover your re-charming
time.&nbsp; Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Discordant Mind, Cajoling Whispers, Color Shift, Root,
Mesmerize, Shiftless Deeds, Tashania, Swap Slot.</em></p>

<p><strong>Group-Tactics - </strong><em>You're really becoming a diverse caster.&nbsp; If
you want to be called the best, then here is my advice:&nbsp; Know when to use what.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; I've showed you every tactic there is for crowd
control, buffing, debuffing and even some miscellaneous crap.&nbsp; The king of enchanters
at this level isn't the one who always mezzes certain mobs or stun locks when slot A is
properly filled by slot B.&nbsp; You see a caster pull and instinctively decide right then
if you're going to stun-lock.&nbsp; At the same time you call for AE nukes targetted on
yourself.&nbsp; If you're going to be holding the crowd still, you might as well take
advantage of the AE power wizards and druids have to offer you.&nbsp; Watch for the times
when charming is worth the risk, realize when a safe single mezzing strategy is the best
for the group, or when you need to just get your hands dirty and start stun-locking.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will offer one new piece of advice though.&nbsp; Really evaluate the
situation when gunning for AE Mez.&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of resists can mean you're dead very
quickly, and you will usually find that single-target mezzes will mean less healing till
you get them under control.&nbsp; Still, sometimes when there's 5 incoming, an AE mez
followed with skillful stuns, single-mezzes and maybe even some charming is what makes you
the best at what you do.</em></p>

<p><em>Outdoor Lineup:&nbsp; Pillage Enchantment, Color Skew, Color Shift, Root, Entrance,
Shiftless Deeds, Tashania, Swap Slot.&nbsp; Color Skew often gets replaced by Boon of the
Garou, or over Pillage Enchantment when no damage shields to worry about. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Using the charm solo loadout can be staggering.</em></p>

<p><em>Dungeon Lineup:&nbsp; Mesmerization, Color Skew, Color Shift, Root, Entrance,
Shiftless Deeds/Wandering Mind, Tashania, Swap Slot.&nbsp; Color Skew becomes
Beguile/Cajoling occasionally, depending on pulls and my confidence for the day.</em></p>
