<p><em>Jakonis tried to concentrate, to hold his meditations calmly as the fight with the
orcs flared around him in the lair of the Crushbone orcs.&nbsp; The calm his master
instructed was broken and distracted by screams and sounds of melee in the distance, some
three paces away.&nbsp; There was an alarming break in his control, and the high elf
quickly rose to see a dwarven warrior, come to join the fight breaking apart the hypnotic
trance Jakonis had just draped over an orc.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;That's mezzed, damn you!&quot;</em></p>

<hr>

<p>As is true of most Circles, the enchanter gains a multitude of new spells again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of them will see large use for quite some time to come.&nbsp; At a
glance we have:</p>

<p><strong>Alliance - </strong><em>Increases your faction with the target's faction
category.&nbsp; This will only shift you one faction level to the better at best, and if
you are Dubious or worse, it's unlikely that you'll even manage that.&nbsp; Still this is
a good way to sometimes take a merchant from Dubious to Apprehensive and be able to use
them.&nbsp; Combined with Minor Illusion, you can actually get most mobs to Amiable.
&nbsp; (My guess is that Minor Illusion is treated has having no class, religion, race, or
anything, thus base faction modified by your deeds.)&nbsp; Now if only you could </em>move<em>
like that.</em></p>

<p><strong>Bind Sight - </strong><em>Utility spell that we get called weird for using.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows you to see through your target's eyes.&nbsp; May be recast from
new target, but the next destination must be in range of </em>you<em> (spell does not
require LoS).&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly I only use it to have fun.&nbsp; Drains stamina bar
slowly and expires when stamina runs out.</em></p>

<p><strong>Cancel Magic - </strong><em>As mentioned before, this is your first upgrade to
Taper Enchantment.&nbsp; In PvP this may see more use... but I think I've cast it once,
ever.&nbsp; Most spells I would cast it on (like Blind) don't last long enough to even
make it worth it, or occur often enough to warrant memorizing the spell.&nbsp; Removes one
spell effect on success.</em></p>

<p><strong>Chaotic Feedback - </strong><em>Our first DD (direct damage)/stun spell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The damage is 43 to 48 (increases gradually) for 45 mana.&nbsp; At 8th
level this is actually a decent ratio, but the recast delay is horrid at 8 seconds, and
you had better get used to it.&nbsp; Our nukes will always be slow and poky to recover,
and all the other casters will get more and more efficient with their mana.&nbsp; This
spell is magic based, and a resist </em>really<em> blows because of the recast delay
alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure to drop Tashan first.&nbsp; Honestly you will rarely nuke in
group situations, except to stop runners, but you have another spell better for that.
&nbsp; I kept it memmed all the time, but normally as a &quot;if I toss this nuke &lt;so
and so&gt; doesn't die&quot; spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our nukes are very aggrovating to mobs,
and will later be known as &quot;Mega-taunts&quot;.&nbsp; This is because I have seen a
wizard do over 610 damage to a mob with 4 nukes, while I plinked the mob with 150 damage
and a split-second stun (from Chaos Flux), and when Root broke the mob charged me! &nbsp;
The stun on this nuke is instantaneous, but it will interrupt casting every time.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kamikaze-Soloing blossoms with the addition of this spell to our arsenal.</em></p>

<p><b>Enchant: Clay - </b><i>A new spell added in the tradeskill patches some
time ago, this spell turns a brick of clay into an enchanted clay brick, used to
make some specialized pottery items.</i></p>

<p><strong>Enchant: Silver - </strong><em>Turns one silver bar into an enchanted silver
bar.&nbsp; Pretty simple, really.&nbsp; Used to make Enchanted Silver Jewelry.</em></p>

<p><strong>Eye of Confusion - </strong><em>Blinds your target for up to 18 seconds.
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you blind a mob before fearing it, this will cause it to run erratically
sometimes, but not slow it down any.&nbsp;&nbsp; This spell sees plenty of use in PvP I'm
sure, but I have used it very little.</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Gnome - </strong><em>Shortest race in the game--usually goofy
looking--gives infravision.</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Wood Elf - </strong><em>Shortest elf in the game--looks naked because
they can't be enchanters--infravision.</em></p>

<p><strong>Lesser Shielding - </strong><em>Self-only buff.&nbsp; +30HP +9AC +10MR by level
18 (when you will have a replacement spell, go figure).&nbsp; In many cases you will
notice the AC raise you receive from spells is increased; I feel this is due to increasing
Defense skill applifying the effectiveness of AC raises.</em></p>

<p><strong>Mircyl's Animation - </strong><em>Next pet.&nbsp; Requires three daggers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This and all further pets are bought in Highpass Keep from Tarn Vislyn,
an Erudite in the library.&nbsp; This animation hits for 10 to 14 damage now, and I'm not
sure what levels they summon as--anyone want to offer that--and Bashes.&nbsp; Getting to
be very good at shelling out fast damage.</em></p>

<p><strong>Root - </strong><em>Amazing spell, still using it in the 51+ levels. &nbsp;
Keeps the mob from moving--overwrites movement hindering spells like Snare or Clinging
Darkness, and takes priority over Fear.&nbsp; (So a Rooted &amp; Feared mob will behave as
if rooted till it breaks, then run away.)&nbsp; Root costs 30 mana, last up to 48 seconds,
and takes 2 seconds to cast (0.5 seconds faster than Mez).&nbsp; Combined with your pet
and nukes, you really advance in your soloing ability with this spell.&nbsp; The target
makes a save to break the effect every 6 seconds, or every time a direct damage spell
effect lands on it.&nbsp; (Like our nuke or our DD/DOT/Debuff first landing.)</em></p>

<p><strong>See Invisible - </strong><em>Allows you to see invisible mobs.&nbsp; Useful
when keeping your party invisible, and also on PvP servers.&nbsp; Casting See Invisible on
your pet will </em>not<em> keep him alive if you go invisble, and this spell does not make
Shadowed Men visible.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sentinel - </strong><em>For the longest time I have seen this spell as just </em>amazingly<em>
annoying.&nbsp; It centers on the area you cast it (even if you move) and continues to
notify you of any an all movement in that area.&nbsp; It surrounds anyone triggering it
with mana flashes, and you have a constant mana flash around yourself as well while the
spell is going.&nbsp; If you're near the area of effect, you also hear a constant spell
noise.&nbsp; This spell cannot be turned off, and lasts around 5 or 10 minutes.&nbsp; I
cast it off the end of a dock when waiting for the boat by myself so I can run errands in
town, and I also discovered that you get faction hits from mobs that dies in the area of
effect.&nbsp; (Was discovered accidentally at an orc camp.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Soothe - </strong><em>The upgrade to calm.&nbsp; If there were two mobs at an
orc camp and I wanted only one at this level, I just mez one.&nbsp; The other one charges,
the group fights it.&nbsp; I've got 24 seconds till I re-mez or they pull it.&nbsp; I have
never cast this spell--not even once.</em></p>

<hr align="center">

<p>Okay, the first, and most boring thing you need to do is raise your Evocation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chaotic Feedback is the first spell you have of this type, and getting
it to at least 20 is my recommendation if you don't want to sit around having a
fizzle-fest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your cap for 8th level is 45 in Evocation, and I reached
that cap before proceeding.&nbsp; It takes a <em>lot</em> of nuking your pet to get there,
but it's worth it when you never fizzle this mana hog.</p>

<p>Root and Chaotic Feedback, plus a pet upgrade really transform your ability to
Kamikaze-Solo, by crossing it with a technique known as Root-Kiting.</p>

<p>Root-Kiting is what wizards and shamans do.&nbsp; You immobilize the mob so it can't
move, then either nuke or DOT it until it's dead.&nbsp; If the Root breaks you renew it,
and you keep this up till the mob is history.&nbsp; Enchanters do basically the same
thing, except we have a pet to help out too.&nbsp; Mobs at 8 to 11th are getting to be too
strong for you to melee anymore, so your pet is stuck doing all the work now.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the enchanter pet will always have terrible hit points,
so you have to help him out a lot.&nbsp; When Kamikaze-Soloing now, here is the technique
I advise:</p>

<p>You should have Strengthen/Haze/Lesser Shielding up, while pet has Strengthen/Haze</p>

<p>Open with Tashan, killing magic resistance and pulling the mob.&nbsp; Take a hit to put
your pet in (I was calling him &quot;the shiny guy&quot; at this point in my career), then
back out.&nbsp; Drop your DOT (Suffocating Sphere) on the mob if you like, though later on
you're going to get out of this habit, then watch the fight a sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now toss on
that nuke.&nbsp; Many times, the first nuke won't be enough to make the mob charge, so
just wait for that ungodly recast, and toss another one.&nbsp; This time it will charge.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I've never seen a mob take two without charging unless I let my pet <em>really</em>
tear it up before nuking (meaning pet probably won't survive the fight).&nbsp; Now at this
point, you have a very pissed off mob rushing you, and you must remain calm, because two
things are happening right now:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Youre pet is <em>wailing</em> on the mob from behind.&nbsp; As a rogue, he
actually does more damage to the creatures back consistently.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Your pet isn't getting hit.&nbsp; Sacrificing a little of your life for the
team is what having a pet is all about.</p>

<p>But you don't want to take a pounding... when you are ready to let the pet take over
the fight again, drop Color Flux (because you should be <em>really</em> good at timing the
spell between attacks now), then take a step back while the spells ungrey, and drop Root
as soon as you can.&nbsp; The mob will spin to face your pet again, and depending on how
the fight is going, you can open up with the nukes again.&nbsp; What's important to do is
try to outdamage your pet, because you get full xp for the mob if you do.&nbsp; Otherwise
the pet gets half the xp--but it's better than no xp at all because you can't kill the
mob.&nbsp; (In groups pets take no experience by the way.)</p>

<p>Using the Kamikaze technique with a wizard partner is also very sound.&nbsp; The wizard
is quite familiar with Root breaking, and the two of you become quite adept at letting
whoever <em>isn't</em> being charged renew the hold.&nbsp; Plus wizard nukes can get just
absurd!</p>

<p>Finding a necromancer that wants a reverse-kiting partner is much more likely at this
level, and finding a druid to reverse kite with is easy too.&nbsp; (They get Snare at 1st
level.)</p>

<p>Now to complete 8 through 11th, you can solo like this, but I recommend finding an orc
camp and sticking with it.&nbsp; You will learn a lot of valuable things about interacting
with the other classes here, and discovering the strengths and weaknesses of the other
races and classes.&nbsp; While grouped, keep Strengthen on all the members that will be
meleeing, and Haze on the ones who are taking the main damage.&nbsp; The reason you don't
Haze them all is mana-management... it's too much of a load to keep them all buffed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaman and Enchanter buffs rarely stack, and some Cleric buffs clash
with ours as well--so learn what spells you need to add in those cases.&nbsp; Every single
pull, land Tashan on the mob, followed by Suffocating Sphere.&nbsp; If you like, you can
drop Enfeeble, and there <em>is</em> an effect on the damage, but it's not drastic, and
rarely worth the mana.&nbsp; Dropping a nuke on the mob that will finish it will save
about the same amount of health lost, really, and frees up a spell slot, which you're
probably beginning to see is getting very crowded when you have to choose only eight
spells from our thickening spellbook.</p>

<p>Your real time to shine is on multiple pops.&nbsp; Mez one and the second will charge.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Called a mez-pull.)&nbsp; Your party has 24 seconds to kill the mob.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, you just re-mez to start the clock over again.&nbsp; If there are three
mobs it gets tougher but still isn't hard if your group cooperates.&nbsp; Mez one and two
charge.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tanks intercept, and you mez one of the two they are on.&nbsp; As
soon as the mez lands they back up (causing the non-mezzed one to follow) and begin
fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you keep the other two mezzed.&nbsp; You can do some amazing
things with mez, and this is the time to expirement, when a mistake won't necessarily get
the party killed.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the most part, you'll be medding a lot, dropping Tashan
and DOT on every mob, and nuking the bigger mobs to help finish them.&nbsp; As long as
you've always got mana, everyone will love you when there's an extra pop that charges
right into a mez.</p>

<p>You should keep a pet summoned, but I wouldn't let him go into combat unless you're on
a single pull.&nbsp; If mez resists, your pet can buy you valuable time to let the party
switch to the mob your pet is on while you mez the one they <em>were</em> fighting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Since &quot;the shiny guy&quot; won't back out of the fight, and
breaks mez.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Your pet is your bodyguard--not your personal tank. &nbsp;&nbsp;
However--during a single pull where you would like your pet to be doing extra damage, or
you're on the last mob of a series and need the extra damage the shiny guy puts out, Root
the mob.&nbsp; By standing <em>on</em> the mob, it will swing at you (rooted mobs swing at
the closest target, almost always).&nbsp; The attack will bring your pet into the fight,
and only took 30 mana, as opposed to the large amount of nuking that might have been
required otherwise.&nbsp; At the higher Circles, the chance to aggro a 27th level mob that
the paladin is fighting involves using 100 to 200 mana in nukes, and the mob will <em>not</em>
leave you alone after that without more casting.&nbsp; Or you can Root for 30 mana, take
an attack that often misses anyway, and your pet is in.</p>

<p>Let me take a moment to explain why DOTs are going to see little use in the future.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you drop Suffocating Sphere on a mob, it will do 18 damage over
the course of 12 seconds, so it's worth dropping onto a mob.&nbsp; But at the Fourth
Circle you obtain Choke, which takes much longer to do it's full damage.&nbsp; If a DOT is
only working on the mob for half it's normal duration, it's only doing half-damage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it becomes more feasible just to use nukes if you want to
contribute to damage.&nbsp; But at the Fourth Circle, you obtain your primary debuff line
that you'll be using from now on... but more on that later.&nbsp; The other thing to bear
in mind, especially when trying to outrace your pet, is that a DOT only counts as your
damage for the first hit.&nbsp; All the rest of the damage is &quot;un-named&quot; and
counts as from nobody.&nbsp; So the damage your DOT does is not outracing your pet.
&nbsp;&nbsp; [Note:&nbsp; This has apparently changed!&nbsp; DOT damage is now considered
assigned damage to you!&nbsp; This is a good thing, and makes DOTs feasible for outracing
your pet finally!]</p>

<p>Spell Lineup:&nbsp; 1-Chaotic Feedback, 2-Suffocating Sphere, 3-Color Flux, 4-Root,
5-Mesmerize, 6- , 7-Tashan, 8-Swap Slot&nbsp; (6 is still left empty, so put whatever
suits you there.&nbsp; The swap slot is now going to see use, just putting whatever buffs
you need to cast into the 8th slot.&nbsp; One more level and you'll have a fairly standard
spell lineup, and I'll explain the placement then.)</p>

<p>The Third Circle is an extremely important level for you, as it's when you truly begin
learning to group.&nbsp; The orc camps and Kamikaze can take you all the way into 12th,
and you find this is actually a very easy Circle to finish, as your spells are in their
prime for the mobs you are fighting.&nbsp; As always, I suggest soloing steady blue mobs
to avoid not only downtime now, but death.&nbsp; See you in the next Circle!
