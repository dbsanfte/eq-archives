<p><i>One short, swift stroke, bereft of sympathy, was all the signaled the fall
of the raiding troop's scout.&nbsp; The iksar fell slowly to the ground, his
scaled hide parted from shoulder to waist in a diagonal across his back, as
multiple gouts of crimson liquor sprayed a globbily trail in the air to mark his
path to the rocky tunnel floor.&nbsp; A dull thump, decidedly wet by the sound,
left a muted haze of silence over the astonished raiders, despite the high
pitched dragon shrieks of the sarnak towering over the monk's corpse.</i></p>
<p><i>Down the long hallway the monk had run in from, the shriek carried well,
losing no volume or girth in it's rolling gait down the hallway.&nbsp; Soon the
cries of battle began to sound through the entire complex deep inside Chardok,
followed by mystical warning claxxons blearing on, warning of intruders at the
front gates.&nbsp; Soon the battle would begin in force.</i></p>
<p><i>Xornn looked wearily at Amaeranth beside him.&nbsp; She looked at least as
tired as Xornn felt, and she was better at hiding it--so the high elf knew he
must look fairly haggard.&nbsp; The concern on her face was a mirror to his
pondering, and left no doubt how bad he looked.&nbsp; The raid was going well,
but the toll was being lain on the enchanters as they repeated stopped wave
after damnable wave of oncoming dragon-men.</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Vengeance!&quot; cried out one of the warlords, and the raid as one
consumed the sarnak and the two unfortunates which came in time to die in their
unleashed fury.</i></p>
<p><i>New resolve washed through Xornn, as the warriors vows of death were soon
reinforced by powerful sword strokes and hellish wizard fire permeating the
air.&nbsp; Amaeranth helped another enchantress to her feet and the three looked
solemnly amongst themselves.&nbsp; Xornn finally spoke, &quot;Let's finish this
then, the royal family dies tonight.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>They all nodded, and turned as one to face the oncoming rush of twenty
more dragon-men.</i></p>
<hr>
Most enchanters will tell you that 56 was worse than both 55 and 57 were.&nbsp;
My guess is because you're taking a larger cut of the experience by 57, the xp
movement is becoming more visible.&nbsp; Honestly though, be proud to be this
far, and know that you're over halfway to being a Phantasmist.&nbsp; (Though
opinions on that will very, considering how bad 59th is.)&nbsp; No real
spectacular spell additions at this level, primarily you've just inched closer
to finishing the leveling runs.&nbsp; You've probably made a ton of associates
by now, if not very close friends, and seen and done just about everything in
the game.&nbsp; If you haven't, get out there and see what you missed in the
drive to level.
<hr>
<p><b>Spells</b></p>
<p><b>Augment - </b>Augmentation II essentially, and long-awaited.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the effects really don't stack up enough to make it a choice
versus Aanya's Quickening.&nbsp; 45% haste, 35 AGI, 18 raw AC, and increased
stamina regen.&nbsp; dropping off 19% haste just isn't worth the AC and AGI from
this spell.&nbsp; So it's really more of a collector's item in reality, save a
few encounters (like Kedge Keep) where you want a solid haste + stamina regen,
or in situations where you must haste a ridiculous amount of people, because the
mana cost is half that of AQ.&nbsp; Casts in 5 seconds, 135 mana, lasts 36
minutes.</p>
<p><b>Horrifying Visage - </b>This is a single target spell new with Luclin;
it's apparent effect when cast on someone is to cause every strike after it
lands to generate extra aggro.&nbsp; Exact percentages are still in speculation
at the moment, and I'll wait until I'm more confident in the numbers to say
exactly.&nbsp; This is the upgrade to Haunting Visage from the 8th Circle.&nbsp;
The spell has a 36 second recast delay, so you need to have it memmed slightly
in advance to needing it, takes 200 mana in 2 seconds, and causes heightened
aggro for 18 seconds afterward.</p>
<p><b>Overwhelming Splendor - </b>Last CHA buff received, this one is a whopping
50 CHA!&nbsp; By now it's probably become apparent that anything you're able to
actually land mez on is very blue to you.&nbsp; This means that the mobs will
almost always be at or around their resist floor, before CHA is even a
factor.&nbsp; This buff allows you to focus on INT (for more mana) even more
greatly, as most enchanters will have enough &quot;incidental&quot; CHA raises
that this will take them near to or over CHA at 56+.&nbsp; By this level HP gear
is usually a better choice over CHA, but a 50 point buff never hurt
anyone.&nbsp; 175 mana, 5 second casting time.</p>
<p><b>Torment of Argli - </b>An interesting, and basically <i>new</i> spell
line.&nbsp; This spell causes the targets Intelligence and Wisdom to drop by 21
points, as well as drain away 560 HP in 20 tics (28/tic).&nbsp; Also over the
course of that 2 minutes, the target loses 35 mana per tic!&nbsp; This DOT
stacks with our DD/DOT/Debuff line, and is excellent for draining away mana
faster from caster mobs that are prone to CHeal and Gate on you.&nbsp; The spell
drains 150 mana in a 2.5 second casting time, and carries a 10 second
recast.&nbsp; Definitely a great spell against a caster, combined with Mana
Sieve and Theft of Thought, and even Wandering Mind, that's a lot of mana drain
for the enchanter!</p>
<p><b>Trepidation - </b>Final fear spell in the line, this one costs 200 mana
(double that of Invoke Fear), lasts a maximum of 36 seconds (6 seconds less than
Invoke Fear), and carries a 2.5 second cast time, with 7 second recast.&nbsp;
The benefit of this spell?&nbsp; Less resistant, as though Tashan was being cast
on the mob already.&nbsp; Worth picking up, though you won't be fearing a
terrible amount these days.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Buffs-Solo - </b>Clarity II, Gift of Insight, Shield of the Magi,
Brilliance, and Overwhelming Splendor.&nbsp; If you intend to stay alive for
very long, I suggest stocking up on Rune Vs.&nbsp; Animation solo is a rarity
involving caster spawns you might find or other extremely low hit point mobs,
and charm solo is about the only route that works with efficiency.&nbsp; If
charm solo wasn't dangerous enough last level, the mobs that give you xp now hit
even harder, faster, and have greater hit points.&nbsp; Have fun.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p><b>Buffs-Group - </b>Horrifying Visage is a new addition to group enchanting,
and I will only say that if you find you <i>need</i> to use this on a tank to
keep aggro on them, they should not be your lead tank.&nbsp; This spell is more
of a raiding application to help keep a mob sticking to your main assist target,
not for xp-grinding.&nbsp; Outside of that, no changes to group buffing.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Tactics Changes</b></p>
<p>Don't forget about Torment of Argli's mana drain potential (the best use of
the spell), especially in raiding scenarios, but otherwise very little will
change for you</p>
<hr>
<p>There are no words of advice to you now, Beguilers.&nbsp; You have journeyed
much too far to need help knowing how to level, or words of encouragement that I
believe you will become a Phantasmist.&nbsp; You know, yourself, if that will be
a goal you strive to complete from here--and either way you decide, you will
have chosen the right path, your own.</p>
<p>But I'll offer my encouragement anyway, because I can.</p>
