</td><td valign="top" width="24"></td><!--msnavigation--><td valign="top"><p><i>A light, rhythmic tapping pervaded the crisp
air about the band, as the stocky dwarf Omar fidgeted with his battle-worn axe,
and the intricately forged metal rings of his vest clicked and patted against
each other and the leather beneath them.&nbsp; He huffed in a visible show of
impatience at this waiting game, his own personal jab at the
&quot;finger-wrigglers&quot; always wanting to stop and &quot;align the
planets&quot; as far as he was concerned.&nbsp; The snow was deep here in the
Wastes, at least up to Omar's waist in most areas, not counting the massive
gorge he had just been levitated over--much to his complaint.</i></p>
<p><i>Their scout was off in the distance, looking for the giant captain they
came to slay, and there were a few other soldiers and knights among the
band.&nbsp; Near the back of the group a paler than normal high elf was kneeling
in silent meditation, despite a talkative halfling next to him carrying on a
conversation with no one in particular regarding the next meal.&nbsp; His eyes,
steeled gray, were open--but blank, as though he were merely a very lifelike
statue, rather than the enchanter they had traveled with many days to get
here.&nbsp; Omar let another derisive snort go, to little visible effect on the
group.</i></p>
<p><i>As Omar began to feel his limits to this waiting approach, Xornn spoke up,
&quot;Yes, Omar, your time is almost here.&quot;&nbsp; The gaze of the koada`dal
was on him, only not quite looking at his creased and weathered eyes, but more
like... his shoulder.&nbsp; He turned as the wind seemed to die behind him, from
a strong breeze to a light wind, and then a light breeze seemingly choked out by
a growing shadow.&nbsp; As his own bodily mixed battle fury began to take hold,
a screaming sense of energy and speed overcame him in a swirl of rippling
magic.&nbsp; The giant cresting the hill and blotting away the setting sun
seemed to move slower--or perhaps Omar was moving faster.&nbsp; It was all the
same in the end--the captain would fall.</i></p>
<p><i>Xornn quietly knelt back down as the last fighter was hastened, and
watched the battle calmly.&nbsp; He shivered, once.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>You have graduated again, students--to Beguiler.&nbsp; There is one pivotal
change that will occur now, that you will notice from this point on--54th weeded
out a lot of people.&nbsp; 55th+ is an elite group for the most part, that has
pushed the limits of their abilities, and proven they have what it takes to work
with a group--and therefore with an enchanter.&nbsp; The levels will get slower
with each passing, but the power you wield will begin to rise at nearly an
exponential rate now.&nbsp; It's a very good time to be an enchanter, and you
are about to see things you never would have imagined possible.&nbsp; For the
enchanter is a rare class as you advance this far--so many fall to the wayside
as the margin of error gets smaller and smaller, and the risk vs. reward becomes
too great.&nbsp; But you made it, didn't you?&nbsp; So you might say it's all
downhill from here.</p>
<p>Of course, I wouldn't.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Spells</b></p>
<p><b>Gift of Insight</b> - This is the upgrade to Gift of Magic, a spell of
somewhat questionable importance.&nbsp; However, make no mistake when assessing
the value of this one, for whereas GoM increased your maximum mana pool by 50,
this one increases by 100.&nbsp; Not impressed?&nbsp; Good, you shouldn't
be--but then couple the increase of mana regen by 1, which stacks with the
Clarity line.&nbsp; This is the awesome power of GoI, and why it will be a must
cast on any primary mana user.&nbsp; (Hybrids don't need it, but anyone who's
primary tactics need mana should receive this buff.)&nbsp; The mana cost is an
extreme 300 per cast, but the duration is a long 75 minutes, so after the
initial drain this one won't be too bad to keep buffed out.</p>
<p><b>Largarn's Lamentation - </b>This spell actually has no real forerunner,
though it acts as a cross between Mana Sieve, and Whirl Till You Hurl.&nbsp; 120
mana to cast, with a 2.5 second casting time, this is a targetted (not AoE) stun
that last 8 seconds, and drains 75 mana from the target.&nbsp; It is also bears
a fairly low resist rate.&nbsp; 120 mana is very costly, but this can allow for
a stun from across the chamber to stop a Gate or Complete Heal, when you have no
time to approach and stun, or it's too hazardous to get into melee range.&nbsp;
This spell carries a 24 second recast delay, so don't rely on this to aid well
in a stunlock situation.&nbsp; Note the spell carries a 1ft knockback effect,
which could actually contribute to pushing a mob around.&nbsp; (Note that
outside of causing a stun, the next most effective way to interrupt an NPC
caster (or any caster actually), is to move them.&nbsp; Everyone standing on the
same side of Lady Vox as they attack is the key to interrupting her Complete
Heal attempts if the enchanters don't get enough mana drained.</p>
<p><b>Memory Flux - </b>This is the final spell in the Memory Blur line, single
target, and very costly at 350 mana.&nbsp; Some small testing has given me the
impression it is the most reliable blur we have to date, but for the intense
mana cost involved, I would rather use several blurs, or just trust in Root like
I did since level 8.&nbsp; Carries a 12 second recast as well--and will probably
see little use by any enchanter experienced with blurring reliability in the
high end game.</p>
<p><b>Wind of Tashani - </b>The first AoE MR Debuff we receive.&nbsp; While this
may initially sound like a death wish, you will find it is often very useful,
particularly if you are in an area that tashing is rarely if ever
necessary.&nbsp; In a situation that you rarely get resists--the only time they
become a concern is during high quantities of saving throws, such as during AoE
Mez usage.&nbsp; In this instance an AE Mez followed by AE Tash can reduce all
of the MR across the playing field quickly.&nbsp; Also setting up for the
shaman's AE Slow to blanket the mobs.&nbsp; 45 mana to cast, with the
traditional 1 second cast time of Tash spells.&nbsp; Lowers MR by 23, as a
poison effect for removing purposes.</p>
<p><b>Zumaik's Animation - </b>One last animation for the enchanter's bag of
tricks, and quite seriously, about the only application it still has involves
farming green mobs, or fear kiting--the latter of which doesn't occur much in
the 55+ game, though Shadows of Luclin has brought a new set of zones where high
level fear kiting is a very real opportunity.&nbsp; Unfortunately it's still a
very slow method to level, as kill times get longer and longer, and setup time
for fights is extreme.&nbsp; By the way, damage range is from 46 to 54 max--only
a one level increase from the last pet.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Buffs-Solo - </b>Animation soloing is completely out of the question at
this point, unless you manage to find a low hit point mob (probably a caster)
that doesn't devour your animation in seconds.&nbsp; If you do find this, then
lob on mana regen and ac/hp buffs, because that's all you're going to
need.&nbsp; Your pet needs HPs and Haste of course.&nbsp; When charm soloing,
lob on your CHA buff if you feel it helps, or just stock up on peridot and make
sure Rune V is up all the time.&nbsp; Due to the extreme heavy hitters you are
required to work with when charm soloing now, Rune V is about the only
acceptable protection now.</p>
<p><b>Buffs-Group - </b>No brainer here, just add GoI to the mix for any healers
and casters--hybrids can make due with just C2, unless you're really
bored.&nbsp; Don't go crazy trying to land GoI like crazy on a group, C2 is the
critical spell, and GoI can wait a bit if needed.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Tactics Changes</b></p>
<p><b>Solo - </b>You gain a new animation, but this isn't really enough to
solo--the only chance you really have to maintain a solo with the animation
involves frivolous usage of Rune V, and a lot of Dementia casting.&nbsp; If you
have the bucks for this, I invite you to continue the practice, but this will
hurt your pocket boot fast, and approaches the danger of charm soloing at this
point.&nbsp; Your animation is so fragile, trying to solo with it is almost like
trying to fight just wizard style.&nbsp; I recommend saving the animation for
farming equipment for your twink.&nbsp; Charm soloing is very dangerous now, and
if you <i>do</i> choose to fight this way, it's important to consider this
factor--if the average charm is 2.5 minutes (reasonable with my experience), can
your pet finish the fight with your pull in that time?&nbsp; At one point in
charm soloing, about 40 to 50, mobs you charmed could kill two other mobs before
charm broke.&nbsp; You will find with the colossal increases in total hit points
of the mobs, even the heavy hitting charmed pets have trouble finishing a fight
in under three minutes.&nbsp; Dealing with a charm break is practically expected
at this point, unless you are able to locate a set of low hit point mobs that
will carve each other up quickly.&nbsp; I no longer recommend using slow on the
enemy mob, as you will rarely hold a pet that can survive two fights in a row,
and losing your pet can often mean zoning because you don't have the mana to
nuke finish a mob.&nbsp; Successful charm soloing usually involves a pair of
mobs spawning together, rooting one, charming the other and letting them battle
it out, doing your best to make sure your pet <i>barely</i> wins, allowing you
to break charm and have a fleeing mob left to finish off with nukes.&nbsp; You
may even consider hasting your pet, to make for a reliable kill time.&nbsp; If
you choose this route, then I suggest slowing the enemy, and going for a two mob
kill before charm breaks.&nbsp; A strong haste is often enough to pull this off,
but you can go from full health with Rune V up to very dead in seconds in this
situation.</p>
<p><b>Partner - </b>Shadows of Luclin has introduced a plethora of new zones
crawling with high level mobs that can be fear kited with ease!&nbsp; While this
brings back the power of a snare/enchanter duo, the experience gains from this
effort are still slow, even for a double-hell level.&nbsp; Mana efficiency is
the key, and an excellent spot, free of adds, but without long pulls--and pull
time is usually such a factor, that coupled with very long kiting times, it's
just not worth the effort.&nbsp; However when you don't have time for a group,
and don't want the extreme hazard of soloing, fear-kiting is back as a reliable,
and at least active method of leveling.</p>
<p><b>Group - </b>No visible changes to the grouping tactics, outside of a new
buff to cast, and lower resist rates due to your level.&nbsp; This will continue
all the way to 60th, when encountering a resist is usually just a minor
annoyance rather than a common situation.
