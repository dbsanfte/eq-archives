  <p><b><i>Eligibility and Seniority</i></b></p>
  <p>
    Eligibility for item awards is determined by raid attendance. Each raid is worth a varying amount of points to reflect the relative value of that raid in meeting guild objectives. There are three drop award eligibility categories:
    <ul>
      <li>Fully eligible: Have received at least 50% of all raids points in previous month</li>
      <li>Rot eligible: Have received between 33% and 50% of all raid points in previous month. Item awards can be made to this category if no fully eligible member nominated</li>
      <li>Ineligible: Have received fewer than 33% of all raid points in previous month. Items awards not normally made to this category</li>
    </ul>
    Raid points have no value other than determining eligibility, they are not used as currency for awards
  </p>
  <p>Class captains determine member seniority within their class by methods of their own devising. Class captains solicit interest in item drops and forward their recommendation to the raid leader</p>
