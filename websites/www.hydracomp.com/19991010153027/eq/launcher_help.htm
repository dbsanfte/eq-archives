<P><A NAME="s1a"></A><B>What is UniNet ?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>UniNet is a new concept in Software Application Deployment
and Updating.&nbsp; We feel that UniNet concept will take computer software
to the next level, in creating a new means by which users are able to install,
and keep software applications current.&nbsp;&nbsp; By using the UniNet
platform, users can access a single location to see which UniNet compatable
Software Applications they have installed on there system, select new software
applications to automatically be downloaded and installed, and to ensure
that the latest components of that software are always the most currentl
that are avalible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="s1b"></A><B>What is the UniNet Launcher ?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The UniNet Launcher is the magic program which helps make all
of this happen.&nbsp; It is responsible for both ensuring that applications
are using the most current and up-to-date components each time they are
run, as well as providing the means by which users can download and install
new UniNet compatable Software Applications, and provide a central location
to set global UniNet software settings, such as Proxy Server configurations,
etc.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="s1c"></A><B>Who develops UniNet Software?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Currently, there are only two software applications being developed
to use the UniNet platform, EverMon and EverGuild, both of which are utilities
for a Mass-Multiplayer Internet game called EverQuest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>However, once the UniNet platform ist stabalized, there will be information
provided that will allow other software developers to create UniNet compatable
software that users of the UniNet Launcher will be able to be informed
about, and automatically download and setup.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>More information on this topic will be avalible in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="s1d"></A><B>Where to get the latest version of the UniNet Launcher
?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Once you have initially downloaded and
installed the UniNet Launcher on your system, you will not need to worry
about getting new versions of the launcher, as they will automatically
be downloaded when they are avalible.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">If you have not yet downloaded and installed the
UniNet Launcher on your system, you can go to the following website to
get the latest version :</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><A HREF="\\www.hydracomp.com\eq">http:\\www.hydacomp.com\eq</A></BLOCKQUOTE>
The latest UniNet news, as well as other UniNet software app news, and
other information can also be found at that same site.
<BR>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="s1e"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Where to get the latest version
of UniNet Software ?</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Once you have initially set up a software
application using the Launcher's Configuration mode, then you will always
automatically get any future version upgrades for that software application,
and no further work on your end will be required to get it.&nbsp; That's
one of the benifits of using the UniNet software platform.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="s1f"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Why are some UniNet Software
Applications listed as BETA ?</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Several of the software applications
which are currently using the UniNet architecture are works in progress
themselves.&nbsp; Because of this, you may see two listings for each software
application.&nbsp; The first listing listing the name of the software,
snd the second listing the same software name, with BETA at the end of
it.&nbsp; The BETA Versions of the software are exactly that, they are
pre-release versions of the applications which are used for testing.&nbsp;
You should only select these versions if you are an experienced computer
user, and are prepared to have to work through bugs, and do light troubleshooting.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you are only looking for stable apps, then it is suggested that you
stay away from the BETA versions of the software, and only use the Non-Beta
versions.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="s2"></A><B>INSTALLATION INFORMATION</B>

<P><A NAME="s2a"></A>Installing the UniNet Launcher
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>1. DOWNLOAD - </B>To Install the UniNet Launcher, you will
either need to download <B><I><U>uninet-sm.exe</U></I></B> (about 350k),
or <B><I><U>uninet-lg.exe</U></I></B> (about 1500k).&nbsp; If you have
previously installed EverMon, or some other application which uses the
Visual Basic 6.0 Run Time Libraries (msvbvm60.dll and related files), then
you can get the small version.&nbsp; Otherwise you will need to get the
large version.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B>NOTE</B> : <B>It is suggested that you DO NOT save the downloaded
file on your desktop.&nbsp; instead use a directory like C:\SOFTWARE, or
D:\DL, etc.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>2. INSTALL -</B> After you have downloaded the software, you will
need to run it.&nbsp; It will ask you the temp directory to use.&nbsp;
In most cases, you can simply press <B>OK</B> and use the default.&nbsp;
This will launch the VB Installer, and walk you through the setup process.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B>NOTE : If you have problems with the installation process see <A HREF="#s4a">Section
4a : Trouble Shooting Installation Problems</A> at the bottom of this manual.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="s2b"></A>Installing UniNet Software Applications
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once you have completed the installation process, you should
have a <B><I>UniNet </I></B>menu in your <B>Start | Programs</B> menu.&nbsp;
The only icon which should currently be there is one called <B><I>Launcher
Configuration</I></B>.&nbsp; By selecting this icon, the UniNet Launcher
Application Configuration process will be started.
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="launcher_help1.jpg" HEIGHT=204 WIDTH=455></CENTER>

<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>
Once the Configuration mode starts, you should get a screen such as that
shown above.&nbsp; This will list all the currently avalible UniNet applications.&nbsp;
Additional applications are automatically added to your list as the become
avalible.&nbsp; For each application, the Status will either say <B><I>INSTALLED</I></B>
or <B><I>NONE</I></B>.&nbsp; Applications that say 'None' are not installed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>If this is your first time running the Launcher Configuration, all
of the applications will say NONE, even if you ran a previous version of
EverMon.&nbsp; To install an application, double click on it.&nbsp; The
installer will then ask you if you wish to install that app, and will then
take you through a few steps needed for the basic setup.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>After you have finished setting up applications, and Close the configuration
program, if you go back to the <B>Start | Programs | UniNet</B> menu, you
will notice that new Icons have appeared that are listed as the names of
the applications you just selected to install.&nbsp; Select those new application
icons to complete the install, and to run the application.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><A NAME="s3a"></A>Configuring UniNet Proxy Server Settings
<BLOCKQUOTE>All UniNet Applications have built in support for Socks 4,
4a, and 5 Proxy Servers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>If you are on a LAN and do not have direct Internet access, or are
behind a Firewall, or need to connect to the net via a Proxy Server, then
you can configuration UniNet applications including the UniNet Launcher
to use your proxy server.

<P>To access the configuration, go to the <B>Start | Programs | UniNet</B>
menu, and select the Launcher Configuration icon to get into the UniNet
Launcher Configuration screen.&nbsp; Once you are there, press the <B><I>Proxy
Setup</I></B> button.&nbsp; You will see a window that you can use to set
the server location of your proxy server.&nbsp; The port is optional, if
you leave it blank, then the standard proxy port 1080 will be assumed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR><A NAME="s4"></A><B>TROUBLE SHOOTING INFORMATION</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><A NAME="s4a"></A>Trouble Shooting Installation Problems
<BLOCKQUOTE>If while attempting to install either the small version (<B><I>uninet-sm.exe</I></B>)
or the large version (<B><I>uninet-lg.exe</I></B>) of UniNet Launcher,
you experience one of the following problems :
<OL>
<LI>
You get a message saying that <B>setup1.exe</B> can not be started, or
the process can not be created</LI>

<LI>
You get a message saying that <B>setup1.exe</B> or <B>setup.exe</B> is
currupt, or invalid</LI>

<LI>
You run the <B><I>uninet-sm.exe</I></B> or <B><I>uninet-lg.exe</I></B>
install file, but after it decompresses, instead of getting UniNet 1.0.2
Launcher install screen, you get an install screen for some other application</LI>
</OL>
If you have a problem that matches one of the problems above, or a problem
that is very similar to the problems listed above, this <B><U>may</U></B>
be due to a known problem with the Microsoft Installer, which UniNet uses.&nbsp;
If components of the install files exist in your windows directory, or
in your system path, then the installer tends to use those files, instead
of using the real files it should be using.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>In order to fix this problem, you will need to remove the old components
from your system.&nbsp; The componenets should not be there in the furst
place, but may end up being left behind when previous installers failed
to completely delete all the temperary files they use.

<P>Here is the step of procedures you can take to attempt to fix this problem
:
<OL>
<LI>
Make sure you our out of the setup program.</LI>

<LI>
Go to <B>Start Menu | Find | Files or Folders</B> to search your hard drive
for the file : <B><I>launcher.cab</I></B></LI>

<LI>
If you find any, then hightlight the file, and press DELETE on your keyboard
to remove it.</LI>

<LI>
Follow the same set of procedures for Searching and Deleteing any <B><I>setup.lst</I></B>
or <B><I>setup1.exe</I></B> files.</LI>
</OL>
One you have finished cleaning the files, re-run the uninet insall program
(Either <B><I>uninet-sm.exe</I></B> or <B><I>uninet-lg.exe</I></B>, depending
on which you need).
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>If after taking these steps, you still can not get UniNet Launcher
installed, then please send me an e-mail, describing the exact problem
you are having, as well as any error messages you may have been given during
the installation attempt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
