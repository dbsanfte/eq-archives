<B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>EverTools Support Discontinued</FONT></U></B><BR>

<P><B>EverTools update and support is officially discontinued.</B>

<P>It is with great sadness that I must do what I have always dreaded having
to do, and that is to end EverTools support, especially after having met
so many great people over the years.  This is been a decision I have been
fighting with for the last several months, and part of the reason why such
a long time has gone without any updates, but when all the good and bad
points were looked at, the simple fact of the matter remained that I could
not effectivly support a product for a game in which those who create the
game have no desire to support the product themselves.

<p><B>EverQuest over the years...</B>

<p>I have been involved one way or another with EverQuest since it was very
young, many years ago.  Infact, the first public release of EverMon came
literally hours after the official start of Phase 4 Beta, and involved
little more than a patch server check and a login server check.  This was
back in a time where the developers and creators were truely involved and
pationate about the game.  This is a time when you could walk around
Norrath and find GM's and developers wondering around, who would not mind
chatting with you about the game for a bit before continuing their work.

<P>The early days of EverQuest were also a time when the top level
administration of Verant Interactive were truely customer-centric, putting
a very high level of focus on customer service, and satisfaction.  This
was really displayed to me the day when the Vice-President of Verant
(John Smedly), called me on a few occations, and we worked out the concepts
behind what would become the Verant Status Server which until recent months,
would provide EverMon as well as several other server and web based monitors,
information about EverQuest.

<p><B>EverQuest moves to the present...</B>

<P>I believe the popularity and success of EverQuest to the degree that
it was, was something not even the early develoeprs of the game could have
imagined, as it exceeded everyone's highest expectations.  I fear that it
was this success eventually lead to where we are at today, as the quick
success of the game caused some very rapid growth in the rather new company.
As the game continued to grow months and years after release, so did the
company and number of staff needed to support it.  Unfortunatly, a rather
large number of newer team members brought abord had a much harder view
on customer service and satification, and rants and issues continued to
grow in regards to the esclating lack of apparent interest in the customer,
and more interest in the corporation.

<P>The buyout of Verant by Sony Online Entertainment further increased
this.  It is the belief of many players and those involved in the player
volunteer support of the game that several of the top level people that
were responsible for providing customer service had no concept at all of
the game, or what the players needed.  The importance and concern of the
corporation, continued to grow.  The administration of the game became more
and more paranoid of any small event that would occure, feeling everything
that happened was a security threat to themselves or the company, which
continued to lower the level by which customer service could be provided.

<p>Finally, the decision was made to no longer provide players with
information about player counts and server status, a decision that was
openly admitted by the producer of EverQuest as one for the sole purpose
of corporate consideations, and the fact that corporate competition might
find out how many people were playing the game.  As a result, 400,000
subcribers were forced to suffer.

<P><B>EverQuest in the future...</B>

<P>I could continue for hours with examples demonstrating this continued
lack of interest in customer service and support, but the simple fact
remains that those responsible for EverQuest continue to move away from
supporting the true success of the game.  It's not the corporation that
created the success, but the players.  It is my sincere hope that as
SOE moves into the eventual release of their next major project, Star
Wars Galaxies, that they will realize this, and once again put the focus
on the players.

<P>However, past experience with SOE suggests that this will not be so,
things will continue as they have been going at SOE, and players will
continue to directly and indirectly suffer as a result.  That is, until
the day that players finally speak out, not with their words, but with
their money.  It is players that created the success of EverQuest, and
it is players that will one day create it's demise.  When a company
continues to neglect it's players, eventually the players stop supporting
the company.

<P>I've met many great people over the years at Verant / SOE, and I'm
really sad to see things go in the direction that they are, and god
knows that I have tried my hardest to change that.  Very few people
know what my true involvement with EverQuest has been over the years,
and unfortunatly it will have to stay that way, I have had great faith
in that the came was and could become over the years.  But unfortunatly,
everyone has their limits.  Now is my time to move on to other projects.

<P>I look forward to seeing all of you in the next great adventure,
whereever that may be.  Until then, those of you staying behind in Norrath,
the evolution of the game is in your hands.  Remember, alone their is
very little one person can do, but true strength exists in numbers and
in unity.
