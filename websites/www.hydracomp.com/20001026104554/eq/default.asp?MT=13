<B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Help Support EverTools and get paid at the same time!</FONT></U></B><BR>

<P>&nbsp&nbsp Since I really don't believe in web banners too much, I've tried
to keep them off the site.  However, I've just ran across a neat little program
called AllAdvantage.  Basically, they pay you to surf the web while looking at
their ad bar.  They also pay the person that referred you to them.</P>

<P>&nbsp&nbsp So, if you are interested in making some extra money, and if you
are interested in further supporting the EverTools development process, please
feel free to check them out.  When you sign up, be sure to use HAL-751 as the
referring member ID.</P>

<B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>EverTools Beta Testing (1/25/2000)</FONT></U></B><BR>

<P>&nbsp&nbsp Effective today, EverTools is now being released as a public
open-beta test version.  The first beta version of EverTools contains the
initial EverTools applications (EverChat, EverMon 3.0, and EverLogs). Additional
applications will continue to be developed, and added to EverTools as time
goes on.  If you are interested in helping with the beta test, and would like
to stay on top of the very latest development and support information for
EverTools, you might wish to consider joining our development e-mail list.
The list is a moderated list for development and support issues.  Also, you
will notice a menu option to the left for going to our public message bases.
The public message area is where general conversation and discussion about
EverTools can be held in an open and un-moderated forum.</P>

<B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Welcome to the official EverTools Website</FONT></U></B><BR>

<P>&nbsp&nbsp As of January 1st, 2000, the EverMon project has been
officially closed.  In it's place, EverTools is born.  Due to the large
number of feature requests that have been made over the last several
months for EverMon, we could no longer keep everything in one program.
So now, the project has been greatly expanded to EverTools, which is a
collection of several different utilities all grouped together, and
released as a single suite.</P>
<P>&nbsp&nbsp We are very excited about all the new features and tools
that EverQuest players will soon have.  Use the links to the left of the
screen to learn more about what tools are part of the EverTools project,
and what the current development status of each tool is.  The EverTools
news page will provide late breaking public-release news, so keep an
eye on that as well.</P>

<B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>What happened to that Launcher thingy?</FONT></U></B><BR>

<P>&nbsp&nbsp The UniNet Launcher software that the old version of EverMon
used was a neat idea.  However, it proved to be too complicated and difficult
to understand and set up for many users.  So now, we have taken the idea one
step further.  Instead of requiring users to download the launcher software,
and seperatly setup and install other software, the launcher update technology
is embedded into the EverTool Applications.  The applications run the updater
instead of the updater running the applications..</P>
<P>&nbsp&nbsp What does this mean? Basically, this means that you only download
and install the EverTools software, and no longer bother running or setting up
other software components, since it is all done internally.  This should
make things a lot easy for users to use and understand.</P>
