<p><a NAME="s1"></a><b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b>
<p><a NAME="s1a"></a><b>What is EverMon ?</b>
<blockquote>EverMon is a small utility that monitors the servers for the
EverQuest multi-user game developed by Verant Technologies.&nbsp; EverMon
has several features, which include the ability to automatically launch
EverQuest, when your desired servers are up, Play sound files when your
servers are up, monitor the number of players on each of the world servers,
and chat server, provide you with up-to-the-minute broadcast messages about
game status, and much more.</blockquote>
<a NAME="s1b"></a><b>Who Develops EverMon ?</b>
<blockquote>EverMon is directly sponsored and supported by HydraSoft, a
division of Hydra Computers, and Programmed by Bryon Quackenbush (a.k.a.
Zackron).&nbsp; Neither Verant, 989Studios, or Sony Interactive have any
role in the development of EverMon, nor is it officially supported by them.&nbsp;
However, Verant did develop the Status Server that EverMon uses in order
to get the majority of it's game server status and information.</blockquote>
<a NAME="s1c"></a><b>Where to get the Latest Versions of EverMon ?</b>
<blockquote>The latest versionf of EverMon, along with other EverQuest
related utilities, can be downloaded from the Main EverMon homepage at
:
<blockquote><a href="\\www.hydracomp.com\eq">http:\\www.hydacomp.com\eq</a></blockquote>
The latest EverMon news, and other information can also be found at that
same site.</blockquote>
<a NAME="s1d"></a><b>Is it against the EverQuest User Agreement to use
EverMon ?</b>
<blockquote><font color="#99FF99">NEW </font>: As of EverMon version 2.0,
EverMon is now in complete complieance with the EverQuest User Agreement
and Terms of Service (TOS).&nbsp; EverMon previously used a part of the
EverQuest protocol to determine current server status, however, that has
been changed as of EverMon 2.0 and later, as server information is now
recieved directly from a Verant hosted Status Server.
<p><font color="#FF0000">IMPORTANT LEGAL DISCLAIMER : </font><font color="#000000">ALTHOUGH
EVERY ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO WORK WITH VERANT IN ENSURING EVERMON DOES
NOT CAUSE A PROBLEM WITH THE SERVERS, AND THAT PLAYERS MAY FREELY USE EVERMON
WITHOUT FEAR OF ACTION FROM VERANT, USE OF EVERMON REMAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF THE USER.&nbsp; NIETHER HYDRA COMPUTERS, HYDRASOFT, OR THE PROGRAMMER
TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IN ANY WAY TOWARD THE USE OF EVERMON SOFTWARE.</font></blockquote>
<a NAME="s1e"></a><b><font color="#000000">What is the EverMon Beta Team?</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#000000">In an attempt to ensure that the latest
public versions of EverMon are as stable as possible, an EverMon Beta Team
has been formed.&nbsp; The purpose of this team is to test development
versions of EverMon before they are officially publically released, for
the purpose of finding any bugs or other problems that may exist.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">We periodically accept applications to be a part
of this beta team.&nbsp; Check the <a href="http://www.hydracomp.com/eq/beta.htm">Beta
Team Page</a> for more information.</font></blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><a NAME="s2"></a><b>INSTALLATION INFORMATION</b>
<p><a NAME="s2a"></a><b>Full Install vs. Update Install</b>
<blockquote>There are two different distribution files that are released
for EverMon.&nbsp; The First file is a rather large file, upwards around
2 Megabytes in size, this is the Full Installation file, and meant for
first time EverMon users, who do not have the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
libraries installed on their computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second version is
rather small, normally around 100-150 Kilobytes in size.&nbsp; It is the
update version, and meant to users that already have EverMon installed.
<p><b>You should download the Full Install version when :</b>
<ul>
<li>
You have never Installed EverMon before, and you do not know if you have
all the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Run Time Libraries insalled.</li>
</ul>
<b>You should download the Update Install version when :</b>
<ul>
<li>
You already have a previous version of EverMon that has already been installed,
and had at one time properly worked.</li>

<li>
You know for sure you already have all Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 RTL's
installed on your computer. (i.e. you have Visual Basic 6.0 installed).</li>
</ul>
If you try to use the Update Install without using the Full Install first,
and the Update version will not run for you, then it is advised that you
download and install the Full Version, even if you think you might have
all the needed libraries.</blockquote>
<a NAME="s2b"></a><b>Full Install Instructions</b>
<blockquote>If you are downloaded the full install version, there are very
few instructions that you need to know about, since almost everything is
completely automated.&nbsp; But here is some information for you to go
by.
<ol>
<li>
The Install file is shipped in an .EXE file format, which automaticlaly
begins the installation process when you run it.</li>

<li>
The installer will check the version of some of your system files.&nbsp;
Specifically OLEAUT32.DLL, OLEPRO32.DLL, and MSVBVM60.DLL.&nbsp; If any
of these files are out of date, the installer will ask you if you would
like them to be updated, and it will then restart your computer.&nbsp;
You will then need&nbsp; to re-run the install to continue.</li>

<li>
The installer will default to using C:\Program Files\EverMon\ as the default
directory, although you can select any directory you please to install
it to.</li>
</ol>
<b>If you are having problems with the installation, or the Installer Keeps
asking you if you want your files updated, then make the following :</b>
<ol>
<li>
Make sure no other programs are running during the install, this includes
programs in your System Tray, and programs you may have set up to auto-start
in your Start Menu.&nbsp; If any other program is using any of the .DLL
files the installer needs to update, the update will fail.</li>

<li>
Make sure that you are running in the standard Microsoft Win 95, or Win
98 shell... Some programs, such as Neo Planet which may modify the shell
environment, and system files, may cause the installer to function incorrectly.</li>

<li>
If you still have problems, the files may already be updated, try downloading,
and running the Update Version.</li>

<li>
If you still have problems, send me e-mail at <a href="mailto:bryonq@hydracomp.com">BryonQ@hydracomp.com</a>,
and I will try to help you further.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="s2c"></a><b>Update Install Instructions</b>
<blockquote>The Update versions are set up slightly differently than the
Full Install files.&nbsp; Update Installs are Self Extracting Zip files..
which means that they come with as an .EXE file, but when you run the file,
it will create the EverMon.EXE file in what ever directory you run it in.&nbsp;
the EverMon.exe file which it creates should be copied to replace the olf
EverMon.exe file, where ever you installed EverMon at.
<p>If you used the default installation, it would be in the C:\Program
Files\EverMon\ dirctory.&nbsp; You can either use a DOS window, or Windows
Explorer to move the file to the correct location.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><a NAME="s3"></a><b>INTERFACE INFORMATION</b>
<p><a NAME="s3a"></a><b>The Main Interface Window</b>
<ul>After you start EverMon, you will be in the Main Interface Window,
which will look something like this :
<center>
<p><img SRC="evermon1.jpg" height=461 width=416></center>
This window may look simple, but it displays a lot of different Information.
<p><img SRC="em_main1.jpg" height=42 width=463>
<br>MENU BAR - The menu bar provides several different types of information
and options, and has the following menus :
<ul>
<li>
FILE MENU - Exits EverMon, or Launches EverQuest</li>

<li>
OPTIONS MENU - Allow you to configure EverMon</li>

<li>
WEB SITES MENU - A quick way to jump to several popular EverQuest sites</li>

<li>
INTERACTIVE MENU - Provides functions for interacting with the Stat Server,
by sending Bugs/Comments, or reading past broadcasts</li>

<li>
HELP MENU - Contains About and Online Help links.</li>
</ul>
<img SRC="em_main2.jpg" height=20 width=463>
<br>PATCH SERVER - Located under the title, this lists as <font color="#00CC00">UP</font>
or <font color="#CC0000">DOWN</font>, and indicates if the Patch server
for EverQuest is online or not.
<p>EQ STAT SERV - Located next to the Patch Server status, this lists as
<font color="#00CC00">UP</font> or <font color="#CC0000">DOWN</font>, and
indicates if Verant's Status Information Server is up.&nbsp; Without this
server, information about world/zone status, and player counts can not
be retrieved.
<p>EVERMON STAT SERV - Located next to the EQ Stat Serv, this lists as
<font color="#00CC00">UP</font> or <font color="#CC0000">DOWN</font>, and
indicates if the EverMon/EverGuild Stats Server is up.&nbsp; Without this
server, you will be able to get auto-downloads for new versions, broadcast
messages, or have access to the interactive menu.
<p><img SRC="em_main3.jpg" height=18 width=463>
<br>SERVER STATUS - This takes the largest part of the form.&nbsp; Here,
you will get information on the servers you have requested to monitor in
the Monitor Options menu (Explained later), along with information regarding
the status and health of each server, including the following information
:
<ul>
<li>
SERVER - This is the name of the world or chat server</li>

<li>
PLAYERS - The number of players that are currently on that server, or <font color="#CC0000">DOWN</font>
if the server if offline.</li>

<li>
TIME UP - If the server is up, and a number is listed for the number of
players, then this is a green time, which indicates how long the server
has been up.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the server is <font color="#CC0000">DOWN</font>,
then this is a red time, and indicates how long the server has been down.</li>

<li>
ZONE STATUS - This is a special digital light display that indicates the
health of the zones on that world.&nbsp; If all the zones are up, then
all the lights will be lit, like this :<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<img SRC="em_zones1.jpg" height=54 width=224><br>
&nbsp;<br>
However, if there were zones down, then the lights would start going out,
for each zone that was down.&nbsp; If say 10 zones were down, Then the
last 10 lights would be out.&nbsp; NOTE : No matter which zones were down,
the lights furthest to the right always go out first, thus the lights do
not represent zone order :<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<img SRC="em_zones2.jpg" height=54 width=229><br>
&nbsp;<br>
If more than 35 zones are down, all the lights will be out.&nbsp; Typically,
if that many zones are down, then the world server will be down as well.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<br><img SRC="em_main4.jpg" height=69 width=463>
<br>SCROLL BAR - At the very bottom of the screen, you will find another
one of EverMon's new features, this is a text scroller which will be able
to list important news and developments either with EverMon, or EverQuest.</ul>
<a NAME="s3b"></a><b>File Menu</b>
<blockquote>The File Menu provides program and server optiosn, and has
the following options :

<p><a NAME="app"></a><b>APPENDIX</b>
<p><a NAME="AppA"></a><b>Appendix A - Why can't you PING or TRACERT EverQuest
Servers?</b>
<blockquote>(updated 02/25/1999)
<p>Perhaps one of the questions I get asked most often is people asking
for EverQuest server addresses that they can use the PING or TRACERT command
or, or people asking me why these commands fail when they try to use them...
<p>If you go to your MS-DOS prompt, and type PING CHAT.EVERQUEST.COM&nbsp;
you will see what I'm talking about, in that your requests will all time
out, or fail to reach their destination.&nbsp; If you type TRACERT CHAT.EVERQUEST.COM,
you will notice that a trace route starts, but seems to die just short
of getting to Sony Interactive's network (Where EverQuest.com, and the
rest of the everquest servers live).
<p>The reason both of these fail is because there is a large firewall set
up on the gateway computer which leads into the Sony Interactive network.&nbsp;
This firewall blocks all incoming ICMP packets.&nbsp; ICMP packets, otherwise
known as Internet Control Message Protocol, is the means by which PING
and TRACERT commads are able to return information to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the packets are blocked, the computer your trying to send the packet
to never gets it, and thus never replies.
<p>So why would someone wish to set up a large firewall which prevents
people from being able to PING them?&nbsp; There are many answers for this.&nbsp;
One factor is that of network security.&nbsp; Another is that of server
stability.&nbsp; Game servers when not being flooded with PING's can focus
more on serving game players.&nbsp; In the end, it all works out for the
best for the players.
<p>So how can you get PING and TRACERT to work with EverQuest servers?&nbsp;
Unfortunately, you can not.&nbsp; Although a return trip time is being
worked into one of the future versions of EverMon, which will act like
a PING, there is no way to get TRACERT to work on any of the game servers.&nbsp;
The closest you will be able to get is the computer right before the Sony
Interactive gateway computer that blocks the ICMP packets</blockquote>
<a NAME="AppB"></a><b>Appendix B - What is the difference between real
PING and EverMon PING times?</b>
<blockquote>(updated 03/10/1999)
<p>With the new ability of EverMon to display Chat and Game server ping
times in Direct Mode, I've started getting several questions regarding
the comparison to real pings, that you would get from DOS, and the numbers
that EverMon reports.
<p>First of all, it's important to understand that the ping times that
EverMon reports is not in any way the same as the time that would be reported
if you used the DOS PING instead.&nbsp; The reason they are different is
in part because true PING's and TRACERT's can not be done on EverQuest
servers... See Tech Report #1 : <a href="tech1.htm" target="main">Why can't
I PING or TRACERT EverQuest Servers ?</a> for a good explanation as to
why this is not possible.
<p>Next, DOS PING times are reported in milliseconds... which means that
a ping time of 1000 would be the same as a 1 second time.&nbsp; The times
reported in EverMon are not millisecond.... instead, a 100 ping in EverMon
is the same as a 1 second round trip time.
<p>Your next guess would be to multiply the EverMon ping by 10, to get
the normal PING time, so if you see a 60 in evermon, you would think this
to be a 600ms real PING, right?&nbsp; Nope!&nbsp; this is not accurate
either...
<p>Because a DOS PING is done at an operating system level, the times are
going to be more accurate.. the PING times in EverMon are done at an application
level.&nbsp; There are events that occur in the application before the
ping time is calculated, which can cause the time to be slightly longer
than if it were done at the operating system level.&nbsp; Since we are
talking about very short periods of time, it does not take much to make
that value higher.
<p>So, the final question is what good is the ping time in EverMon, if
it is not the same ping time that the DOS PING would return?&nbsp; The
main, and only purpose to the EverMon ping times is to allow users to get
an idea as to what servers are running faster, and to give them a general
idea of how long it is taking to make a round trip from their area...&nbsp;
Generally, ping times of 40-50 are pretty good, where as ping times greater
than 100-110 may not be as good.&nbsp; users must compare their ping times
to those of their friends, and check to see at what ping times players
are getting good preformance at, and what ping times players are finding
it hard to play at.
<p>I'll start making this ping time ranges avalible here as soon as I'm
able to start getting feedback from other players as far as what ping times
others are getting, and how well they can play EverQuest.</blockquote>
