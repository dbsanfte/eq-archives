<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Perhaps one of the questions I get asked most often
is people asking for EverQuest server addresses that they can use the PING
or TRACERT command or, or people asking me why these commands fail when
they try to use them...</FONT></B><B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>If you go to your MS-DOS prompt, and type PING CHAT.EVERQUEST.COM&nbsp;
you will see what I'm talking about, in that your requests will all time
out, or fail to reach their destination.&nbsp; If you type TRACERT CHAT.EVERQUEST.COM,
you will notice that a trace route starts, but seems to die just short
of getting to Sony Interactive's network (Where EverQuest.com, and the
rest of the everquest servers live).</FONT></B><B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The reason both of these fail is because there is a
large <I><U>firewall</U></I> set up on the gateway computer which leads
into the Sony Interactive network.&nbsp; This firewall blocks all incoming
ICMP packets.&nbsp; ICMP packets, otherwise known as <U>I</U>nternet <U>C</U>ontrol
<U>M</U>essage <U>P</U>rotocol, is the means by which PING and TRACERT
commads are able to return information to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the packets
are blocked, the computer your trying to send the packet to never gets
it, and thus never replies.</FONT></B><B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>So why would someone wish to set up a large firewall
which prevents people from being able to PING them?&nbsp; There are many
answers for this.&nbsp; One factor is that of network security.&nbsp; Another
is that of server stability.&nbsp; Game servers when not being flooded
with PING's can focus more on serving game players.&nbsp; In the end, it
all works out for the best for the players.</FONT></B><B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>So how can you get PING and TRACERT to work with EverQuest
servers?&nbsp; Unfortunately, you can not.&nbsp; Although a return trip
time is being worked into one of the future versions of EverMon, which
will act like a PING, there is no way to get TRACERT to work on any of
the game servers.&nbsp; The closest you will be able to get is the computer
right before the Sony Interactive gateway computer that blocks the ICMP
packets.</FONT></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
