12:02 - UniNet Launcher Rollout
        </FONT></B><BLOCKQUOTE>

Well, the time is getting closer to the beta release of EverGuild.  With
the beta release, we will also be introducing the <a href='about.htm#uninet' target=main>UniNet Launcher</a>, which
will handle the updating of EverGuild, as well as EverMon, and any other
UniNet compatable applications.<br><br>

 <center><image src="launcher.jpg"></center><br>

Here are some of the features that will be gained with the use of the Launcher :
 <ul>
 <li>Automatic downloads for updates, similar to EQ's patch utility
 <li>Ability to download and install new applications from the web
 <li>Allows support and configuraiton for Socks 4, 4a, and 5 proxy servers
 </ul>

Since the Launcher is a relitivly new addition to our development plan, it
will be beta tested along with the EverGuild, and EverMon betas, and will
not be rolled out publically until either the new version of EverGuild, or
EverMon go public.

12:41 - Development Plan Update
        </FONT></B><BLOCKQUOTE>

I have finally updated my Development Plan!  I will be updating this
alot more often during the development of EverGuild, you can check this
page out to see what the current development status of EverGuild is,
including what has been completed, and what is planned to be completed.<br><br>

I have had many people wanting to know when EverGuild is out, and the
andwer is as soon as I can possibly get it out.  EverMon development
is being placed on hold, asside for a possible public patch to fix some
event bugs, but my daily development time will now be devoted to EverGuild.

12:31 - EverGuild Information
        </FONT></B><BLOCKQUOTE>

The only thing that I can say is that I am truely sorry... Over the last
month, things got very crazy on me with many needed EverMon changes, and
EverGuild development suffered as a result.<br><br>

The good news is, that EverGuild development has now picked up steam, and
I have a new target date for the first set of beta's.  That being 5/9,
which just happens to be the 3 month birthday of EverMon. Continue to
keep an eye on this site as we approach that date.

19:43 - EverMon 2.1 Build 32 Released
        </FONT></B><BLOCKQUOTE>

The latest version of EverMon is being publicly released a day earlier than
planned.  With it, all the new icons and splash screens, as well as some new
features have been added, including :
 <ul>
 <li>The new UniNet Packet Protocol has been fully implemented, and should
     prevent any future random boxes and strange effects.
 <li>String Library and the Error and Debugging Library has been upgraded
     and enhanced
 <li>Server Time Up/Down has been implemented.  However, it will restart from
     00:00 each time you start EverMon, until the EM Stat Server learns to
     track times as well later next week.
 <li>Support for ICQ #'s has been added for those wishing to get replies
     to bug reports and comments
 <li>Bug Reports and Comments now have a new interface which allows much
     larger messages to be entered

11:05 - EverMon/EverGuild now under Open BETA
        </FONT></B><BLOCKQUOTE>

In order to increase the number of beta testers that we have with our EverMon
and EverGuild software projects.  Beginning today, we will be moving to an
OPEN BETA policy.  This means that beta testers will not have to apply, and
anyone who is interested may download and use the beta versions of the software
by accessing our beta page at <a href='http://www.hydracomp.com/eq/beta' target=_new>http://www.hydracomp.com/eq/beta</a>.<br><br>

However, There are a few things that must be understood before trying to use
any of the beta software :
 <ul>
 <li>Beta Software is UNSUPPORTED software which can and will have many bugs
     and other problems with it.  If you are looking for a stable, relitivly
     bug free software, only download the public versions, and do not download
     the beta versions.
 <li>Beta versions of the software have built in TIME LIMITS which mean that
     usually after a month of use, they will SELF DESTRUCT, and no longer be
     usable.  You will either need to download the latest public version, or
     the latest beta version.
 <li>The updater in the beta software will only let you know when other BETA
     releases are made.  to be told when public releases are made by the
     updater, you will need to be running a public release version and NOT
     the beta version.
 <li>We have a BETA TEAM ICQ list set up.  If you are going to be using the
     beta software, and would like to get ICQ notification when new versions
     are out, please let either myself or ConneXion know.
 <li>Beta versions will be released ALOT more often than public releases. There
     may be one or two versions released on a daily bases.  We will be trying
     to limit the number of public releases to once every week or two weeks.
 </ul>

If we havn't scared you away yet with the above information, then feel free
to run on over the the beta page, and get the latest version of EverMon 2.1.
The good news about beta testing is that you will get to use the latest
EverMon features before anyone else, and will have a direct say in the
direction of development for EverMon as well as EverGuild once that makes
it to the Beta stage.

14:56 - New Site Graphics
        </FONT></B><BLOCKQUOTE>

        What do you think about the new graphics?  Pretty cool huh?  We can
        thank the EverMon and EverGuild official Graphics designer, <b><u>
        ColdDarkNord</u></b> as he has done an excellent job both with the new
        site graphics, as well as the new banner that will be part of EverMon
        starting with the upcoming 2.1 version.

O.k., so maybe the online chat and the message forums were a bad idea.. in
the last 5 days that they have been up.  no one has used them, so I am
taking them off the site.

I would like to thank both everyone that submitted banners for the banner
contest, as well as everyone that took the time to vote on the banner they
liked best.  The banner contest is now officially over.  If you don't yet
know who the winning banner is, you will soon find out with the release of
EverMon 2.1 *smile*

14:40 - EverMon 2.1 release timeline...
        </FONT></B><BLOCKQUOTE>

Tonight the first beta for EverMon 2.1 will be released to the EverMon beta
team.  Over the weekend, a lot of work was completed in the protocol re-write
for EverMon.  In addition, EverMon was successfully updated to use the new
UniNet Core modules.  What does this mean for you?  EverMon 2.1 will still
have the same basic look and feel as EverMon 2.0, however, the problems
with the message boxes, update boxes, and other odd effects randomly happening
should now be gone.  In addition, the Comment and Bug Report messages will
now be able to be much larger, and use the same message form interface
as the broadcast messages did.<br><br>

Assuming that their are no major problems encountered with the beta testing,
EverMon 2.1 should be released to the public by Friday Night.
