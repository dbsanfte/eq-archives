(Convert AVI or D2V to VCD)<br />
<br />
We've all had an AVI or D2V (D2V is a frameserving file produced by DVD2AVI) from one place or another, whether it was a DVD rip, a downloaded video, or simply a video capture from our camcorder or VCR. In this guide, you will get all the help you need to convert an AVI or D2V to a VCD-ready MPEG file.<br />
<br />
AVI is a nice video format except for the fact that it will only play on your computer, and not in your DVD player. This means that you're stuck in front of the computer if you want to watch it, and you can't exactly take it to a friend's house for movie night unless they happen to have a computer as well.<br />
<br />
Now, we're assuming that you've already prepared the AVI by stripping the audio to a separate WAV file, as mentioned on the previous page. At this point, you'll want to open TMPGEnc and cancel the wizard. That's right, cancel the wizard. Why? Well, although the wizard is nifty, we're learning how to do this &quot;the right way&quot;, so we can bypass it for now. Besides, you'll find that once you get some experience with this, using the wizard actually takes longer.<br />
<br />
First, you'll see this screen:<br />
<br />
<img src=http://www.dvdhelp.us/graphics/tmpgenc/tmpgenc_main_screen.gif><br />
<br />
There's nothing tricky about this section at all. This is simply prompting you to enter the video source (your AVI or D2V file), the audio source (your WAV file), and to choose a filename for the finished MPG file.<br />
<br />
On the &quot;Advanced Tab&quot; (Click Settings, then the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab)<br />
<br />
Video source type:<br />
For DVD rips and 99% of downloaded material, choose &quot;Non-interlace (progressive)&quot;<br />
For video captures from TV, VCR, and some camcorders (especially older analog ones), choose &quot;Interlace&quot;<br />
Since it is sometimes difficult to know what the source is without a test, do a test clip and change this if you get obvious horizontal lines (it could almost be described as a horizontal &quot;fuzzy&quot; effect) across your video.<br />
<br />
Field order:<br />
Usually choose &quot;Top field first (field A)&quot;<br />
This is another instance where it is difficult to tell without a test, so do a test clip and change this if you notice &quot;jerky&quot; video<br />
<br />
Source aspect ratio:<br />
For widescreen sources, such as a widescreen DVD, choose &quot;16:9 Display&quot;<br />
Otherwise, choose &quot;4:3 525 line NTSC&quot; (or &quot;4:3 625 line PAL&quot;) if the source is traditional fullscreen.<br />
<br />
Video arrange method:<br />
99% of the time, you will want to choose &quot;Full screen (keep aspect ratio)&quot;<br />
Occasionally you may prefer to simply center a video, which will result in black borders all the way around. This is typically only done for downloaded material that has a particularly odd aspect ratio (a tall, thin rectangle, for example...)<br />
<br />
Guess what?<br />
<br />
Technically, you can just click &quot;Start&quot; at this point and assuming the video isn't too long, you will have a VCD-compliant MPG file. However, we're usually going to want to tweak things a little so that we get the best results possible. After all, what good is it to spend all of this time converting video if we end up with an ugly picture?<br />
<br />
Time to tweak! :)<br />
<br />
From here on out (with the exception of the &quot;Detect Scene Change&quot; setting which should always be checked by default anyway), the settings described are purely optional, and independent of one another. Use them all or use only those that you select. It's all up to you. The question is: How important is this particular video project to you?<br />
<br />
These settings tend to make the picture quality better, but they also add a considerable amount of time to the conversion process. Everything discussed hereafter is on one of the tabs available after you click &quot;Settings&quot; from the main TMPGEnc screen.<br />
<br />
Let's start with the easy ones.<br />
<br />
VIDEO TAB:<br />
You will usually want to set the Motion search precision to &quot;Highest Quality (very slow)&quot;. It makes the conversion process take a bit longer, but allows for more fluid motion on the screen as compared to jerky motion. Personally, I always choose to use this setting.<br />
<br />
ADVANCED TAB:<br />
Follow the guidelines below for superb picture quality. Note that these two settings will DRASTICALLY increase the time required to encode the video, but will compensate for nearly all of the visual glitches normally caused by using a relatively low bitrate.<br />
<br />
To clarify, this is intended for the folks who are trying to clean up a low quality source video such as home video with visual &quot;noise&quot; (squigglies and similar issues), scratchy AVI or DivX, etc. and not for those of you who are working with a high quality video source, such as a typical DVD, etc. To do this with a typical DVD would be a waste of time and would only result in a &quot;softer&quot; video rather than a crisp clear picture.<br />
<br />
You may lower any of these settings if you desire. These are the settings for the most detailed cleanup, but if your video is only slightly &quot;dirty&quot; then you can probably cut these settings in half, or possibly even skip them. <br />
<br />
On the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab<br />
<br />
Noise reduction<br />
    * Still picture: 100<br />
    * Range: 4<br />
    * Time Axis: 100<br />
    * Check &quot;High quality mode&quot;<br />
    * &quot;Enable filter&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharpen Edge<br />
    * Horizontal: 127 (all the way to the right)<br />
    * Vertical: -127 (all the way to the left)<br />
    * DO check &quot;Enable filter&quot;<br />
    * DO NOT check &quot;Field base&quot;<br />
<br />
GOP STRUCTURE TAB:<br />
Check &quot;Detect Scene change&quot; unless you notice that it's causing blotches in your video. This is rare, but it does occur from time to time, in which case, you simply uncheck it and you'll be fine. This applies to nearly all videos that you'll work with, including DVDs.<br />
<br />
QUANTIZE MATRIX TAB:<br />
For VCD, check all four boxes and set &quot;Intra block&quot; to 10, and &quot;Non-intra block&quot; to 20. If necessary, you can increase these numbers, but don't go too high or you'll end up with a very soft-looking video. Obviously, we want sharp edges for 99% of our projects, but this is sometimes necessary in order to compensate for VCD's inability to produce clean edges due to the required low bitrate.<br />
