RELEASE NOTES
<p>
Before you download the most current build of IE6, we want to inform you of some of the intricacies of this particular build. Issues that you may encounter will be documented here each time we deliver a new build to you (we call these "known issues") whereas special features that we are excited for you to spend extra time testing are documented on the focused testing pages on The IE 6.x Website. For developers, we've added some notes of interest to you in the Developer's Notes section below as well. 
<p>
KNOWN ISSUES
<p>
The Internet Explorer Team does not recommend installing beta versions of IE over beta versions of Operating Systems. Standalone beta versions of Internet Explorer 6 are currently accessible to our beta sites for the purpose of testing on released Operating Systems.
<p>
Whistler incompatibility:
DO NOT install this version of IE 6 over Whistler or the IE 6 Public Preview! Doing so will cause your machine to fail and may not be reversible. 
Cannot download with IE versions 2 to 3.02 If you are using any versions of Internet Explorer between and including IE2 and IE3.02, after you click "Download latest build," you will be presented with a scripting error and will not be able to download the bits. 
Cannot download with Netscape If you are using Netscape 6 and click "Download latest build", you will get a dialog box asking you to submit information. After clicking "OK", nothing is submitted. This prevents you from downloading the bits. 
Flash problems Flash does not work properly in current builds of IE 6. Segments of the Flash animation on web sites may appear to loop and in some cases may cause a crash. Workaround: In the case of looping, typically refreshing the browser will correct the issue. 
Privacy settings work-around Internet Explorer is currently developing privacy features in version 6.0. If you experience problems in using a particular web site or receive errors related to cookies try adjusting your Internet Explorer Privacy settings to Low to ensure compatibility. Below are steps to accomplish that:
1. In Internet Explorer, click on Tools and select Internet Options. 2. Click the Privacy tab. 
3. Adjust the Privacy Preferences slider to Low. 
Find a Map Using the "Find a Map" feature by choosing "View > Explorer Bar > Search" will result in continually being prompted to enable cookies, despite any settings you may have. This will be addressed in a future release. 
 
<p>
ISSUES RESOLVED SINCE LAST RELEASE 
<p>
Personal Bar customization change When you upgrade IEAK, you will lose your previously installed Explorer bars. The new bar will include the MediaBar, MSNBC, MSN Search and Shopping. You can then reinstall your personal HTML bars after the upgrade.

 
<p>
DEVELOPER'S NOTES 
<p>
Msxml3 registers itself over msxml In this tech beta, msxml3 will register itself over any existing version of msxml on your machine, routing all calls into msxml to msxml3. (Msxml3 is the first version of msxml that is completely compliant with W3C standards and the first version of msxml to support XSL/T.) Please verify that data islands and all xml related behavior works as expected.
<p>
IFRAME security="restricted" A new property has been added to the Frame and IFrame elements: Security="restricted". This new property has the ability to push the Frame/IFrame into the restricted zone so the security setting for this zone will be placed on the contents within the frame. The key scenario here is to prevent malicious script or ActiveX controls from running within a frame on a web-based email application. Here's an example scenario: John wants to check his mail on Yahoo. He goes to the Yahoo site, logs in and notices that he's got a new message from hacker@hacker.com. Thinking that everything is safe and secure, he clicks on the mail, which displays the contents within an iframe. If we did not have the security property available to us, the iframe will exist within the same security zone as the rest of the application. This will allow the hacker to write malicious script that can access the parent window and browse through the rest of John's mail. The hacker may also have the ability to run destructive ActiveX controls. By forcing the frame into the restricted zone with security="restricted", script cannot execute and ActiveX controls cannot run. 
<p>
Custom Cursor The user is now able to generate their own cursor. Even animation is possible! IE supports .cur and .ani files. The look of the existing cursor has been changed to be standard CSS2 compliant. Focus events Due to historic compatibility with Netscape, onfocus/onblur are asynchronous and non-bubbling events. Developers have a hard time generating reliable focus. <br>
