    New York-based AT&T Corp. will exchange shares of its common stock valued at nearly $3 billion with rival cable-TV providers Comcast Corp. of Philadelphia and Cox Communications Inc. in exchange for shares of Redwood City, Calif.-based high-speed ISP Excite@Home, the companies announced today. Comcast and Cox were given the right to sell a total of about 60 million shares of Excite@Home to AT&T as part of an agreement announced last March to reorganize Excite@Home's operation. Following the transactions and on a fully diluted basis, AT&T will hold about 38 percent of Excite@Home, compared with about 23 percent that it holds today.<p>
 
AT&T's roughly 74-percent voting interest will increase to about 79 percent. The number of AT&T shares issued in the transactions will depend on the stock's average price during a 30-day trading period that began in mid-December. <br><br>
