    <b>FCC asks AT&T to clarify MediaOne plans.</b><br>

    The Federal Communications Commission asked New York-based AT&T Corp. Monday to clarify its plans to shed some of its cable television operations, a requirement it must meet as part of its purchase of MediaOne Group Inc., Reuters reported today. AT&T said Friday it would use its planned spinoff of Liberty Media Group to get below the 30-percent federal cap on cable ownership. When AT&T acquired MediaOne, its share of the cable market increased to 42 percent and the FCC gave the company three options to put itself below the cap, the article said. The commission also ordered AT&T to complete the process by May 19. However, the FCC wrote to AT&T, saying the company "does not appear to make a single election" in a requirement to shed cable subscribers or certain assets. An AT&T spokesman said that the company would study the letter further, but was confident that the company is in compliance with the order.
