    <b>AT&T, Cox seeking to evade cable-TV franchise fees.</b><br>

    Atlanta-based MSO Cox Communications Inc. and New York-based AT&T Corp.'s cable arm AT&T Broadband are using their classifications as telecommunications carriers toward the end of not having to pay millions of dollars in cable-franchise fees, Reuters reported today, citing a story in the Wall Street Journal's online edition today. The companies said that, if the fees are waived, subscribers who use their cable-TV lines to access the Internet will pay less each month. The franchise fees require companies to pay cities in which they use cable to deliver Internet services, the newspaper reported.<p>
The companies are arguing that, because of a San Francisco-based court ruling in June that Internet services delivered over cable lines are telecommunications services instead of cable-TV services, the companies Internet services are exempt from such franchise fees.<br><br>
