Her breath smelled like talcum powder. Wewere in the rec room.<p>"The quality of those stories &#151 I mean, they were <i>stories.</i> Even if it was just a paragraph, I'd find the story there, and I'd tell it like one. Beginning, middle, end. Sometimes no middle. Middles were frowned upon in those days. Folks didn't care about middles. Nowadays, middle is all you get. I bet you don't even know what I mean by 'middle,' that's how indoctrinated you are."<p>I nodded.<p>"The AP," Maia said. "We were kings back then. Back then there was awork ethic, and we were always looking for ways to be better, cleaner,faster. We wanted to break down the barriers between the Event and theReporting and the Consumption. We had a holy vision, we all shared it, thisidea of a miracle, Josh, a miracle where something would happen, somebodywould get assassinated, some treaty would be signed, a cat'd be pulled outof a tree, and the people would know about it instantly." Maia snapped herfingers, the fingernails free of deposits and yet tasting, I knew, and ohyes, of ancient bookpaper and of soil. My stomach lurched with incestuousnausea as I caught myself voyaging, as I had so many times before (nevergot old!), into the rarified air that was trapped between her breasts.<p>I nodded. "We don't even have 'the people' anymore."<p>"It was Abe whohad the Big Vision. We all shared the idea of the miracle, but he was theone who actually saw how it could work."<p>"The machine," I said.<p>Maia raised an eyebrow. "She told you?"<p>"It gave me nightmares for weeks, that story."<p>She shrugged. "I guess that's to be expected. It gave me nightmares forthe rest of my days. It was so damnably violent. It hurt so much, thisthing, tiny little knives, little needles, all over your body, like littlebees buzzing in your veins, trying to get out, stinging and stinging.<p>"But I'll tell you what.<p>"Once I wiped the sweat out of my eyes and took a good look around, theteletype would burst into life, chattering away, relaying thestory, the beginning and the middle and the end of everything I saw,describing it concisely and objectively. It was beautiful." That came outlike "beeyootifull." Her diphthongs were devolving, taking on the dry heatof Texas.<p>"So who was it?" I asked, leaning forward so she would do the same. "Whodestroyed it?"<p>Maia tightened her lips, cutting off the flow of blood. Then: "Kingston.But he didn't destroy it. He took it. He swiped it! He left Angel screamingand full of bloody holes, the teletype glass shattered. Six months later,the Firelands Electromagnetic News Service appeared, the King at the helm,beating out all of us &#151 we used to drink with him! &#151 getting topress hours before us, sweeping up all the awards."<p>"But," I said.<p>"But," and Maia smiled humorlessly, "But he and his staff were in Bedlamby the end of the year. They all had their own language, nothing anyone hadever heard of, and they couldn't understand anyone or each other. It waslike Babel all over again."<p>I moved even closer and reached out to caress her bare shoulder. "Andthat's where you went, huh?" I said. "You were there with them."<p>Maia lowered her eyes, staring right through the board between us. "Tellyour grandmother. And tell her I was just trying to keep the work ethic alive."<p>"That's a can-do."<p>Maia reached out and roughly messed up my hair, then went limp. When shelooked up again, confused, I kissed her on each eye and she murmuredquietly in a sleepy, wordless voice, preverbal, and our lips intertwinedlike flushed, ruddy vines and the past seven weeks tumbled forward,whirlpooling around the rec room, peeling the wood paneling from the walls,puncturing the swollen heart of the beanbag, and we asked each other,soundlessly, what we should do next, to top ourselves, and her tonguetasted like a blinding future, full of the unbearably sweet shock of beescoursing through our veins.</td><!-- Right Margin --><td colspan=1 bgcolor="#ffffcc">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffcc" colspan=5><br><br><center><img src="../images/f.gif" width="380" height="30" alt="The Letter F"></center><br><br></td></tr><!-- Boilerplate --><tr><td align=center valign=middle colspan=5 bgcolor="#000000"><font color="#cc3300" face="verdana, geneva, arial, helvetica, ms sans serif" size=1><br><br>Copyright 1995-1999, Joshua Allen<br><br><a href="mailto:info@fireland.com">info@fireland.com</a><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center></body></html>
