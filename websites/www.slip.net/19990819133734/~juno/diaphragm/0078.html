I'd been trying to learn all I could about who the movers and shakers were in that arena, what kind of stuff was out there, but it was difficult since there was so much and most of it was extremely hard to come by (plus a lot was released on vinyl and at the time I didn't have a turntable). But as I read countless newsgroups and mailing lists on the subject, the same name kept coming up again again: Orifex. They were always mentioned in the same breath as other experimentalists that I was into, like Throbwhistle and Dalau KAF and 443, but it sounded like Orifex was going way beyond what I'd heard thus far, creating really interesting and novel music. I knew I had to get my hands on some of this stuff.<p>That turned out to be a herculean task. I soon found out that Orifex kept getting involved with fly-by-night labels and their music just wasn't getting out there. These days it's a lot easier to track down their albums, now that their back catalog has been picked up by Warp, but at the time it was nearly impossible. I did manage to locate some sound clips on the Web, however, and the tiny snippets I heard completely blew me away. The music was so mechanical, so simplistic, but there was a genius behind it that couldn't be denied. An almost alien genius. I could clearly feel the massive intelligence and passion controlling everything, but that intelligence, that presence of organic life, was completely unfamiliar. There was something about the organization of the music, the way the sounds were processed and intertwined, that made perfect sense, but not human sense.<p>After finally locating copies of all three full-length Orifex releases, I began to assemble a vague biography from what I learned on the Web. Turns out that it was all the work of one young man from New Jersey by the name of Daniel Berube. He was just 17 when his first 12" came out, and only 20 when he composed his masterwork, <i>My Love Feeling of Love Dynamo,</i> the last piece of music he would ever create. Berube had always been fascinated by machines and electronics, and was constantly holing up in his garage to assemble new creations from the broken pieces of various household appliances and leftover parts from his father's automotive shop. He soon focused his obsession onto sound, modifying recording equipment and building machines that could bring to life his peculiar perception of noise. When he was thirteen years old he saved up his money and purchased a Tascam 4-track recorder and an entirely new world opened up to him. Berube would use school-time only for recording ambient noises, which he would then bring home and listen to obsessively, finding the tiny pieces that he wanted, then cutting them up and feeding them through his specially constructed amplifiers, radio transmitters, guitar pedals, and keyboards. When he finally got access to a computer at his friend's house, it was all over. Berube gave up on all other pursuits and plunged himself into an aural world of his own making. Eventually he dropped out of school and was kicked out of the house by his disappointed parents.<p>Berube lived at his friend's home for six months, and during that time he put together a massive collection of music. Ideas poured out of him and he spent almost every waking hour composing and recording. Some sources report that he assembled over 500 hours of tapes during that six-month period, but that's really all conjecture since he ended up erasing most of the material. I tend to think of this as a very compressed experimental phase, where he was simply trying out everything that occurred to him and not judging the results until it was complete. This was a time of learning for Berube, him figuring out what exactly his strengths and weaknesses were, and how to best play them to his advantage. By the time he left his friend's house for his own apartment in New York City, he'd whittled the 500 hours down to two. Two razor-sharp, unbearably intense, mind-expanding hours. Within a week, he had a job as the house DJ at Club Uxo. That two-hour demo tape is also lost to history.<p>Soon afterward, he cut a deal with the now-defunct label Shiny Pox Records, which released a string of twelve-inches under the Orifex name. I'm not a huge fan of these early works since I feel his job at Uxo was negatively influencing his sound. Because he had to give the crowd exactly what it wanted night after night, these twelve-inches have a more streamlined, more mundane feel to them. You see signs of things to come, but it's clear that Berube wasn't there yet. Shiny Pox compiled fourteen tracks and released his first full-length album, called <i>Moroplan,</i> in 1995.</p><br> <br><center> <img src="../images/orifex/moroplan.gif"><br> <font face="geneva, verdana, arial, sans-serif" size=-2><a href="http://www.real.com/" target="resource window">RealAudio</a> clip of <a href="../images/orifex/spider.ra">Spider Acetone Under</a>, the first track off of <i>Moroplan.</i> [26K]</font></center><br> <br><p>The album enjoyed some success, however - enough to get Orifex a deal with up-and-coming label Stellarium, who put out his next (and last) two full-length releases, <i>tGps22</i> and <i>My Love Feeling of Love Dynamo.</i> <i>tGps22</i> had Orifex going in a whole new direction. Berube was becoming more entranced with minimalism, exploring how the simplest of elements and the minutest of changes could still have an overwhelming impact. This was cold, solitary music, but music that could still whip a room into a frenzy. Below is the first sound clip of Orifex that I ever heard, and it still haunts me:<br> <br><center> <img src="../images/orifex/gps.gif"><br> <font face="geneva, verdana, arial, sans-serif" size=-2>RealAudio clip of <a href="../images/orifex/axwork.ra">013/22-AXWORK</a>, from <i>tGps22.</i> [29K]</font></center><br> <br><p>Not much is known about Berube's life after the release of <i>tGps22.</i> He quit his job at Uxo and disappeared. Berube was already shrouded in mystery but for almost all of 1997 he was nowhere to be seen. Stellarium was getting calls all the time about <i>tGps22</i> from fans wondering who he was, when the next one was coming out, etc., but no one had any news. Then, on October 19th, 1997, Daniel Berube entered the tiny loft that housed the three employees of Stellarium Records with a package under his arm. He chatted briefly with the staff, then suddenly collapsed onto the floor. An ambulance was called, but Berube was dead by the time it arrived. An autopsy revealed nothing. There had been absolutely nothing wrong with Berube, he'd been in perfect health, no drugs in his system, no cancerous tumors, no nothing. He simply died.<p>In that package, of course, was the master of his final album, which Stellarium released two months later.<br> <br><center> <img src="../images/orifex/lovefeeling.gif"><br> <font face="geneva, verdana, arial, sans-serif" size=-2>RealAudio clip of an <a href="../images/orifex/lovefeeling.ra">untitled track</a>, from <i>My Love Feeling of Love Dynamo.</i> [32K]</font></center></td><!-- Right Margin --><td colspan=1 bgcolor="#ffffcc">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffcc" colspan=5><br><br><center><img src="../images/f.gif" width="380" height="30" alt="The Letter F"></center><br><br></td></tr><!-- Boilerplate --><tr><td align=center valign=middle colspan=5 bgcolor="#000000"><font color="#cc3300" face="verdana, geneva, arial, helvetica, ms sans serif" size=1><br><br>Copyright 1995-1999, Joshua Allen<br><br><a href="mailto:info@fireland.com">info@fireland.com</a><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center></body></html>
