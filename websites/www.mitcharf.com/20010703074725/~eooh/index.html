<H2><A NAME="charter">Charter</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="core">Core</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>Goal: To make a name for ourselves as quality group members and
upstanding players.  People should see our guildtag and want us to group
with them.</LI>

<LI>Principle: We should be respectful and friendly to other players,
regardless of their level/guild/etc.</LI>

<LI>Principle: We should be adventurous and explore Norrath actively.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="elabor">Elaboration</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>Our goal is the most important part of the core.  Why?  Because we're likely
to be a small guild, especially to begin with.  We won't be able to
single-handedly hold many raids.  But if we have a good reputation, then
hopefully we'll have an easy time finding a place for ourselves in raids
held by others.  This won't happen right away, but it will
happen, provided we conduct ourselves well.  Of course, raids are a
long-term goal.  The guild has people of many levels (ranging from
around 10 to post-50).</LI>

<LI>Our first core principle is to help us avoid the "pompous
jerk" reputation that some of the more powerful guilds have gotten
(justly or not).  We want to avoid situations where a more powerful
group steps on the toes of a less powerful group, just because they
can.  Our guild is going to rely on making allies, so
this is important.</LI>

<LI>We'll be unlike most other guilds in that we won't hold
recruiting events.  We won't sit in Freeport and offer membership to the
first 10 newbies to find us, or whatever.  Membership in our guild will
pretty much only come through us inviting someone.</LI>

<LI>We need to be selective in our invitations.  Our most
valuable asset will be our reputation as a guild.  We lose that asset if
we invite people who do not merit it.  We don't want to be elitist (in 
the sense that we look down on people who aren't in the guild), but we
need to be selective.</LI>

<LI>We should try to help out other guild members wherever
possible, with teleports, rezzes, etc.  This isn't an obligation, of
course -- if you're a cleric and the primary healer for your group, it
may not be feasible to go to another continent to rez a guild member. 
Unless the guild member is in dire trouble, they should try to use the
services of a local cleric.  Remember, our goal is to make a good name
for our guild, and people won't look kindly on the group member that
abandons them.</LI>

<LI>The guild does not exist
for the purposes of twinking and powerleveling.  
They are not outlawed
in certain circumstances, but if a potential guild member 
is looking for this in a guild, then they are the wrong
place.</LI>

<LI>Power-leveling is worse than twinking.  Even if the character to be
power-leveled doesn't belong to a new player, it still can be detrimental.
The only case when it is not
harmful is if the player has already played a high-level character of
that class.  Just because you've got a level 51 druid doesn't mean you could play
a level 51 rogue or wizard very effectively.  It's important to
learn your character as you go up in levels.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="member">Membership</A></H3>

For a new member to join, they
have to:
<UL>
<LI>Have 3 sponsors, 1 of whom must be an officer.  (Obviously the
officer may not be of an appropriate level to group with the candidate
-- they'll pretty much just talk to the person, make sure they
understand what the 
guild is about, make sure they'll fit in with the guild, etc.  At least
1 of the other 2 sponsors, and preferably both, will group with the
candidate before giving their approval)</LI>
<LI>Have none of the current officers veto the membership (although only
officers can veto, anyone in the guild is encouraged to make the case
for a veto if they think it is appropriate)</LI>
<LI>Complete a task, decided upon by the current officers</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="officer">Officership</A></H3>

To become an officer, a guild member must:
<UL>
<LI>Be at least level 46</LI>
<LI>Have been in the guild at least 1 month</LI>
<LI>Have completed a task, decided upon by the current officers</LI>
<LI>Must have the support of two thirds of the current officers</LI>
