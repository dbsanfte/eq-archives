<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">&quot;...the Dreamer...&quot;<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>If you haven't met Rodrick yet, you should. When he greets you &quot;Heyla!&quot;,
you couldn't help but smile and say &quot;Heyla!&quot; in return. He's been
troubled with a common RL affliction most of us menfolk have - W-O-M-E-N...
&lt;chuckle&gt; But what bard isn't? &lt;grin&gt;<p>Anyway, as it is
traditionally solved by drowning the problems in drink, Rodrick has stepped up
to the task and has become a master brewer. If you happen to be a master forager
or even just are a widely-travelled adventurer, you might be able to help him
out. Check out his shopping list <a href="Rodrick_stuff/Rodrick_shopping_list.htm">here</a>.<p>Last but not
the least, true to being a bard, Rodrick has had some creative ideas, the most
noteworthy one I'm going to post below. I still think that this has it's
potential... maybe it could still happen... who knows...<p>Thus... is the life
of a dreamer...<p>&nbsp;

Subject: I have an idea...... you should all be scared now</p>
<p>My friends,</p>
<p>This is the first that many of you have actually heard from me, and some<br>
even heard OF me. The reason I speak up now is to bring before you an idea.<br>
An idea that stumbled out of the deep, dark recesses of my mind. An idea<br>
that came to me as I was singing and dancing my around Greater Faydark on a<br>
clear, beautiful day. An idea that... oh, sorry. The bard in me was<br>
starting to get the better of me again.</p>
<p>Now.. back to my idea. Everyone knows how Verant (the creators of EQ for<br>
those of you who didn't know :-P ) has always said that they wanted this<br>
to be a world created by the players. So far, this development by the<br>
players has come in the form of ideas for spells, songs, items, trade<br>
skills, area suggestions, etc. All seeming to be focused on the future of<br>
Norrath. Well, I bring before you a way for the players to develop the<br>
HISTORY of Norrath... a particularly bardic way, mind you, but a way that is<br>
still open to ALL characters. Okay, okay. You want me to get on with<br>
stating my idea.</p>
<p>So.. here it is. *handdrumroll* How about organizing a songwriting and<br>
storytelling competition? It would be open for anyone to make submissions.<br>
They could write anything they wanted (just so long as it pertained to<br>
Norrath and was in good taste ie.. no sexual content, etc). For example...<br>
stories about how the druid rings were built, or stories about some great<br>
hero of the past, or cheesy love songs about star-crossed lovers that got<br>
killed when a tree fell on them during a lover's tryst. The typical kind of<br>
stories that different races and classes would tell and sing.</p>
<p>Now, I already understand that this is going to be time consuming reading<br>
all the stuff that might be submitted, so judges would be in order.<br>
Probably break the submissions into categories and have a couple of judges<br>
per category. We would probably also have to have a message board of some<br>
sort for people to make their submissions. Right now, this is still just in<br>
the scheming phase, so there is still a lot of work that would have to be<br>
done if I/we go forward with this.</p>
<p>As rewards, we could ask high level players to donate items for rewards.<br>
Also, I was thinking about trying to ask Verant if they would be willing to<br>
post the winning stories and songs on the main EQ website. Since this IS<br>
going to help develop the game, I think they &quot;might&quot; actually be
willing. I<br>
also want to ask if they would be willing to provide some prizes so that<br>
high level characters are also interested in submitting entries.</p>
<p>Okay.. now that I have thrown my idea out there, I am prepared to take any<br>
constructive criticism, be it negative or positive. Remember, this is just<br>
an idea. If this seems like a feasible, fun, and exciting idea, I am<br>
looking for volunteers to help me. I was also thinking that we might want<br>
to have it guild sponsored. It might be a good way to get our name out<br>
there and maybe pick up some new members.</p>
<p>Okay... sorry for the long post, but I think the idea warrants at least that<br>
much.</p>
<p>I leave you to your thoughts and response writing now.</p>

Love no one until you can love yourself,<br>
for love of another is merely empty flattery<br>
and self-deception for one who cannot accept<br>
himself without pretense.<br>
