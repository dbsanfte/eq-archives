<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">The Trials of a Faithful Cleric<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>As the last ogre wise one fell to her knees and gave one final cry for mercy,
a ray of sunlight shone down through the merciless dark clouds overhead,
singling out the cleric amidst her party of fellow adventurers. The ray struck
her with such force as to throw her arms and head back. Her back arched, she
basked in the glory of her patron god, the Prime Healer, Rodcet Nife, energized
with the new strength and power He bestowed upon her.</p>
<p>Aeorni had known since the first summer she had devoted herself to Him, that
this day would come. Rodcet had sent her a vision in her sleep, a vision of this
moment, and 'twas then that she knew her life was His and would spend eternity
doing His Healing. And it would be this moment that would be her final naming,
as well, determined by the sign He would give her: Sunshine.</p>
<p>She stood there, the single ray of light sparkling brightly upon the droplets
of water that clung to her polished armor. The three adventurers under her
healing care turned their gazes upon Aeorni, bearing witness to the awe-inspiring moment. The paladin in their group knew instantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Aeorni!&quot; He called to her. &quot;This must be your naming, for I
recognize such a special sign as this! The face of your god surely shines upon
thee. What name has He chosen for thee?&quot; Daiikari asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&quot;His power is like the warming rays of the sun! As the Prime Healer's
faithful servant and the Hand through which he works, I shall be Sunshine!&quot;
she proclaimed into the light.</p>
<p>Lightning cracked across the clouds and thunder rolled through the sky so
loudly that it shook the ground below, and the ray of light was gone quicker
than it had come. The already menacing clouds became darker still, loosing upon
the land a torrential rain like none before, dousing torches and washing away
the soil.</p>
<p>Aeorni sank to her knees in the sand, her morning star falling from her hands
as she raised her fists to the sky, where once the clouds had parted in His
glory, and screamed, &quot;No!!! Why hast Thou forsaken me? What poison, what
disease, have I not cured in Thy name? What have I done to displease Thee so, oh
Glorious One?&quot;</p>
<p>She brought down her hands to her face and sobbed into them as she kneeled
there in the sand, the downpour continuing all around her. The paladin, Daiikari,
ran over to her, taking her by the shoulders and shouting through the storm,
&quot;We must leave this place before all are washed away!&quot; He dragged her
to her feet and toward the small dock just in time to see her other party
members opening gateways of escape for themselves.</p>
<p>Back in southern Freeport, sullen and soaked to the bone, Aeorni stood
outside the city walls. Calling down her deity's Furor and Smite, she punished
herself to the brink of death over and over, never using her gifts of healing,
only simple bandages to bind her wounds. For three days and three nights, she
made herself suffer through this pain without food, water, or rest. When at last
she fell from exhaustion, she cried out for a mediary to be sent to her.</p>
<p>In her delerium, she did not catch his name. She begged of him to plead for
her to Rodcet, and relate to Him details of her self-inflicted pennance, and beg his mercy. As the man
nodded and bid his farewell, Aeorni was left with her thoughts and wounds.
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she wondered to herself, &quot;it was the day in the great
desert when I was looking for work and none would have me. In a selfish moment
of spite, I refused my gifts to one in need.&quot; She shook her head as a tear
rolled down her cheek.</p>
<p>Two more days and nights passed, her time spent protecting and healing freely
the young and innocent who would wander from the city gates. On the third
morning at the western gate while bestowing protection upon the young, a friend
and member of the guild to which she belonged came running through. She waved to
him and smiled. Ynnos stopped before her, bowed and said,
&quot;Congratulations!&quot;</p>
<p>Aeorni gave him a very puzzled look, replying, &quot;For what?&quot; to which
he beamed a smile and simply stated, &quot;Your name! It is plain for all to
see... the glow about you... you are Sunshine!&quot;</p>
<p>She gasped and thought, &quot;Could it be?&quot; and glanced about herself. 'Twas
true! She shone with the light of Sunshine, casting about her a radiant glow.</p>
<p>- Aeorni Sunshine, 6/24/2001
