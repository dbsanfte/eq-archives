Subject: Crushbone tactics</p>
<p><br>
Here is a little something i knocked up from my exp's in Crushbone<br>
</p>
<p>Crushbone tactics</p>
<p>This map is a lot of fun to play but very crowded. I have played here for 5+
lvl's and have some advice so people new to its charms.</p>
<p>General: When quiet be careful: more Orks will spawn and pulling Two Lego’s
is no fun for any lvl. When busy be careful: a quick check on /who will tell you
the likelihood of Bad to Uber trains here. Lots of lower lvl’s = Kings
Cross-Station. Lots of higher lvl’s (people with surnames) = forget it, only
weaker (Upney) Throne Room Trains.</p>
<p>Tunnel: Trains to the tunnel will be the tougher Ork’s people run from. If
you are low lvl or health fight with your back to the zone border and you can
escape the Train whilst keeping your eyes peeled for more baddies arriving (the
infamous “Second Wave” which usually is the Last guy to run from castle
followed by Emperor Crush and some Royal Guards). The Orks have a strange
pathing route through here so learn it and you can avoid any Train in time.</p>
<p>Trainer hill: When not camped you can pull the Trainer on his own by standing
close to the tree and using your bow. THEN run down the hill and wait for him at
the slope up. If in trouble just fall back off and run to zone. Trainer drops
the Shiny Brass Shield once in a blue moon. Trains from here take FOREVER to
reach the tunnel (because of a strange routing path) and consist of the
Centurions, Trainer, and some buddies they picked up on the way. Don’t shout
“TRAIN” too quickly because you will look very foolish when ten PC’s run
up to help and nothing can be seen. Wait…</p>
<p>Outside Castle Main Drawbridge: Main Train route from castle, but a lot of
people camp here and send in a puller. A nice spot but usually not anything
better than the guard Lego’s. If the Throne Room Group come tumbling out the
castle doors and windows, then a big train is coming directly after them. Be
careful to avoid anything you can’t handle.</p>
<p>Outside Castle Rear Drawbridge “The Pit” : This is a multidirectional
camp. You have Slavers from the rear, Lego’s and Centurions from the front and
sides, Oracles from the castle grounds and sometimes trains from the Throne Room
following a jumper from the window. Nice! A good group on a quiet day will get
almost constant Mob’s attacking them if that’s your powder. However, when CB
is full and all the camps are packed, then this camp spot is not for groups
above 12 as passing traffic will be dead before you get it. One thing to note
this camp is usually first to spot the Warlord (rare spawn – needed for
Screaming Mace Quest) who I've mostly seen on the castle-side of the bridge. If
you should be so lucky to get to him first then make sure you loot him as SOON
as he drops because Kill Stealing is rampant on this MOB.</p>
<p>Tent City (Lego’s Camp): This is an area for a nice small group of around 4
and is never camped because it’s a bit boring.</p>
<p>Slavers Hut (Slave Pits) : This camp is great for 10 – 14 lvl’s because
(again) you will get hit from all sides. A good number of Melee Classes can
avoid the casters getting jumped. The pits themselves have slavers who drop keys
to the Elf Slaves around the Zone. Get the keys and give them to the right slave
for some nice EXP. The Top Slaver there conned Blue to me last night (Very Quiet
– 5 players in zone) and I’m lvl 16 warrior. The named Dwarf here drops his
tongue for a Pally quest. The Big hut has the NPC’s needed for the Screaming
Mace Quest.</p>
<p>Screaming Mace Quest: Follow these instructions to complete this (long)
quest.</p>
<p>1. Get 15pp and buy the Dwalfen Ringmail Tunic in Greater Faydark. Don’t
pay more than this. Alternatively get a KICK arse group and camp the Throne Room
Tower (see below)<br>
2. Wait, and wait, and wait, and wait for Warlord to spawn. Various theories
abound about getting him to spawn, but my two favourites are that Crush and
Dvinn Must have been slayed first. Or that All the placeholders have to be
killed (Ork Pawns). I try both. When you finally get him you are looking to loot
the Bracer of Battle. Once you have it you will be pestered by everyone in the
map to sell it to them – DON’T! It is a very rare item.<br>
3. Goto Slave hut. Talk to the FIRST Dwarf blacksmith and say “the king is
dead” and “what about ringmail?” Sometimes it takes a few tries’s for
him to respond. Once he asks for the Tunic give it to him for a Mace<br>
4. Move to your right and say to the Elven Priest “the king is dead”. Once
he responds give him the Bracer and he will give you the Prayer Cloth. He will
then ask for both the cloth and the mace.<br>
5. I gave him both at the same time.<br>
6. He will give you the screaming mace back. This is a magical mace which Yaulps
in battle (occasionally, depends on level and DEX) Yaulp buffs you STR by 10 and
your AC by around 7. It can sell for around 75pp in Greater faydark right up to
125pp in Freeport or further away.<br>
7. For PITY’S sake if you keep it be sure to have trained 1HB or your be in
the same boat as me pouring in all you points after levelling (DOH!)</p>
<p>Throne Room: This camp is hard for two reasons.</p>
<p>1. The route into the room is thin and if you have big players in your group
you will be stuck in one-on-many battles.<br>
2. It is possible to pull the whole damn room in one go and die very quickly due
to the above problem. My advice is too Wait outside by the caslte walls, and
pull the MOB’s carefully to lessen the resistance left inside. Once trimmed
occupy the doorway to the throne room itself with the casters WELL BACK, and
then pull the room and rush to the table. Once you have the room you will come
under a lot of MOB pressure almost constantly. Get the group to stay by the
table and don’t go up to the throne or you will pull those MOBs in the tower
as well.</p>
<p>To hold here you will need (in my opinion) at least lvl 14+ PC’s. One pure
Melee, Two or Three Mixed Melee, One or Two Wizards, and One or Two Healers.
Bards (the warrior’s best friend) are my favourite mixed melee as well as
rouges.</p>
<p>When I grouped here best: the Wizard stood back and concentrated firepower on
the magical Orks or the toughest fighter.</p>
<p>I like it when everyone fights and no one quits or chickens out, but that
sometimes cannot be avoided and when RUN is called, jump out one of the windows.
DO NOT try and run back through the corridors because you can run into Two Lego’s
inside and another outside on the bridge. (This is how the Uber train gets
going). Also, when running don’t be afraid to jump into the moat as long as
you can swim well, this can sometimes gain you valuable seconds on your retreat.
Dying here can be a right pain so AT LEAST make sure you get out of the castle
before dying :)</p>
<p>The Tower: This is the final challenge on this zone. All the TOP Orks spawn
here (Crush, Prophet, Dvinn) and subsequently this can be a very camped area by
the higher lvl players (Prophet has a head for a high quest etc). Be aware that
space is at a premium so I would only recommend fighting here if you are 20+ and
with friends. Dying up here is a very bad thing to do. Dvinn is a Dark Elf and
has some nasty hit stats to say the least.</p>
<p>All the Tower Orks will train after you all the way to the zone if you run!
Especially if you run back through the throne room and out the main door (/em
Shakes his head in disbelief) I’ve seen a train at the tunnel that took twenty
people to sort out, which for a Lower Teen lvl zone is very bad.</p>
<p>One thing to note, a good bowmen or high lvl spell caster can sometimes pull
Crush from outside the castle by shooting up at the tower. This can sometimes
result in only crush coming out to play (I’ve seen a high lvl player farm him
this way). Although, its worth noting that I’ve ALSO seen this cause the
wobbly group holding the TR to run pulling the rest of the castle along with
him. CHOO CHOOO!</p>
<p>One final thing: Killing Orks puts you in the Faydark Guards good books and I’ve
gone from Apprehensive to Warmly in no time.</p>
<p>All in all Crushbone has something for everyone. After the listlessness of
East Common Lands and the barren death trap that is North Ro I have found
CrushBone to be the best Lower Teen Zone I’ve yet come across. I still get
EXP, meet good people, mix with higher lvl’s, get my skills up, and make some
good profit here (off the unique items at least). Myself, I mix this zone in
with a couple of runs to Steamfont (Love those Minotaurs!) and make around 20pp
a night selling their axes to Newbies (and I’ve gone up 7 lvl’s in a good
time).</p>
<p>Enjoy!!</p>
