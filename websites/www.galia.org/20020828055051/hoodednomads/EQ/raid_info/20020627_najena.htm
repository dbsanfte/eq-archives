<p>About the raid, from Sillain Dreyguns:</p>
<p>We will be having a guild raid in Najena on Thursday, June 27th at 7 PM EST. 
I will log on Sillain at least one hour prior to the raid to port anyone in that 
may need a ride. Please be near a wizard spire at this time. PLEASE PRINT A MAP 
OF THE ZONE BEFORE YOU ARIVE. It can be very easy to get lost in areas of this 
zone, and it can save your life and the life of those in your group to know 
where you are going. There are several traps that will drop you down to the 
bottom floors of the dungeon. You can find a good map at 
<a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/najena.html">http://www.eqatlas.com/najena.html</a> 
According to Allakhazam's
<a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Antonica/Najena.htm">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Antonica/Najena.htm</a> 
this is a level 15 to 35 zone. There are quite a variety of creatures here 
including undead and summoned so you clerics and paladins out there can enjoy 
playing with some of your specialty spells. A complete list can be found at 
<a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml? zone=45">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml? zone=45</a> The only NPC I 
encountered that had any faction hits was a High Elf enchanter in the jail cells 
on the bottom floor (Evil races beware, she WILL agro on you) so faction should 
not be a concern. Since most of us are still in the lower levels, and there is a 
13 percent experience bonus for this zone, I will try to form groups to gain 
experience when it's possible. However, there is some really nice loot to be had 
here and I would like to get some of it for those who attend the raid. I will 
list some of the nicer items, but I encourage you all to look for yourselves. 
Bonecracker (lvl 23-26) 
<a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3583">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3583</a> 
is probably one of the easiest mobs to kill. His loot includes a +2 STR ring 
with the new Summoning Efficency effect, a 7 28 whip, and a +3 AC +3 DEX mask. 
Next up the food chain would be Rathyl (lvl 25 with a lvl 22 pet) 
<a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2166">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2166</a> 
who drops a couple weight reduction bags (20 percent, 8 slots on the nice one). 
BEWARE....As soon as you kill him Rathyl's Incarnate will pop (lvl 30) http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5258 
This bad boy drops a bracer AC: +6 Magic Resist: +7 Mana: +15 with the new 
Extended Affliction I effect. Drelzna (lvl 30) 
<a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3625">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3625</a> 
drops a nice spear with 10 charges of right click heal and a really nice dagger 
6 23 and procs a wicked little dot for it's level. I'll be coming back to get 
one of these for my rogue after the raid. The only mob I didn't slay while 
exploring here today was Najena herself (only because I couldn't get the key to 
her layer) Najena is a lvl 28 Dark Elf (Don't worry, no faction hits) that is 
needed for the Necro
<a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3628">Epic. http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3628</a> 
Her common drop is Black Tome with Silver Runes Int: +4 Mana: +30 with her rare 
being the Flowing Black Robe AC: +8 Sta: +5 Int: +3 with Reanimation Efficiency 
I. This is a really nice at the lower levels, however, if your a neco, you will 
have to give it up in the process of getting your epic. It can also be bought 
fairly cheap, however it is lore so you will have to hand in your first one 
before you buy another.Belive it or not, Najena is not the biggest mob in the 
zone. The Widowmistress is (lvl 36-40) 
<a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3538">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3538</a> 
She drops the same dagger as Drelzna but is also needed for a quest to get a 
REALLY nice cleric only mask. Terror Forged Mask AC: +4 Wis: +7 Cha: -5 Magic 
Resist: +5 and UNLIMITED RIGHT CLICK FEAR! My cleric will have one soon. I can 
see how this can really be a life saver when your out of mana. For those daring 
enough to take her on becareful. She is a major undercon. I have heard of her 
killing lvl 50 people, however Silain dropped her with no problems (Glad my root 
didn't fail). Please note that many of the mobs listed above are key holders for 
many of the locked doors in the zone. Refer to the above link to the map if you 
want to know exactly who holds what keys. </p>
<p>One final note. I forgot to mention in my last email that all loot aquired on 
raids will be handed out on a &quot;need before greed&quot; basis. It will go to the 
person ATTENDING THE RAID WHEN POSSIBLE that can use it the most. If noone 
attending the raid can use the item that drops, I will then open it up to alts 
and then to everyone. If you are the lucky one to get some of this fine loot, I 
may ask that you give the item that is being replaced to another member of the 
guild that can use it. This way everyone can benifit. </p>
<p>That pretty much sums it up for this zone. As always, I encourage you to 
explore the zone before the raid to become familiar with it. If you do I 
strongly recomend taking some friends with you. If anyone has any questions just 
yell, you know where to find me. </p>
