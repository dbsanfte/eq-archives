<br>
Felixx ran and ran, his feet barely touching the ground. He heard fireballs go whizzing past his ears and heard a mumbled shouting following him as he ran out of the West Gate in Freeport.<br>
This wasn't the first time that it had happened, the view of dark elf clerics sickened the lowly humans and their foul smelling light skinned friends the Faydwer elves.<br>
Just as he ran past the city walls out into the open space he noticed that the light had begun to fade and darkness was approaching.<br>
The mob of seething vermin had given up chasing him and just as he began to think of other matters a voice came out of nowhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello&quot;, it said softly. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
Felixx had gone into a trance, something that he can't control that happens in quiet moments. The voice snapped him out of it and he looked across.<br>
There before him stood a human female, she was about four inches taller than him but short for a human, Felixx was short for a dark elf though, much to the amusement of passing gnomes who like to poke fun.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm fine, just a little tired&quot; he said resigningly.<br>
&quot;I saw the people chasing you out of Freeport, what happened?&quot;<br>
&quot;You don't want to hear it&quot;, Felixx's eyes were getting heavy and the last thing that he wanted to do was get into a deep conversation about trying to talk to one of the Priests in the Temple of Marr.<br>
&quot;Try me..&quot;, the voice persisted.<br>
&quot;Well, I practice the arts of a cleric - and I wanted to gain some wisdom by talking with one of the Temple priests in North Freeport, I thought the worst that could happen would be that I would be told to leave and just as I started talking to the guards outside a passing merchant noticed that I was wearing a mark of Innoruuk around my neck and screamed out for my blood....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Consequently I had to run, the guards who barely noticed me before united together and accompanied with merchants and townsfolk chased me to the edge of the city, I heard one of them tell me, if I was ever seen in Freeport again they would make sure that I didn't get out alive&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's horrible&quot; she said, putting her hand to her mouth.<br>
<br>
Felixx applied some chemicals to various wounds that had been afflicted upon him while he made his escape, his life long goal was to converse with the Priests of Marr and even though he was still young, he felt that his dream had been shattered.<br>
<br>
He bid the human goodbye and headed into the moon for Neriak with a nasty limp from an arrow that managed to sink it's tip into the back of his knee, every step was hard but he'd done all that he could with regard to his injuries.<br>
<br>
The last thing he needed was sympathy for his situation, after all what he attempted was stupid and dangerous, not to be attempted again before he had gained some recognition within the cleric community.<br>
<br>
It was still getting darker as he emerged from the famous tunnel, the merchants had all been busy at it during the day by the looks of things and beggars could be seen harrassing them for spare coin as they walked away with their day's profits.<br>
<br>
A dwarf beggar approached the limping dark elf, and blurted out his well versed line &quot;Excuse me sir, could you spare me some loose change? It does no' have to be much&quot;<br>
<br>
Poor old Felixx, he couldn't even run away this time, just limp along listening to it's voice making excuse after excuse as to why he should part with his meagre possessions. Finally after five minutes of it he turned around and in a threatening tone said &quot;Listen here you little rat, if you don't get out of my sight I'll...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;..you'll wha'?&quot;, he interrupted. &quot;Kick me? Chase me away?&quot;, he said sarcastically.<br>
<br>
The dwarf walked slowly away whistling looking for someone rich to beg to, knowing that the blue skinned elf wouldn't do anything&quot;.<br>
<br>
Felixx prayed for a better day tomorrow, for it cannot be any worse than this....<br>
