<font color=#408080>POSITION</font>: Mistress To The Shadows<P>

<font color=#408080>CLASS</font>:  Rogue<P>

<font color=#408080>HISTORY</font>: Lhust has no real memory of her time before
she was sold to the K`Jartan of Neriak for a few platinum pieces at the age of
six ... at the time she was known as Erised. She would spend the next ten years
as a servant to them ... spending most of her time in the kitchen at the bar
they owned, Maiden’s Fancy. Some nights she would sneak downstairs and watch
the women dance ... she thought they were the most attractive people in the all
of Neriak.<P>

Shortly after her sixteenth year, while waiting on tables on the first floor, a patron got a little too friendly.  In the scuffle that ensued her dress was torn, revealing her full breasts and the rest of her attributes to all that were there.  Belyea was astounded to find out his little kitchen wench
had bloomed into a beauty.  He wasted little time to get her trained as a dancer for his more privileged patrons.<P>

The Shadow Master recruited Erised into his circle of darkness her opening night
... taking claim not only her body for the first time but branding her soul with
his own sinful force. He renamed her Lhust ... and she has embraced his gift ...
relishing the chance to enhance her wickedness almost as much as she does her
next frolic in the sheets.<P><font color="#008080">USE OF CHARACTER WITHIN TALES</font><font color="#FFFFFF">:
</font><font color="#C0C0C0">If it happens within Norrath then feel free to
write about it.&nbsp; Also feel open to use her within tales written as a
supportive character ... don't try to take her over or put her in places she
would not be ... (IE: Suddenly she finds herself a prisoner of the Barbarians in
Halas, when prior to that, she was in Lavastorm stalking an innocent child). I
do ask that any sexual content involving Lhust be e-mailed to me first for
approval.&nbsp; And please understand there will be NO continuous 'cyber-sex'
stories between my character and another.&nbsp; Perhaps a single tale if the
situation warrants.&nbsp; If I use your own character inappropriately (either
within Norrath or on the forums) please e-mail me as soon as possible so I can
make edits and amends.</font><P>
