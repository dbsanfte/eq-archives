      <b><i>Updated</i></b> <b>Rules of the Game</b>
      <p>Greetings and welcome to &quot;Shadow Sins&quot; a malevolent guild
      finding its place on the Bristlebane server. We are a recent addition to
      this realm, created for the singular intention to role-play with other
      role-players. A lot of us come from other servers … drawn here by a
      common interest.<br>
      <br>
      To make this adventure an exciting escapade for everyone, a few rules will
      be laid out in advance … we ask that they be respected.<br>
      <br>
      1) Have Fun!<br>
      <br>
      2) &quot;Shadow Sins&quot; were created to role-play … if we are
      wandering Norrath we are there to role-play … we have elders in other
      realms when we want to hunt for experience, items or mobs. However, we
      understand there will be times when the others that participate will not
      be able to. (Not in the mood, fighting an epic mob … etc). To help
      alleviate confusion we ask that when you are role-playing you use /role.
      This command hides your level, class and location. So if we do /who all
      &quot;Holy Order&quot; and see the following …<br>
      <br>
      Anonymous Siniana &lt; Holy Order of Tunare &gt;<br>
      Level 50 Ranger Rychird &lt; Holy Order of Tunare &gt; Plane of Fear<br>
      Anonymous Villaen &lt; Holy Order of Tunare &gt;<br>
      <br>
      We would assume both Villaen and Siniana are available to participate in
      the storyline … but …<br>
      <br>
      You tell Siniana, &quot;Greetings, Light Dweller.&quot;<br>
      Siniana tells you, &quot;OOC: Not tonight up in Fear with the guild.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      At this point we will not pursue contact any longer. We are constantly
      role-playing BUT if for some reason an OOC must be made it will be marked
      as above or within ( ).<br>
      <br>
      Siniana tells you, &quot;You cannot hide in the shadows forever.&quot;<br>
      You tell Siniana, &quot;(Sorry, AFK a moment minor emergency)&quot;<br>
      <br>
      3) Forums – At this time most of our story telling outside the game will
      take place within our own Guild Hall (http://shadowsins.com/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi),
      Natural Selection (http://pub2.ezboard.com/bsilentthunder59720), Holy
      Order of Tunare (http://pub46.ezboard.com/bbindingties) and The
      Bristlebane Tavern (http://pub63.ezboard.com/fbristlebane70700frm2)
      Forums. <b>** Webmistress Note: Can you make hyperlinks for those four
      forums, purrty please??? **</b> We have a restricted forum dedicated on
      our message boards for &quot;Darker Tales&quot; you can expect our posts
      publicized on other places to be at a PG-13 rating or lower. Perhaps as
      time passes we’ll add more guilds to our list … or maybe lockdown on a
      single role-playing forum.<br>
      <br>
      There will be little censorship on the &quot;Shadow Sins&quot; forum we
      hope you always speak your mind both IC and OOC … however we do ask that
      you remain civil to one another and any out of character comment made on a
      role-playing forum, regardless of intent will be moved or deleted.<br>
      <br>
      4) If you have a problem with a particular player please try to resolve it
      between yourselves first … if that is not possible please contact the
      following representatives of each guild with your grievance.</p>
      <p>Athene – Natural Selection - druid_athene@hotmail.com<br>
      Siniana – Holy Order of Tunare - siniana@hotmail.com<br>
      Lhust – Shadow Sins – lhust@shadowsins.com</p>
      <p>*If your problem lies with none of the above mentioned guilds please
      contact Lhust and she will take care of the dilemma as quickly and
      diplomatically as possible. If a new guild enters the game a
      representative will be appointed to help keep things orderly.<br>
      <br>
      5) Feel free to use our &quot;Shadow Sins&quot; characters within your own
      tales … we ask that you remain true to the character’s stories and
      profiles … don’t go putting Glutten on a diet or making Lhust a saint
      … if you are unsure please ask first either on the forum, private
      message or e-mail. Also no killing or maiming, or sexual involvement of
      characters without prior approval.<br>
      <br>
      6) We will attempt to keep an updated list of all active role-players
      involved within the storyline for other guilds on our forums, for we
      realize not everyone wishes to be involved ... and others that are not in
      &quot;Shadow Sins&quot;, &quot;Natural Selection&quot; or &quot;Holy Order
      of Tunare&quot; will be. There will be no such list for &quot;Shadow
      Sins&quot; … you want to see the role-players look at the roster …
      that is what we were created for … we have other characters to go to if
      we want to do other activities.</p>
      <i>
      <p>Amendment: We have a couple characters that have made their Shadow Sins
      their only characters at times the do not wish to role-play they will use
      /anonymous.</i><br>
      <br>
      7) We are working on having an IRC chat room set up for impromptu RP
      sessions outside of the game, more details on that as the game progresses.<br>
      <br>
      This document is a work in progress please feel free to add your own
      thoughts and ideas.<br>
      <br>
      And on that note let the games begin.</font></td>
