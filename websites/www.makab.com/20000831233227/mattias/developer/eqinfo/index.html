	<DIV CLASS=centermark>
	A feature packed program for EverQuest players.
	</DIV>
	
	<DIV CLASS=normal1>
	EQ&nbsp;Info is a nice program for players of the very popular on-line game EverQuest.
	</DIV>
	
	<DIV CLASS=normal2>
	Features include: Skill information and monitoring, mana calculator, server monitor, class 
	and race combination and starting cities, etc.
	</DIV>
	
	<DIV CLASS=normal2>
	It all started as a mana calculator as the previously available ones did some minor 
	things wrong (Intelligence over 200 not handled correctly and mana only for every 
	5th int). But I kept adding more things I would like to have myself. I hope you find this 
	useful too!
	</DIV>
	
	<DIV CLASS=normal2>
	More Information is available in the <A HREF="readme.html">Readme file</A> 
	(for example upcoming features).

	<LI>Download the program from the <A HREF="#files">files section</A>.
	<LI>Then it depends a little on the platform you are using. If on Windows for
