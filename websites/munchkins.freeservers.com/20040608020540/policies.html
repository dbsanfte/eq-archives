        Policies </font> </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Reputation</b> <br>
        The reputation of the guild and its individual members must be one of 
        the primary focuses of everyone. Our goal is to maintain a visible presence 
        on the server, and be viewed by the server community as an honorable and 
        charitable Guild. Members are expected to carry themselves in a manner 
        that reflects well upon the guild as a whole. </font><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Guild Chat<br>
        </b>The /Guildsay channel is a private means of communication for guild 
        members only. It's use is a privilege of being in the guild, and places 
        a certain level of responsibility upon each member. Most importantly, 
        guild chat will be a positive environment and is not the place to vent 
        or rant. There will be no arguing amongst guild members on guild chat. 
        It will be given that there will be disagreements, and if you need to 
        debate the matter, please do so in /tells. If you find that you can not 
        resolve your differences; feel free to contact an Officer to settle the 
        argument, but be warned, the ruling of an Officer are Final and may not 
        be appealed. Also since the guild has members of various genders, races, 
        ages, nationalities and political divisions; discussions that might be 
        offensive to these groups is prohibited. <br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Keeping Informed</b> <br>
        WE VERY HIGHLY recommend that each member checks the Web site and especially 
        the MESSAGE BOARD for the latest information and news such as Raids, Events, 
        Times and Dates of Events, etc... Please use the message board often as 
        it is the best source of timely information. The Message Board is a Privilege 
        and a great means of communicating, we ENCOURAGE each member to participate 
        as much as they can.</font><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Anonymous</b> <br>
        We, the members, are very proud of our Guild Tag and each member is encouraged 
        not to go anonymous in Norrath. This will help other members easily find 
        those near them for grouping and assistance. If going anonymous is needed 
        (for one of many reasons), please use the /roleplay command so that the 
        guild tag will stay intact.<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Guild Mates</b><br>
        Whenever possible, party with fellow guild mates, especially when they 
        need help obtaining quest items. We are a Family of friends outside of 
        the real world and that is why we are here, to work together and help 
        each other,and you never know when you may need the help. It also looks 
        good to see groups of Munchkins traveling and fighting together.<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Guild Events</b> <br>
        Guild events are called for the purposes of Bonding the Guild together, 
        gathering necessary equipment and just generally doing mayhem and having 
        fun. Please be Prompt - people don't like waiting to start killing or 
        having fun.<br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Begging</b> <br>
        Begging is not tolerated. Period. Giving out free items is an act of kindness 
        from another member and should not be expected.<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Kill Stealing</b><br>
        Do not steal kills! As tempting as it may be, KS'ing is not tolerated 
        in our Guild. There should always be a way to share spawns, if not, just 
        hunt somewhere else. If you are having issues with another KS'er, simply 
        speak to him/her in a kindly fashion and if that does not work /petition 
        a GM and report the offense. Do not risk suspension by trying to &quot;get 
        back&quot; at your competition.<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Loot Stealing</b> <br>
        Do not loot fallen monsters that you did not kill. Unless you have permission 
        from the characters that killed the MOB, do not scavenge other corpses. 
        If you see a lone corpse and there is nobody around, it is fair game, 
        but if there is a group nearby, it is a safe bet that it's their kill.<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Help Non-Members</b> <br>
        Assist others when you can. Let's give MoM a good reputation on the Vazaelle 
        server. If someone needs a buff, help finding a corpse, a teleport, bind, 
        etc&#133;and if it is within your power to help, do it. Of course, there's 
        nothing wrong with excepting donations in the process.<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Grouping</b> <br>
        Party often and represent us well. Partying outside the guild is a great 
        way to meet other adventurers that could be considered for membership. 
        It's also a good way to make new friends. When partying, loot responsibly 
        and pull your weight. We want to show others that the MoM are Mature and 
        Experienced players, and that they know their Business!<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Looting Rules for Raids:<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Looting rules 
        that you are about to read ONLY applies to Raids and not to your regular 
        groups. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> The same rules 
        apply for non-guilded members that wish to join us. For Alliances the 
        Looting rules will be discussed among Guild Leaders an Officers.</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All Loot will be distributed 
          in the terms of &quot;need before greed&quot;, this same rule will apply 
          to No Drop items as well. You are not eligible if the item you have 
          is better then what drops. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> All Loot will be Random 
          1-5000 with level caps, if a tie should happen then those members that 
          tie will reroll. The level caps consist of 15-20, 20-30, 25-35, 30-40, 
          35-45, 40-50, 45-55, 50-60.<br>
          <b>Example</b>: If an item drops in the level category of 39, then members 
          that are levels 30-45 only may roll but if item drops in level category 
          41, members at level 35-50 may roll.<br>
          The level of creature dropping the item will determine what level caps 
          should roll.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All Primary characters will 
          have first rights on loot and all Alts/Twinks will be on the bottom 
          of the loot chain. Meaning that you will not be able to roll for an 
          item if someone's primary is in the random roll. However, if there isn't 
          a primary in the roll you may random that item with other alts/twinks. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you win an Item and have 
          no need anymore for the item you are replacing, we then encourage you 
          to please hand that item down to whom you think mostly deserves it. 
          This is what we call chain looting, an by doing this a lot of members 
          can walk out with something rather then nothing. This rule is not mandatory, 
          it is only encouraged and by not following this rule you will not be 
          looked upon any less, its simply optional.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All raids will have set 
          timers, once that raid ends the loot will be given out accordingly. 
          After the loot has been given out, anyone that wishes may continue the 
          raid using the same loot policies until there is only 1 group left, 
          then it will be up to your group leader to decide how you loot.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You are not entitled for 
          any loot if it was dropped in a raid you did not attend unless the item 
          was not claimed and it was put in the Guild Treasury.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you camp/log before 
          the end of the raid you are not entitled to any loot that has dropped 
          after you have done so, unless the item was not claimed and it was put 
          in the Guild Treasury.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There will be two master 
          looters for each group, one for coins and one for items, the looter 
          for coins is to take split off. Both looters is recommended to bring 
          only what is needed an to dispense other items and coins to avoid confusion 
          and encumbrance, if it so happens that you were not able to get to a 
          bank please ask a guilded friend to hold your stuff until raid has ended. 
          At the end of the raid the person in the group in charge of loot must 
          contact the guild leader, co-guild leader or if there is another officer 
          in charge of loot with what was claimed. The master coin looter is to 
          split off to each member in there group accordingly. If the master looters 
          become encumbered then it will be up to the group leader to assign an 
          additional looters. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you already won an item 
          then you will not be eligible for the next lotto unless know one needs 
          that item. This rule is implemented so that all members have a better 
          chance on getting an item, of course not everyone can get something 
          but this rule will help. <br>
          <b>NOTE:</b> Remember to be careful on what items you roll for. Meaning 
          if you roll on an item that you need but kind of don't need and win 
          the roll, then you will not be eligible for a better item for your character 
          until all other members attending the raid has won items, therefore 
          starting the process all over again.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If a person has to leave 
          before the end of a raid and they have not looted an item yet, then 
          they may ask for one of the items already looted. This choice must be 
          approved by the majority of the raid members, and only applies if the 
          person has been present and helpful on a majority of the raid. This 
          also does not pertain to an Item already given out.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any Ultra Rare Items (Dragon-Planes) 
          that drop will be assign to an individual at the officers discretion. 
          Meaning all Officers will vote on who needs/deserves the specific item 
          the most. Who the rare drops will go to will be announce before each 
          raid. <br>
          <b>NOTE:</b> Any Ultra Rare Item that drops during a raid is considered 
          the guilds property. The specific item may not be sold, traded or given 
          away with out the guild leaders approval. <em>This one rule is very 
          important and can mean banishment if not obeyed.</em></font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The jewels (ruby crowns, 
          etc.) are split amongst the Clerics to cover Symbol costs. If an Enchanter 
          used Rune spells TO GOOD EFFECT (i.e. they saved lives) then should 
          be reimbursed. If the jewels do not cover reagent costs for the Clerics, 
          the remaining gems are divided amongst them until costs are covered. 
          Same thing applies for wizard costs on components on hate/sky raids.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any remaining high-end gems 
          are given to raid members who did not receive any loot, or received 
          substantially less loot than others.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If anyone that has been 
          attending many raids that feel that they are not getting there share 
          of loot by either being cheated or not winning any rolls then that person 
          is to contact an officer. If it is in fact that you have not been winning 
          any roles, we will then review the looting list and if indeed you have 
          been left out of many items then we will reward you the next drop that 
          you are specifically looking for on the raid being attended.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>One other thing . . .<br>
        </b> Have Fun! Everquest is a game, not an obligation. If you feel like 
        you are getting burned out, take a couple of days off. When you return, 
        you will be recharged and ready for the Fun again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Repercussions of Failure 
        to Abide by these Guidelines:<br>
        </b>These guidelines will be enforced. Again, the guild is more important 
        than any individual, and no one in the guild will be exempt from following 
        them. Repeated failures to abide by these guidelines will result in banishment 
        from the Munchkins of Mayhem. The decision to banish any member will fall
