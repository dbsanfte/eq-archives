          <br>
          <Br>
          Thank you Mr./Ms. Lockard for your detailed explanation as to how you suspended/banned a person who hadn't even 
          been online for three whole days,  who hasn't EVER in his ENTIRE EQ career of 3+ years 
          received a warning to his
          account, and is responsible for the actions of 70 other people, of whom 99% he has never even laid eyes upon,
          on a PVP server, for, **GASP**  P V P I N G!  Here is my suggestion Mr./Ms. Lockard, they are simple and easy,<br>
          <br>
          1.  Pull head from own ass.<br>
          2.  Remove head from Verant's ass. <Br>
          3.  Level a character, without twinking or help, from level 1 to level 60 on a PVP server.<br>
          4.  Learn what it takes to play on a Zek.  Remember your friends,  write down your enemies.<br>
          5.  Get into a guild. (I hear there is an opening at SotG's HQ for s person with their head up their own ass due to
          	  the fact that their resident "Headupmyownass'er" is in Indignation now.)<br>
          6.  Interact with OTHER people, not the mobs that lack AI and correct Pathing.<br>
          7.  Refer to #1<btr>
          8.  Unpucker your ass and NEVER, EVER, NEVER, EVER Ban a paying customer in a video game for the action/actions of
          another paying customer simply because they share a common chat channel in the GAME of Everquest.<br>
          I, and many others, failed to see your logic here.  Am I mistaken?  Did you suspend someone who was not even online for the actions of a
          few other people?  From the looks of your email,  I would say that is a yes.  Well sir.. I just simply cannot stand
          for this.  A reply must be made.  A retort must be filed.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Ahem.....<br>
          <br></p>

I regret to inform you that your payment for my account as been suspended for the numerous 
actions of disruption, harassment, nerfs, and abuse from your guides, GM's and Developers fir the game of 
          Everquest. 
As the Parent Company, you are responsible for the actions of your peon subsidiaries. As you have previously received
notification (you know, the 1400 /feedback's a day about how much your CS Dept SUCKS ASS) about your subsidiaries'

          the point.&nbsp;&nbsp; I, for one, got a grand chuckle out of this 
          one:</TD></TR>
          <TR>
          <TD>&nbsp;<p><i><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">
          Greetings Deloth. <br>
          <br>
          Firstly, I apologize for the previous generic reply informing you that 
          your e-mail has been forwarded. E-mails regarding account status are 
          forwarded here for our records; however, I still wish to address this 
          with you myself.<br>
          <br>
          Your account was not suspended for any instances of standard PvP 
          attacks. It was suspended for violations of our rules. Your guild 
          members have, several times, violated our Rules of Conduct and Play 
          Nice Policy. Some of these instances include PvP related issues, such 
          as zone camping, bind camping, and corpse camping. Although corpse 
          camping has been made legal, the past violations are not erased by 
          this as they were still a violation of the rules at that time. Others 
          include several instances of ninja-looting, kill-stealing, harassment, 
          foul language, and zone disruption. While it is true that on a PvP 
          server there is an option to resolve conflict by PvP combat, this does 
          not excuse actions which are in violation of any of our rules, nor 
          those which are not resolvable by PvP combat (ex: ninja-looting, 
          kill-stealing, etc.). As the guild leader, it is your responsibility 
          for the actions of your individual guild members. As it has been 
          stated several times to your officers and members to cease these 
          actions, and as the guild has already received an official guild 
          warning, this action was unfortunately necessary. The specifics are 
          stated in our Rules of Conduct/Play Nice Policy, as follows:<br>
          <br>
          You may not operate a guild that habitually violates these rules. <br>
          Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a 
          broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the 
          Rules of Conduct or Play Nice Policies may be disbanded. In addition, 
          monopolizing numerous spawn areas with the intent to exclude other 
          players will not be permitted. If investigated and verified by an 
          internal EQCSR, monopolizing will result in the disbanding of the 
          guild.<br>
          <br>
          The actions taken by your guild will also not be permitted for ANY 
          guild. If another guild is reported several times for these issues and 
          these issues are verified by our records, /reports, and other logs, 
          similar actions, including guild warnings, action taken against the 
          guild leader, or guild disbandment may result to the offending guild.<br>
          <br>
          Should you desire it, I will be happy to provide you with dates and 
          specifics of some examples of these violations, as well as the members 
          involved if that information is available. Any information I can 
          provide to you to assist us in having these actions discontinued would 
          be most appreciated. However, if this type of behavior is not 
          discontinued by your guild, it may result in the disbanding of your 
          guild, suspension or banning of the officers/members involved in this 
          action, as well as the suspension or banning of your account. I would 
          sincerely regret having to take any further action, so any actions you 
          wish to take which result in improvement is greatly desired.<br>
          <br>
          Again, I am sorry that it was necessary to suspend your account. I do 
          hope that we can work together to resolve this situation in a more 
          positive fashion.<br>
          <br>
          Thank you for your patience. If you have further questions or 
          concerns, please feel free to reply. <br>
          <br>
          <br>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Deloth,</p>
          <p>Your guild owns this server.&nbsp; You all kill every uber mob upon 
          pop and that is just unacceptable.&nbsp; We will be instituting the 
          Blue Server Ruleset regarding spawns.&nbsp; You must share.&nbsp; It 
          just isn't fair that you enter a zone and everyone evacs.&nbsp; It is 
          just wrong that if someone is wanting to kill a mob, that you PVP them 
          on a PVP server and take it.&nbsp; It is so unfair that you use weaker 
          guilds to clear our shit zones meant to be time sinks al Fear and then 
          you come in,&nbsp; Cast spells and hit them with swords on a pvp 
          server and take the spawn from them&nbsp;&nbsp; This just isn't right 
          and must be stopped.&nbsp; BTW.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a large penis.

          <TD>In a surprising development tonight... A few members of Pandemonium showed the TRUE Power that is Pandemonium.
          In ninja-esque fashion, the trap was set.   Sanaleb, acting as the lowly wounded and stuck Paladin, "/petition'd" 
          for GM assistance.   Upon arriving in Wakening Land,  the poor, unsuspecting GM Gendal arrives to help the poor Holy 
          Knight in his time of need.  The Prey has entered the trap.. the trap is sprung and the most evil and cruel of PDM's 
          arsenal of pets is unleashed upon the GM!  Woushit!  Woushit is relentless in its attacks upon the GM and in a few 
          short seconds, it is all over.

        <TR>
          <TD>It is with a sad and heavy heart that I bring this news to you.  Today marks a sad day in PDM Website update
          history.  Atomo, a.k.a Krowe, a.k.a Synipus, a.k.a The Uni-Bomber, a.k.a. Sweetcheeks has left the building.  What
          happened to him you say?  Was he injured.. did he get mugged and mortally wounded while withdrawling money from 
          the ATM at Bobby's House of Slippery SheMales?  Saddly no.. none of those rumors are true (I lost the guild pool 
          on the last one being dead on)  Atomo, just like a PDM Main Tank that will remain <a href="./24APR02/kamzan.htm">
          nameless</a>, has found WOMEN!  Those evil, evil creatures.  The Bane of every EQ-playing males existance.  They
          have not been jailed or locked up by the law, they have not been hospitalized, THEY HAVE BEEN PUSSY WHIPPED.  They
          have tasted the sweet nectar, and boy was it good!  Can't say I blame you boys..  Long stroke em a few times for me.
          You will be missed Atomo..  Come back and see us!
          </TD></TR>
		<TR>
		  <TD>Now on to the update...<br>
          <br>
		  PDM has been busy lately.  Not exactly busy in the true meaning of the word.  In all honesty, we haven't been 
		  really doing jack aside from the immediate killing on pop of any mob named Tormax, Statue, Yelinak, Dain, Narandi, etc.
		  All of these encounters are mighty trivial to us now, almost borderline boring.  I mean really, how many times can
		  you kick the same thing's ass <a href="./14JAN02/DOdead10.jpg">over</a> and <a href="./14JAN02/DOdead12.jpg">over</a>
		  and <a href="./14JAN02/DOdead16.jpg">over</a> again?  So we got to thinking. There is really only one mob left
		  standing on Tallon Zek that resides in Vellious.  The Avatar of War.  After a miserable first attempt, we decided
		  to use strategy this go around.</TD></TR>

		  <TD>While we are on the subject of the Avatar of War, I would like to take this time to discuss my dislikes about our
		  shitpile, er, wonderful game of EQ like most Guild Website updaters do.  The mother fooking Complete Heal Bug.  Which
		  VI coder had his head up is own ass that day?  It is a SERIOUS bug.  It can make or break a raid. (Just like our last 
		  AOW fight.)  I mean seriously.  I wonder how fucking long this bug as been in existance.  How long did we chalk MT's dying
		  up to lag and our own systems not updating HPS fast enough.  Someone really screwed the pooch when they add the ability 
		  for us to SEE ourselves getting healed.  I just love getting healed for 6K hps only to die 2 hits later.

		  and the rest of the people in that guild they are in :P) as "<i>The Great Time Sink</i>!"  That's right, Ssssssraharhashhaseazaa
		  Temple.  When I read up on obtaining the everso elusive Creator Key, I heard all the horror stories.  Can't be that bad
		  can it?  I mean really.. 200 Commander Kills and no key?  WTF.. that can't be right.  Well.. on about day 8 of our camp
		  of this key.. and our 4th Commander (yes.. I said 4, as in o/~ Fore, they are dumbass Encounter Designers, They are dumbass
		  encounter designers!o/~).  I could not even imagine sitting through 200 Commander spawns. That would be like sitting through
		  a Veneration Kael raid, Death by Boredom. (I assume it is boredom that kills them all the time in Kael, Surely.. it can't
		  be the Vindicator (/snicker)</TD></TR>

		  <TR>
		  <TD>I know I know.. he ain't dead.. but I will have to apologize, becuase I spent 8 fucking days camping a key and my worthless
		  guild waits till I have to work to kill the damn thing!  Thanks Guild :P  To top it off.. I logged in as they were deciding
		  the loot.  So I never even got to see the corpse!   Grats Tiberan on the <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/pictures/shieldofthecreator.jpg>
		  Sheild of the Creator</a> and Macorsha on the <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics17/bladeofangels.gif>Blade of Angels</a>.
		  Yes.. ANOTHER friggin SK/PAL Weapon. All in all.. I would say our first Creator loot was right on par with the rest
		  of Luclin loot..  SHIIIIIIITY.</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD><BR>
		  <BR>
		  Other Raids of Note:  NTOV too many times, Tormax too many times, Yelinak too many times, coupla Statues, A Cazic or two,
		  some Ring Wars,  a couple of Dragons named 'cars, some Rhag's and even a Tunare Kill.  Trakanon was also killed by a pick-up
		  group of 8 in under 10 seconds, yet.. Manaburn is working as intended on PVP Servers.  NERF WIZARDS.  (Or at least fix the timer
		  so Olman will stay logged in for more than the time it takes him to press the damn /cast Manaburn; /sit; /camp desktop macro)

		On another note, Grats to the boys and girls of <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com">Triton</a> over on Povar for killing

		<TD>Well, That concludes my first update as your favorite PDM Site Updater.  I know this update didn't have Atomo's 
		flair, or his kinderguarden-level stick figure drawings (OK.. maybe just one!  Atomo's Last Claim to Fame!  
		<a href="./24APR02/creatorguide.jpg">HOW TO KILL THE CREATOR</a>!).. But hey, it is 5 a.m. and no one forced you to click on the link or favorties tab to get ya here.  In Short,  if
		you don't like it.  Fuck ya!  As always.. We will leave ya with a few quotes of the week!  Enjoy.

        <TR>
          <TD>It's that time of month again! The bloating. The bitching. The headaches. The copious blood loss. That's right, it's "balancing"
		  season at Verant HQ, as nerf bombs are being dropped all over Norrathghanistan. Apparently The Vision, written
		  in the later part of the last decade by a secret organization of traveling circus monks, high-ranking carpet salesmen, 
		  former 1960s superhero Birdman, and <a href=./23APR02/Haha.jpg>this guy</a>, did not foresee a time in EverQuest where high end PvE was
		  actually more fun than receiving a Tabasco enema. Now Verant has gone apeshit, busting out the nerf batons to beat and kick our ethnic
		  minority of a game as it lays crippled and bleeding on the side of the L.A freeway. Except for one VERY SPECIAL server that I'll
		  mention later. For now, let's get started on just what's happened since our last update. </TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>First on the nerf list was the Queen Bitch herself. Doubled in size and packing the latest in nerfonomic
		  technology, the new Tunare was about as hard as beating Christopher Reeves in a game of soccer, only much less fun
		  and rewarding.</TD></TR>	
		  <TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="./23APR02/Tunarelooted.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TD align=middle><SMALL>Yes, it's a poor picture, but on the other hand, stfu!</SMALL></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>She dropped on the same day she was nerfed, so much for that "revamp." Loot was decent, with daggers
		  for Tzuten and Razzorin, an earring for Briseis, and a branch for
		  Flertz.</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <tr>
		  <TD>Now, as we all have heard on practically every EQ forum and site in existence, North ToV, the loot-spewing gold mine of
		  EverQuest, was ninja nerfed a few patches back at the same time as Eye of Zomm pulling was gimped. Verant snuck in in the middle
		  of the night and without warning, dragon HP were buffed, pathing and aggro was changed, and one Mr. Vulak'Aerr was replaced by buggy mobs, which
		  when first noticed, made for some very fun <a href=./23APR02/mindgames.jpg>mindgames</a> in guildchat.The Temple of Veeshan 2.0 was then set and ready to go, now possessing the same fun factor as waking up one morning to find a box full of clowns on your doorstep.
		  Only the clowns have all died during shipping because someone forgot to poke in some air holes, and so now you're stuck with nothing
		  but a smelly box and potential clown zombies.</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>Anyways we ganked our way through Ntov once more, and lo and behold, who do you think awaited us at the end of our raid?!</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="./23APR02/Vulak.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>Not that guy! But what the hell did you expect, a Vyemm killshot? Another picture of the twin dragons
		  laying dead next to each other? Whereas once Vulak was the reward for clearing an assload of dragons, our only reward
		  this time was a boring ass buggy Ring of Fire where one screwup means you get to try again in a week. Needless to say, that's one zone
		  that's falling down a few places on the to-do list, and I'd certainly like to donkey punch the grandma of whatever Verant copyboy
		  put this idea in place.  </TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>The nerf parade continued as we ganked THO 2.0 a couple more times and also went to Akheva and Ssra temple to
		  pay these guys a visit:</TD></TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="./23APR02/Archlichded.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="./23APR02/IVfight.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>I won't even mention the IV loot. The Arch Lich dropped yet another godamn <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics18/sword_lost_crusades.gif>paladin suicide weapon</a> for Sanaleb.
		  I guess Verant decides the 20,000 fucking pal/sk only weapons from Ntov/Tunare/Rhags wasn't enough.  He also dropped a <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9007> shield</a> for Arimedes. We also ganked the Exiled and Glyphed, but they're just a bunch of fucking snakes too, so I won't bother
		  with another boring screenshot. Exiled ended up dropping <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8752>Elphorn's Cleaver</a> for uh...Elphor, and a <a href=http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10349>Jade Skull Ring</a> for Henrik.
		  As for the Glyphed, I refuse to ever type the words "SK/PAL weapon" on an update again.</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>Now with all that covered, allow me to go on a small rant. Verant has taken the time to nerf Tunare, Ntov, the Eye of Zomm,
		  AA points, the THO, hell, even the Fungal Grove shrooms were nerfed for the second time around and given lure DDs that also happen to bug your P.O.V.
		  Why Verant does this is as clear as night and day. They're trying to extend the life of this game by slowing down
		  the progression of players. But that's not the real issue. Even though VI has completely lost sight during this nerf rampage of the fact that this is a game
		  and games are intended to be fun and not chores, that's not what pisses me off. It's 
          <a href=http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/>this</a>.

		  <TD>Pardon me, but just what the fuck is the idea behind Legends? We've all heard the "We should be getting this type of service
		  for what we pay now" argument, but there's something else that bugs me, and it's the lack of foresight by VI. Specifically, I'm
		  referring to the fact you can transfer back and forth from Legends to whatever server you played before. In other words:</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="./23APR02/Legendsmonk.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD> You can pay 40 bucks a month to play EQ and rake in phat gear, but you can't put a price on guild loyalty. Considering A.
		  These are the same people who are smart enough to be paying obscene amounts of money to play a game past its peak and B. They already burned
		  their bridges with their former guilds once, it's going to be a nightmare forming anything resembling a tight knit guild. It's going to be a great
		  feeling to learn your main tank decided to go back home after getting decked out on Stormhammer.</TD></TR>
		<TR>
		<TD align=middle><IMG src="./23APR02/Curry.jpg"></TD></TR>
		<TD align=middle><SMALL>Among the many additional benefits available to Legends players is the ability to create
		your own customized profile to show off to the rest of the EQ community.</SMALL></TD></TR>
		<TD>Well, what more can one say about Legends other than that it's the worst public relations disaster since Chef Boyardee's Hitler N' Friendz Shaped Spaghetti-o's. Anyways, enough ranting, and on to
		quotes of the week, with special thanks to Veneration's Keldorn and Erondiel for a very special reminder of what it means to play on a pvp server! Best
		wishes on finding a nice hooker, Erondiel, and remember Keldorn, when you're trash talking someone, make sure you still pay enough attention to the other person
		currently trying to kill you, or you may just die!</TD></TR>

          <TD>Yes, it was finally decided this Sunday that the madness of the goddess responsible for creating a race with names like Leafbanegokustarfighter
		  and Singingnaturecharmanderz must come to an end. To a brutally swift and decisive end, for it is a well known fact that the time-consuming task of clearing PoG has the same fun factor as
		  filing M.C. Hammer's taxes, mowing your lawn with safety scissors, and watching the promising but ultimately disappointing<i> Bridges of Madison County II:Blood Vengeance</i>.
		  In order to avoid clearing PoG, it was necessary to once again hire the services of the resident cutthroat mercenaries known as Gnome-Tek, and they succeeded,
		  proving once again that gnomes and firearms are the most lethal combination on the planet. The history-changing event had a bigger impact around the world than we expected, though, and it is with this news that I am proud to present
		  to you the epic foreign film based on this massive battle, <b><i>Magic Goddess Tunare: One Million Strength Fighter!</i></b>,the next level of moviemaking that is taking Europe and Asia by storm! Over three hours in the making, and destined to one day claim a spot in Blockbuster's bargain bin right next to <i> Cliffhanger</i>, <i>MGT:OMSF</i>
		  is already gathering rave reviews from critics all over the land! </TD></TR>
