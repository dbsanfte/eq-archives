<font class="white_16">EgrasUI 6.0 (Everquest User Interface)</font>

<p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">The Everquest User Interface. Since Sony released the ability to modify the UI in game, I scanned the net for the best UI to make my gameplay work well. I would find pieces here and there, but enver find one that solved all my issues. I decided to learn XML and develop my own. This is the result of that learning and creating process that began 6 version ago. Your welcome to download and use it at your leisure. Please dont modify the code. Its not as simple as it looks and you can make things worse.</font></p>

<font class="white_16">Egras GFx (Graphics)</font>

<p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">I have dabbled in graphics for many years. I made a signature for a web forum, then the avatar to match, and eventually made one for my Magelo. This stirred up alot of requests for help and/or graphics for other players. I did this at a cost of 50K in-game platinum for a short while. It got to overwhelming and timely to do after a short while. I added the how-to section to the website so you can make your own step-by-step. You will find the directions and even find some basic templates for your cut and paste. Get creative.</font></p>

<font class="white_16">Egras SLx (StoryLine)</font>

<p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">The newest item I have begun devlopment on is the storyline window in Everquest. The code is not much different than XML and HTML. Why shouldnt we use this area to hold mob, loot and even strat information on as we move through the game. Then there is no scanning the net during a raid or having to look up mob/loot information. It will be all in there and ready for the browsing. The files, when posted, will be password locked to only PDM if they are strat or guild related files. The mob information and loots is for public use.</font></p>

<font class="white_16">Magelo (StoryLine)</font>

<p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">A simple place to get help on Magelo issues. I dont program the site, but I can help ya add music and your background. Not gonna find too much here other than that.</font></p>
