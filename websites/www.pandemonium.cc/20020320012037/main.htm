          <TR>
          <TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD>It's that time of month again! The bloating. The bitching. The headaches. The copious blood loss. That's right, it's "balancing"
		  season at Verant HQ, as nerf bombs are being dropped all over Norrathghanistan. Apparently The Vision, written
		  in the later part of the last decade by a secret organization of traveling circus monks, high-ranking carpet salesmen, 
		  former 1960s superhero Birdman, and <a href=http://krowepdm.homestead.com/files/Haha.jpg>this guy</a>, did not foresee a time in EverQuest where high end PvE was actually more fun than receiving
		  a Tabasco enema. Now Verant has gone apeshit, busting out the nerf batons to beat and kick our ethnic minority of a game as it lays
		  crippled and bleeding on the side of the L.A freeway. Except for one VERY SPECIAL server that I'll mention later. For now, let's get started on
		  just what's happened since our last update. </TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>First on the nerf list was the Queen Bitch herself. Doubled in size and packing the latest in nerfonomic
		  technology, the new Tunare was about as hard as beating Christopher Reeves in a game of soccer, only much less fun
		  and rewarding.</TD></TR>	
		  <TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="http://krowepdm.homestead.com/files/Tunarelooted.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TD align=middle><SMALL>Yes, it's a poor picture, but on the other hand, stfu!</SMALL></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>She dropped on the same day she was nerfed, so much for that "revamp." Loot was decent, with daggers
		  for Tzuten and Razzorin, an earring for Briseis, and a branch for
		  Flertz.</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <tr>
		  <TD>Now, as we all have heard on practically every EQ forum and site in existence, North ToV, the loot-spewing gold mine of
		  EverQuest, was ninja nerfed a few patches back at the same time as Eye of Zomm pulling was gimped. Verant snuck in in the middle
		  of the night and without warning, dragon HP were buffed, pathing and aggro was changed, and one Mr. Vulak'Aerr was replaced by buggy mobs, which
		  when first noticed, made for some very fun <a href=http://krowepdm.homestead.com/files/mindgames.jpg>mindgames</a> in guildchat.The Temple of Veeshan 2.0 was then set and ready to go, now possessing the same fun factor as waking up one morning to find a box full of clowns on your doorstep.
		  Only the clowns have all died during shipping because someone forgot to poke in some air holes, and so now you're stuck with nothing
		  but a smelly box and potential clown zombies.</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>Anyways we ganked our way through Ntov once more, and lo and behold, who do you think awaited us at the end of our raid?!</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="http://krowepdm.homestead.com/files/Vulak.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>Not that guy! But what the hell did you expect, a Vyemm killshot? Another picture of the twin dragons
		  laying dead next to each other? Whereas once Vulak was the reward for clearing an assload of dragons, our only reward
		  this time was a boring ass buggy Ring of Fire where one screwup means you get to try again in a week. Needless to say, that's one zone
		  that's falling down a few places on the to-do list, and I'd certainly like to donkey punch the grandma of whatever Verant copyboy
		  put this idea in place.  </TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>The nerf parade continued as we ganked THO 2.0 a couple more times and also went to Akheva and Ssra temple to
		  pay these guys a visit:</TD></TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="http://krowepdm.homestead.com/files/Archlichded.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="http://krowepdm.homestead.com/files/IVfight.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>I won't even mention the IV loot. The Arch Lich dropped yet another godamn <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics18/sword_lost_crusades.gif>paladin suicide weapon</a> for Sanaleb.
		  I guess Verant decides the 20,000 fucking pal/sk only weapons from Ntov/Tunare/Rhags wasn't enough.  He also dropped a <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9007> shield</a> for Arimedes. We also ganked the Exiled and Glyphed, but they're just a bunch of fucking snakes too, so I won't bother
		  with another boring screenshot. Exiled ended up dropping <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8752>Elphorn's Cleaver</a> for uh...Elphor, and a <a href=http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10349>Jade Skull Ring</a> for Henrik.
		  As for the Glyphed, I refuse to ever type the words "SK/PAL weapon" on an update again.</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD>Now with all that covered, allow me to go on a small rant. Verant has taken the time to nerf Tunare, Ntov, the Eye of Zomm,
		  AA points, the THO, hell, even the Fungal Grove shrooms were nerfed for the second time around and given lure DDs that also happen to bug your P.O.V.
		  Why Verant does this is as clear as night and day. They're trying to extend the life of this game by slowing down
		  the progression of players. But that's not the real issue. Even though VI has completely lost sight during this nerf rampage of the fact that this is a game
		  and games are intended to be fun and not chores, that's not what pisses me off. It's <a href=http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/>this</a>.

		  <TD>Hail, Worst Marketing Idea Ever! Welcome to Everquest Legends, where for the low price of nearly half a thousand dollars a year, you too

		  <TD>-Personalized Character and Guild pages on the official EQ website! </TD></TR>

		  <TD>-Up to 60 miles per gallon!</TD></TR>

		  <TD>-Powerful and moving performances by Academy Award-winning actors Billy Bob Thornton and Sidney Poitier!</TD></TR>
		  <TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
		  <TD>Those of you currently subscriped to the $10 a month package can expect to get:</TD></TR>
		  <TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
		  <TD>-GM Events in the West Commonlands where a manic-depressive guide playing a werewolf runs around the zone for an hour, kills a level
		  15 gnome rogue, then throws a +8 DEX necklace at the first roleplayer to say "thou are a fiend!" before logging
		  and crying himself to sleep with a bottle of Jack Daniels still clutched in his hand.</TD></TR>
		  <TD>-All petitions answered directly by Bonzi Buddy™</TD></TR>
		  <TD>-the clap</TD></TR>
		  <TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
		  <TD>Pardon me, but just what the fuck is the idea behind Legends? We've all heard the "We should be getting this type of service
		  for what we pay now" argument, but there's something else that bugs me, and it's the lack of foresight by VI. Specifically, I'm
		  referring to the fact you can transfer back and forth from Legends to whatever server you played before. In other words:</TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD align=middle><IMG src="http://krowepdm.homestead.com/files/Legendsmonk.jpg"></TD></TR>
		  <TR>
		  <TD> You can pay 40 bucks a month to play EQ and rake in phat gear, but you can't put a price on guild loyalty. Considering A.
		  These are the same people who are smart enough to be paying obscene amounts of money to play a game past its peak and B. They already burned
		  their bridges with their former guilds once, it's going to be a nightmare forming anything resembling a tight knit guild. It's going to be a great
		  feeling to learn your main tank decided to go back home after getting decked out on Stormhammer.</TD></TR>
		<TR>
		<TD align=middle><IMG src="http://krowepdm.homestead.com/files/Curry.jpg"></TD></TR>
		<TD align=middle><SMALL>Among the many additional benefits available to Legends players is the ability to create
		your own customized profile to show off to the rest of the EQ community.</SMALL></TD></TR>
		<TD>Well, what more can one say about Legends other than that it's the worst public relations disaster since Chef Boyardee's Hitler N' Friendz Shaped Spaghetti-o's. Anyways, enough ranting, and on to
		quotes of the week, with special thanks to Veneration's Keldorn and Erondiel for a very special reminder of what it means to play on a pvp server! Best
		wishes on finding a nice hooker, Erondiel, and remember Keldorn, when you're trash talking someone, make sure you still pay enough attention to the other person
		currently trying to kill you, or you may just die!</TD></TR>

          <TD>Yes, it was finally decided this Sunday that the madness of the goddess responsible for creating a race with names like Leafbanegokustarfighter
		  and Singingnaturecharmanderz must come to an end. To a brutally swift and decisive end, for it is a well known fact that the time-consuming task of clearing PoG has the same fun factor as
		  filing M.C. Hammer's taxes, mowing your lawn with safety scissors, and watching the promising but ultimately disappointing<i> Bridges of Madison County II:Blood Vengeance</i>.
		  In order to avoid clearing PoG, it was necessary to once again hire the services of the resident cutthroat mercenaries known as Gnome-Tek, and they succeeded,
		  proving once again that gnomes and firearms are the most lethal combination on the planet. The history-changing event had a bigger impact around the world than we expected, though, and it is with this news that I am proud to present
		  to you the epic foreign film based on this massive battle, <b><i>Magic Goddess Tunare: One Million Strength Fighter!</i></b>,the next level of moviemaking that is taking Europe and Asia by storm! Over three hours in the making, and destined to one day claim a spot in Blockbuster's bargain bin right next to <i> Cliffhanger</i>, <i>MGT:OMSF</i>

          <TD>It's been little over a month since Verant has graced us with 
            yet another expansion, and Christmas/Hanukah/Kwanzaa break through a 
            wrench into things, so what better time to update? It wasn't until 
            last week that I could actually buy Luclin for myself, but we'll 
            take a look anyway, cuz it sure beats Tormax kill #541! This latest 
            release strays off the path of the previous two expansions and takes 
            place on a whole freakin' moon instead of a long lost continent. Now 
            you're probably thinking, "The moon? That's crazy, there must be 
            some rollercoaster edge-of-your-seat kind of thriller plot that led 
            up to these lunar shenanigans!" Well calm down there, little Ebert, 
            because sure enough, Verant has devised what has to be the most 
            fascinating space storyline since Arthur C. Clarke's <I>2001</I>. 
            Don't take my word for it, see for yourself in the SoL manual the 
            story of why through a long series of earth-shaking events, a 
            powerful Combine empire reeling from an assassination was sent to, 
            of all places, the moon! </TD></TR>

        <TR>
          <TD>Of course, with every expansion the graphics have been upped, 
            and in this case it's no different. Despite having a relatively new 
            computer with 1Ghz and 128mb of RAM, more than enough to play 
            Velious and Kunark smoothly, I was greeted with a pop-up warning me 
            about my system specs upon trying to log in: </TD></TR>

          <TD>As disheartening as this was, and after a few quick calls to 
            Grandma, I decided to turn on a few models anyway and they ran fine, 
            although those models just happened to be "gnome male" and "gnome 
            female" and we have an excess of neither in the guild. While the 
            gnomish females followed suit with the majority of new models we've 
            seen, in that they're horribly disfigured and sometimes cause those 
            who see them to shed tears of blood, the new gnome males struck me 
            as something different. Specifically, they struck me as EXTREME 
            PERVERTS. Gone are the little gnomes of yesterday, with their 
            mischievous little expressions and tiny little frames. Now we're 
            left with 56 year old balding Danny DeVito clones that have somehow 
            left the middle-school playgrounds they were prowling to take up 
            careers in dragonslaying. </TD></TR>

          <TD>Another thing that caught my attention was what Verant 
            developers consider the female body. It doesn't really say alot 
            about how often they meet girls when this latest virtual model is 
            some sort of bizarre bodybuilder/pornostar hybrid that doesn't 
            resemble any woman ever born on this earth, outside some Japanese 
            hentai cartoon. See for yourself the massive torsos on these strange

        <TR>
          <TD>Later one day, a startling revelation was made in guildchat. We 
            didn't have any <A 
            href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/outriderstamingwhip.jpg>OUTRIDER'S 
            TAMING WHIPS</A>. Panic soon arose in the guild, and chaos broke 
            out, resulting in several political coups that saw numerous 
            Columbian druglords and at one point level 5 gnome enchanter 
            Professorpickle take leadership of the guild. It would have been the 
            end of us had we not decided right there and then to give Yelinak a 
            long overdue visit. While we're a pretty heavy raiding guild, we've 
            never really raided Skyshrine for any other reason than getting a 
            Cobalt Scar key. Just look at the zone. The home of the dragons and 
            80% of the population is mudmen and Jell-o cubes. Let's not forget 
            gargoyles which were probably put in because they kinda look 
            lizards, if lizards mated with winged pigs. Either way, the zone was 
            steamrolled over, and to make a long story short, Ol' Jellydick took 
            a dirtnap. Don't ask me why they call him Jellydick, I honestly have 
            no idea. </TD></TR>

          <TD>Thanks to Verant's tendency to have more patches than a railroad 
            hobo's wardrobe, we actually managed to gank Yelinak before the 
            server crashed, then gank him again when it came back up. 3 Yelinaks 
            in seven days resulted in 3 <A

            Whips</A>, and peace was restored, thanks to this powerful whip 
            worthy of the king of dragons. Grats to Kuin on one of these 
            beauties, the other two were destroyed in a tearful parting

          <TD>And while I've been on vacation until last week, the guild also 
            managed to make Ntov a ghost town and keep it that way. More than 
            once Vulak stood alone ready to be pummeled when an emergency patch 
            was announced. Nonetheless the guild managed to drop him four more 
            times, resulting in Camii's Bracers for Cydd, Talsar, and Sanaleb, 
            Sirran's Boots for Tzeenth, Tolan's Longswords for Clairdelune and 
            Keamina, Sal'Varae's Robe for Mythd, Crystal Rings for Chemosh and

          <TD>I've said it before and I've said it again, the 10th ring war is 
            the most fun you'll have in a PvE event. The whole zone goes into a 
            frenzy wondering what happened to all the kodiaks and giants, and 
            the newbies come out to <A 
            href="./14JAN02/Beggar.jpg">beg</A> 
            for items they believe to be worth billions and billions of plat. We 
            were even graced by the presence of Darkoan, who once gained our 
            Prison Bitch of the Week award for ninja looting a Ragefire heart. 
            All those golem wands on our tanks and trying to train Narandi away 
            was for naught, what a shame ;( Maybe he'll learn to train Narandi 
            in the right direction next time. Special thanks to Xantille, who 
            valiantly fought in the war..sorta.</TD></TR>
