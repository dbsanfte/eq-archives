<p> Pandemonium Vanquished!<br>
Discordia is winning the pvp game!<br>
The gap is closing!</p>
<p>We all went to WoW, have fun TZ! </p>
<p>Sorry to burst your bubble, this aint <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org">Mith Mar</a> yet folks. </p>
<p>Despite the rumors from our tlcing friends in Discordia, Pandemonium still remains in the lofty position atop the food chain on Tallon Zek. Discordia members sit in Tranquility and speak until they are blue in the face about how they are owning the server in pvp because they tlc out and wasted our time. </p>

<p>Hey buddy, you said it! They are right; it&rsquo;s a waste of time to look for good pvp. </p>
<p><img src="11MAY04/pofpvp.JPG" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p>Zoning into 70 people with 30 and watching them zone is a shitty feeling. Do you people have any idea how long it takes me to buff up, stop laughing about your guild and horse over to you only to watch you TLC out and leave your dead behind to be CC&rsquo;d? Hell, you might even win a fight, but instead, your officers tell you that you have no chance by calling TLC.</p>

<p>Thanks for doing your part in helping our guild&rsquo;s morale go down the drain by sucking down Shaod&rsquo;s mana rebuffing my twink every night for pvp since I can&rsquo;t cast SoE yet. </p>

<p>And just in case you thought I was kidding~</p>

<p>In other news, Discordia went to PoEb and finally owned some content! A year later&hellip; Umm, ok&hellip; </p>
<p>Wait, wait, in more news, Indignation did Xegony! A year later... Umm, ok...!</p>
<p align="left">Hey, at this rate, Quarm will be down for Discordia in time for Duke Nukem Forever! </p>

<p>Some of you may have heard we started doing some back flagging with a new batch of apps. Some of our more valued members as of late have been playing WoW beta, so we decided to do a bit of recruiting</p>
<p>Guess I should be a little more real on that one. Replace the 'valued member' with 'peices of shit like Kylt' and 'WoW' for 'New LifeSuck 2.0' and you get the idea.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">I LOVE YOU SHIELD!</p>
<p>With this in mind, and with Linse's obvious love for our new app process...</p>
<p><img src="11MAY04/linsequote.JPG" width="527" height="115"></p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce our 1st new member to PDM. Let me introduce 'Wonderbread Girl`Cleric'. I'll be renting this space for the next 2 weeks, so if you see me on my ranger in game, you owe me 500pp for the time you just spent whacking it.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="11MAY04/wow.gif" width="200" height="147"> </p>
<p>In other news, we got a <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=8810b123fdd67ad0a9bfc70cd47f0b31&threadid=18337" target="_blank">good laugh</a> at least out of the Discordia Information Minister: </p>
<p>Almost exclusive access to the elemental planes? Shared with one other guild? What do you tell your applicants when Pandemonium comes for you? OMG! Where did those come from? I swear that guild was never here before? Or are we a ring event you haven&rsquo;t beaten yet? </p>
<p>Ulaxmi was nice enough to rewrite the cleric application for you in a more truthful manner:</p>
<p>Discordia looking for Clerics(ebay characters encouraged) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Looking for elemental flagged or close (Plane of Justice trials are good enough) clerics interested in a guild with almost exclusive access to eplanes on Tallon Zek. Well, we share it with one other guild (our bluebie rotation partner) and a guild that continually destroys us and disrupts our raids, then kills our mobs for twink loot. We almost never get a raid done. No lineups except for corpse summoning and DA looting, and a DKP system where palidins get all the plate over warriors and clerics. We're making the push for Time over this summer and the next two years. So, if you are interested in being a part of the challenging encounters that get you there (Ring of Pandemonium, we keep losing that one) check out www.discordiathegimps.org for more information </p>
  <p> Bonnes (Discordia! it ain't dead..yet) </p>

<p> Fear Intelligence though </p>
<p>Ok, so now your thinking &ldquo;They posted this shit update so they could get away from actually admitting they can&rsquo;t get into Uqua!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Wrong bitches&hellip; </p>
<p>WE GOT ONE GROUP IN! </p>
<p align="center"><img src="11MAY04/uqua.JPG" width="400" height="421"></p>
<p>Ok ok, cool loot from there next time, Kod`Taz and related bullshit zones and dead things in the mean time~ </p>

<p>Reminds me of my ex-wife for some reason. Either it's the big mouth or the painful look in the mirror. </p>
<p><img src="11MAY04/mindrider.JPG" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p>We got some cool shit like this:</p>

<p align="center">Gratz Noyiamo </p>
<p>And 924 Darkglint blades, but who gives a shit. </p>
<p>Enough of my bullshit here. It just wouldn't be an update without those quotes you all love so much.</p>
