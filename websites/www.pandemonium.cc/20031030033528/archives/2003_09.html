<span class="title">An update</span>

<p>Update by Vump<br />

<p>Often in web-site guild wars, the content viewed is a matter of spun perspective.  To properly understand the perspective of a writer, it's important to understand the mentality of the writer himself.  Thus we present...</p>

<p>Greetings from Singapore, be home in a week, congrats on Time.</p>

<p>Catching up on the various message boards and I couldn't help but notice that Rulan is as gimpy as he ever was, so I uncovered some 4 year old screenshots that still make me lol.</p>

<p><u>Quick Background</u><br />
Back in late 1999/early 2000, the first large numbers of people were hitting 50, the server was Light vs Dark, and the Darks owned Guk and Sol B.  Once in a while, a Lightie group or two would punt some newbie Darks (level 40ish) out of a spot in Guk, and the high level Darks (level 50, I R uber) would come and kick them out.</p>

<p><u>The Story</u><br />
Enough of the background, here's the story.  We get a message that Rulan and some of his guild (I think the guild name was AOTL, predating Chosen Blood and the 21 guild names he's used since then) were in Lower Guk someplace.</p>

<p>I think they were on the Live Side.  We go down, and find them and gank them.  Some of the bind rush (surprise) and they all die.  Except Rulan.  He gated, but his gate was only to the zone line.  He "forgot" he was bound right there, lolz.  As we are unloading on him, he nukes himself...which, back then, caused you XP loss, heh.  So, we punted his group, got Rulan to XP himself and generally had a good laugh at his expense.</p>

<p>Those events lead to the following exchange between him and me (Marc).  Ignore my l33t bandaging, tough to find good healers even back then~  Also, ignore guild comments from people like Rummol, Deloth and Quantumphish, not sure who they are~</p>

<p><img src="http://kort99.tripod.com/rulan_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>He's getting testy, hence the USE OF CAPS.  Then, he brags how he didn't die in PvP, but gated (l33t skillz there) and then admits how he forgot that he was bound right at the zone in.</p>

<p><img src="http://kort99.tripod.com/Rulan_2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>Then I, being the helpful guy I am, remind him that he nuked himself (causing XP loss):</p>

<p><img src="http://kort99.tripod.com/Rulan_3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p><i>This was the strangest comment, and probably is still his mentality. He is PISSED at me/us for PvPing since it ruins his PvE experience.  We ruined his chance to get loot in lower guk for him and his buddies.</i></p>

<p><img src="http://kort99.tripod.com/Rulan_4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, he's clearly lost his mind.  He wants to fuck me, my friends and my guild (circle noir).  Not really an appetizing thought.</p>

<p><img src="http://kort99.tripod.com/Rulan_5.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>His frustration leads to the low point of my Everquest career and caused me to quit just a couple of months later...he put me on ignore.  To be candid, my life hasn't been the same since.</p>

<p><img src="http://kort99.tripod.com/Rulan_6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
