   <font class="white_16">EgrasUI ( User Interface ) Version 6.0</font>

<p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">The EgrasUI has been around since Everquest began allowing UI modifications. I only recently released it for others use. I was apprehensive about letting it go public due to the fact so many mods are out there and so many just steal from one to the other to claim it as their own. This webpage will show every single window I have done and make it difficult for them to do that. Each one has something hidden in the xml, graphic or UI that is hard as heck to find and edit to steal my work. Below are some screenshots of what I see every day when I play EverQuest. For a look at each window and what I have done to it go to the EgrasUI Windows area on the page. You are welcome to edit the clicky slots on the windows, but do NOT forge to make a backup copy as xml code is difficult to learn and easy to damage.EgrasUI is built and designed for single account use. You dont need special versions for casters and melee classes. They load equally and the caster information wont even show on a melee character or vice versus.</font></p>

You will see that spell gems, mana and spellbook items are on the same window. I removed them from the main Hot Button window so the pure melee dont have to look at them.</font></p></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

You have the combat ability window instead of the spell gem one and its sized identically so your not looking in different locations changing characters. </font></p></td></tr>

This makes it possible to have access to an additional 12 buttons on the fly. You can also change the tabs like normal. For a view of each tab go to the EgrasUI Windows area and look for EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml. I show all 4 tabs open there.</font></p></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

Not many make UIs that allow you to view every bag in every slot on one screen. No more opening and closing bags to move things around. The bank you see is my custom verion to help me organize my things better. Go to the EgrasUI Windows area to view the standard bank mod that comes in EgrasUI 6.0.</font></p></td></tr></table>
