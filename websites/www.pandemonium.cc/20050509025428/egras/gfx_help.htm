<p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">If you want to start designing and making your own sigs and graphics the first thing you must know is that is takes time to learn. You ahve to edit your own screenshots to mask out your character and stuff. This is NOT something an impatient person can do. Lots of tweaking and editing are involved.</font></p>

<td valign="top" width="175"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">The first one and one I prefer using is Paint Shop Pro. Its pretty simple to learn and works quite well. The product has been around for several years and does a great job with basic graphics editing.</td>

<td valign="top" width="175"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">This is the grand king of graphics editing. This is the one for the professional editor. I use it for more complex work like editing the tga files EverQuest uses cause it handles layers and masks better.</td></tr><table>

<BR><center><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Either one will work for what you need to do creating graphcis. Its really a matter of expense vs usage. Dont buy the expensive program if your not going to use it to its full advantage an get your money's worth.</font></p><HR><BR>

   <font class="white_16">Creating the Image</font>

<center><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Alright. You have the program, so here is the work. This is step by step taking out alot of the smaller stuff I do. Try to follow best you can and please let me know whats missing so i can fix this tutorial.</font></p>

<td valign="top" width="209"><BR><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Take a screenshot of yourself in game. Shrink it to the size you want depedning on what graphic, sig or avatar your going to stick it into.</td>

<td valign="top" width="209"><BR><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Using what ever way possible, you now need to edit everything around you off the graphic. I normally use that light green to see what I get and miss. Its also the color I use for makeing the graphic transparent later, so it works out well.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top" width="131"><img src="egras_sig_a3.gif" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top" width="209"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Make a blank graphic the size you want the avatar, graphic or sig to be. Its VERY important you dont skip a step here and make the border around your screenshot image of yourself. That will make this more work than you can imagine later. Ok. Create your border.</td>
<td valign="top" width="131"><img src="egras_sig_a4.gif" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top" width="209"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Add your name, slogon or whatever into the small box. Your graphcis doesnt have to have one, but mine did, so I covered it.</td></tr><tr>

<td valign="top" width="209"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Take a screenshot or find the background you want to use. Cut it down to size. Adjust the gamma or bightness as needed. I chose the char select for the example. I also reveresed one side, to remove the rock. Really anything is possible with patience.</td>

<td valign="top" width="209"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Grab your borders, text and anything you want from step 4. Paste it onto your graphic and line it up. Careful where and how you put it before you release it onto the image. This step may require backups and retrys often to get it centered jsut right.</td></tr><tr>

<td valign="top" width="209"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Grab your body shot you did in step 2. Paste it onto your image. Again be careful on position. This step is a pain also.</td>
<td valign="top" width="131"><img src="egras_sig_a8.gif" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top" width="209"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">I added a light white shadow to bring the body out a bit so it doesnt blend with the image as much. You can do this or anything else you want, but be careful that the shadow can tiny the border as well. You may need to recolor it to the red and  like I did.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top" width="131"><img src="egras_sig_a9.gif" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top" width="209"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">This is the step you change the color of your border to the color that looks best. I choose to wait till now, cause I like to see how the border will look on the background. Sometimes they just dont look right.</td>
<td valign="top" width="131"><img src="egras_sig_a10.gif" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top" width="209"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Here you need to remove all the stuff outside the border. Make it one color. I chose the green cause its not used anywhere else on the image. This color must be the only time its used on the graphic for when we turn it transparent all times the green its used will disappear.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top" width="131"><img src="egras_sig_a11.gif" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top" width="209"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">This is the EXACT same image as the one in step 10. The difference is that I told the program to make the green transparent. This will be covered below.</td>

<center><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Alright. You now have a avatar. The steps are the same in all 3 images. Just different sizes. Your might not be transparent yet. I understand some are not familiar with this step. Read on and lets finish this thing up totally. I use a rather old version of Paintshop Pro for this, cause if ti works, why change it. Some of the stuff your looking for may be a little different, but for the most part the programs stayed the same on this stuff.</font></p><HR><BR>

   <center><font class="white_16">Making and Image Transparent</font>

<center><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Go back and open the very last image you used. For me this was egras_sig_a11.gif. Can be named anything you want really. I just did them in numeric order and it took 11 steps to cover it.</font></p>

<p><img src="tran1.gif"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">This part is the real tricky part. Using the eyedropper tool (little button I copied under the green square on the right). Find the green on your image around the outside. With the eyedropper over that green you will see the color number for it on the right next to an "I". For my image is was 128. Remember that number.</font></p>

<p><img src="tran2.gif"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">Go up top to File, then Save As. Change the "Save As Type: to GIF - Compuserve. You will see an options button at the botom right of that window. Click that button.</font></p>

<p><img src="tran3.gif"><p align="justify"><font class="gray_10">This is the file preferences area. There is a GIF tab. Click that and you will see transparency stuff. Click the bottom one and set the value to the number of your green. Mine was 128 so I set that. Click ok and then click save on the Save As window. Your image should look like mine in number 11. I hope it worked.</font></p>
