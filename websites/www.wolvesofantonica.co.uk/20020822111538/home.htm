                  This is our resting place when the weather is upon us, and the 
                  server is down!! For EverQuest, as much as we love it - we loathe 
                  the downtimes!<br>
                  <br>
                  Our server - Firiona Vie - is a Role Playing server. Eyes in 
                  the dark watch over us all, and we should stay in character 
                  always. If you think your wit and skill are of interest to us, 
                  then why not talk? If you convince us - then the community spirit 
                  of the Wolves will carry you through your early Character, and 
                  into Adulthood. For we are brethren of Blood! We pack together 
                  - and hunt as one! But we have a HIERARCHY. Through our Officers, 
                  you may join us. But to be worthy to carry our name, we expect 
                  you to be a part of our team, and hope you agree with our DECREES.

Loyalty to the guild will be honoured.  You may find yourself climbing the hierarchy to new levels!<br>
Questions arise in us all.  If a riddle vexes your mind, we urge you to look upon our GUILD PLACARD.  There are many messages to read, and you may post your own.  We are here to serve our members and prospective members alike.   We all want our journeying troubles eased - and that is why the guild is here..<br>
