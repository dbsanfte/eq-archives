                  1: Getting Started<o:p></o:p></b><o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                  a raid leader posts a raid, they will normally post a time and 
                  place to assemble. It is of the utmost importance that you be 
                  at this place at the time specified to start the raid. Many 
                  raids depend on reaching a certain objective within a limited 
                  time frame. For example, Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox are normally 
                  killed within 3 hours of having popped on many servers. In order 
                  to reach the objective of your raid before others do, you as 
                  an individual must be on time to start the raid.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                  order to do this, it is critical that you be aware of the time 
                  and how long it will take you to get from wherever you are to 
                  wherever the raid is supposed to start. A good guideline is 
                  to start on your way towards the assembly place an hour before 
                  the raid is supposed to start. This gives you time to bank, 
                  buy supplies, be bound, and still be on time before the raid 
                  begins. Remember that everyone else attending the raid will 
                  be waiting on you if you are late.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
                  everyone has arrived, the Raid Leader will assign groups. To 
                  help the Raid Leader out, when you arrive, disband any group 
                  you're in and turn on LFG. This allows the raid leader to do 
                  a quick /who LFG to see who's not grouped yet. Sometimes groups 
                  may be revised two or three times before the raid begins to 
                  account for last minute additions to the raiding party.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  most important thing you can do during this time is staying 
                  QUIET. The raid leader will communicate either through chat 
                  channel, /say, /ooc, or /shout at this point, but any kind of 
                  text messages on the screen can easily drown out what he is 
                  saying. You should refrain from talking in say, from doing many 
                  emotes, or from casting spells. Remember that not only are you 
                  having to read this information, many others are too. The raid 
                  leader will give you time to buff, etc. before you start fighting, 
                  so do your teammates a favor and hold off on these actions until 
                  it's time.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
                  groups are formed, the raid leader will go over the objective 
                  and rules of the raid. Most raid leaders have a certain style, 
                  which you'll learn after you attend several of their raids. 
                  Remember that the raid leader's word is final, and don't argue 
                  with them. You're on the raid to do a job, and to have fun, 
                  and that won't happen if you are &quot;backseat driving&quot;.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lesson 
                  2: Communication<o:p></o:p></b><o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 
                  a raid, it may seem easy to ask a question of the raid leader. 
                  However, you should never ever do this. The reason why is that 
                  the raid leader is also being sent tells by every other member 
                  of the raid, as well as people who didn't make the raid for 
                  some reason, and other people in the zone. They're probably 
                  also trying to think, fight, and plan on an ongoing basis, and 
                  every /tell they receive is one more thing to sort through.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
                  solve this problem, raid leaders assign group leaders. You should 
                  always funnel your questions through your group leader. Odds 
                  are that they'll be able to answer it for you, and if not, they'll 
                  send it on to the raid leader. You need to be patient when waiting 
                  for answers. Sometimes it may take a minute or two for the raid 
                  leader or group leader to get to your question.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Raid 
                  communication is always over /ooc or /shout. You need to keep 
                  these channels clear during the raid, only use them to call 
                  pulls and mezzes, report mana, or so on. You don't want to miss 
                  the shout that says that the entire raid is moving, or the one 
                  telling you the puller is coming with death on his heels. Likewise, 
                  the raid leader relies on these channels to keep an idea of 
                  what's happening - for example, which groups are low on mana. 
                  Keeping these channels clear helps him make sure that he's got 
                  all the information so that he can make the right decisions.<o:p></o:p></font></p>

                  3: Chain of Command and Professionalism</b><o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About 
                  60% of Everquest is built for single-group play. This means 
                  that you and 5 of your friends get together and go slay monsters 
                  and gather treasure and fulfill quests.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  rest of Everquest requires slightly more than one group.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                  you start getting more than 6 people together in one place, 
                  making decisions and acting on those decisions becomes increasingly 
                  more complex. Therefore it's very important to respect the chain 
                  of command.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  raid leader is in charge. In a sense, during the raid, you are 
                  there working for him or her. It is imperative that you do whatever 
                  he or she tells you, without stopping to ask why. Remember that 
                  the raid leader's primary responsibility is keeping you and 
                  everyone else alive long enough to finish the raid. They are 
                  doing everything in their power to insure not only the survival 
                  of the raid, but to make sure that you get experience and loot 
                  as well. In return for this, when they tell you to move, you 
                  need to MOVE. Don't question, don't argue, don't ignore them, 
                  just do what they say. If you don't, you may very well cause 
                  your raid to be wiped out.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  raid leader will normally have a second, who will help out with 
                  directions in combat and will take over if something happens 
                  to the raid leader (like death). You should follow the second's 
                  directions in the same way as you should follow the raid leader's 
                  directions - as if your life depended on it.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, 
                  your group leaders are responsible for coming up with whatever 
                  tactics your group uses in combat. It's important that you listen 
                  to them and follow their directions too, because if your group 
                  is not working together, they aren't helping the raid at all.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                  order to do a raid properly, you must at all times approach 
                  it in a professional manner. Of course, the objective of the 
                  raid is to have fun, but unless the raiding party is working 
                  like a well-oiled machine you're not going to be having much 
                  fun. Casual players CAN do raids, but they can NOT play casually 
                  during them. Things you would normally do during single-group 
                  play, like going afk for long periods, or talking on the phone 
                  while playing, or even just looking away from your screen and 
                  watching TV for a minute or two, are unacceptable. Worse, they 
                  will get you killed. At all times you must be focused on the 
                  raid, where you are, and what you're doing. Not to say that 
                  you can't go afk during a raid, but you must wait until you 
                  have the raid leader's permission to do so. If you object to 
                  this, put yourself in his shoes. That raid leader is responsible 
                  for keeping anywhere from 12 to 100 players alive, happy, and 
                  working towards a goal of some sort. He can't do that if every 
                  two minutes, one or two people just suddenly go afk.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Being 
                  in a raiding party is equivalent to being part of a military 
                  unit. You must respect the chain of command, and you must devote 
                  yourself entirely to the greater goals of the raid, rather than 
                  your own personal goals. This may mean modifying your schedule 
                  so you don't have to go afk so often, or letting the answering 
                  machine pick up that phone call, or even just simply waiting 
                  a few minutes for the raid to get to a safe spot before you 
                  go to the bathroom. Professionalism is key. The raid leader 
                  will take your needs into account, but you must also take the 
                  needs of everyone else on the raid into account. Breaks will 
                  be scheduled when possible.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remember 
                  though, any Real Life emergency is more important than, EQ, 
                  but if you just need a drink wait until it's safe.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lesson 
                  4: Roles<o:p></o:p></b><o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every 
                  raid is different, and demands a different approach in order 
                  to succeed. However, there are some standard roles that are 
                  used in the majority of raids.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Main 
                  Assist</i></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  main assist is usually (although not always) the highest-level 
                  &quot;tank&quot; available. This person is responsible for picking 
                  which monster dies next. All other raiders should be assisting 
                  this person, thus the title &quot;main assist&quot;. Main assists 
                  are needed on some raids, but not all raids.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Secondary 
                  Assist</i></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  secondary assist is basically the backup main assist. This person 
                  takes over when the main assist is down, or if there are two 
                  mobs being fought simultaneously. Everyone should have an assist 
                  key for the secondary assist as well as the main assist. Like 
                  the main assist, secondaries are used on some raids, but not 
                  all of them. Member of the secondary Assist's group should assist 
                  them. This person is also commonly known as the tank mezzer.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Puller</i></font></p>
                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  puller is usually the highest-level monk or shadow knight on 
                  the raid, but other classes may also fill this role. The puller 
                  is responsible for pulling out rooms in the dungeon, splitting 
                  the spawns, and bringing them back one or two at a time for 
                  the raid party to destroy. Pulling is an art, and it is very 
                  difficult to pull a high level dungeon properly. Pullers will 
                  sometimes double as main assists, but not usually. Not every 
                  raid will involve pulling, as many dungeons are built to discourage 
                  it.<o:p></o:p></font></p>

                  During a raid, this person will loot any and all rare drop items 
                  and distribute those, either on the spot or at the end. This 
                  person will also distribute no drop items. Looting is a big 
                  part of any raid, and normally the master looter will not participate 
                  in fights unless absolutely necessary, in order to keep up with 
                  the corpses. On raids, the master looter should be the ONLY 
                  person looting kills<o:p></o:p></font></p>

                <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Warriors</i> 
                  - ONLY use taunt when you are the main assist. It's that simple. 
                  If you find yourself getting hate when you're not the main assist, 
                  then stop attacking and back off slowly until the mob has been 
                  back on the main for a few seconds. Only the main assist should 
                  break mezzes. Make a hotkey that says &quot;/shout Taunting 
                  %t&quot;. Hit this hotkey, and then taunt the mob 3 times. Have 
                  another hotkey that says &quot;/shout Breaking mez on %t&quot;. 
                  Use this, and then attack the mob. Doing this will save your

                  - See warriors above. Refrain from flashing or stunning the 
                  mob unless you have to (example: The mob is healing/gating, 
                  etc). Remember that mobs really hate being stunned and blinded 
                  and WILL start hitting you, so be careful. Only root for crowd

                  always wait a few seconds between casts. If your pet is up, 
                  make sure you have him on a leash, and that he is only attacking 
                  what he is supposed to be attacking. If he's not where he's

                  good. Your job is to be beating the snot out of the mob while 
                  it beats the snot out of one of those platemail-wearing fools. 
                  Always let the main assist pound on the mob for a moment before

                  yourself getting aggro during the fight, stop attacking and 
                  back off or JOLT. We know you like to be in the thick of it, 
                  but there are other, safer ways to damage the mob. In open areas, 
                  back off and use your bow. You do have a bow, right? Rangers 
                  do more damage with bows than any other class, so use the damn 
                  thing. In close quarters, like in dungeons, use your spells. 
                  Only cast when you are not in direct melee with the mob, because 
                  it will decide it doesn't like you otherwise. Make sure you

                  that when you land that huge backstab the mob is probably going 
                  to be quite upset with you. If necessary, stop fighting for

                  Don't over nuke - conserve mana. A good idea is never to blow 
                  more than 30% of your mana pool on one mob, unless it's a boss-type 
                  mob. Don't use AE spells when your enchanter is mezzing, or

                  of raid leaders don't even allow pets on their raids, and the 
                  reason that happens is bad pet control. Don't allow your pet

                  nuking. When fighting big mobs, NEVER use a spell that turns

                  raiders are expected to be at the meeting place on time to begin 
                  the raid, or they risk forfeiting their seat on the raid. A 
                  good guideline is to begin moving to the meeting place at least 
                  1 hour before the raid begins. Raiders are expected to have 
                  bound themselves as close by as possible to the raid location, 
                  and to have completed any necessary individual preparation (buying

                  the group leader and given to the raid leader or loot master

                  raids, it is likely that individual raiders will die. This is 
                  unfortunate, but it is part of the game and cannot be avoided. 
                  As the raid leader cannot control who does or does not come 
                  to the raid, individual raiders will not be guaranteed a resurrection 
                  of any level if they die. The raid leader will arrange corpse 
                  recoveries for people who die, and will always attempt to provide 
                  resurrections when they are available, but this is by no means

                  all times during the raid, raiders are expected to remain polite 
                  and courteous. They are expected to stay with their groups and 
                  to follow directions given by their group leaders and the raid 
                  leader. Communication to the raid leader should be filtered 
                  first through your group leader, to insure that the raid leader 
                  is not overwhelmed by tells. The raid leader will make every 
                  effort to insure that your group gets experience and loot, but 
                  repeated tells requesting better experience, better loot, or 
                  stronger kills can and will result in your dismissal from the 
                  raid. Please remember that your raid leader is doing the very 
                  stressful job of trying to keep multiple groups alive, moving, 
                  and happy, and be patient.</font></p>
