                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I am 
                  sure many of you have noticed the news section has be a little 
                  slack! &nbsp;Sorry my fault I always go to update it and then 
                  bang I forget or am busy hunting.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As many 
                  of you are aware the Wolves are once again becoming a strong 
                  force and as we grow more and more great hunts lye ahead for 
                  us to tackle. &nbsp;Now I am not saying this is going to be 
                  easy and I am sure we will fall many times but as usual we will 
                  pick ourselves up and fight another day, but we will always 
                  have FUN!!</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I also ask 
                  ye Wolves to take many screen shots of ye great hunts so we 
                  can show others whom may be interested in the Wolves what they 
                  are missing out of. &nbsp;The guild gallery is a great place 
                  for us to show others or even look back on.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are 
                  running through a zone and see a named mob shout out in guild 
                  chat and if the mob is of use we will take our weapons to it. 
                  &nbsp;Trackers run to many zones and do a quick track so we 
                  can gather and destroy.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also I am 
                  very proud of all our guild members as we are not selfish and 
                  think of each other first as a family should do, I have had 
                  many new members send me tells saying how they have never been 
                  in a guild who care and help each other as much us the Wolves, 
                  so pat yourselves on the back. &nbsp;Spread the word of the 
                  Wolves you don't have to be an officer to invite a new person 
                  to the guild tell them about us and get them in chat channel 
                  woa, if they are WoA material I am sure an officer will be more 
                  than glad to run to the other side of Norrath to bring them 
                  into the pack.&nbsp;</font></p>

                Dearest Wolves - we know this has come as a huge shock to many 
                of you. This, unfortunately could not be avoided. For many moons 
                now, there has been wispers and secret discussions in dark corners. 
                But now, it has come to light - for all to see! <br>
                <br>
                The Leaders of the Wolves have taken the bold step forward, in 
                recognising that evil is, as evil does. The colour of skin, or 
                deity worshipped does not conclude that someone is evil. Each 
                person should be judged by their action. <br>
                Since the release of the Planes of Power entension to EQ, it has 
                been hard to ignore that the Plane of Knowledge, and the plane 
                of tranquility both have both evil and good races and classes 
                living together in some form of utopia. <br>
                <br>
                We now believe that this is the example of true enlightenment, 
                and a direction in which we now follow. What happens now, is up 
                to you - but the basic values of family, friends, and loving and 
                helping one another stays. We are no different in a sense, only, 
                now we are free to extend our love, friendship, and kinsmenship 
                - to each and every member of Norrath! <br>
                <br>
                This may shake the core foundations of the wolves - but come through 
                this, and we believe we will be stronger, and more able to move 
                forwards than ever before.<br>
                <br>
                Be Strong, be proud - you are the Wolves of Antonica. <BR>

                  The last patch seemed to have caused many problems for a lot 
                  of us. I can't guarantee this solution will fix them all, bit 
                  it made the game a whole lot more playable for me! My machine 
                  crashed every time I zoned. This seems to be the solution, and 
                  I hope it helps any of you with similar problems.<br>
                  <br>
                  1. Go to the folder where Everquest is installed.<br>
                  2. Find the file TestEverQuest.exe (should have an EQ Shield 
                  picture over the name)<br>
                  3. Run this version of EverQuest! - it will start patching the 
                  patch program!<br>
                  4. Just to be safe, delete the texcache.txc file. Don't worry 
                  - its gonna work!<br>
                  5. Now, run EQ as normal. - if you use EQ Windows - make sure 
                  you run the patcher for this time!<br>
                  6. Now, another safety thing - you might want to perform a complete 
                  file check. So, de-select the AutoPlay option - and when available, 
                  click the Advanced option. Click on the "complete file check" 
                  option.<br>
                  7. Enjoy your newly working EQ!<br>

		No, its not a personal dig at all our younger members - its 2 pieces of news in one.<br><br>
		Firstly, effective as of today, the entry level into the guild has been raised to 20 seasons.  This has been debated for a while now - and we have decided to move it to 20 for the moment.  So, all officers and HC, please respect that when offering guild membership in your travels.  For those that have already applied for guild membership, and we are in talks - you are the possible exceptions to this new rule.<br><br>

This is timed to slot nicely in with the result of the Raid run by our very own fur-ball Vulrath.  Those that went on it know it was very well organised, and run with military precision.  Its certainly an achievement to be able to say we had around 50 or more players involved in the raid - and there were times I though to myself "we're gonna die!" - but the power of 50 players is not to be under-estimated.  For we cleared out the entire zone, and that is an achiement in itself!  Well, all except Cazic Thule himself.  Whom I believe Con'd RED to a level 60 player.  Some speculated he has been upped to level 70!  Well, when a Golem has 125000hp of health, it begins to make you wonder what we need to take Cazic Thule himself?<br><br>

So, A big well done to Vulrath for this very successful raid.  If you want to know how he did it so well, - sign up to his riad training programme on the guild Placard.<br><br>

                  fellow Wolves!<br>
                  After the last patch, it seems that many of us (including me) 
                  seem to be suffering texture problems. I played around a little, 
                  and have sorted it out. Its something I've had to do before 
                  to sort out a slightly different graphical problem. Worth noting 
                  for future. <br>
                  In the EQ Game Options, there's a "Texture cache" option. Remove 
                  this option. <br>
                  In your EQ Game install directory there is a file called "texcache.txc". 
                  Delete this file.<br>
                  Now try the game. Should work perfectly now. The next time you 
                  play, you can turn the texture cache option back on. Everyting 
                  will be fine now! *smiles*</font></font> </p>
