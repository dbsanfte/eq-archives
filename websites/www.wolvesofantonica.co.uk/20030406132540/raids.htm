                Notes:</b><br>
                <br>
                <b>Objective:</b>
				Want to get to the area with the black reavers - and bash the hell out of them until they drop epic pieces!
				If we are good enough - Lord Rak'ashir will spawn, and he drops the Shammy epic piece.  More info later.<br><br>

                If we head for the back of the zone, we can certainly accomodate 3 full groups there, maybe more.  If people don't mind the squeeze,
				we can surely try.  Casters may have trouble getting stuff to land on the black reavers.  They are very resistant.  Pets may not be advisable.
				Melee's will want haste, ATK and STR buffs.  The MA / SA will need HP buffs too.  Lets not waist peridots un-necessarily, ok?

              <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sign-up:</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                Please sign up on the post in Guild Raids section on the guild placard - including your level and class and 
                any other information you feel I need to know (I.E. coming late, 
                leaving early etc.). Preference will be shown in the sign-up according 
                to the necessity of the class for a successful raid.  I mean, if we got no healers, and one pops up late - the raid couldn't go
				ahead without one! (two preferrably!) Once necessary classes are present, its a first come, first served basis.  Thats not to say 
				you're not needed - just that key classes HAVE to be in place for it to succeed. 
				</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Meeting 
                location: </b>Be there at least 30 mins before at the entrance to City of Mist, just inside, so we can begin organising groups.
				The sooner we get sorted, the quicker we can get on with it.<br>
                <br>
			  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Communication: </b>
			  	please join chat channel WOAraid for discussions during raid, and for organising ports etc, as necessary.<br>
				<br>
			  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Requirements: </b>
			  	There are no requirements other than level.  But if you intend to leave early, it might be an idea for you to have a Gate potion
				handy (if you are not capableof gating yourself).<br>
				<br>
				
			  
				
                <b>Loot:</b> Please read this carefully so there are no uncertainties. 
                There is only 1 epic pieces reserved - the first Jade Reaver 
                for me.  I know this sounds a little gready, so let me explain a little further.
				<br>If we only get one Jade Reaver, then we all role on it.  That would be really bad!
				<br>If we get 2, I may well just say roll on both.  But if we get 3 (Oh, Lord! Hear my prayers!)
				then I'll take one.  If I get many people complain of this concession - I may have to change that.
				<br>Anyway, let me further back this up by saying its only gonna happen the once.  Once I have mine,
				I will still continue to organise and run such raids for the rest of us.  Hope you understand, I need my epics! 
				<br><br>
				All other epic pieces will be randomed at the end of each fight -  between 
                the people needing them. All other gear loot will be randomed 
                NBG at the end of the raid so please plan on staying the full 
                time. If you win a piece of gear, you will not be allowed to roll again until 
                all members of your class have gotten a piece. The only people 
                doing the looting on this raid will be the group leaders. If you 
                aren’t a group leader and start looting, you will receive a warning 
                (see below). Randoms will be 0-1000. NBG status for each item 
                at the end will be determined by me and is not open for discussion. 
                If I say an item is for casters only, I don’t want Hybrids asking 
                me to roll on it. 
				All money loot (coin, jewelry, gems etc.) will be saved until the 
                end of the raid and turned in to me. At that point, reimbursements 
                will be taken out for components and the remaining items will 
                be split among those who didn’t receive a piece of gear. Loot 
                fights are <b>not acceptable</b> and are cause for removal from 
                the raid.<br>
                <br>
				<b>Tactics: </b>
				In a perfect raid, we'd have an inital group with the ability to tank, slow and heal.
				After previous experience in this, having the cleric blinded or agro'd on is not good.
				So, a backup healer like say a druid is always adviable for this group.<br>
				Secondary group will have melee and a backup healer to take care of them.  This group
				needs to be self sufficient in terms of agro.  If the tank loses agro to this group - they need
				to back off, and let the tank re-establish agro, or the backup healer will be doing overtime,
				and will likely draw agro for chain-healing - but thats not gonna happen, right?
				I will explain in greater detail at the time, of how pulls will happen - and actions we take.
				<br><br>
                <b>Components:</b> All priests and buffers, please be responsible 
                for your components – only use them when appropriate, and keep 
                track of expenditures. At the end of the raid, notify your group 
                leader of total expense and I will take it out of any money loot 
                gained (if we have enough) and return it to you. If we do a CoTH 
                break in, I will supply the pearls and take the cost out of the 
                money loot at the end of the raid.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Warnings: </b> 
                I'm not going to accept messing around.  A lot can go wrong, and I'd prefer it
				if any clowns would stay away.  I don't have a points system, but I do remember
				people that mess around.  I am usually quite forgiving, but if I see that the actions
				of any individual are putting the raid in any un-necessary danger, I'll have to TL you
				out of the raid, and you're not gonna get a chance to roll on anything.
				<br>Also, if you have a problem listening to commands, and you are breaking mezzes instead of the MA,
				I'll not give you many chances before you get kicked out!  So, get serious, have a second chat window
				open, and filter all raid chat to it - so you don't miss anything!  Ok?  Lets do it!
