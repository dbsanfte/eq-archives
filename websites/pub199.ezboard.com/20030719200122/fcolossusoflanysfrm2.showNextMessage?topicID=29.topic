last night with debuffing, slowing, crippling, snaring etc.<br>
so i looked up a guide<br>
on the shaman's crucible. lots of good information there<br>
<br>
it's a pretty hefty post but contains a ton of useful<br>
advice.<br>
<br>
here it is, by Barshin Rattlebones of Fennin Ro:<br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is what I constructed for my guild, three guilds ago.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Raid debuffing<br>
<br>
I've compiled this to give some general insight into the process for those who aren't usually part of debuffing, as well as to solidify debuff team duties. The following information also is more geared to core debuffs on high-level, high-resist, raid-type encounters. As such, I'm not dealing with non-core debuffs like SK attack taps etc. <br>
<br>
The recommended level for casting all debuffs is 65. Period. However, the minimum requirements by class are:<br>
<br>
Class: minimum level/recommended level<br>
<br>
Shaman: 60 (malo)/65 (malos-malosinia)<br>
Enchanter: 57 (forlorn deeds)/62 (howl of tashan)<br>
Bard: 55 (occlusion of sound)/65 (harm. of sound)<br>
Beastlord: 65 (sha's advantage)/65 (sha's revenge)<br>
Mage: 60 (mala)/63 (malosinia)<br>
<br>
Generally your debuff team should consist of a 55+ bard with occlusion/harmony of sound, a 63+ shaman with malo/malos and malosinia and a 62+ enchanter with howl of tishan and forlorn deeds, due to overall spell selection. However, shaman aren't 100 percent needed, as a 60+ mage can mala and then a 65 beastlord can cast sha's revenge or a 57+ enchanter can cast forlorn deeds, but this could leave the chanter casting two very high-aggro spells, tash and slow. It works, just plan on rezzing the chanter a few times. Frankly, I even prefer a two-shaman slow team to alternate slow attempts to keep aggro spread out. <br>
<br>
Debuffing should always be done in two waves, the low aggro and the high aggro. The low aggro spells are recant/annul, malo/mala/malos, and occlusion/harmony of sound. Spells like slow and tash are terribly high aggro due to their poison and disease counters, and should be reserved after the MT has had an opportunity to establish aggro depending on the strength of the encounter. This is key in that the primary goal to having a debuff order is to ensure all the debuffs stack property and, most importanly, to make sure extra aggro is not built up by casting a debuff before resists have been properly lowered. Casting slow before tash and getting resisted will only get you A) killed B) extra aggro, so that when you try to slow next, you've now built up enough aggro go back to option A. Just as bad, if you malo/mala/malos before recant/annul, that just got dispelled - or order is critical. <br>
<br>
So, since the goal is minimize the number of debuffs attempts and keep things in the proper order, you must ALWAYS announce in the proper raid channel when a resist debuff has landed. Always. Do not tell me you always cast that debuff 30 seconds into a fight. People go LD, lag, pick the wrong target, whatever. Seeing the message triggers the next debuff in the chain while a resist may prompt other action. Communication is key here. That said, debuffs like cripple really don't require a call since no specific action will follow. Melee are not be waiting for cripple to land before they attack, while wizzies will most certainly be waiting for resists to be debuffed fully before unloading. But calling out cripple really doesn't hurt anything either. <br>
<br>
The 13-step debuff order:<br>
<br>
Note, this applies to a basic encounter where the target is not immune to changes in attack speed. Other scenarios are dealt with below. Parenthetical notation reflects cumulative resist debuffs given the highest-level debuff applied. <br>
<br>
1. MT engages pull<br>
2. Recant Magic, if needed, to strip off DS/buffs within the first few seconds. (annul is only half as effective) <br>
3. Occlusion/harmony of sound (-15 fire -15 cold -15 magic). However, this lasts only 18 seconds and re-application may be necessary.<br>
4. Malo/Mala/Malos (-70 fire -70 cold -70 magic -55 poison)<br>
<br>
This is where the first evaluation needs to be made. Many encounters call for a near-suicide slow or at least slow asap, such as Doze, Statue or RC. In these cases, the next spell may be turgur's, or a quick tash followed by turgur's. In cases where the slowable mobs' DPS doesn't warrant insta-slow, use good judgement and wait for the MT to establish aggro. The dead cannot debuff. In cases like this, it's important for enchanters to apply aggro-lowering spells to you and aggro-boosting spells to the MT.<br>
<br>
5. Howl of Tashan (fire -70, cold -70, magic -118, poison -55)<br>
6. Slow attempt 1* Note, always, always slow from point blank range due to resists and aggro. People die when a mob comes to find you.<br>
7. Malosini/Malosinia (fire -85, cold -85, magic -133, poison -70), which overwrites malo/malos/mala; it is not additive. This may take a few attempts, but it's nearly non-aggro. You can chain cast this. Plus, in doing so, at the very least you space out your slow attempts, lowering your overall aggro.<br>
8. Slow attempt 2* and beyond. <br>
<br>
The following phase of debuffs really can go in any order and many are situational. <br>
<br>
9. Ro's Illumination<br>
10. Cripple, often a very important cast** <br>
11. Misc. necro/bard/druid resist debuffs <br>
12. Mana pool debuffs (beneficial on some CH'ing mobs, if needed and applicable) <br>
13. Ensnare (if needed)<br>
<br>
*see slows below <br>
**see cripple, stat debuffs <br>
<br>
<br>
Who should slow?:<br>
<br>
Turgur's, at level 65 unmitigated, will slow a mob's rate of attacks by 75 percent. Thus, a mob that would have attacked 100 times will now only get 25 attacks in that same window. Forlorn Deeds, the enchanters best slow, is 70 percent at level 65. Thus, 100 attacks becomes 30. Therefore, even that 5 percent difference between slows equates to a 20 percent decrease in damage potential.<br>
<br>
Example: Mob X would attack 500 times in a given period.<br>
<br>
Turgur: 500 x .75 = 375<br>
Forlorn deeds: 500 x .70 = 350<br>
<br>
Thus Turgur would eliminate 375 attacks leaving 125 while Forlorn Deeds would elimate 350 attacks leaving 150.<br>
<br>
150 - 125 = 25/125 = .20, or 20 percent.<br>
<br>
Thus, with Turgur, you have a significant decrease in the number of attacks, thus damage potential.<br>
<br>
<br>
Disease-based slows:<br>
<br>
A few mobs -- Spite Golems, the Kromzek Captain, Seru, Emp, Dagarn, Vyemm, The General, Black Reavers, Tangrin, White Stallion and ToV glimmer drakes -- are immune to magic-based attacks but not immune to changes in attack speed. For these few mobs, you can use shaman's line of disease-based slows. The order is short and sweet, although both spells are very high aggro and they should be spaced out. <br>
<br>
1. Insidious/malicious decay - tash for disease debuffing<br>
2. Plague of insects/Cloud of grummus<br>
<br>
<br>
Re-slows:<br>
<br>
Turgur's insects, the most effective slow at 75 percent, lasts from 5.1 minutes at level 51 to 6.5 minutes at level 65. If mana is not the greatest concern, I recommend attempting to reslow at the 5 minute mark. Don't guess. Get a clock or even a stopwatch. With certain high-resist mobs, like the Fourth Warder, you may need 4-5 or more attempts to land a slow even if the mob is fully resist debuffed. Also remember to have occlusion/harmony of sound rolling when you make these slow attempts, as many bards don't maintain this beyond the initial debuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pre-engagement debuffing:<br>
<br>
A handful of mobs (Shei, HP, AL, XTC, Lady Nev, wtov rares, IV, AC burrower) are perma-rooted. In these cases, all debuffing should take place prior to engagement. In some of those cases, you may choose to blur or have debuffers camp to clear aggro so you don't have an enchanter on rampage. However, NEVER blur a triggered mob like Shei. Ever. <br>
<br>
<br>
Slow mitigate:<br>
<br>
Many mobs, like BoT minibosses and rares and PoSky mobs like an her megirs mitigate slow, meaning it doesn't have its full effect. Mitiagte works by scaling down, percentage wise, the reduction in attacks based on the spell's maximum potential. Thus, a 75 percent slow may be halved, becoming a 37.5 percent slow. Note tho, since mitigate operates in this way, a mitigated Turgur's is still better than a mitigated Forlorn Deeds, which in that case becomes a 35 percent slow -- although the margin is narrowed. <br>
<br>
Client side, the message you get after the spell lands reflects the effectiveness of the slow:<br>
<br>
&quot; ... has been partially successful&quot; = appx 30-35% slow<br>
&quot; ... has been slighty successful&quot; = appx 16% slow<br>
&quot; ... has been mostly successful&quot; = appx 50-55% slow<br>
<br>
<br>
The glossary: <br>
<br>
I've broken the debuff spells into five categories: primary resist debuffs, attack slows, primary stat debuffs, mana pool debuffs and dispells. This is mainly to highlight each effect, use and level needed to attain, so you can assemble the best debuff squad and assign appropriate duties. <br>
<br>
<br>
Primary resist debuffs: <br>
<br>
- Tashanian: decease magic resist by 37-41. 57 enc. No resist check. Poison curable. <br>
- Howl of Tashan: lower magic resist by 48-50. 61 enc. No resist check. Poison curable.<br>
- Wind of Tashinian: AE decrease magic resist by 40; max 4 targets. 60 enc. No resist check. Poison curable.<br>
<br>
- Occlusion of Sound: decrease fire/cold/magic resists, base of 10 percent. 55 bard. No resist check. <br>
- Harmony of Sound: decrease fire/cold/magic resists, base 15 percent. 65 bard. No resist check.<br>
- Tuyen's Chant of the Plague: direct damage, base 41-42 &amp; disease debuff, base 21-22. 61 bard. Disease resist check.<br>
- Tuyen's Chant of Venom: direct damage, base 41-42 &amp; poison debuff, base 22. 63 bard . Poison resist check.<br>
- Tuyen's Chant of Ice: direct damage, base 41-42 &amp; cold debuff, base 22. 63 bard. Cold resist check.<br>
- Tuyen's Chant of Fire: direct damage, base 42 &amp; fire debuff, base 22. 65 bard. Fire resist check.<br>
<br>
- Malosini: decrease fire/cold/magic/poison resists by 60. 57shm/58 mage. Magic resist check. Will overwrite malo/mala/malos, which is key, though it is not additive. <br>
- Malosinia: decrease fire/cold/magic/poison resists by 70. 63 shm/mage. Magic resist check. Will overwrite malo/mala/malos<br>
- Mala: decrease fie/cold/magic/poison resists by 35. 60 mage. No resist check. <br>
- Malo: decrease fire/cold/magic/poison resists by 45. 60 shm. No resist check. Will overwrite Mala. <br>
- Malos: decrease fire/cold/magic/poison resists by 55. 65 shm. No resist check.<br>
- Insidious Decay: decrease disease resist 36-42. 52 shm. No resist check.<br>
- Malicious Decay: decrease disease resist 51-52; 63 shm. No resist check.<br>
<br>
- Ro's Smouldering Disjunction: decrease ac 26-27, fire resist 66-68, ATK 58-62, 150 DD. 56 druid. Fire resist check. <br>
- E'ci's Frosty Breath: decrease AC by 22, cold resist by 55. 63 druid. Cold resist check.<br>
- Hand of Ro: decrease AC by 15, ATK by 100, fire resist by 72. 61 druid. Fire resist check.<br>
<br>
- Scent of Terris: decrease fire/poison/disease resist by 33-36. 52 necro. Poison resist check. <br>
<br>
<br>
Attack slows: <br>
<br>
- Turgur's Insects: decrease attack speed, max 75 percent. 51 shm. Magic resist check. <br>
- Tigir's Insects: AE decrease attack speed, max 50 percent. maximum 4 targets. 58 shm. Magic resist check.<br>
- Plague of Insects: decrease attack speed by 25 percent. 54 shm. Disease resist check. <br>
- Cloud of Grummus: decrease attack speed by 40 percent. 62 shm. Disease resist check.<br>
- Forlorn Deeds: decrease attack speed by 70 percent. 57 enc. Magic resist check. <br>
- Sha's Revenge: decrease attack speed, max: 65 percent. 65 beastlord. Magic resist check.<br>
- Sha's Advantage: decrease attack speed, max: 50 percent. 60 beastlord. Magic resist check.<br>
- Requiem of Time: decrease attack speed, max: 52 percent 64 bard. Magic resist check.<br>
- Melody of Mischeif: decrease attack speed 45 percent &amp; direct damage, base 35-36. 62 bard. Magic resist check.<br>
<br>
Note: All slows add disease counters, and as such, are disease curable.<br>
<br>
That said, many, many mobs cannot be slowed. Before you bother attempting to slow a mob, make sure you're using the right slow (disease or magic based) and that the mob isn't flagged immune to changes in attack speed. Remember, even though the mob may be immune, the aggro effects are added to the hate list. Seredith has compiled a great chart at: <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Primary stat debuffs: <br>
<br>
- Asphyxiate: decrease str 39-42, agi 39-42, hit points by 48 a tick, 50 DD. 59 chanter. Magic resist check. <br>
- Cripple: decrease dex 58-70, agi 68,-80, str 68-80, ac 31-34. 53 enc/shm. Magic resist check. <br>
- Ro's Illumination, decrease AC by 15 &amp; ATK by 80. 62 druid. Fire resist check.<br>
<br>
Yes, cripple plays a key part in the debuff chain when you are dealing with high-level or rampaging mobs. See this thread from Shaman's Crucible. <br>

Mormegil: &lt;- this is me <br>
Re: Does cripple matter: Here's what I've noticed, and it's two-fold but connected. And it's more theory than fact and I haven't tested it too hard. On even or blue con mobs, it seems to have little effect. However, on yellow and red mobs, melee generally report hitting a bit harder and taking a touch less damage. This is anecdotal, but they notice it even when I don't mention it. I've also noticed, and I forgot what level I was at the time, low 50s tho, that my pet + ebolt would kill a crippled ice giant where if I didn't cripple it, the IG would kill my pet. Note, the IG conned blue to me, but likely red to my pet. So, I have operated under the principal that a spell like cripple, which lowers a mob's offensive and defensive capabilities to some unknown degree, might help mitigate a level desparity since your level verses a mob's level seems to be the primary factor in melee damage taken and damage dealt. I know it makes more of a difference than AC since I ran a test where I was at level 53 with like 900 AC and a ranger was level 34 with the exact same AC and he took more than 20 percent more damage against the same sea fury, yellow to him and blue to me, repeatedly. So, it seems the higher the con the harder it hits you, AC be damned. Anyway, do we use it on 60+ mobs? Yes. Plus, rampage is a proc, and since cripple lowers dex, it is surmised that it would lower the number of rampages, big on mobs like the AL.<br>

Re: my reply: That's the theory I generally work under. If I am grouped with a couple of people who are lower than the typical mob level, or I'm relying on my pet for a lot of damage (like soloing something that will take several minutes to kill), I'll use cripple. Incidentally, I don't think I buy the dex debuff effect, mostly because cripple had no noticeable effect on how often phase spiders will phase their target. But, perhaps rampage et al are a different thing entirely from other proc effects. <br>

There are *many* mobs in Luclin that have an extremely high damage mitigation quotient in their AC. Melee can hit just as often, so the mobs are not avoiding the blows, but the average hits are much lower than similar level mobs in other locations. I have been trying to gather some logs on my rogue damage with and without cripple, but there are so many other factors, it has been difficult to get untainted data. Most mobs where it is quite obvious that mitigation is high are mobs where I can't duo easily. And when I do, with current slow aggro and cripple aggro on top of that, there isn't much consistency from fight to fight as to which of my characters is doing the tanking, and what side my rogue is on makes a difference, even on average hits it seems from my limited logs so far. But from what I have gathered so far, cripple *does* make a difference on mobs with high mitigation AC. I won't go so far as to say that cripple takes all its AC debuff from mitigation and doesn't affect avoidance yet (although I am leaning towards believing this is true since it fits with why no one noticed much change with cripple in the past) but it does seem to be worth casting at times. <br>
<br>
<br>
Mana pool debuffs: <br>
<br>
- Curse of Simple Mind: decrease int and wis by 20. 29 enc. Magic resist check. <br>
- Torment of Argli: decrease int and wis by 21; 2 minute 960 DoT. 56 Enc. Magic resist check. Stacks with Curse, but not necro heart line. <br>
- Mana Sieve: decreases mana 214-370. 34 enc. No resist check. <br>
- Theft of Thought: 346-400 mana tap. 51 enc. Low resist magic resist check. <br>
- Color Slant: PB AE stun and mana sieve, decreasing mana by 100. 52 enc. Magic resist check. <br>
- Lost Composition of Ervaj: decreases mana by a base of 220 every 18 seconds. 60 bard. No resist check. <br>
- Mind Wrack. Decrease mana by 300. 58 necro. Low resist disease resist check.<br>
<br>
Note: Mana sieves just reduce a target's mana. Mana taps like ToT increase the casters mana as well. And remember, contrary to popular belief, mana sieving has little effect on whether or not a mob is likely to gate or not, since the gate spell cost so little mana. It has more effect on mobs that cast large heals like CH, like Vox. <br>
<br>
<br>
Dispells: <br>
<br>
Recant magic: Will remove up to 4 buffs with little aggro. 53 enc. No resist check. <br>
Annul magic: Will remove up to 2 buffs with little aggro. Many classes. No resist check.<br>
<br>

like i said, a hefty post but lots of good info. perhaps<br>
we can coordinate a bit more effectively on our next<br>
raid... it's good that we're starting fairly small and giving<br>
ourselves room to grow and learn to work together.<br>
<br>
hope this proves useful.<br>

<br>
A system could be put together with you debuffers and myself.  From what I saw last night, it seems to me that shamans and necros seem to draw the most aggro.  Shamans are understandable but Im not quite sure why the necros were getting aggro.  (Poor Schadow <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )   <br>
<br>
We seem to have come up with a system last night that was working ok.  Low aggro debuffs on INC, High aggro debuffs after ASSIST is called.  This might be a problem later due to slows being such a requirement very early in the encounter, but we will approach that when we get there.  So, help me compile a list of low aggro vs. high aggro spells since the post you put up didnt exactly have them listed with aggro potential.  We will see what we can come up with. <p>Chris Silversky<br>

It seems that ench and sham resist debuffs are rather low aggro due to the fact that they are magic based and leave no disease or poison counters, whereas the necro resist debuff is high aggro and leaves a poison counter.  Also, the sham resist debuffs are much more effective than the necro debuff so my casting of my debuff was probably not as important to get off right away, and i will keep that in mind.  As far as me getting so much aggro last night, i am a little confused. after landing only one debuff when the mob was at ~90% health and then getting summoned, i must say that something was defintiely in one of the patches recently because that doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense, but i will work around it in the future.  <br>
   Most importantly, we need to get some bards!  I remember that once i was with teiresias and my brother who plays a 57 bard, and we were in Sirens Grotto, and the seahorses would resist almost all of mine and teiresias' spells until the bard OOS'd them, and then everything landed, a very nice spell (song) indeed!<br>

We need to get some more of certain classes, or at least one of each class.  Unfortunately, Bards are a rare commodity, and good bards are worth their weight in plat.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for clearing that up with the disease/poison conversation.  Adjust as needed Schadow/Morb at least until after the next patch.   <p>Chris Silversky<br>
