        <br>
        Joining the Fellowship of Valor is not a decision to be taken lightly.
        We are increasingly becoming more and more of a role-playing guild and
        since we are a guild of good alignment we do not allow Necromancers nor
        Shadow Knights to join. We do not believe in discriminating against race
        because the actions of ones life determines their alignment not they're
        birth.&nbsp;
        <p>To join the Fellowship of Valor you must petition a member in good
        standing with the guild. If they recommend you to an officer and you
        agree to the conditions set forth here you will be added to the guild
        roster as a probationary member.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You must group with members in good standing who have the opportunity
        to witness you perform three valorous acts.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acts of Valor can include but are not limited to a) Sacrificing
        oneself to save another. B) perform a great act of Charity or C) Great
        acts of faith or kindness.</p>
        <p>These acts must be witnessed by a non-probationary member and
        petitioned to an officer when they occur.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you feel that you would like to petition for membership please
        follow this <a href="http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipofvalorfrm10" target="_blank">link</a>
        and leave a post stating what you name is, your class, and a time an
        officer can contact you in game. </td>
