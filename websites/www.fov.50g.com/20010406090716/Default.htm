Bittersweet Revenge be warned that Relfection's is a post bittersweet story and
has some spoilers in it.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="1"><b>General News: </b>Watch for new changes coming
to the website. We are preparing to create a new layout and add new features. I
know we have been promising changes that have yet to occur but Salidina and
myself are having some RL issues that are keeping us running back and forth to
Kansas City from our home in Springfield Mo. One of the features we are hoping
to add is Netmeeting connectivity. We would like to have a Netmeeting channel up
and running for our guild members to get on to have verbal discussions of
issues. Technical Support will be available at given times if you will need
assistance setting it up.&nbsp;</font></p>
