[B]The History of Dereth should not be bothered with who has the biggest monarchy or who got the highest level first.  it should be a bold and stirring tale of the tradgey and victory of the human heart; the struggles we endure as we settle this new land.  Those who perform heroic deeds should be written down in the annals of history: the brave men and women who helped destroy the Great Work, though I believe as time passes we may grow to curse their names.  From my own research I believe they have set loose something far worse than even the demented Gelidites could imagine.  Prepare yourselves.  Not only shall we discover history but soon...we shall make it.

May Asheron watch over your soul.

I wish I could take credit for it but I cannot and applaud the efforts of Ryan Idol of Thistledown.<BR>Here is his words of wisdom:<BR>History of the World<P><BR>NOTE: The numbers in parentheses indicate the source of the information.<P><BR>Pre-History<P><BR>Titanic battles between the witch-gods and a "force which writhed within the bowels of the earth". (5)<P><BR>The Falatacot come to Dereth 6000 years before the founding of Frore. Ruled by priestesses, the Falatacot were a matriarchy who worshipped the "witch-gods" and conducted blood rituals. They settled the swamps and desert (lands occupied by the Sho and Gharundim today). The Falatacot commanded great magics, some of which allowed them to dig enormous tunnels through the ground. They were also known as great prophets, receiving glimpses of the future during scarification rituals. Two of their lost ancient books are "The Uotecatl Sect of Nahouhaztl" and the "Book of Eibhil". The ancient lore of the Falatacot speaks of the "Mouth of the Abyss", the "Web of the Elder Gods", and the "Pulse of Darkness". (1, 5, 6)<P><BR>The Great Cooling of the World (4)<P><BR>The Old Lords of Dericost, a kingdom on another continent to the East, begin using necromantic magics that turn them into liches, revenants, and other forms of undead. Lord Rytheran of Menilesh is one of them. At some point there is a schism among the Old Lords. It seems that the they divided over religious matters, with some worshipping the evil defeated by the witch gods and others (like Lord Rytheran) worshipping a different entity. (4, 5)<P><BR>Lord Rytheran and some of the other Old Lords of Dericost, led by His Eternal Splendor, arrive in Dereth via ship from Nesortania, southern port on the continent to the East. (4)<P><BR>The Yalain build the Tou-Tou lighthouse. (4)<P><BR>Ilservian, a Dericost, and Maila, rouse a "thing" from beneath the earth and create a huge blackened crater which is known as the Obsidian Plain today. (4)<P><BR>The Necromancy of the Old Lords of Dericost and the actions of Ilservian set off the Millenium War. (4, 6)<P><BR>Millenium War<P><BR>Coming of the Darkness: Bael’Zharon, the HopeSlayer, and his infinite army defeat Lord Atlan. Shadow men kidnap the children of Asheron’s culture. Lord Asheron researches planar magic hoping to use it to imprison Bael’Zharon. (7)<P><BR>-2089 PY:Bael’Zharon is imprisoned in a crystal by Asheron and the Council of Five. Soul stones buried deep within the ground are somehow keeping Bael’Zharon in his prison. This ends the Millenium War (8)<P><BR>The people of Haebrous and Yalain join together and cast down the Ice Throne off Dericost. The surviving Dericost are forced to live as migrants or underground in the grasslands of Yalain (on the other continent). (3, 6)<P><BR>Empyrean Era of Lore<P><BR>Lord Rytheran founds the Mage Academy where he teaches magic to the Yalain. He makes some of the Yalain undead down in the rank cellars where the Great Ones once lived. (4, 6)<P><BR>The Burning Time: One of the Old Lords of Dericost (a lich) is found in hiding in Haebrous. The sons and daughters of old Dericost (the Gelidites - they named themselves after the Plateau of Gelid, the ancient homeland of the Dericost.) are blamed and are put to fire and sword for the errors of their grandsires. The Yalain torture the Gelidites. The Grand Inquisitor and his 2 assistants are found dead in the square of Farimeh, and the Burning Time ends. (3, 6)<P><BR>The Gelidites come to Dereth at Fenngar’s suggestion, landing in the North near the Bandit Castle. Upon landing they use ancient necromantic spells to become undead. They wander for a while, leaving 3 monoliths to mark their passage. (6, 10)<P><BR>The Gelidites find an acceptable site and begin construction of Frore. During the excavation they find the Great Work and begin to use it. There are several indications that the Great Work might be one of the Soul Stones used to imprison Bael’Zharon. (5)<P><BR>Olthoi come to Dereth. (4)<P><BR>Ice Cave History Book is written, warning of a catastrophic event. The author notes that a soul gem involved in the entrapment of Bael’Zharon may be flawed, allowing him to communicate with his minions. (2)<P><BR>Asheron removes the surviving Empyreans from the world and opens the portals to Ispar.<P><BR>Current Era<P><BR>-15 PY:Humans first arrive in Dereth<P><BR>0 PY:Olthoi Queen is killed<P><BR>6 PY:Holtburg is overrun by Tumeroks. Celcynd manages to save the children by using planar magic, but the adults are all killed.<P><BR>9 PY:Elysa Strathelar disappears<P><BR>11/12 PY:The Fourth Sending: At the urging of Frisirth, the Gelidites use the great Work to draw the heat-energy within the earth, bringing forth an ice age. Frisander becomes concerned that the crystal’s connection to the nether regions of the earth may also draw up the mysterious forces alluded to in the ancient Falatacot texts.
