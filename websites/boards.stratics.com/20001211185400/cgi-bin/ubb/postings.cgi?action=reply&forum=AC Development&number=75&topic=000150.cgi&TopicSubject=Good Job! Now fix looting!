I lead them into an area I hadn't been in for awhile, and apparently it has gotten a bit more dangerous there. Before I knew it, one of them was dying left and right trying to recover his gear (communications breakdown) and eventually my other follower got seperated and eaten by gromnies, losing three items that we would have a tough time replacing.<P>Finally realizing that we were getting hopelessly seperated and that they were just going to keep getting slaughtered if they kept playing "find the corpse" we regrouped and went to the nearest town to re-equip. Since I had no vitae and all of my gear, I went back into the nasty area to recover their lost equipment while they went off to fight their vitae back down to reasonable levels.<P>The good news was that not only was I able to recover most of their gear, but in a single evening they were able to work off a sizable vitae penalty. The new system appears to be well balanced - it isn't easy to recover, but it is certainly possible.<P>The bad news is that I still had to wait for their corpses to decompose before I could loot them. I'm their Monarch, and I was the only one of us capable of surviving alone in that area long enough to recover the gear, but it took a lot of time and patience for me to do it.<P>My vassals and I were doing fine in that area until one of them didn't run soon enough and got critically hit. He died again when he tried to meet us - once we were seperated the area went from risky to suicidal. Then he died when we tried to escort him back in. If I could have just brought him his armor the first time, we could have continued on our way without too much trouble.<P>There should be some way to give permission for people to loot your corpse...I guess they want to make sure that death is unpleasant, but if they are going to allow people to recover gear from corpses at all, they should allow others to recover it for them - for the sake of community, if nothing else. That way you could @tell someone when you find their corpse and offer to recover their gear for them. They can choose to trust you or not. <P>-Jn-<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Gelum Fyre</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">This idea has been brought up times before and I have heard someone say they are considering it (Let's hope).<P>The prompt for trusting someone should only come from allegiance/fellowship personnel, I feel.  Otherwise, every single person that comes along to look at your corpse will be sending you a message.<P>Consider this..  An allegiance or fellowship member looks at your corpse.  This initiates a prompt to you.. "Soandso, of your allegiance, desires the items from your corpse.  Permit the access?".  Once the items are gone, you receive no other prompts from those looking at your corpse.<P>The problem with this, is how the prompt will incorporate with the other text.  It can't have priority over a current battle.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Joe Napalm</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans"><BR>There's a simple solution...<P>When someone tried to loot your corpse, you recieve a message "[player name] is attempting to loot your corpse" in that nasty green text.<P>You have the ability to type "@loot allow [player name]"...<P>That way you could give anyone you wanted the capability to loot your corpse. They wouldn't even have to try to loot it first - That way if you died somewhere nasty, and had a couple people trying to help you out, you could give them permission ahead of time. They wouldn't have to sit around waiting for the "Bob the Unfortunate has given you permission to loot his corpse" message.<P>They could make it really fancy, if they had the inclination and the time, and give us a @loot list that would show us who had permission to loot us. Maybe they could make it so that you could give one-time looting rights and long-term looting rights. That way if I am in a fellowship with someone I can let them loot me just this once, but I could give the members of my Alliance general looting rights so that I would only have to add them to the list once.<P>Maybe "@loot allow [player name]" gives them the ability to loot once, while "@loot add [player name]" adds them to my list of looters until I do a "@loot remove [player name]"...<P>-Jn-</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Gelum Fyre</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Under that system (well thought out), there would not be a need to get a "someone's attempting to loot your corpse" message at all.  If it's someone you know (or even if it isn't), they can take the time to @tell you that they are at your corpse.  If it's someone not in your allegiance/fellowship you can just @reply "ya.. as if.."   <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>"@loot allow" and "@loot add" would be a great addition to the current system.  Because of the potential programming/storage burden of additional lists, I think an as needed "@loot allow" would be sufficient.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
