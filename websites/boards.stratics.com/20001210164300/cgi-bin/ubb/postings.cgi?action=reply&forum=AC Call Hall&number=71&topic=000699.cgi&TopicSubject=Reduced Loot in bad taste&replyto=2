It shouldn't have been changed... They said it was too easy to make money, but you needed every cent. It is very expensive to be a higher level char (15+), as you need to buy mana stones to charge up your junk before going out.... 1000p average for small mana charges, it adds up...

The shops already "make a profit" - selling for more money than what they offer.  Increase this difference!  Instead of selling 1 sword plus change to get another, make it so you have to sell 3 swords to get another.<P>You could also make NPC "profits" much higher in harder areas, where loot is more common.

If you fight a creature with a sword, you will always get a sword, but it may be of a crappy quality (worth less coin).  The "realism" would be intact and the loot would be lower.<P>Magic components are much more common loot now.  Instead of a 5p-10p component, I'd rather a similar worth weapon (assuming I saw it on the creature).</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Joe Napalm</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">It stinks of shooters, doesn't it? You kill a bad guy, and he's carrying some ammo but no weapons...hmmm...<P>You would think that they would have just implemented some simple economic fixes...if the market is being flooded with weapons, make it so they aren't worth much unless they are exceptional in some way. Sure, it would also make common weapons more affordable...but no one ever buys them anyway. The less common items would still be just as expensive.<P>At the same time, why not just tweak encumbrace so that it is more realistic? Weapons might not be very heavy, but it would be next to impossible to fight effectively with a half-dozen spears, bows, axes and swords strapped on. They already take this into account by making spears and axes more encumbering than a short sword, for instance...why not just crank it up another notch and make it more realistic while helping fix the money surplus?<P>Either way fixes they problem - either the weapons are worth less, or you can't carry as many...the end result is the same.<P>The fact that they chose to implement such a silly fix bothers me...Are they under so much schedule pressure that this was the best solution they could think of? I know they have milestones to meet and pebble-counters to satisfy, but the quality of the game is measured by the little nuances like this as much as it is by the flashy features.<P>-Jn-<p>[This message has been edited by Joe Napalm (edited September 28, 1999).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Calems</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">I absolutly agree with you all. <P>The fist time I saw that was in the beginning of beta 2 where all the monougas we're affected by that "bug/feature".

Most of the monster I fight in the wilderness give me strange magical component that they don't even use when they fight. The dagger the drudge used? Gone. The darts that we're throwed at me? Gone. <P>Yes the realist of the loot contributed to make AC great and I hope it will be back soon In the beta - Sorry after UO and EQ promises I don't trust any after release statement.<P>By the way anyone know if the housing project is still planned for after release?<P>Oups! =)  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Merrlinn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">One thing that the reduced loot really effects.. is newbies.  I started a character about a month ago, and the only way to earn any cash was to take the weapons off the monsters you've killed and go sell them.. now, as I've returned and started another character.. I can't make ANY money! Where am I supposed to get the cash for any weapons or armor upgrades? It's unbelievable, without finding a patron to help (and of course he's strapped for cash nowadays as well) a newbie would have ABSOLUTELY no way to make any money to upgrade his equipment..</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">JerryF</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">I myself was doing just that for hours on end: Killing low-level monsters, taking the 'very' occasional pyrees (1-25 usually), the ONE spell component, and once in a blue moon the knife (worth about 15 gold at a blacksmith but over 20 at a smaller shop).  It took me nearly 3 hours just to make enough pyrees to get a better mace weapon and a few peices of armor.  I wasn't playing the game the way loot was before but the way it is now, if you are a new player, it seems to take quite a while to get anything.  I think maybe they should put a little more stuff on monsters (not the way it was where people were making too much money too quick) but enough to get a decent suit of armor and a good weapon within a REASONABLE amount of time.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Truebolt</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">I agree with most of you; the way the loot is set up now is unrealistic and difficult.  <P>I personally liked the loot the way it was before, where 90% of the time you got the weapon from what you killed.<P>Many argue that it is too easy to accumulate wealth that way, but there is a purpose to having extra pyreals.<P>Mages need new components.  Archers need new arrows.  Warriors need new healing kits.<P>And if you have enough pyreals, potential vassals are always asking for a little hand out.<P>Good stuff ain't cheap, and saving ALL the pyreals you get comes in handy.  While it was a bit easier with nearly always getting the weapon off a creatures body, the pyreals didn't go to waste.  Unless you had a SoLL, you were always on the lookout for a better blade, or unless you were wearing green mire, you were always looking for better armor.  And when you couldn't ID that item, and had the spare pyreals, you bought it and tested it out.<P>Microsoft broke one of the most imporant game developers rules:<P>If it ain't broken, don't fix it.<P>Perhaps I only see things like this because I am always strapped for cash lately, but I know of many others who feel the same way.<P>Truebolt</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Flutie</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">i agree with this new system.

I've been to 3 of them and every one on the first floor has ONLY Gnawer Shreths (lvl3) and Druuge Skulkers (2).  You can earn 500+ pyrees (or stuff that will get you 500+) within 1 hour buy just bashing Gnawers and Skulkers.  The wilderness is too dangerous if you are a newbie and wander too far away (I died one time when an adult reedshark came out of nowhere and blasted me in seconds).  Rule of thumb in the wilderness for newbies is if you start seeing Druuge Prowlers, or Banderling Scouts, etc you've gone too far from town.<P>As for the Loot issue, I've actually gotten 300+pyree Necklaces from Gnawers in newbie dungeons.  Granted they are rare but it seems lots more gnawers in dungeons have 20+ pyrees .  When you get level 3 or 4, go downstairs and take on the Druuge Slinkers.  They give Maces worth 250+, and other decent weapons you can sell.  As a rule, the monsters don't give that much though.  Mostly 1 spell component and 5 or so pyrees OR a peice of FOOD.
