</FONT><HR>To Whom it may concern:<P>It has become painfully obvious that Norrath does not want craftsmen or tradesmen, or anyone that is not male, 16 years old - and whose main interest is hack and slash.<P>I am so disappointed in EQ I am not sure where to start.<P>Perhaps I should start with what I AM looking for in a virtual world.<P>I am looking for a world where:<P>a) I am not at the mercy of any idiot that wanders by that decides to take a pot shot at me - this EQ does very, very well.<P>b) Where I can involve myself in a fullbodied virtual world - one that welcomes and has room for many different types of people, and many different types of interests. This promotes the socialization and immersion into that world. EQ is in it's infancy, but it falls far short of this, and with recent changes gutting craft skills - it's headed in entirely the wrong direction.<P>c) One where there are many things to do - OTHER than hack and slash, i.e., adventuring. I had hoped as EQ matured this would become so - it's obvious that is where you want the focus to be, and that is sad. Not only does the world and society suffer from that choice, it's impossible to keep these folks entertained on a longterm basis - they get bored. Society takes care of itself, is by far the most intricate and immersive factor in a virtual world - and since it is in the hands of players and is everchanging - is not a burden on development teams.<P>Now, are there enough folks like me - that are as deeply immersed in the society side - as there are hack and slashers? Probably not enough to make a noticable dent in your bottom line. However, what you have left in a world without us is a very shallow, onesided shoot-em up with lovely graphics. <P>The lack of information coming out about changes that are made without any notice - without any consultation with the players affected speaks very poorly of customer service. It also speaks volumes about Verant's position that we are merely second class citizens and not worth the effort to address. I refuse to live in any world where my motivations to play and interact are not taken seriously.<P>To remove all profit motivations from crafts is assinine. Tradesmen and crafters are out of make a profit just like anyone else with a 'job', just like adventurers that go out, and bring back loot. Can you imagine the hue and cry that would go up if adventurers couldn't sell their bat wings and rusty axes to merchants? To say one is fine, the other is somehow 'unfair' or 'imbalancing' is once again telling craftsmen that they are an afterthought and not important. To setup crafts in the first place without having anything needed by other players is bad enough, but to remove all profit margins to NPCs is insane.<P>Economic problems that are developing within EQ have NOTHING to do with any profits craftsmen may make. It has everything to do with lack of money and item sinks ingame. It's a simple matter X items being harvested at X interval /number of players. Eventually everyone will have full rubicite, and that sword o'whoopass, it's simple mathmathics. The more common any item is, the more the price drops, that's simple economics. The amount of money in the world is really a side issue. Money in and of itself is useless. Most craftsmen *I* know, including myself - that have made some profit have plowed them right back into CRAFT skills. Money becomes useless at high levels, simply because there is nothing left to spend it on.<P>One thing Verant did very well was limiting twinking in the code. I have seen many posts from 'adventurers' that it's somehow 'not fair' for a low level player to be able to work to earn money for decent armor and a weapon. Well geeze - why not? I have seen enough twinking (and usually NOT from craftsmen, but adventurers handing things down) to know that all the armor and weapons in the world on a lowlevel character provide you with a very well dressed corpse. Instead of Verant buying into this, or having a kneejerk reaction, how about pointing this fact out to people that may not realize it?<P>Verant did a very good job (irritatingly good) of spreading things out, and making trades tedious enough that's it's not 'quick and easy' money. If someone spends that much time and money investing in learning a skill like this, they should by rights expect some return for their effort. People that cry out it's 'easy money' have quite simply not done crafts. <P>Every skill and item needs to be looked at in terms of cost of manufacture - and resale price. Every craft also needs to be looked at so that every single one of them have SOME items that can be sold to other players, that are NEEDED - and that don't take more money to manufacture than a PC can just walk up and buy from an NPC. Why should anyone buy from me, if it costs me more to manufacture an item, than they can buy it ready made from an NPC?<P>As any online world matures you have more and more of a problem with keeping your customer base. As any server matures, the economic dynamics within it change drastically. Society is the glue that keeps longterm players playing, no matter what their motivations originally are, and a real working economy will reduce the ageing dynamics a great deal and promote continued interest, vs. been there, done that - I guess I 'won', quit. Adding more item sinks will also promote the longevity of a server and an economy.<P>I believe if you took a poll of your players - the folks most interested in societal and trades related matters tend to be a bit older, more mature, focused on constructive, rather than destructive aspects of a virtual world. Perhaps you simply don't care about that segment of the playing population, perhaps your marketers have convinced the powers that be - that we simply aren't important based on our numbers. Perhaps you are only going after the shoot-em up ex-quakers out there. If this is the case, please do yourself and the gaming public a major favor and state this clearly.<P>What you will find about an older player is they tend to be a bit more dedicated and stable - and also provide a stablizing 'good' influence to the community. This is something hard to quantify, but without them, the world is a very different place.<P>Also, as a server matures, and everyone has been there, done that - has all the items they want, without a society structure - and other things to do to fall back on, to make it possible to actually 'live and breath' in a virtual world - it's done, there is nothing else to do, and no reason to stay.<P>Take all this for what it's worth. I have been involved in online communities for many, many years. In many aspects - these new virtual worlds share a lot with their predecesors - the MUDs, the BBBs, the other places that people gathered together online to socialize. I've also been involved in UO since it's beginning - and it has it's fair share of problems as well. I can tell EQ learned a great deal from UO - but EQ should not be ignoring some of the things that DID work in UO, simply for the sake of being different. <P>I have great faith in the new genre of online virtual world - I only hope someone, somewhere - will finally be able to look at the big picture, and construct a world that isn't so geared to one specific gaming demographic. Of COURSE hack and slash is a huge demographic, there is precious little for society oriented folks to get involved in, which is where online worlds will be missing a huge trick if they don't understand there is an untapped potential out there.<P>I strongly urge you to make a public statement about the direction you intend to take crafts and your position concerning nonadventurers. People like me are otherwise left up to drawing conclusions - and at the moment, they are not pretty. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/equbb/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=43&topic=000593.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Trade+Skills+in+General&TopicSubject=My+letter+to+Verant+re:+tradeskills+and+anything+non-hacknslash">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>very well written, much better than the other guy and his "F-you Verant" letter hehe<P>i have to agree and disagree with something, altho it doesn't matter really if you sent that mail off and it is just your opinion (well probably more people than just you)<P>trade skills SHOULD make a little money by selling to merchants, and more to players which would mean that every trade would need some product that people would want. I can't offer many answers on how to do it but i've posted a few here and there. But the major problem wasn't just that people were making a little money from brewing (and now pottery which is also getting nerfed MUAHAHA) but they were making a LOT of money. 20p+ an hour is just too much in my opinion. i've never made that hunting anything with either of my high teen level characters with the exception of running across a shiney brass shield or something i sold. i'm talking hunting normal critters. the only way to come close is get super lucky with the loot drops of bandits and dervs and hope for a lot of bronze or gems and even then i doubt you'll make as much as you could with some of those trade skills. <P>a more realistic method other than complete killing of brewing and pottery (check out the test server message, they are killing it too) would be to leave some small profit margin, even 5to 10p an hour, maybe a little more for HIGH end master items and a lot more involvement to master than an hour of your time and 10p would be better to me. <P>i'm not sure how to make something like Brewing a needed trade to players except to make alcohol tolerance a useful skill, which it may be i'm not sure. maybe a lot of people haven't checked it out or worked on it. <P>there must be something potters can make that people are going to need..but don't ask me what hehe<P>baking is easy. make the better foods last longer per item than an egg or a slice of bread and you'll find people looking to buy fish rolls and candied spider legs, fruit pies and other stuff<P>not really a criticism of the above letter i just wanted to add a couple comments =)<P>Rassy--Master Smith, Master brewer, average potter and baker </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/equbb/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=43&topic=000593.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Trade+Skills+in+General&TopicSubject=My+letter+to+Verant+re:+tradeskills+and+anything+non-hacknslash">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">

</FONT><HR>I must agree with you as well.  I myself like to lose myself in the trades sometimes.  One thing I liked about UO, was being able to go out and chop wood off a tree.  Simple I know, but it kept me entertained for days while I tried to increase my abilities.  <P>I must say that Verrant has really screwed their economy.  They just don't seem to understand how to make it work without performing a little hack and slash on the trades. <P>It is my opinion that they need to do two things to make their market recover.  First off, their will never be a good player economy unless they can modulate the labor!  My lord, everyone and their johnson is a smith/tailor/potter/brewer/baker master.  That just simply won't do.  And no amount of nerfing will fix it.  Nerfing will just get you a useless trade and pissed off people.  Instead, if they where to modulate how many skills you could be involved in, that would virtually fix their supply and demand issues.  Treat it sort of like the Specialization skills of the mages.  You get one skill to master, and you can have some proficiency with the others.  Now you can leave the bakers and the brewers alone.  The smiths can charge high prices for their labor, the brewers and the bakers can make money to be able to buy them.  Your economy starts to work.  <P>The second thing that needs to be added to make the economy effective, is spending.  If your tradesmen are making money and you want them to spend it...then LET them.  Make some one-use  or multi-use items and stick them in the game.  Aim it toward the lower levels so that they can make some choices and spend that trade money.  Face it, at higher levels, the economy will start to break anyway.  Your players have been around a while, they are rich, have the best armor, etc.  Unless you implement some kind of re-mort ability, then your always gonna have a bunch of rich guys hanging around.  However, the lower levels is where you want the modulation anyway.  If you give them some hard but viable choices, then you will slow their wealth accumulation, yet keep them happy.  For instance, healing potions.  Make differing powers of heals and offer them for sale.  AND I DONT MEAN FOR 50pp!!!!<BR>Be reasonable, you WANT the lower levels to spend their money.  If you make light heals available for a gold or two, then minors available for 5 or 6, etc. you can controll the money.  Players WILL buy such things.  In addition, you can make them non-stackable to hold down the amount they can buy, etc.  Lots of options and none of them will destroy your trade skills as Verrant is so avidly doing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/equbb/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=43&topic=000593.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Trade+Skills+in+General&TopicSubject=My+letter+to+Verant+re:+tradeskills+and+anything+non-hacknslash">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>Well Ras - at lvl 10 I was hunting bandits - to build a nestegg that all went into developing my crafts.<P>It was not at all uncommon for me to make 30+ plat an hour hunting them between bronze and gems. So I don't think 20plat - given the tedious nature of crafts, and the failure rate and money it takes to actually get to a point to breakeven - is all that bad at all.<P>I started my crafts with about 400plat - plowed it ALL back into learning crafts. Now, I'm still about even with the board - but that is a heck of an investment - for something that in the future will bring me back no return.<P>Adventurers that complain about loot - simply don't know where to hunt, or aren't willing to have the patience to hunt the slower richer spawns - or ones that don't also give them xp in their mad rush to attain lvl 50.<P>BTW, what the heck happens that's so fantastic at lvl 50? Do you get a cookie? Does Brad come to your house and shake your hand - or do you say you 'won' and can quit? Never quite understood that myself.<P>Oh....I did get a response to my letter, and I quote<P>"Thank you for your input. You feedback is important to us and it is forwarded to the development team.<P>One Last Note:.  If you do need additional help, please include all previous emails dealing with the problem."<P>Isn't that comforting.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/equbb/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=43&topic=000593.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Trade+Skills+in+General&TopicSubject=My+letter+to+Verant+re:+tradeskills+and+anything+non-hacknslash">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">

</FONT><HR>A serious problem which in the end will rend _ALL_ trade skills useless is the "immortal object" syndrome.<P>Once a suit of banded armor is made, it is in the game forever - it never wears out, never gets damaged and never needs repair. Once you have moved into better armor, the unused banded is either sold cheaply or<BR>migrated as a "twink" to a new character.<P>_ALL_ items, even those nifty, spiffy, onces that mobs drop have to wear out and break or else there will be no more work for blacksmiths, tailors and enchanted jewelry makers. The world will be saturated with those items.<P>For the player driven economy to really work, not only must the trades produced player desired items, but also item must age, decay and break so that money will be spent with a tradesman for new armor, repairing old armor etc.<P>               Taim</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/equbb/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=43&topic=000593.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Trade+Skills+in+General&TopicSubject=My+letter+to+Verant+re:+tradeskills+and+anything+non-hacknslash">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>You people crack me up.  You really seem to have this stupid idea that Verant gives a **** WHAT you think.  What more evidence do you need?!?!  They could'nt give a rats ass about any of us once we buy the game.  Crack dealers have more scrupples than Verant does.  This IS a hack & slash game, period!  They have proved this OVER AND OVER AND OVER again in their actions and words.  I only read these idiotic posts for exploits and cheats.  Yes, you may lable me as a "cheater" or whatever you like,  but I (like verant), couldn't give a **** what you think, BUHWHAHA!  Brewing was an exploit, so was pottery, and programming good, evil experiment, who cares what it was.  I don't care, I'm a Master Brewer, Master Potter, and now Master Smith, hehe.  So, I beat them at their own game, HA!  I made over 300pp with brewing and potting, enough to buy me tons of nifty equipment for my 13th (hehe, twinking at it's finest), and enough to fund my smithing skill, which is the only (save jewelry) trade skill that is worth a ****.  They'll probably nerf it too, oh well, I'll just find another way to exploit the system, hehe.<P>Ok, now that I have succeeded in pissing off everyone who's reading this post.  This was just a sample of what EQ has to look forward too.  I very much agree with the letter that started this thread.  I've been gaming for years, and cheating, twinking, exploiting USED to make me as sick as it does all of you.  But, what choice do we have when Verant treats us AND the game like this?  I think what's his name said it quite elogantly when he said, "**** YOU TOO VERANT!" hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/equbb/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=43&topic=000593.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Trade+Skills+in+General&TopicSubject=My+letter+to+Verant+re:+tradeskills+and+anything+non-hacknslash">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">

</FONT><HR>I suppose the comments by MasterTradesman are probably common to alot of twinkers, etc..  However, the real issue involved is that imbalances exist in the skills before they are nerfed.  Instead of just nuking the skill, an adjustment in their profitability would be more rational.  It sounds reasonable to suggest that a someone practicing trade skills should be able to generate an income somewhat similar to hack-n-slash.  Some trade skills should be more profitable than others.  <BR>Obviously, smthing should make more than fishing.  Maybe hack-n-slash will tend to make more because the player is bringing back "rare" items to be sold in the city which aren't normally produced there.  I personally believe that the only real way for the economics to work is for items to decay with use.  Otherwise, deflation will occur.  Maybe as tradesmen sell alot of a product then the price offered will go down.  Over time, the demand for the item will increase and the profit margin as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/equbb/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=43&topic=000593.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Trade+Skills+in+General&TopicSubject=My+letter+to+Verant+re:+tradeskills+and+anything+non-hacknslash">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

I sunk hundreds of plat ad no small amount of hours smithing.  I am now a master smith, and have found that I can make as much or maybe a shade less money adventuring as I can selling banded.
