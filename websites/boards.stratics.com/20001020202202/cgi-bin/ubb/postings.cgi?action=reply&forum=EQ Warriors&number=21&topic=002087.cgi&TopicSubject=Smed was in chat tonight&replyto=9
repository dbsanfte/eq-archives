 Personally I would wish that they created a new server went through found every character that has an item from a mob 10 lvl above them and put that character on it. For the most part I don't care about twinking. Truthfully I don't, but when in a full group of very low 20 character's you have 1 warrior in full crafted w/ an exe axe, 1 bard in full bright blue armor, sorry forgot the name, w/ 2 yak's and a fbss, and a sk w/ a mix of some of the best armor enamaled bp and a ssb are 2 items the rest where a mix weilding a dark reaver. I just get alittle discouraged. Not only did I feel out classed I was told by the cleric who was also fairly twinked that I was becoming a mana drain and was requested to leave the group. Right now I'm just venting, but is twinking characters that much fun? Anyhow back to topic, it's sad that even E-marr one of the least played server's is steadly getting closer to the 2000 mark during prime-time.[/B][/QUOTE]

Smed came into Chat tonight and discussed a number of issues.  The primary problem addressed was server overcrowding, specifically Fennin Ro.  He indicated that there may be a server split on FRo, that will allow players to choose one of the two to play on.  This was not set in stone but he said they hoped to address Fennin overpopulation in approximately 3 weeks.  He stated that the 2 new servers would come on line late this week or early next but did not release the names.  The crowd was very unruly with a disproportionate amount of spammers and idiots using vulgarity and slamming Verant over and over.  I'm surprised he stayed as long as he did (about 20 minutes). Although he DID NOT say there would be a split, he did aknowledge that Povar was seriously overpopulated as well. No class/race issues discussed.  <P>Kwyn</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Kutulu Valkyriur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Yeah I heard some crap about this myself. Since I now play on Lanys T'Vyl I of course dont have to worry about it, especialy since Rallos sometimes has more people on it then Lanys. Anyway, if they were to do this the only way would to have a GM see what items the player has the level etc and create a character and make him the same level and give him the items that the previous had (basicaly a character transfer which I have heard about but have no confirmation of). If they cant do something like that there will be some VERY pissed people hehe.<P>------------------<BR>--Kutulu Valkyriur,<BR>     Monk and Leader of the Downward Spiral<BR>--Zaman Kuthuleth, <BR>Troll Shaman of the Downward Spiral</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Tadar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Is Verant that blinded by a single Server they cannot see all but the PvP teams servers have topped the 1500 mark.  Last night when I played,  I decided to count the amount of people above 1500 on each server and total it up... and you know what I got?  roughly 6000 people, and this was only at 9pm est, I'm sure it went up from there.  By my calcs, they should be implementing 4 new servers... not just 1 or 2.   I play on Rodcet Nife, a relatively new server in regards to Fennin Ro, and we have already topped 1900 in a single eve.  Verants product has high demands, and I don't see why they cannot supply more servers to serve the population demands.  After all, they are getting 10 bucks a month from each of the nearly 150,000 people registered with them (I believe this is correct), so they are pulling in 1.5M monthly, I think they can afford to implement 4 or 5 new servers.  But thats just my common sense way of thinking.<P>Gravid Thornhold<BR>19th Lvl Halfling Warrior<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Kwyn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Counting the new FRo server, that would make three.  These are definitely steps in the right direction.  If the FRo split goes well, I would bet you will see other servers do the same,ie. Povar, Xegony, etc.  Smed also mentioned what I am sure will be a very unpopular opinion. They have to pace the server builds so that when EQ inevitably declines, they only have 15 servers like Vallons and Tallons sitting around with 800 people on them rather than 25 (my words not his.  Don't quote him).  He explained this in the context of trying to justify the expense of the hardware as well as the staff that must be hired for a near future need against the possibility of a future liability.  <P><BR>/rant on<BR>And just a side note, a bunch of the people in chat were truly a bunch of ignorant lamers.  Guides are not paid "your ten bucks a month!", they are volunteer players.  People who hate guides are pathetic.  At least these guides are trying to do something to enhance and help the game while most of these protesting ding dongs are trying to figure out how to get ShowEQ to work on their system.<BR>/rant off<P>Kwyn</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">slimharpo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I think this a step in the right direction. The addition of normal new servers like Lanis hasn't stopped Fennin's population from rising steadily. Last night I saw up to 2759 people on with /who count all. Lag has been getting terrible for me lately, and I've heard the same thing from many others.
