I'd just recovered from a fight with a Crocodile, and was inspecting my Langseax of the Wolves, making sure I hadn't nicked my precious little baby. I, being of the 12th Blade, was insulted by an Inkie wizard of the 12th spell. He claimed he could defeat me in a duel of honor. Being a dwarf, I gladly accepted.<P>Everyone came to watch. He was collecting energy, while I was saying "Get up, you fool! Let's get this over with!" He simply ignored me, shielded himself, meditated a bit more, and said he was ready. Upon my acceptance of the duel, he immediately rooted me. Scum! He was playing cheap. A blast of fire surrounded my body and combusted around it, searing off my leather tunic (now everyone could see my buff upper-body). The magical vines around my feet broke, and I charged into the wizard as he was chanting a spell. Boom! My Blackened Iron Boots gave him a hard, swift kick into the balls, obviously interrupting his casting. I prepared to hack large pieces out of his frail body. He was at about half life when he rooted me, and another fireball singed my beard, while yet another nearly knocked me unconcious. I was down to half life. The magical vines around my feet once again broke, and his balls once again met my boots. I hacked away at him while he ran. He managed to Shadowstep, and teleported a short distance away. I searched for him, around the dock, at the gypsie camp, and at the rock pillar in the water. I'd assumed he was meditating, regaining lost energy. I was hurt, so I sat down and began to recollect on his weak points. Suddenly out of the blue, sickles of ice were jutted into my back. I pulled them out, and saw the wizard chanting another spell. I threw a shuriken into his balls, thus interrupting his casting. He was less than a quarter life. This time he would be mine. Again my faithful Langseax of the Wolves hacked into his body, my Blackened Iron Boots repeatedly kicking his balls. At least, he was unconcious and lying there incapacitated. He said, in a half-alive voice, "It appears...you...may...have....won...." <P>"I guess I have" I said. I raised my Langseax of the Wolves, and chopped him in half. That was the end of the inkie wizard, who doubted the power of the Blade, and put his confidence into his feeble Magik.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Moe Drippins</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Nice story, and a well fought battle.<P>I have to ask, however, what was the fascination with his balls?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">xynder777</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Everyone knows that if you kick a caster's balls, his spells get interrupted</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Leadpipe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I must say, as a wizard I am completely offended by this.  You would take such a fool as this as a true wizard?  If he had been a true wizard he would never have bothered with rooting and such silly nonsense.  Ah well I suppose its not a big suprise, him being one of those lesser races.<P>btw on a side note: Why is it that every warrior i fight gets mad when I <BR>a. Shadowstep or<BR>b. Invis<BR>or something of that nature?  Im a wizard, Im meant to hit from a distance, and Im meant to stay away from melee as much as possible, Im not going to stand there and let you whack me as hard as you can unless I want to die.  Sorry but of the five or so warriors I have ever dueled, only one has understood this, so I was wondering if this was a common thing that warriors expect duels to be both people standing at close range?  I hope not, I hope I just ran into a band of fools.<P><BR>Adrianoch<BR>30th Erudite (read: perfect) Wizard</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">gald</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">When you are fighting a MOB, if you use a ranged weapon, your character moves to aim itself directly at the mob, then fires, as long as you aren't looking in completely the opposite direction.  Here's a question then, for those who might know... Does it work the same way in duels?  For instance, if a wizard were to go invis, but you still had them targetted.  If you use your range weapon, and you are facing the general direction they are standing, will it turn you towards them before it fires?  Also, does it break the invis?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Ganudan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">You will not turn to face them, but the arrow will fly to them if they are in range.  The arrows fly fast, so you have to watch where it goes to locate your opponent.  I use it all the time in duels to locate invis opponents.  It even used to break invis, but that bug was fixed.<P>Ganudan Bladestorm<BR>(retired warrior)<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Bushka</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Regarding this wiz dueling thing. NEVER do it without a decent bow(range being the important factor here) and some arrows.  If they invis and you have them targeted then simply fire off an arrow regardless of wether or not they are visible to you, your trusty bow will quickly find the finger waggling fool and stick him thus breaking invis and interupting their medding.  One other thing dont fight them round wizard spires i've lost battles before from crazy wizz's running up spires casting lev when i get up the top and running off its not even close to funny when you die falling off and loose xp though at lvl 45 which am now you can usually wear the 200hp on the chin.  Another thing if your a large race use slam to interupt and stun.  Those miserable nukers can get off a minor spell such as shadowstep quiet easily and this allows them the chance at ripping a big fireball/icestrike into you from a minimum distance, again if your far away and stuck in a root fire off an arrow its a low shot at interuppting the cast but it can work and those big spells take quiet a while to load up and land.  The key here though is that with luck and a few resists they'll go OOM before your out of hp though in my experience it tends usually to be a near thing.  When they do they'll begin to cast invis hit em with the arrow and stick close because once you get a stun and maybe 10 seconds of melee into them they are in real trouble.  One more thing make sure they are debuffed nothing worse then realising half way through that your opponent has SOW on and even worse clarity so get a shammy or the like to debuff their ass's but good )</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Everfan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Now i know i may be a little over the top here but would it hurt to get puches of ghoul power for see invis? or nullify magic potions only 15 or so pp not a big deal for high lvl tanks. just let him think you can't see him then let him sit and then proceed in opening the can. just my thought</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Sulvar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Well duels with wizards are usually very interesting.  With the changes in PvP where wizards spell only do 66% damage on you most wizards should barely have enough manna to kill an equal level warrior. This is if none of their spells are resisted or if they don't waste a lot of manna trying to root you.  The point is that if you resist a couple of spells (I love resisting the all or nothing spells like force shock) then the wizard will need to med sometime during the battle.<P>The points above about having a bow is also very very useful.  One of the best PvP bows IMO in the Carved Elm Silk Bow.  The damage is not great, but it has a delay of 39 which makes it the fastest bow in the game.  The main use of a bow in my experience has been to shoot arrows at casters to try and interrupt them when you are rooted.  Here the prime concern is firing quickly not doing tons of damage.<P>Also another tip is to dual weild some of the fastest weapons that you can find.  Unlike NPCs, PC casters are almost always interrupted when you hit them.  In order to really interrupt casters I like to use two weapons with a mismatched delay.  For example a langseax and maybe a Barbed Leather Whip.  These weapons won't swing at the same time so you will have a more constant output of swings and combined with kick or slam you will have a really good chance to interrupt.<P>------------------<BR>Gartuff Little Halfling Warrior<BR>Rarguk Orge Greenblood<BR>Utarn High Priest of Hate<BR><B><A HREF="http://www.handofevil.org" TARGET=_blank>The Hand of Evil</A></B></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Caber</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Didn't know you could get a LoW at level 12.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Avatar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Two things, <P>One:  Dwarves can only kick the groin on prone opponents, so unless there are any dwarven monks or gymnasts out there this is obviously a falsified record of events.
