[B]Wouldn't it be GREAT if every 5 levels we could go to our guildmaster and by new weapons and armor that are 15-25% better than the previous 5 levels? And wouldn't it be great if these weapons and armor only cost roughly 5pp around level 10, 15pp around level 30, 20pp at level 40 and 25pp at level 50.

Of course some of these would be random rare drops of creatures at the appropriate level. We would have to use the Blacksmith skill to combine to make our armor...in this case they would be free.

Oh...I'm really liking this idea!!![/B][/QUOTE]

We already knew that though. But how many of you high level warriors like me are almost all decked out in this "sub-par" gear?<P>The answer is probably almost all of you. Seeing as the Plane of Hate is bugged to hell, and the drops there are insanely rare compared to Fear now, what are we to do?<P>My suggestion would be for Verant to put in a "Crafted 2" quest.<P>Warriors are the class most entirely dependent on AC for our tanking abilities. I would like to see a new armor quest for high level warriors with AC less than Indicolite, but better than Crafted (Like an AC 30 BP, or AC 15-17 Arms and legs). Perhaps make them statless so that Indicolite is still an attractive reward. We need AC! The leap between Crafted and Indicolite AC is just crazily dramatic that there is no sense in not putting in something between the two.<P>But literally, we warriors are suffering under this sub-par Crafted armor. If there was a high level quest to get a new set of armor that didn't involve loitering around in the Plane of Hate, I bet every warrior would jump at the chance.<P>What do you think about this?<P>------------------<BR>Mulberry McQuaid<BR><I>50th Season Wolf of the North<BR>The Tribunal Server </I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Oorgar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">sounds like it would be a step in the right direction..<P>there's still too many disparities in abilities between melee and caster though.<P>I'd love to have new armor types and weapons that did increasing amounts of damage (or were increasingly faster) easily available from a vendor every 4 or 5 levels.  Granted the high level stuff would be quested or planar related, but hey, why don't we just do that.  Have them completely change the armor and weapon system so that warriors and the other weapon wielding tanks get *something* to look forward to other than an increase in skills and a handful of hitpoints.<P>I would love a price comparison between how much it costs a level 40 caster to buy all the purchasable spells vs how much time and money it takes a level 40 warrior to collect the components and size a suit of crafted.  Oh heck, why don't we throw in research on that mage, he's got some spells to research doesn't he?  Ok, add that time and money too.<P>Wonder who comes out ahead in that?...<P>*sigh*  sorry, rant over yet again.<P>Still though, another kind of higher level armor that can be quested sounds nice..  I'd like to say though, make the quest warrior specific and the drops lore nodrop so that the high level wizzies and druids don't camp the quest mobs for warrior parts.<P>Oorgar<P>------------------<BR><B>Grumbo</B> &lt;The Hand of Evil&gt;<BR>Troll Warrior<I> Rallos Zek </I><BR><B>Faoldubh</B> &lt;The Hand of Evil&gt;<BR>Walking Gnome Lich <I>Rallos Zek</I><P>"Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!"</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">PackMan97</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Wouldn't it be GREAT if every 5 levels we could go to our guildmaster and by new weapons and armor that are 15-25% better than the previous 5 levels?

They said crafted was 'mid-level gear'.  Well...it just seems there should be a difference between 'high-level' gear and 'level 50 gear'.  Something inbetween crafted and indicolite would fit the bill quite nicely.<P>I for one would also love to see a shield worthy for a warrior to use.  Uni shield *almost* gets there but fails with it's horribly slow delay (I could deal with the low efficiency if the delay was lower) and lack of bash.  Maybe a shield with a proc effect would be nice...  I just think it's silly that the only people really using shields are paladins...<P>Yep, the gap is there and it's huge.

Personally I'm wearing full crafted too, simply because its the best there is at lvl 50, not considering planes.<P>This is probably also the reason I stopped playing my warrior. Because after I got my dual ykeshas and fbss from some hefty guk camping there simply isnt anything left for me that doesnt take 18+ People to get. And since i'm in a relatively small guild that at best can muster one full group of 50's there basically isnt much reason to play my warrior at all. I have no intention of trying to suck up to the powerguilds on my server to try and get invited to the planes.<P>Our best bet is probably hoping that there will be some warrior armor in "the hole". But I'm not holding my breath.. Basically I'm twinking my enchanter while i wait for better days, wether or not I'll get bored before the expansion remains to be seen.<P>Rani<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Tappen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Mulberry, I agree 100%.  Bring this statement to Verant's Gameplay Forum to give it a wider audience and I'll be there supporting you.

It's already gotten some interesting ideas going.<P>I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed the disparity between our plane armor and the "mid-level" crafted. The problem is, there really is nothing better AC-wise for a high level warrior to wear in most places until they /do/ get Indicolite now. <P>In some armor locations, this isn't a bad disparity. Indicolite bracers are AC 12, crafted are 10. Crafted gauntlets are AC 12, Indicolite are 16.<P>But in most armor locations, the jump is unacceptable. Crafted BP is AC 22, Indicolite BP is AC 35. Crafted legs, arms and helm are AC 14, 12, and 14 respectively. Indicolite legs, arms and helm are AC 20 each.<P>There's a lot of room for something inbetween here. <P><P>------------------<BR>Mulberry McQuaid<BR><I>50th Season Wolf of the North<BR>The Tribunal Server </I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Taivlan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Can you post a link to the thread on the sony site.
