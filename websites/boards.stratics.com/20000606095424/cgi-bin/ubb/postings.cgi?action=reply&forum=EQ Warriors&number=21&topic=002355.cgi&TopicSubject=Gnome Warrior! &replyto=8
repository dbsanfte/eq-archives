I know they probably have the worst stats for it but I've decided to give one a try just to set my self apart from all of the ogre and troll warriors that populate the land.  Plus I love the sensation of speed you get when your only 2 feet off the ground.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/biggrin.gif"><P>Could those of you who have played a gnome warrior give me some advice placing my stat points?  Well I guess anyone can give me advice I just don't want to hear "Play a big trolly dey smash em gud" or "I be um Ogre, me gunna stan on yur hed til it pop".  I'm set on playing a Gnome so that's what I want advice on.  Of course now that I said that I'll probably get a dozen posts of "Wittle gnomies caint be warriors!  Dey tooo teeny to smash anyting real gud".  Ohh well, I'll take any info I can get.<P>So I need help on stat points, religion, and where to go once my Gnome has been created.  Personally I've always found the opportunities to make money at low lvls in Faydwer to be lacking compared to Antonica so I was thinking about shipping over to Freeport right away.<P>Any advice would be appreciated.  <BR>Thanks in advance.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Ruatha</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><I>I decided that I would like to play a gnome warrior.</I><P>Welcome to the Gemchoppers.  There's a ton of us around here.  In fact, I think we outnumber everybody but the Barbs.

Odd, but true.  Welcome to Everquest.<P><BR><I>Could those of you who have played a gnome warrior give me some advice placing my stat points?</I><P>If I had it all to do over again, I'd put 15 points into STR (to avoid encumberance) and 10 points into STA (for extra HP).  As it is, I put 15 into STR and 10 into (get this) CHA.<P>Just make sure all your stats are over 75 and you'll be fine.<P><I>Of course now that I said that I'll probably get a dozen posts of "Wittle gnomies caint be warriors! </I><P>If you'd started posting here back in August, you would have indeed seen many posts of that nature.

However, if you want the religion that gives you the biggest in-game advantage, be Agnostic.  Agnostic Gnomes can go anywhere but Grobb and Oggok.<P>As for where to go, there are plenty of XP and loot opportunities on Faydwer.  The Nybright sisters are a good source of bronze weapons during your teen levels, and there are several bandit camps throughout Faydwer.<P><P>------------------<BR>Ruatha Kneeslasher &lt;Wings of Honor&gt;<BR>39th Level Gnome Warriorette</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">PackMan97</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I think I put 10 points into STR, 10 into STA (when I thought it meant something *sigh*) and 5 into AGI.<P>I had a problem in my late teens/early 20's with the weight of small bronze...but now in full crafted with an evil eye bag my problems have pretty much gone away.

But I'd recommend adding to str and honestly wisdom. Get your wisdom over 75 would cost you 8 points and I think do wonder's for your ability to be successful at skills. Stam honestly barely effects hp. Dex helps processing weapons and crit's who know's what else. Agility help's base AC. While the bonus of higher str in combat can be argued I will say this. Unless you are really twinked and do not have to worry about the bronze age. Raise your str to carry that heavy armor. Full small bronze weigh's between 60 and 70, well maybe not that much but alot, which eats almost all of a gnome's str. <P>On any advise I'd say take advantage of your high int. Train multiple weapon skills. I would also recommend you get bullsmasher. It's a great weapon and though will probable take multiple attempts will also help your faction with your guild. But on Faydar steamfront can occupy you till around 6th then I'd recommend going to CB till around 10th and then go back home and into the mino mines. That will set you till you get duel weild and then I'd say back to CB or to the bandit's in L'fay. Eventually you will probable want to either visit Unrest or take the boat to the mainland. Unrest is real dangerous with at least at 19th things are either green, light blue or real red. Around 15th I imagine the yard trash would be good xp and give small bronze armor. Lastly I'd say anywhere between 16 and 19th oasis is great xp, but around 19th you might want to try south karana. <BR>lol, I'm going to stop now, a couple of suggestion's for hunting spots are turning into probable a bad list for pwrlvlng. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Caper</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I put all my bonus points into strength, just so that I could brag.  This is a remarkable conversation stopper, viz:<P>Caper:  "Hi!  I'm Caper, the strongest Gnome in Norrath!  What are you?"<P>Other:  "I'm...I'm...I'm taller than you are."<P>I can't say I've regretted it.  With a 95 strength I'm still often encumbered.  As I go up in levels and get some good Strength items I'll probably not notice so much.<P>The real power of warriors is in our hit points, so sometimes I wish I'd added points to Stamina.  Also, I do find myself getting stunned a lot.  Doesn't Stamina help prevent that?  Or am I creating rumors?<P>We Gnomes have some other advantages.  We can't Slam like the big boys, but we get to wear small armor which weighs less.  We get to max out all our weapons skills because we're so smart.  <P>Also, being this small, it's much easier to hide.  Thi is an important consideration if you're on a PvP server like I am.  At the bank in Kelethin I'll turn off my guild tag, walk behind the counter and sit down to do my banking.
