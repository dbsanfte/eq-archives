</FONT><HR>First things first:  This isn't an anti-twinking rant.  I used to be really irritated at twinking, but I got over it once I realized that there's a fundamental difference in the point of view between twinkers and non-twinkers.  The difference lies in the answer to the following question:<P>Does the player earn the phat lewt?  Or does the character earn it?<P>The key to understanding why the issue of twinking will never be resolved, and the key to my getting over my irritation of twinkers, was the realization that <B>there is no wrong answer to this question</B>.  Once I understood that, I stopped being bothered by twinks and twinkers except in those instances where I was competing for gear for myself with 50th level casters who wanted the gear for their twinks.  (I *do* still believe that a person's primary character should be given preference for equipment over the twinks of others.)<P>So again, this isn't an anti-twink rant.  There is no wrong answer to the question I pose above.  Thus, there is no rant.<P>What I seek instead is to further my understanding.<P>I know a lot of people who twink so that they can sail through the first 10-15 levels.  Even though I don't twink myself, I can understand this motivation.  These are people who twink a couple Langseax, a SBH, and maybe a full set of banded or a visual set of bronze.<P>What I don't understand are those who MEGA twink.  Those folks who start off a newbie warrior with the best possible equipment their 50th level primary characters can get.  I recall not too long ago some fellow posting that he'd started his warrior off with the absolute best non-plane armor he could get, 2 diamondine earrings, a Mith 2Hander (or maybe it was a Skarlon), 2 Yaks, FBSS, TBB, and so forth, and so on.  His Level 1 Warrior was decked out in gear the listing of which looked a great deal like my wish list for the next 11 levels.<P>And as I read down his list of items that he'd twinked over, I found myself thinking "Jeez, what does this guy have to look forward to?"  I mean, for me, the journey is at least as much fun as the destination.  Having two EBWs is neat.  GETTING two EBWs was even neater.  I felt a real sense of pride, elation and accomplishment when I got my first EBW, and I was equally thrilled when I got my second.  If someone had just handed me two EBWs (assuming that they were tradable items) at 1st level, it wouldn't have been as fun or as exciting as it was to get 'em myself.<P>So I'm curious:  For those of you who megatwink full suits of crafted, Mith 2handers, etc etc...  What's in it for you?  What do you have to look forward to over the next 50 levels?  Where do you derive the majority of your enjoyment from the game?<P>None of these questions are meant to be facetious or sarcastic, btw.  I really am interested in hearing from some of the folks that really twink up their characters.<P><BR>------------------<BR>Ruatha Kneeslasher &lt;Wings of Honor&gt;<BR>39th Level Gnome Warriorette<BR>(Feeling philosophical today)<p>[This message has been edited by Ruatha (edited February 09, 2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>hmmm... I twink to a limited degree.. basically I give loot I can't sell to lwoer players...<P>My necro has been 17th level since June, now she has a staff of writhing, Robe of Enshroudment, 4 int earrings, BI amulet, savants cap, PBBs, etc... basically junk I had in the bank that wasn't worth the effort to sell 4K pp in the bank to, why do I care if I can get 100pp for a PBB?<P>Anyhow, now that I am getitng into higher levels I see competition for gear between me and a group member's Twink. I have said on this board before, it is my position that any loot dropped should go to the person who could use it first (and I mean their primary character)<P>What I imagine when I hear about the guy you mention with 50th level non-planes gear on his newbie-twink I wonder about the poor tanks in the groups this caster was in. They lost rolls against this guy on a mith 2 hander and are probably still wielding an exe axe. (ignore the fact that until 20th level, duel langseaxes are gonna outdamage that mith  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/tongue.gif"> )<P>/em cries<P>I twink my necro for (you won't believe it) RP reasons... the highest members of our guild twink our little evil pets and formed a guld to go to war against the younger members. It gives the higher levels something more interesting to do than Evercamp and keeps the lower levels interested/excited/on their toes...<P>We don't want to spend all our time on our evil twinks, so we give them good gear to help them keep up...<P>Just my rambling thoughts on the topic, perhaps later I will make a coherent post on the subject.<P>[Kupa still in a posting frenzy]<P>------------------<BR>Kupa FrostHeart<BR>38th Barbarian Warrior<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>I have asked the same question. I fall into that thrid catigory of play: Twinks a little to powerlevel all the faster out of the lower levels. And I do wonder what these super twinks have to look forward to. The other great (and inadvertant source) of twinkage for my alts is friends. High level charicters seem to have amazing amounts of crap floating around to give out to friends.<P>I twink Prann (17th gnome wizard) with a couple of items (and only one visible one) and have since then been upgraded from apprentice rob to FBR to a Green Drap to Orical robe. Most of these were spontaniously offered to me. It is funny.<P>Even alts I start who  will not twink get twinked. Have an Erudis paladin who showed a high level ranger where the gem shop was (so she could get her quest armor greeves) who as a member of a friends guild. I did not tell her this. I made 20 plat bringing her to the gem merchant because she figured I saved her 2 hours.<P>Playing a different alt in West Common Lands as a 6th mage. I get a tell from a 50th warrior (I knew him too) who had just returned from a trip to SolA. I got a free Mithril Quill. <P>Wish my alts would stop taking up all my luck and let Kailyn get some planear armor.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">

</FONT><HR>Well, I figure I'm in a fairly good position to help answer this, as the folk I've been grouping with regularly lately are twinked to the extreme. I'm talking mith arms and legs, the occasional piece of dragon loot (koshis mostly since other stuff is still used on primaries), crafted, rubicite, lava pendants, ykeshas, EBWs, haste sashes, whatever you can think of to get from the main plane of Norrath. <P>Their reason: The game is more fun for them when they can just burn through levels with almost no downtime. If they can spend time with their primary characters getting these items, and have their secondaries benefit, then that's what they'll do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>I'd rather group with a level 20 twink in level 50 gear then a level 50 in 20gear... Twinks not only help themselves level easy, but when you group with them you are gettin a free ride almost. Nothin is more enjoyable then killing somethin you know you probly would never kill at your level even in a full group equip'd with gear for your level.<P>Personally, I love twinks. Sure they get ya depressed when they have 'dragon loot' on a level 6 but oh well, they musta have earned that one piece some fashion.<P>If verant was smart, they should MODIFY newbie zones to compensate for the newbie twinks, NO not on NEWER servers. BUT on servers that are 1 year old, USUALLY people just starting out on EQ will join a new server or one if a friend is on that one.

</FONT><HR>I don't particularly agree with changing the levels of mobs already in the game, but it'd be sure nice if they would spawn faster. Even a mega twink won't perform more than a few levels higher than their actual level, but they can mow down blues in a hurry.<P>It's a lot of fun grouping with them, and since I've known a few of the guys for years (pre-EQ) they've hooked me up somewhat, so at least I'm not the bronze wonder anymore. I do feel like I'm almost slowing down their leveling at times, when I look at the damage output from my silvery/langseax combo compared to their hasted yaks/EBWs, but overall it's a blast.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">

</FONT><HR>I'm not in it for the equipment.  So, I was never really "looking forward" to anything gear-wise.  I'm looking forward to getting in some of the nastiest most dangerous places and busting heads and having a great time.  If you're in it for equipment and <B>not</B> the excitement of the game, I suggest you re-think matters.  <P>I've played my wizard to 47th level.  My first EQ char was a warrior, he made it to 16th before I realized the disparity between casters and melee classes.  That's when I started my wiz.  Now, my wiz is almost 50th, my addiction to EQ is wanning(sp?) and I needed something to help me enjoy the game again.  So, I twinked out a new warrior with crafted and some nice weapons (LoW, Langs, and Kilij).  Now, he kicks ass as a 14th DE warrior.  I can't wait until he's 25th and I can start in CT, then onto LGuk and Sol B.  I envy high level warriors who can stand there and take a beating from multiple mobs and kick some heads.    <P>Andy <B>paid</B> cash for all of Svol's (my twink) gear.  I did not quest for any of it, except the Kilij.  I paid someone else who had the items obscene amounts of plat for them.  So, no one was "hurt".   <P>I'm a warrior at heart I guess.  I twinked him because I could, so sue me.  If anyone is jealous of the gear my twink has, it's <B>they</B> that has the problem, not me.  <P>My answer to the question, "who earned the loot, the player or the character?", is <B>I'm</B> the poor sap that sat in front of that monitor for 50+ days to accumulate all that whelth, and <B>I</B> will spend it however I wish thank you very much.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">

</FONT><HR>I think the main answer on why people twink is because they have the time to do so. After about 3 weeks of logging on Grimdar and finding nothing to do, I decide I needed to find something else to do to keep the game fun and interesting.<P>My twink started out pretty basic: A set of bronze armor, cracked darkwood shield, some dervish rings, and a Gladius sword. However, once I got up there in levels, (around 15-20) I realized that having an alt character gave my PRIMARY character something to do. I.e. more goals & more advancement - The main reason we all play this game.<P>Now my Paladin has a full set of Ro armor (minus BP and helm - I use Mithril BP and SSB). It took me around 2 months to collect all this armor and I did it almost all by myself (had to borrow and Erudite wizard's char to do the Bracer quest due to faction). I am VERY proud of this armor. I got a sense of accomplishment when I forged it and gave it to my Paladin. Everything else my Paladin has was either earned by me or gifted by someone who I have helped in the past (my GB for example was a gift from a lvl 50 Paladin that I helped get a Mith 2h). The misc. items I have mostly collected with good luck and / or cash. (all the Plat jewelry for example, was purchased by me) I have NEVER done any of the following for my secondary:<P>1) Lotto'ed for item that someone else in the group needed so that I could use it to twink<BR>2) Taken a camp from someone for the specific intent of twinking<P>I enjoy playing my twinked Paladin. It's also a source of fun role playing. I RP my Paladin as the Daughter of Grimdar Hillmover. (same last name). When people ask "Wow how'd you get all that stuff" I tell them, "My father got it for me". I also spend a lot of time talking with other Paladins trying to do Ro armor quests, helping them with spawn times / locations / levels, etc. (a side note on the Hillmover clan- there are now 7 total Hillmover's on Rodcet Nife. If there are any budding Dwarfs out there interested in sharing in the glory of the Hillmover Clan , give me a tell in game. heh)<P>So, the end reason of why I twink: I have the time to do so (you wouldn't believe the spawn times on the Paladin armor quests), it gave my Primary character "something to achieve", and I take great pride in the items I *earned* for my twink. I got just as much a sense of accomplishment forging that first piece of Ro armor as I did the day I was the first on Rodcet to turn in the fangs for the EBW quest.<P>Grimdar Hillmover, 50th Warrior of Brell<BR>Dandolina Hillmover, 35th Paladin of Brell and Daughter of Grimdar (and named after her fathers life friend, Dandain Soulforge)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000010&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>I twinked a warrior with full crafted and 4 or five mid- level weapons.  <P>I quested for all of the crafted and 1 of the weapons.  Hey I like the quests.  I am currently starting on the bard quest armor now.  All other items where purchased or open camps (collar of undead protection).<P>Besides giving me another goal with my  primary (48 druid), there is a sense of enjoyment playing with a powerful character (relative to level).  I actually play these games to build characters (power /equipment /level) not to roleplay.  Its the building process that I enjoy, but I view my account as the whole and not on a character by character basis.<P>You will not find groups that take items away from people they group with all the time.  (ie wizard taking a yak from a warrior they group with 24/7)  In a random group of strangers its probably another story.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>-Seeing how my Warrior is my main character and is always in search of his own equipment and never really has any serious cash. I do not think that excessive twinking is an option for me. I did give my Ringmail Tunic to my Shaman which allowed him to save money to buy banded by lvl 12, hes now lvl 16 and still in the banded. As the Shaman I healed and buffed some higher level people who were hunting evil eyes while I was exploring the areas in and around RunnyEye they gave me a BIMedalion. I still do not have all my Spells, though <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/frown.gif">. I later traded a Shiny Brass Sheild for a Gossimer robe with the intent on selling it. Not getting any buyers for it right off I banked it and went about my business, after restarting my Gnome Wizard again I realized I liked to play him so upon reaching lvl 6 gave him a Gossimer Robe which allowed him to scrape up enough cash for food and spells he needed.(Still do not have all the spells but I am close to getting them all for each level, man are they expensive.). My Monk was given a Lockjaw Tunic out of the blue by some high level Paladin this allowed me to forego having to buy or make him any other armor allowing him to save cash for Wu's Gauntlets and the Freedom to complete many of the different Sash and Headband Quests, hes only lvl 6. My Paladin was given a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic when he died trying to save some fellow on Orc Hill in G.Fay. He was also given a FS Hammer and a Dwarven Axe by another player while travelling in East Commmons. This allowed my Dwarf to buy Full Visible Bronze(which is unbelieveably cheap in G.Fay) by lvl 9 which in turn allowed me to save money for the weapons I sold to get the bronze and still have money for all his lvl 9 spells.<BR>-As for Mega-Twinking I never really considered doing that and like I said its not really an option for me. I enjoy grouping with twinks because they tend not to loot at the lower levels which means more for me. What I do not like is grouping with a Mega-Twink that brags constantly about his gear and tells me my stuff is crap and then offers suggestions on what I should get but that more of a personality thing than a game thing. My opinion is people twink because they can.<P>------------------<BR>On the Cazic Thule Server<BR>*Kernan MacFenrirson&lt;Golden Order of Dragons&gt;28th Rank of the Wolves,Naked LongWalk Hating Weilder of the LangSeax."For Halas and Glory!

</FONT><HR>What I love to see is when someone super twinks, but for like a warrior they give him all of the Stat increasing instead of the AC items. And then say that AC is over rated. Hehehe... Twinking I can understand, banded, bronze, its all over might as well get some... crafted unfortunatly is just as prevelent if not more sometimes then bronze... heck on mithaniel marr not having full bronze non twinked before level 10 is considered bad armour. Everyone I know on mith marr twinks, or is twinked. I had a level 20 cleric friend who fried his character just to twink his necro. He has never experienced not being twinked... when he first started I gave him a full suit of leather... then the higher levels in my guild gave him stuff... He has a pugius for his enchanter, FBR, and other stuff, He has never known the experience of not being twinked. And now in order for me to get him to come over to Lanys Im probably gunna have to help twink him some how. Some people just don't know life outside of twink hood. Which is kind of sad. Me I love the advantage my warrior had with a full bronze... and a langseax, then when I got him some crafted life was a breaze... But it was no where as fun to me as being a newbie, when I had to fend for my own, the feeling of actualy dieing. It is the only reason why I re-make my characters ever.<P>------------------<BR>--Kutulu Valkyriur,<BR>     Monk and Leader of the Downward Spiral<BR>--Zaman Kuthuleth, <BR>Troll Shaman of the Downward Spiral</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>Almost all twinks are secondary or more characters of a guy who played it the hard way with his main (starting from scratch like everyone did at the time they bought the game).

I began with my warrior in full bronze at lvl 8 (did 1 to 7 like a newcomer to my server only to be sure to keep all the basic skills maxed) then added full crafted at 20.

</FONT><HR>Well... I have played a druid since Beta Phase 3.  I soloed alot and realized how much quicker I was at leveling past my friends.  So, one day, at the coffee shop, the topic of EQ came up.  They were complaining that now they are in their lower 30's, it is becoming harder and harder for their group tank <I>(A rogue)</I> to tank everything.  So asked for a week of play time to collect some twinking material and I will create a warrior.<P>I collected an Exec Axe, a full suit of Crafted, Silver War Axe, a Unicorn Shield, an EE bag and gave it all to my newbie warrior.  Then, my friends spend 3.25 days of RL time as recorded by EQ, and took my warrior from Level 1 to Level 28.  So I was twinked rather hard.<P>Now, I am level 31 and all my friends are L35ish.  But I can adventure with them and have a ball.  No more soloing. I can just log in, look for them, and ravage CT.  I even retired my Druid and use her strictly for group TPs when needed.  I even traded away my MANASTONE for 2 Yaks and 2 FBSS.<P>I twinked in order to optain an acceptable level to adventure with my friends.  Now, I am roughly there level...Character-wise and equipment-wise.<P>I did not twink because I can...I twinked in order to have funwith my friends.  In my book, that is a HUGE difference.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000022&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>I've seen level 20s and below in full crafted and it's sorta sad to me.  Hell, I was in ringmail until early 20s, full bronze until early 30s and full crafted by Mid 30's.  Every piece I earned and am proud of.  Well, I was given a LoW by a fellow gnome warrior higher than me.  Some twinking is ok and can be fun, but Mega twinking would not be so much fun to me.  It would be like using Clipping Mode to get thru locked doors in Quake; fun for a bit, but makeing the game boring fast.  I would need the incentive of getting those hard items when my character can do it for themselves at their appropiate level.  Helps keep interest in the game for me.<P>Kilkin Cobblepot - 40th Gemchopper - Fen Ro  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000026&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>Bottom line..  If it wasnt bought from EvilEbay <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/mad.gif"> , then it was "earned"(traded/quested/begged/borrowed/or even stolen)! My primay char is a lvl 22 Barb from Halas: Sollex Iceblood(Tunare). He is doing pertty good for that lvl. A couple of crafted peices(Gaunts, bracers) etc.. nothing very outlandish like a Yk or the like. Still using my 2 Quested Langs...<BR> I have a big problem with higher lvl players muscleing in on items for later Sale on EBay! Or buying 5000 plat and driving up the prices for good items on the server. Other than that, I dont have a problem with players being thier own SugarDaddies. Or friends lending the occasional "helping" hand. If your not having fun..

</FONT><HR><BR> My 2 cents. Arek is my second dwarven warrior. My first I took to 12th and then moved to another state and lost access to my former roommate's account. When I got my own I retrieved all of my former characters things and wore them begining around lvl 6. From 6th to 12th I suppose I was twinked. I was wearing almost all metal armor, mostly ringmail or banded, and had a mino axe and shield. Now Arek is 22nd and I have 3 other characters on the same server. All of which have benefited from Arek's adventures.<P>Mishka a 6th lvl barbarian which was started to compare barb's verse dwarves was given almost a full suit of ringmail a dwarven 2h axe and a gls. I also gave him blackened iron shoulderpads. The ringmail I recieved in loot at HH the axe I got in CB and the GLS took me about 20 minutes to get in w-commons. The pads, simple they are magical and I bought them for 10 plat. I liked the axe when I got it, but at the time I had already gotten a SBH which Arek still uses. I didn't want to sell it, so. The armor, well it's better then PW which was what he was wearing, and the light stone simple because I hate being blind.<P>Vykos I made about the same time the other officer's in my guild made inkies. They twinked out casters mostly, but I desided to continue as a warrior. Well to be perfectly honest, I didn't like dieing in a fight to a snake. He currently has a mix of leather and banded and weilds a mino axe. <P>Keldare, my newest character is a dwarven cleric. I made him as my first attempt as a caster. I gave him 10 plat and a bloodforge hammer upon conception. The money went to his 1st and 5th lvl spells and the hammer because Arek quested and aquired it and at this point I really do not feel like training 2hb from a 1 to masters. Though I think it is a cool weapon.<P>All this considered I suppose I fall into the twink new characters to get out of the 10th and under level's. Though about mega twinks. I have 2 strong opinions. 1 is a combination of jealousy and annoyance at people who con blue or green to me having better gear. I agree w/ Ruatha in that mega twinking characters doen't make sense for me. But my other opinion about mega twinks is more jaded. I've noticed ppl state that w/ their twinks they don't bother looting. That I understand, but.<P> I haven't met a mega twink that has been well composed as to there gear and abilities. I also haven't met one that has opt'ed not to lotto for loot either. Last time I was in HH I was in a group w/ 2 other guildmates and the only reason my mate got her sbh is I gave her my role for it, my other partner has a LoW so didn't want it. The only other person competing for it was a guy weilding a silvery war axe. He insisted on roling for it.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>Massanas: No, I would most certainly disclude myself from any randoms for my secondary, I'm not that bad of a twinker.  If it's rare enough to have to be raffled, then that char needs to earn it.  If my secondary didn't risk life and limb for such a rare item, then he doesn't get it.  However, if I can <B>buy</B> it from someone, that's another story.   As it is, my twink doesn't loot at all. He's only 15th though, I've never seen anyone raffle off some gator meat, lol.

</FONT><HR>This is an interesting topic. I for one don't really twink my new characters until they reach level 15. If I had tried twinking every new character I have made and deleted before level 10 I would be so poor it wouldn't be funny.<P>Murn my baby warrior started out with a few pieces of leather and a Fine steel weapon. I upgraded him to ring and such at 10 and then at 15 I kind of got wild.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> Now at 17th he has all crafted except for the breastplate and wields demon claws and a silvery war axe. <P>The main reason I even started him is that as many people point out, the warrior is in the thick of the battle the whole time.  I was getting depressed in Hell #1 with my druid when I created Murn. So I started doing the crafted quests to get some xp and started thinking about actually using the armor for something. It is all history from then on.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>Delphia Cernunnos<BR>Halfling Druid<BR>Bristlebane<P>Murn<BR>Ogre Warrior<BR>Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000030&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR><BR>I think many of the people that mega-twink aren't starting a new character because they want to start over.  Rather, I think they start a new character because, having gotten to 50th, they look around at the people they're grouping with and think, "Hey, I'd like to try that."<P>And when they say they want to try that, they mean they want to be that class at *50th* level... not levels 1-49.  So, in the interests of getting there as quickly as possible they load up their new character with everything the can find, and get them to 50th as fast as possible.<P>Personally, I don't like this in the least.  First of all, I find it belittles the effort those of us that are working on our *first* character are doing, particularly when someone throws together a twink that's identical to us.  I made my Wood Elf Warrior way back in April when there were only 2 others on the server that I knew of.  8 months later, I swear every 50th level out there had made one, outfitted them in better gear than I had, and powerlevelled them.<P>Secondly, I'm sure everyone's aware (at least on the older servers) of how bad the begging problem has become.  You can't stick your head in Greater Faydark anymore without getting spammed by /tells asking for money and equipment.  While I despise begging, I think a lot of it has to do with new players who are working on their first character having to group with the twinks of 50th levels.  It has to be disheartening when you're trying to throw together the money to buy a piece of bronze plate, and the warrior next to you is dual wielding Ykeshas.<P><BR>Cauldyth Arranen<BR>Wood Elf Warrior<BR>Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000031&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">

</FONT><HR>I have a moderately twinked Warrior now at lev 13, so the mobs are catching up to me now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/frown.gif">  I did it because I had a lot gifted to me, so I added some other minor items like a Collar of Undead Protection, Langseaxes, and bronze.  But I actually did it because I like how charactors look in plate armor, as most ppl are.  But let's face it, being able to feel superior to mobs for as long as possible is good.  Because at level 20 and up, not to mention the later levels, you are getting slapped around like a new-borns butt by blues, and greens sometimes.  So the feeling, however brief, of superiority over the MOBS and not other players is what drives me to do it.  I still twink a little when the opportunity arrives, but my primary is only 26 so even that isn't much compared to the lev 50's out there.<P>Warell<BR>Emerald Warrior 13 cycles on Norrath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002385.cgi&ReplyNum=000032&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Why+do+folks+MEGA+twink|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>I have a level 12 Troll in full crafted except for the helm which is a SSB. He also has a jagged band which I happened to have in the bank. His weapons are an FS 2Hander, an FS Scimitar and the Lamentation sword from Kedge (which is slow as hell but at least it works against magical and I was given this as a gift)and he has a Shiny Brass Shield.<P>In the next week I will be getting a Silvery War axe and Bladed Thulian Claws for when he begins to dual wield. I am also going to give him a BE Mace to train 1H Blunt and upgraded jewelry and resist gear.<P>I did it basically for the reasons stated by Cauldyth (think it was him). I like the class but I really do not feel that I need to fight rats as part of my growth as a warrior. <P>I think standing next to and behind great warriors while fighting dragons or trains in PoH or PoF has taught me a few things about the class. I also have quite a few level 50 warrior friends who have taught me a great deal about the class.<P>Is this the best way to go from 1 to 25 as a warrior? <P>Maybe not, but it is the way that I will go from 1 to 25 and I have every intention of being a competent warrior.<P><P>------------------<BR>Saumerez<BR>Magician 50<BR>Warrior 12<BR>Cleric 10<P><I>Don't think of it as corpse recovery.
