I love playing warriors, in just about any game.  Always have, always will.  And I <B>loved</B> playing Dmitri.  I had a good friend who started playing at the same time and he made up a Barbarian Shaman and we had a great time.  I dabbled in other characters, but I just had too much fun teaming up with my buddy, running around exploring the world.<P>Then my friend had to drop out of the game, and I found that trying to solo a 16th lvl Warrior was a huge pain.  And I got another friend to play, but of course he was 1st lvl.  So I put Dmitri on hold and made up a Mage to play along side him.  And found I loved playing a Mage as well.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> <P>Now it is 35 lvls later ( I am really a one character type of guy, so since I was having a lot of fun as Balo, I stuck with him) and I am getting a hankering to play my Warrior again.  So I am bringing my naked (I sold all of the warriors stuff at one point to give my Mage a boost) Warrior out of mothballs, and I need to re-equip him.  And I am looking for advice as to what is good equipment to get.<P>[Yes, I am going to Twink him ... he is naked after all.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">  And if I am going to give him equipment, I am going to give him nice equipment.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> ]<P>I am looking for things a 35th lvl character can get his hands on (I am a Mage, but I have friends how will help).  I have already bankrupt my Mage by doing some of the Crafted Quests, so I am not so much looking for things to buy as much as looking for things I can go get.  If I remember correctly, Dmitri focused in 1HS, so I will be equipping him with those (unless it is a foolish way to go).  I have been thinking of getting a PGT and a Silvery Axe, but am looking for any advice that I can get.<P>Do I focus on AC or attribute bonuses?  If attributes, which ones?  Is there any armor items other than Crafted that are really worth while?  BIC?  BS Mantle?  Is it ok to stick with 1HS?  Or should I switch to 2HS?<P>I am not looking to super twink Dmitri (I don't have the resources to do that anyway  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> ), but I would like to equip him as best I can and get him out and rolling again.<P>Any advice would be appreciated.<P>------------------<BR>Balo Lafarceur - 35th lvl Gnome Mage<BR>Dmitri - 16th lvl Barbarian Warrior (fresh out of cold storage)<BR>Allies of Honor<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Ranuk</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">You want AC<BR>honestly, unless you're gonna put him in bronze armor..

Experiment with your Helm and Shoulder pieces you may find that you want for than one item for different jobs. Depending on your faction you might be able to swing the Hero Bracer quest as well.<BR>-An easy item to get if you win the random roll(which I havent yet) is the Lizard Scale Cloak. You can get it off the named MOB in Cazic-Thules LTR. Its AC8 DEX+5 and very lite wgt compared to Bronze which has the same AC but considerably more wgt. There are lots of other Back items but this is the one I am currently trying for.<BR>-The Jagged Bands, Thick Leather Apron, and the Skull Shaped Barbute are very inexpensive and very nice items.<P>------------------<BR>On the Cazic Thule Server<BR>*Kernan Fenrirson Barbarian Warrior,27th Rank of the Wolves,Naked LongWalk Hating Weilder of the LangSeax."For Halas and Glory!

As weapons, dont even buy langseaxes, do the quest yourself, its a peice of cake for your level. Bladed thulian claw might work with its nice damage. Armour go definatly crafted if you can, other then that rubi or bronze if you can get your hands on some (look for nice deals from friends and guildmates on rubi), a good friend of mine from another game let me borrow his leggins boots and vambs and said he was willing to sell them at a nice cheep price of similar to crafted. that is of course if you play a rubi server. bartute and some others can be placed instead of crafted. large steal kilt is also always nice it has even a higher AC then crafted so. But go AC, it is almost proven to be the better over stat enhancers.<P>------------------<BR>--Kutulu Valkyriur,<BR>     Monk and Leader of the Downward Spiral<BR>--Zaman Kuthuleth, <BR>Troll Shaman of the Downward Spiral</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Immudan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Don't bother with the PGT.  It is relatively slow and the damage shield it procs is pretty useless after about level 20.  You'd be better off with a Dragoon Dirk or a Langesaxe.  Silvery War Axe is a slightly better 1hs.  You can't get 2 because they're lore.  Other good options within reach would be an Ashenwood Short Spear or an Enamelled Black Mace.<P>As for armor, other than a few exceptions go for crafted.  Head, chest, wrist, and shoulders are the only pieces I see any debate against crafted (SSB, EB BP, Hero Bracer, Carnal Pauldruns being the favorite counterparts).  Oh yeah, don't tell your priest, but your true god is AC  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>Your warrior will be better off with 1 handed weapons til he hits 20 (bye bye damage cap).  Then he'll be better off with 2 handed til about 30 (off hand weapon starts getting double attack).  Then it's a toss up that depends on the weapons.  A good choice for a 16 warrior would be a Langesaxe of the Wolves or equivalent.<P>------------------<BR>Khumak - 43 Ogre Warrior<BR>Hasima - 8 Dark Elf Necro<BR>Immudan - 11 Erudite Wizard<BR>(Rodcet Nife)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Balo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Thank you all very much!<P>I have the the resources to get some nice equipment for my warrior, but as a Mage, I was unsure where those resources were best focused.

A couple of you said that I should not bother with it.  Is that because of it's cost vs. it's value?  Because I already have one (when I retired my warrior, I loaned mine to a friend, and I can get it back at any time, since he is not using it any more).  <P>I had been looking at using the PGT in combination with a Silvery Axe.  Do you think it would be better to go with a Silvery Axe/langseaxe combination, or the PGT/Silvery, since I already have one?<P>Thanks again.

They're fast so you'll fairly easily max both 1hs and pierce.  <P>The PGT is good until about level 20 or so but the higher your level, the less useful it becomes.  The damage shield is relatively small and you take an AGI hit for it.  Plus it's slower than a langesaxe or equivalent.  As mobs start doing more and more damage, the PGT proc becomes a liability because of the AGI hit and the difference in delay becomes more important.<P>------------------<BR>Khumak - 44 Ogre Warrior<BR>Hasima - 8 Dark Elf Necro<BR>Immudan - 11 Erudite Wizard<BR>(Rodcet Nife)</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
