As Ruatha says, it depends on the situation.  With heavy nukers in the group, you won't do much damage relatively speaking.  Instead, you'll just keep the mob occupied so they can burn it down.  Unfortunately, then you're left with long, boring downtimes while they recharge their batteries.

Personally, I prefer melee heavy groups for the most part.  We can deal significant damage, at not cost in downtime.  Throw in a high level enchanter for SLTW or Aug, and you'll be tearing into critters just fine.

Stormbeard also raises a good point.  During your first 45 or so levels, you'll be fighting creatures that can be meleed or nuked.  But once you start hunting in the planes, or even Swirlspines in Kedge Keep, you'll be running into things that are almost completely immune to magic.  When a Spite Golem, Cleric of Innoruuk, or the Maestro is pulled in Hate, those are when you'll shine.  I love it when the Maestro is pulled, and the leader of the raid shouts "This is a melee-only show!  Everyone else get in the corner and hide!"  Makes you feel useful.  The same applies to Spite Golems.  The only damaging spells that can get past their incredibly high Magic Resistance are Shaman/Necro DoTs, and those require a lot of work to get them to stick.  You're wizards will be sitting in the corner doing nothing.

Is this true?</I><P>Erm.  Yes and no.<P>The strength of a warrior lies in the ability to consistenly do comparatively small amounts of damage every few seconds *and* to have the HP and AC to give him/her the time necessary for these seconds to pile up and add up into large amounts of damage.<P>In other words, I *can* do the same amount of damage to a MOB as can a Wizard can with Ice Comet (~1200 points of damage).  I just need more time to do it, and my AC and my HP help to give me this time.<P>If you're a warrior that's constantly grouped with Casters (i.e INT casters), you will not be accounting for much of the damage being done to the MOB.  Your job is to keep the MOB off the Casters (and other party members) and keep them focused on you.  In this role, you're more of a damage sponge than a damage dealer.<P>However, it's also possible to play in groups without Casters.  I very rarely play with an INT caster in my group.  My guild only has one INT caster (a Wizard).  My usual groups are made up of some combination of Tanks and Healers.  Very often it's me, a Druid, a Ranger, a Paladin, and two Clerics.  Sometimes it's me, the Druid, either the Ranger or the Paladin, and *three* Clerics.  In these cases, the Warrior (or, more broadly, the tanks of the group in general) *do* become the primary source of damage against the MOB, unless we're fighting Undead.<P><BR><I>Do warriors not do decent amounts of damage?</I><P>If they have the time to do so, yes, they can put out a lot of damage.  If their group has Casters in it, then they may not have this time as the Casters will drop the MOBs fastern than they would drop otherwise.<P><BR><I>Do warriors just look good while the casters do all the damage?</I><P>See above.<P><BR><I>Also is the life of a warrior boring at all with no spells, not being able to bind anywhere, basicaly haveing very lil variety?</I><P>Nobody can answer that question but you, because only YOU know how important it is to you to have spells and variety and such.<P>Personally, however, I gave up a 21st level Magician to play a Warrior, and I've never regretted it.  Being a Warrior gives you an inside track to being the tactical leader in combat, and we REALLY shine in any sort of multi-MOB situation.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Ruatha Kneeslasher &lt;Wings of Honor&gt;<BR>40th Level Gnome Warriorette<BR><I>That which does not kill me jolly well won't be getting a second chance.</I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Stormbeard</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I joined my guild in POH last night late and just as I and another cleric arrived a spite golem ran in.

The other night in Lake Rathe at spawn 3 I was grouped with a druid and a "grously twinked" paladin, btw his term not mine. When the paly was about to log he made a big deal about looking for another player. After about 3 minutes I told him it was ok and he split. Well the druid was 20th and I was 22nd. The birds range from 16 to 20th lvl. We tried them just the 2 of us a few different ways. What honestly worked best. Simple me with skin like stone, strength and thornshield dual weilding my bullsmasher and lang. His job, provide the buffs 1 swarm per bird and heal. Generally 1-2 during the fight and alot after. I started in the middle and went to town. The fight lasted almost always for within 10 seconds of the thorns and we where never in danger of dieing. BTW my stats buffed AC 506 att 516 and HP 770, my str was 124 dex 97 and agil 101 stam was 100. I generally ended the fight with pleanty of stamina left. Except the first time when I went into the fight with my sbh. One added note, during that first fight I did frenzy and crippled the avo guard for 47 points with bullsmasher a damage 6 weapon. At the time I think my str was 109.<P>I agree with the above poster.
