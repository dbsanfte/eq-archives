You'll need to find a place that has handy pets close to the foes you want to fight. 

And charisma really does make a difference. [/B][/QUOTE]

First of all I admit I am not an expert, I go by what I think is right and try to find the best way to combine my spells to be effective when soloing or in a group. Here goes.<P>I never really bothered trying to get the first spell befriend animal. I saw a fellow druid use it, but he didn't seem too successful utilizing the spell.  I thought it was neat and went and bought the spell.  But again never used it for about a week afterwards.  I was in a group with my Shaman(one of my dozen characters) and we had an enchanter in the group charming Cutthroat Dervishes and using them to slay their own kind.  I though, "woah cool!" so I have used it to solo in the Oasis with crocs.  Of course the befriend animal didn't work well unless used on a mid to low blue or green.  No biggie it was useful and allowed me to nuke and melee without doing a full mana burn using kiting(which I hate cause even medding i hate waiting for mana regeneration).  But it pretty much became more of a humor thing.  Apparently this spell line isn't used often cause practically everytime i used it to fight caimans versus dw caimans people would run up and say things like, "Never saw that before," or, "Wonder how that happenned?" not knowing that it was me. Someone even called me weird but he was getting flamed most of the evening in the zone so I assume he was either a jerk or stupid. Once while fighting a rather powerful aviak in South Karana i saw an elephant wonder by and turned, befriended and had it helping for some really nice goring damage, and I heard a party member go, "WTF!?!"  It is useful and really funny when you hear an elephant, "Yes master sitting down now." or something.<P>Anywho my questions are as follow.  First are the higher level charm spells that much better(which takes a larger mana usage) than befriend animal?  And the second question is this :<P>I know that a few casters can summon pets, if they are soloing they take an exp cut because they are using the pet(like losing half the exp from what I hear).  Is this the same for Druids eventhough they aren't summoning a pet, there is no basis of it being a summoned creature?  It is a non-summoned creature that I have taken control of and made my pet. Make sense?<P>I know that in a group it wouldn't matter anyways at least based off of what I read on the main everquest site.  I love grouping myself.  I don't get as much exp per kill, but if you have a good enough group, the incoming monsters can be so quick that it is practically a nonstop battle and exp kill after another and just plain fun laying waste to hordes of evil and looking at the floor littered with the dead.  As opposed to soloing, blowing your mana, maybe taking a few shots and then sitting forever to be full power, with makes for a pretty boring night. <P>Sorry to just carry on, but any info on the questions would be highly appreciated.  <P>Strangefate Daystar Level 24 Druid of Innorruuk<BR>Nilrasch 13th Mage of Innorruuk<BR>Loquetis 16th Ranger of Innourruuk<BR>Viki 14th Shaman of Innorruuk<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">stoneroot</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">The higher level charm spells are better.<P>The more charisma you have the better the spells work.<P>I generally started using charm spells at lvl 44 in solb.

With a charisma of 70 they seem to break much earlier.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Cleome</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">The tough part will be figuring out which animals are the most useful allies at any given level.

I assume he was at the lowest lvl 34.  I thought I would try to fear Dot, blast.. well I hit the wrong button, I snared him, then I charmed him.. I told him to guard here and went off a bit to med, thinking he would break pretty soon.  Well, I got to FOM and cast invis on myself to break the charm, Dot'd and used the panic animal from first lvl and blasted a few times, needless to say I recast panic animal 3 times, once he resisted.  And at lvl 36 took out my first Griffon Solo ;o) <BR>Beguile animals lasted long enough to regain all the mana that I had used to cast in the first place.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Thoraov</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Hey that is some great information.  I have been meaning to try some of it, but I group so much that I rarely solo.  But I do solo on occassion.  I still have on question from that original post.<P>I know that classes that can summon pets take an exp cut when they are soloing and using their pet at the tank.  I am curious if druids also take an exp cut if they use one of the charm spells to make an animal their pet and use it in a battle with something else.<P>But thanks for the other tactics.  I will be sure to try them out.<P>StrangeFate Daystar level 24 of Innoruuk</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Nakuru</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I beleive any time you have a pet it will take a portion of the xp.  (If you are in a group I this only happens if the pet makes the final blow... not sure if solo)  <P>One of the things to consider is that you charm an animal.. you then help it a bit to kill the thing you wanted to, then if you have the mana, cast invis on yourself and proceed to take out the already wounded one.  This gives you full xp on the 2nd one... just try to keep it alive but not to full on health so that you may kill it with ease and little mana.  <P>This gives you perhaps partial xp for the first one, but full xp for the 2nd.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Alisai</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I should mention that the experience lost for having a pet is on the order of half a percent.  For the longest time, all the testing I'd ever done suggested that it didn't exist at all, and I would still think that, had GZ not spelled it out. To me, .5% less experience is more than made up for the reduced downtime.  Of course, if you're camping, then downtime is less of an issue and a pet may not be warranted, but for general wandering, there's no reason not to have one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Ravendas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Hello, its an enchanter perusing the druid board, and i noticed alot of things on charming strangely enough. I am very adept at charming now, having used it to solo from 24 to 33 very easily in Unrest (not that you druids can, but are werebats considered animals?)<BR>Ok, charisma helps the chance that a charm sticks, and is believed to lengthen its duration. While charming, i have 195 charisma (helps ALOT)<P>The higher charm spell has less of a resist rate, and has a higher time cap. The lower level spells have a cap of around a minute or two i believe, while the higher ones can last much much longer. Because of this, if you use a charmed pet in a fight, kill it at the end so it does not break in the middle of the next fight.<P>Always charm blues or greens. Whites wont last long, and yellow or reds is suicide, since the charm line has a large taunt (apparently they dont like being puppets) and will be difficult to pull off of you. And since you druids dont have mez or ae stuns, i guess it will be even harder.<P>Thats about it... charm is a good spell if used the right way.
