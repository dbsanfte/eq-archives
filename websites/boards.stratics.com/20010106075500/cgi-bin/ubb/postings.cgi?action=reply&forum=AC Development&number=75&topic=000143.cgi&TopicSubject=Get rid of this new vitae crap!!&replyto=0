[B]I've ran into around 10 people today that have decided to quit their characters that have alot of vitae loss cause the fact that you need to get it back qith exp. Some were as high as level 25. How can you get it back when you become rendered unable to fight? Should I go around killing 2 million rabbits? I would rather just lose exp, make it a ton of exp whatever. Make it so you lose 2 items. Anything is better than quitting your character.[/B][/QUOTE]

Upping the ante on the vitae puts a sting to it.<P>The problem is, the people who get in over their head too often are the people who likely complain the most about losing their stuff.  These are ALSO the people who are STILL going to get in over their head and, now, eventually render their characters useless.<P>The chance to lose your stuff (which also created the opportunity to find the most honorable people) was a better "penalty" for dying.<P>My suggestion is a 5-10 minute "no loot" time period.  There should be an exception for those of the same allegiance (or specifically patron and immediate vassals) and an OPTION to allow your fellowship members to loot your corpse.  If it was automatic to allow all fellowship members access, you will probably have people joining fellowships in order to loot.<P>Another idea (still with the 5-10 minute period).. When one of your allegiance or fellowship (within that 5-10 minutes) tries to look at your corpse, you will get a prompt:  "Lord Madeupname, of your fellowship, would like access to your corpse.  Permit the access?".  If you refuse, you still have the rest of the time period to get to your corpse before it's fair game for anyone.  10 minutes is TONS of time to get back, assuming you regularly hit the lifestones.  It took me an hour and a half to get back to my body one time - items intact (whew!).   <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif"><P>In this example, when someone NOT of your allegiance or fellowship tries to look at your corpse, you would NOT be messaged.  That would be oh so annoying.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Joe Napalm</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans"><BR>That is a very good idea.<P>I had a situation last night where the capability to loot a follower's corpse would have been handy. We went up against a large group of nasties, and one of my followers sacrificed herself to save her patron when things went horribly wrong (ever seen a monster run for reinforcements in AC? I have, now...).<P>Anyway. With her monarch, her patron, and one of her vassals standing over the body, she had to run back out to it just to get her gear. I don't think that is what they had in mind...<P>-Jn-</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">ISCE</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">When I first died and saw how many experience points I would have to earn to remove the vitae I was not happy.  However, after I worked it down (twice) due to server dropping me, I like it.  Here is the reason why:<BR>-this is a role playing game, MMORPG<BR>-this is NOT an adventure game<BR>-the character development, in a fantasy environment is the point, and the greatest challenge and reward<P>This new penalty forces you to consider much more what death means, and for those who recklessly just charge forward aren't roleplaying anyway.  I say keep the vitae penalty as it is.  The game was too easy before, and this forces you to make more choices about your character.  If you want to play an adventure game go get Drakan.<P>But: the looting must be changed.  Go back to the old system at least.  It is no good at all the way it is now.  I have been looted, and the bow I purchased that took me hours of Drudge killing to accumulate funds for was a loss, but hey, tough.  The guy who stole it off my body can live with himself.<P>My story is that the Drudge took it, and why don't they loot??</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Joe Napalm</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Just because someone charges into the fray doesn't mean they aren't a roleplayer. Some of the best characters in any of the RPGs I've played have been brave beyond the point of rational thought...usually refered to by the better known phrase "foolhardy".<P>Besides, the new vitae system discourages roleplaying by forcing people to go hunt to get rid of the penalty, rather than being able to rest and socialize when their penalty gets too high.<P>The new vitae system is a bad fix to help balance the new looting system - which is also very ill-conceived. The old system worked, and I think a lot of the people who insisted that Turbine change it are sorry they opened their mouths.<P>-Jn-<p>[This message has been edited by Joe Napalm (edited September 23, 1999).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">ISCE</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Ok... ok... after 2 lag deaths and then an unfortunate accident my vitae is now so high it is hurting to work it off.
