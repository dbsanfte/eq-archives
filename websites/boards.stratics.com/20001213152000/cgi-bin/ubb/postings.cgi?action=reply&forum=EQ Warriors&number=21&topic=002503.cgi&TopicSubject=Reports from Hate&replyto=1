<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Duron:
[B]My guild was in hate all week, and I was there all weekend. We were only clearing to the maestro and to do Inny, due to the terrible pathing and stuck pet bugs, that lead to many camp outs and CR sessions.

In that time, to the best of my knowledge, the armour drops were:

Enchanter legs
Indo gloves, helm and boots and a bracer
Cleric legs x2, BP, Boots and arms
Shaman Bp
Bard bracer, boots
No mage or rogue drops

This was from a full WEEK of working the zone. Now this may have been a bit better if we had the time and resources to clear all the class specific mob houses, but with the way the zone stands now, that is incredibly difficult. I am not even sure that clearing the whole zone would have yielded much more. Clearly the wandering mob drops have been nerfed beyond reason. 

The only good point was that in taking the maestro down 4 or 5 times, he was not too stingy. The last time he was duel wielding six note blades, so there are some happy bards at least  :)

First off, the roamers are a fact that you have to deal with when you are pulling (unless you are on the second level).  Second, many people from many servers have reported low drop rates even on statics (my self and my server included).  Perhaps you just got lucky...  In any respect, compare to Fear and it's just silly.<P>Also, the drop rate EVEN ON THE ROAMERS is way too severe given the atrocious pathing that results in zone clearing, mega-trains in Hate.  I think one weekend we had a roughly 35:1 drop rate on mobs to armor with about a 50/50 mix of roamers and statics.<P>------------------<BR>-Raggrok Skullcrusha<P>50th Ogre Warrior; RZ</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Lasae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">*cry*<P>I saw a level 50 Ogre Warrior who has been 50 for like 4 months now...still wearing only one piece of Indolicite he ever got, the helm, which besides the AC has crummy Stats...and he is in the one guild that does daily forays into the Planes...<P>*thinks her dream of ever wearing a full suit funny bronze looking armor will never happen* <P>------------------<BR>Lasae Leniyersa<BR>Vallon Zek<BR>Emerald Warriorette of the 43rd Season <BR><I>Master Fletcher: 192</I><BR><I>Average Archery Skill: 64</I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Raggrok Skullcrusha</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Well, my advice is to bitch to VI about it on their official board.  Gordon already said that they would look into it.  That is a step in the right direction.  In case you missed the post he bascially said that they decided to have a set number of drops per day come out of the planes and then tuned the drop rates to match that number based on the theoretical number of plane clearings that can be done.  Suffice to say that they totally missed in their estimation of how many times you can clear Hate in a day.  They even admitted this.<P>So at least you can have hope that it might some day be fixed.<P>Also, another consequence of VI's rather short sighted policy on planar loot is that it is very lopsided as to what drops.  Fact is there are not many static mummies in the zone- most are wanderers (that don't drop).  Also the majority of wanderers are spites, scorns, and clerics.  Mages and enchanters tend to get screwed too since the statics for them are way out of the way in the zone and almost never get killed.<P>------------------<BR>-Raggrok Skullcrusha<P>50th Ogre Warrior; RZ</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Grimdar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I was lucky enough this past weekend to get invited to kill Innoruuk. It took us a few attempts because Innoruuk was bugged in a wall and we basically had to suicide once to get him "unstuck" for a normal pull. Anyway, after Innoruuk was slain, people asked if we could stick around to pull some of the far side of the zone to get armor for the casters. This just goes to show how screwed mages and other casters are. You basically have to clear at LEAST to Maestro before you can clear other parts of the zone. <BR> <BR>In the time we got 2 mage boots that I remember. However, much to my surprise, a mummy was pulled and I got indo arms. So- there are more static mummies in the zone, however they are on the far side of the zone as well. <P>------------------<BR>Grimdar Hillmover of Rodcet Nife<BR>50th Dwarven Warrior<BR>37th Dwarven Paladin</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Raggrok Skullcrusha</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Yeah, most of the static mummies are right near the SW corner actually.  But the problem regarding location of mobs exists in Fear too.  There aren't many mobs of certain types and they are pulled last (fright fingers jump right to mind).  VI either needs to make all mobs drop random armor (I like this but I know it won't be done) or they need to change the drop percantages to account for the number of each specific mob that is in the zone.  Like in fear if there are only 3 fright fingers in the whole zone they should drop something just about every time.<P>------------------<BR>-Raggrok Skullcrusha<P>50th Ogre Warrior; RZ</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Duron</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">My guild has probably done more POF trips than hate, due to its buggy, frustrating nature.
