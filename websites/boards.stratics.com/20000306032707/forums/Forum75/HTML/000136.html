</FONT><HR>In previous games, the want/need for player run institutions was astounding. Because of the dynamic concepts in Ultima Online, several player made towns were built, and nourished by the staff. Everquest wasn't quite the same, but many players tried to institute a government in their town. Now, on to Asheron's Call. Why not allow a player to associate themselves to a town of their choosing. Make it much like an Allegiance, where it would take a certain amount of XP to change your town.<P>With this association the player is allowed services and responsibilities. For one, perhaps voting for officials, so that towns can have official institutions, not just a group of people who have deemed themselves the mayor and deputies. This vote would be taken by a simple chat command system, without need for a voting booth or the like.<P>The official mayor of the city would be like the head sysop that would control deputies or handle issues around town as a mediator. This individual would be a deputy first, and move up in rank as time goes on. Mayor is the highest player attainable position in the town, of which any number of other ranks can reside below.<P>Deputies can be voted in as well, who will report of troubles like a disruptive player abusing a bug, another player or language, and help citizens in daily troubles, to more of an extent than advocates. There can be unlimited Deputies as long as the citizens allow them in term with the vote. This would allow helpful players to get into action more quickly then needing to wait for Turbine to get them through the Advocate process. Deputies would be lower then an advocate, obviously, and wouldn't hold as many responsibilities but would still need to retain basic morals to uphold. If the deputy cannot uphold these morals, they can easily be removed from the position.<P>On services, since banks have been done to death, why not have some of the larger towns have vaults. I'm unsure how this would be handled, but I was considering an unlimited locker with taxes depending on how many burden units of items you have inside.<P>Another service could be a town scribe who could remove inscriptions from items. Since looting will be a mute point after the new building coming out, this wouldn't necessarily be used for evil. It would be helpful for when you find an item in the store, or trade with a player whom forgot to remove their inscription. The price for the removal would be some percentage of the item's worth.<P>The taxes from these services would go to town improvements, events, or perhaps tribute to the local race's Lord/Lady. This Lord/Lady would be a Turbine staff member who would also be the one watching the town's and their governments, and fielding complaints about mayor or deputies. Allowing money to leave the economy like this would help with inflation, which is inevitable with the current progression. Another way to do this, is player houses of course.. <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif"> Which is a totally different issue, entirely.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=75&topic=000136.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=AC+Development&TopicSubject=Player+Governments+|AMP|+Lockers+(Long)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea in general.  Perhaps "governing" (or a better term) could be created as a trade skill.  Obviously there will be some level of "dedication" when one has to place XP into such trait to obtain a higher level of town service.<P>Maybe this trait could be applied 100% in ONE town, 50% in other same-race towns, and 10% in other towns.  Just by having "governing" as a usable skill could label you as a "representative" of that town (and race).  Higher levels could equate to ambassador.  A higher level of one town (Mayor of a new Aluvian town) could equate to an ambassador of other race towns and perhaps an offical of somesort in other same race towns.<P>Just rollin with the ideas.  Someone, help me focus!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=75&topic=000136.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=AC+Development&TopicSubject=Player+Governments+|AMP|+Lockers+(Long)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>Well, it is a nice idea, but fatally flawed in my opinion.  Their is nothing to govern, and no reason to govern them.  This is what you said the elected government would do.<P>"...report of troubles like a disruptive player abusing a bug, another player or language, and help citizens in daily troubles, to more of an extent than advocates."<P>That seems like a very short list.  More then that, it is unneeded.  Their is already a button that you can press to register a complaint.  More then that, you can always just hit the ignore command on anyone who you find to have disruptive language.  Anyone should report bug abuse.<P>What exactly are the power that you are talking about giving out?  It seems like you are just suggesting a more complex complaint form.  Believe me, I am all for player governments, but AC is just not the place.  Their is no conflict or strife in the towns.  There are now powers that could be handed down that could possibly improve/wreak towns.  There are no wars, no conflict, no need for alliances (as there is nothing to allay against), and the most disruptive thing an unruly citizen can do that can't be squelched with a few words type into your chat box (namely the ignore command), is loot someone's corpse.... which is being taken out next patch if the news is correct.  So what exactly would a governor have that the average player does not, besides a meaningless title next to his name?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=75&topic=000136.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=AC+Development&TopicSubject=Player+Governments+|AMP|+Lockers+(Long)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>It was simply an idea I had while thinking about the allegiance system. It wouldn't be too hard to impliment, and it would help with the policing issues which plagued previous online games. It also had it's own roleplayability, of course. Too much work then what's needed I guess, after hearing your replies.<P>Also had in mind, a concept thrust apon me by an advocate, that they were going to allow allegiance wars. Deputies would be the only way to keep the towns safe from the battles spilling into the streets, so to speak. And the thought of a town divided between monarchs, posed a very interesting roleplaying situation (Varona of "Romeo and Juliet" with the two families). Battle to get a mayor into office that's under their control. Then have the deputies on their side, and force the other monarch out. Political wars are just as fun as the physical ones.. <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=75&topic=000136.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=AC+Development&TopicSubject=Player+Governments+|AMP|+Lockers+(Long)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>The only potential incentive I can think of for a town official is to have a small percentage of the town's sales go to such officials, much like experience in allegiances now works.<P>There still is the problem of what they could actually DO.  Is their some way such person could effect or focus the growth of the town (and therefore "deserve" the money)?
