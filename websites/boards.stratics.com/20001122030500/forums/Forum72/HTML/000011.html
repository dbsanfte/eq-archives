</FONT><HR>When a kingdom is ruled by another through a puppet, revolution is assured as the day will be hot.  Viamont learned this lesson when it tried to do this with Aluvia and Gharu'n and found the strings cut and enemies on all sides.<BR>(Note: Italics represent rumors)<P><b>Viamont</b><BR>To the west of Aluvia rests a hungry beast, Viamont, one of histories most agressive and expansionistic kingdoms around the Ironsea in the world of Ispar.  A kingdom bordered on three sides by water, acorss the Ironsea from the Gharu'n, Viamonts one connection to land is through the kingdom of Aluvia.  With an established navy and a <i> large force of Privateers (known as kingdom funded pirates) the Viamonters do have much control on the traffic that does cross the Ironsea</i>, a sea filled with the blood of many men who have fought for or against Viamont in its long history of expansionistic policies.<P>Viamont was a kingdom that through a strong duty to king and country (<i>and rumors of a secret police</i>), did rise above the petty squabbles that consumed the neighboring Aluvian clans.  It existed during the height of the Empire of Roulea(2), and had been one of the early kingdoms to recognize the kingdom of Gharu'n(3).  The kingdom was also known for its fleet of Pirates, known as Privateers(3).<BR><i>To increase the flow of valuables to the coffers of Viamont, the kingdom had given the status of Privateers to many ships that had plagued the Ironsea, a practice it still does to this very day.  In exchange for a share of the wealth and protection from pirate attacks, the kingdom of Viamont granted the Pirates safe harbor and access to certain items, as well as the ability to "raid" in the name of the King in times of war, a common occurance as history will show.</i><P>As Viamont grew, expansionistic ideals began to take root in the courts of Viamont and the squabbaling Aluvians and the young Gharu'n made tempting targets.  First there was the invasion Aluvia in which the kingdom of Viamont installed the King Alfric, and made a solid footing into the area to their east (1).<P>Once that conquest was complete, the raw timber of Aluvia found its way to Viamonts shipyards and a massive fleet made its way to bring order to the chaos that had gripped the young nation of Gharu'n(2).  So sailing south across the Ironsea the Viamont navy and army quickly took control and set up a petty lord, Zahir ibn Ma'mun, as a puppet while they ruled Gharu'n from afar.<P>But history would prove that the Viamonters had spread themselves too thin for the puppet strings to hold.  For when the assasination of Pywell III occured(1), Jawhar al-Shamshir was at the same time leading the revolution in Gharu'n(2).  <P>The fact that the Viamonters were faced by forces from two sides worked for the advantage for both the Aluvians and the Gharu'n as Viamont could not save both conquests.  So thus the Viamonters abandoned Gharu'n,<i> but not before looting the coffers of the Gharu'n</i>.  The Viamonters loss against the Aluvians was the more painful one, as the Aluvians were so filled with rage of the assasination of their king, there was no mercy or quarter given in the battles that raged to push the Viamonters from the lands of Aluvia. <i> In fact if it were not for the defenses that were already built along the border of the two kingdoms there is some debate on whether or not Viamont would still be around</i>.<P>Using the wealth of the Gharu'n and the time left the Viamonters have been rebuilding and waiting.  Viamont has not been idle and realizing it had burned its bridges with both Aluvia and Gharu'n it has focused its trading relationship on the Empire of Roulea and has been steadily re-establishing military strength,<i> including but not limited to the hiring of Souia-Vey mercenaries</i>.  Some say that war with the Aluvians is not far off at all(1).<P>A diplomat to Viamont would find it a harsh land that has taken the mentality of a state that is always at war. <i> Security is tight and the military police rule the streets.  While not as forboding as Milant, a traveller there should be very careful in actions and words as many "spies" fill the dungeons.</i><P>(OOC:  I pictured the Viamonters as an Isparian cross of historical Spain and France.  With the Spanish pirates and the French Privateers it seemed natural connection.  The Spanish were heavy expansionists and the French lead the crusades against the Holy Lands.  The constant wars against the German kingdoms by the French make this kind of connection possible.  But Viamont is one kingdom to watch carefully, for as the history of Dereth progresses, so will that of Ispar.  Watch for this war and the impact it has on Dereth, you have been warned.)<P>(1) <A HREF="http://acss.stratics.com/aluvhist.html" TARGET=_blank> History of Aluvia Vol. 1</A><BR>	In olden days, the land now known as the High Kingdom of Aluvia was home to feuding clans of warriors. Seeking conquest, the neighboring nation of Viamont invaded and instated a king, Alfric  I, to rule over the clan chiefs. The native Aluvians rebelled, but with little success; subject to  often brutal reprisals, they remained thralls of a foreign monarch.<BR>   <BR>	To the west, however, Viamont bides: it will only be a matter of time, some say, before war returns to the land. <BR>   <BR>(2)<A HREF="http://acss.stratics.com/gharhist.html" TARGET=_blank>History of Gharu'ndim Vol. 1</A><P>	Amul died heirless soon after, poisoned at his own birthday celebration, and Gharu'n fell into chaos. No fewer than twenty-five Maliks ruled over the next hundred years. The al-Nafalt was razed, and dark times fell over the land. From across the sea, the conquest-hungry kingdom of Viamont sent armies to invade. They set up a petty lord, Zahir ibn Ma'mun, as a puppet while they ruled Gharu'n from afar. One by one, Zahir murdered his rivals all save a young lord, Jawhar al-Shamshir. <BR>	<BR>	Jawhar defeated the puppet king and drove the Viamonters from the shores of Gharu'n. He became the new Malik, returning his kingdom to the glory it had known in Yasif's time. <P>(3)<A HREF="http://www.turbinegames.com/asherons-call/heritagegroups/gharu'ndim/gharu'ndim_content_story2.htm" TARGET=_blank>A Poet Vanishes</A><BR>	Gharu’n was a young kingdom then, and many of the other realms about the Ironsea had not recognized our sovereignty. He [Yasif ibn Salayyar]sailed to Aluvia and Viamont.<P>	...he would have had an unpleasant voyage indeed: captured by Viamonter pirates....<P>	Etien of Viamont, in particular, was notorious for this: once, he’d kept the Poet at his court for nearly half a year longer than was, strictly speaking, proper.<P><BR>------------------<BR>Success is measured not in gold but in the friends at thy funeral<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Nayt al-Yad (edited 07-15-1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=72&topic=000011.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=AC+History+of+Dereth&TopicSubject=Viamont-the+beast+next+door">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>First to the lady Marizelle and lord Ethos, I am honored that thou wouldst consider me for the position as a member of thy research staff, but I must confess I am nay very good at maintianing consitency in activity as my employment dost find me in places far away.  But if thou canst accpet a wandering scholar I would be glad and honored to serve.<P>As for the issue of providing documentation and footnotes.  To Ashe and Raze: History is a three edged sword-their side, your side, and the truth.  Facts can be concealed, words can be twisted, if not properly placed in context.  <BR>A story told to me is of a woman asking a minister why the Bible has no references to PMS, the minister said he would look into it.  The next week he met the woman and showed her this scripture "and Mary rode Josephs ass all the way to Bethleham."  <BR>What this says is anything if properly inserted can be made to fit any truth if taken out of context. <BR>By providing anchors to the mythology, set forth by the creators of Dereth, one can make ones history seem true and within the realm of reason, and provides a context for which the reader can accept what is said as plausible truth.  By giving the path to the facts the reader can take what is said, verify it, and then make their own decisions.<BR>There is no documentation of Roulea's Colluseum, but by using the small fact that they used arenas for entertainment one could extrapolate such a place existed, as I did in my essay.<BR>So while I applaud thee for the roleplaying approach thou hast taken to the history of Dereth, liberal sprinkling of documented facts encourages more belief in thy writings. <P>I do nay wish to force my own standards on the other scholars who spend the time to write here, for every voice that adds to the growing tapestry of Dereth should be a welcomed voice.  But I find the threat of being put to death by Pywll scholars only encourages me to write such long disertations in defense of my writing style.<P>For historians are merely bards of facts and any style to bring such knowledge to those who would rather hear a tale of fancy over fact is welcomed (ooc:Look at the History Channel - I mean who would have thought history would have been so cool.).  So stay true to your style but be prepared to back them up is queried by a fellow scholar.<P>So I thank thee for thy inputs and listening to this old mans rants.  I do hope to contribute when I can, as best I can to the every growing saga that is Dereth and this realm called Asheron's Call.<P>Nayt al-Yad<P>------------------<BR>Success is measured not in gold but in the friends at thy funeral<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=72&topic=000011.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=AC+History+of+Dereth&TopicSubject=Viamont-the+beast+next+door">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>Baah.  I just dislike foreigners showing up myself (heh :P).  I shall endeavor to redo my Chronicles, and incorperate it into my future works.  However, I speak to you of your own out of context falsities, or simple thories. <P>From your Milantos Document:<BR>   "The Milantos have never been heavy in expansion they have all the land they need, but their army is believed to be the most seasoned in the world of Ispar, for no kingdom has gone to war with them. Perhaps out of fear, for there are rumors that those who join the army of Milantos will serve even in death."  I object to this! No facts exist on the existance of even an army! Only schemes and dark plots keep the other kingdoms from attacking this nest of evil.  Not a mythic army!<P>"The kingdom has always been divided into two classes, the ruling magus and the commoners. Those who show arcane talents are quickly introduced into the Cabals that rule from the shadows, those who do not lived in fear of being abducted for dark rituals, join the army, or become one of hundreds of spies for the kingdom. "<BR>    Aye, I'll agree they delve into dark works,  and possess much skill in the arcane.   As well, they have many a spy in all lands, but nay. Not such as this.  You desert your Oath to Truth! Call them Rumors (Aka, Theories) and create a Book on it..  but we need not have our Chronicles of Truth besotted with such ilk!<P>   On your Viamont Document:<BR>"including but not limited to the hiring of Souia-Vey mercenaries.

</FONT><HR>All insights and histories are welcome, no matter what their style - and even if you role-play the telling of the history, I bet you can easily slip in some other references and sources of information for the new students of the lore to further research on there own perhaps? =)<P>As for you, Nayt al-Yad, you are official on the contributing staff as wandering scholar - at this time regular or scheduled submissions are not part of this and I hope never to be that strict a task master! I want this to stay fun and enjoyable for all. <P>Find an area you are interested in research it and write about it, then submit it when you are ready. Also, please feel free to bring up discussions about the histories. I like the idea of folks posting them as well as sending the copies to me. Helps us all learn a bit more and iron out any potential inconsistancy across them too.<P>Also, while I know RP is involved in some of the stories, please try to keep potential heritage group bias out of the telling so we focus on the details. Though adding how the hertiage group feels about a certain event or something would add great depth.<P>Keep sending in those submission - I am enjoying the reading!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=72&topic=000011.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=AC+History+of+Dereth&TopicSubject=Viamont-the+beast+next+door">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">
