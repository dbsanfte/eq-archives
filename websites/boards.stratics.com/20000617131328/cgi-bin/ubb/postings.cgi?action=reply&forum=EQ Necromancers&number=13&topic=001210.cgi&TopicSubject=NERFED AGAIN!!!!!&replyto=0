[B]I can't believe necro's have been nerfed again!  This is an outrage!  I actually have to sit there and play the game now, i can't let the game play for me anymore!  I hate VERANT they are a bunch of ********  for making me have to play the game like everyone else.  I am a Necromancer i am supposed to be superior to everyone, and I'm quitting unless things change.

Things that need to change:

Necro's need teleport spells.  It's not fair that those overpowered wizards and druids get teleports and we don't.

Necro's need to be able to summon something better then skeletons, like maybe spectres or giant skeletons.

HAving to summon a pet everytime i zone is a hassle I should just automatically get one in every new zone I enter into.  Not only that but it should default to the highest level pet i can summon at that level.

It's unfair that we have to lose hp's for mana when Enchanters get that darned clarity spell!  No more losing hp's for mana i say, Necro's need clarity too.

Feign death sucks now it's not even worth using so i say they take it out and give us "auto feign death"  Whenever we get low on hp's we automatically feign death. It's hardly fair that Necro's should die like everyone else.

One last thing I'm tired of using daggers and staffs and scythes, I want a sword with flames on it.

A Necromancer in a guild called Brotherhood of the Sword?..<P>Anyway, had the NEcromancer class not been peopled with all the type that feel the urge to try and bend/break every rule, nothing would have been changed.

Those are called strategies given what is allowed by the game, not exploits.  <P>Exploits are things like using zone bugs to make monsters flee and blasting the oracle's protector from levitating off-shore (when it was allowed). <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Dhacks Fury</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">haha, thanks Steve, short, but pointless, good post.<P>Now, i didnt say that necros are entirely peopled by those types, but when those types play, Necros seem to be the class of choice.<P>That statement there is no arguement with.<P>Now I notice you didnt bother to rebute what i meant with my obvious misspellings so i assume you are done responding.<P>Sieger-<P>First off, this game has very little in common with D&D, but if I didnt play D&D when i was younger, how would I know that?<BR>Do you really think that when EQ came public that every level 1 warrior had any clue as to the disparity between his/her power and that of a pure casting class? Hell, at that time we all thought stats meant something... If you answered yes, i would challenge you that the number of warriors on each server has been decreased since the beginning, while the number of Necros have steadily increased.<P>I used exploit in the loosest sense of the word, not in the Verant definition--<P>for example- I played a Druid long ago, was my second character ever and in the Everquest guidebook it said that when running from enemies duck behind trees, jump over objects, try different things to get away.. So I did.. I fought a Mammoth and killed it even though i was only lvl 23, by jumping on a building where it couldnt get to me in Everfrost. I thought I had come up with a good tactic, a way to fight things with a little ingenuity.. I was summoned by a GM and told that I was a cheater and would have my account suspended for this... Really weak. Since then i have learned new phrases like pathing bug.. EQ has no room for ingenuity, unless it is written in the game code.. then of course its not really ingenuity is it?.<P>Now while I can empathize with the fact it does take know how to do some of the things that necros do, I think that the ones who do exploit it have caused the rest to pay the price.. like I said before, the few caused the whole to pay.<P>and while it does stink to have a classes power lessened, it does even out the paying field a little, and every class whines about not being powerful enough,, goto every board and read someones post about their class.. its the same crap over and over.. I think Necros, pre-patch, were one of the few with very few complaints.<P>------------------<BR>Challenge me, and indeed you shall die.<P>[This message has been edited by Dhacks Fury (edited February 18, 2000).]<p>[This message has been edited by Dhacks Fury (edited February 18, 2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Goldcard</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">In case you have not noticed, the change make it so that FD now only lasts 15 MINUTES.

You're only giving him what he wants.<P>Gookie:<BR>Just because somesone has a negative opinion about necro's doesn't mean they are automatically a warrior. Lots of classes had issues with necros.<P>Sieger:<BR>Being a 20 year veteran of playing D&D I can safely say that your statement about warriors and wizards isn't completely true. Any veteran player will be able to tell you numerous ways a warrior can beat out a wizard in a paper RPG and have a reasonable chance of victory. The key issue is the fact that if a warrior catches a wizard by suprise they have a good chance of carrying the day. Tactics, planning and execution have been the focus of many caster vs. warrior engagements in the campaigns I've played in. You can't even compare EQ to a paper RPG though. Actions and combat in EQ are totally linear...there is no allowance for "real" tactics....it's all about tanks keeping the caster open for nukes until the MOB goes down. In a paper RPG if you can come up with an idea your free to try it and see what happens.<P>Just my 2cp on the subject.<P><P>------------------<BR>Aeowyn Swordsong<BR>Level 24 Wood Elf Warrior <P>Alhanna Evenstar<BR>Level 15 Human Cleric of Erollis Marr<P>Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Sieger</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">OK, just for the record....every game that has remotely resembled Everquest, meaning D & D related comp games, has always had the same reoccuring principles.<P>Warriors are solid, they fight well adn protect everyone early on. But later on, it is the little pipsqueek casters who do the most dmg by far.  <P>It doesn't matter if you played D & D or not, you would have foudn this theme in practically every game, even weak ones like Diablo.<P>Of course there are instances where a melee is better.  But in general, casters outgun melee and that's the way it should be and that's the way it is in the game.  <P>If you want to pretend that you did not know that, then go ahead. But in fact, 99.999% of the people who start this game either knew this before hand or knew it and did not correlate it to this game.  <P>In any case, all you had to do was look up any EQ related page to find out the info.  If you were really going to invest money and huge amoutns of time into a game, you should have at least checked out a web page or two.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Dhacks Fury</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Sieger-<P>You seem to be argueing a moot point bro.<P>Who exactly said they did't know this? No one, i don't think you are bringing any info that is Earth-shattering to our attention. But that is not the way it is in every game, and someone who never played these games wouldnt know that.. And maybe they have something called, oh hell, a real life? I dont need to go and read everything on the web to buy it, the cover looked neat, so I picked it up.. thats how I got EQ.. As for anything else, just because you call it common knowledge, doesnt make it just, and the disparity between necros (well, not so much now) and other classes was pretty large in terms of sheer power.<P>Point being, Necros were to strong, they proved time and time again with -- call it what you will -- but note, if you say it was skill and cunning that propelled Necros along and made them strong, I will ask, well, I am a cunning warrior, tell me exactly why I cant solo a green mob? Cunning means crap if somewhere along the line you dont have the ability and power to do the task.. THAT was my point.<P><BR>Dhacks Fury<P>------------------<BR>Challenge me, and indeed you shall die.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Sieger</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Powering up melee classes is a whole other issue.<P>Your complaining about one class being too strong does not make any of the melee classes any stronger relative to the mobs.  It only makes 1 class weaker and does not improve the situation of any others.<P>And if you got the time to play this game, you an afford to check out a few web pages. ANYONE with or without a life can afford a few minutes to read a few web pages.  <P>If you can afford the money for the game, the subscription, and can afford the time....you sure as hell have 30 minutes to goof around searching a few web pages. You don't have much of a point on that one.<P>And so what if necros outpower melee classes?  So do wizard, so do mages, so do shamans, so do druids, so do all spell casting classes?  What is your point? Nerf them all till they all suck and you feel happy?<P>If you don't know your role as a tank yet, you will never reach high level.  If you don't understand that a dragon can not be taken down with a good number of tanks, then you need to play some more. Every class has a role.  There is no super class....but the underpowerment of the tanks is as it should be. Perhaps they need a bit more power....but fact is they are not meant to solo and they should not be soloing.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
