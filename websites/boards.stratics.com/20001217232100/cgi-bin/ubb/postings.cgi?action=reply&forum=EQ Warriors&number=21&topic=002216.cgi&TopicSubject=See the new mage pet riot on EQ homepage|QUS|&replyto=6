The mages have discovered that their pets don't dual wield.  Part of their discovery was the fact that most mobs without a visible weapon don't dual wield either.  Gordon said "oops, we didn't know the mobs should have been super death machines" (not a direct quote, lol).  So now the dev team is looking into why mage pets (and every other 35 plus mob) doesn't dual wield.  Damn those petcasters!  Damn their eyes!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Brudo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Yeah, I must admit I'm impressed.<P>There've been a LOT of people complaining about necro pets lately- a *ton* of them, especially on the newsgroup.<P>To counter the perception that tanks are useless at high levels, Gordon says...wait for it...'you're wrong'. <P>He then discovers (Alchemy II) that nothing in this game actually dual wields without a weapon. And so, mage pets, which were previously 'only' somewhat overpowered, now get to destroy necro pets and us in the process.<P>(Oh, and let's not forget what happens if they decide to fix the bug and make every other NPC dual wield as well...)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Brudo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">This just in...posted on that same thread:<P>-------------<BR>This doesn't really belong on this thread, but it is related to the same subject. On a warrior board, they were complaining that a level 50 warrior in full crafted and cleric buffs couldn't beat a dual wielding necro pet with daggers. Verant denied this citing a test with a level 50 warrior beating a necro pet with 2 fine steel daggers. I've seen it mentioned several times on this thread that to dual wield, a necro pet has to use 2 DIFFERENT weapons. They need to try that test again, may find that the warriors' complaints are also correct.<BR>Macwhirl<BR>20 shaman Tunare<BR>---------------<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Elldog</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I don't know much, but I do know this:  We were camping the Ishva in Paw with a necro, a shammie, and myself, level 50 warrior.  The enchanter gnoll popped and towards the end of the battle it charmed our necro's pet.  After killing the gnoll i was still at about 90-95% health.  The pet went ape on us, killed it's owner quick, took me and the shammie down to less than 20% health.  If I was soloing this, I wouldn't of stood a chance in hell.  (imho, pets regen a lot faster than us too)<P>So you say "Stop bitchin' about it Elldog and just play the game for what is" and I agree to a certain extent.  But this needs to be brought up to EQ that necro pets are more powerful than warriors. They basically eliminate the need for a warrior in a group.  Gordon says that a pet can't think like a PC so it's at a disadvantage, well a pet doesn't have to deal with lag or losing a monster in battle because 24 other people are trying to melee the NPC also and you basically can't tell what's going on (those that have been to the planes know what I mean).  Type in the /pet attack command, sit back and watch the sparks fly.<P>Anyways, I'll shut up now, just wanted to share a story and some of my concerns with my fellow warriors.

His pet+dam shield+pet haste buff can already solo a seafury, when fight is over he just does a /pet get lost and summons a new one. Faster than waiting for it to regenerate.<P>Guess we'll see. If they upgrade them i guess its good for me too, since i can then bug him to go solo dino in oot for me hehe.

If you think the necro is so damn powerful go play one.  Ive played a mage up, now im workin on a necro while waiting for a friend to catch up to me in lvls.  <P>     I believe necros pets are better than a warrior at dealing dmg, but they are best when soloing.  In a group all a pet is, is a thing to hit on the monsters.  same in solo, although in groups you will always need some sort of tank to pull.  The magician pet, there really aint much of a comparison in dmg though.  although with a lava shield a mage pet is extremely awesome.<P>     Besides, necros have a bit tuffer time than a warrior.  you walk up, press the a button, then maybe the kick/bash/slam button.  Oh ya and you pull(which is awesome).  Necro however has to work his faction up with his own damn town(unless he's a DE).  then if he wants to deal anywhere else he has to work faction up like crazy there to.  Necros have a butt load of cool/useful spells.  They have to decide when too many DoT's is TOO many.  after sending pet in they can usually fear the mob(if it holds) and then follow their pet to continue supporting it.<P>     But i cannot understand a class bitching that they cant beat another class's pet.  a warrior is a punching bag that pulls.  Your not much more than that, sorry.  A warrior does jack dmg in a group when compared to the wizards/magicians sitting behind him.  look at the numbers, no matter what your wielding your never gonna come close to ice comet/rend/lava bolt.  which are 1120/780(?)/810 dmg.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Blackacid</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Asclepius, get a clue... 1) Faction has nothing to do with this. 2) I don't think anyone wants the pets nerfed, more over, we want melee FIXED. 3) The next time you need that "Punching bag that pulls" to taunt something off of you, consider the fact that he just may be on this board, and decided he'll just do what you said he supposed to do...

I currently play a 50th mage as my primary character, so of course the outcome of this debate is very important to me. The fact that our pets are now going to be getting a fix to allow them to dual wield has me elated and concerned at the same time. First off, let me just say that according to what the designers have said on numerous occasions, mage's are supposed to have the most powerful pets. I don't think that our pets will ever be able to compare with a FS dagger-wielding necro pet in speed, but at least this would close the gap in damage output somewhat. That, however, is a debate for another board. On the other hand, I have to admit that I am concerned with the fact that ANY pet could outdamage a warrior of the same rank. In fact, if you check out some of the posts on the magician board, you will see that I am not alone, we as a community support your ongoing campaign to increase the power of the warrior class in combat. I think that the critical hits and cripiling blows are a step in the right direction, but we all know that they don't happen often enough to really make  that big of a difference. I am not like the idiot that posted above, I DO NOT think all you do is hit the auto-attack key and punch kick/bash when it pops! You are an incredible asset to any group, and I for one have been saved on numerous occasions by the heroic efforts of the group warrior. I have seen warriors willingly sacrifice their lives in order for the rest of the group to escape. That is the stuff of legends guys, and you should be proud that you have chosen the most noble profession (class) in Norath IMHO. In closing let me say this, the mages may get their day in the sun today, but it will only strengthen your position to upgrade the warrior class. PLEASE, don't cry for a nerf of the pet-wielding classes, it won't serve anyone in the long run. It won't make you any better in combat, and it certainly won't help us. Instead let us all unite and FIX YOUR CLASS! I, for one, am 100% behind your efforts, and I will encourage my fellow mages to join the picket lines as well. Just remember; united we stand, divided we fall.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Kailyn of Povar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Thanks, I think we over here have not take aim at any of the pets.

Coupled to nerfs of the planes I am conviced that the general melee imbalance is just another one of these things that Verant has no frickin clue about.  I guess when you can whip up a lvl 50 warrior in whatever gear you choose to give it and whatever buffs you want they don't seem weak.  What a frickin joke- wake up and play in our world- then you will see the truth.

Give warriors an extra denfensive skill.  Let warriors regenerate hit points faster than other melee classes.  An extra defense skill would allow a warrior to stay alive longer.

Warriors have a greater responsibility than that in large groups.  I am willing to put my live on the line for the good of the group.  On a bad pull in hate for instance, my job is to peel the baddies off the clerics and pali's so they can log while i run with many mobs on me far away from the camp area and eventually die.  <P>Also, you may want to know, that some of the baddies in the planes are completely resistant to spells.  What are you going to do then?  What are you going to do now that the manastone is useless in the planes?  In a group full of 4 warriors and 2 clerics, we will get exp out of 4 groups 50% of the time.  So don't tell us our damage is crap.  When a wizzie uses 1/5 of his/her mana to cast IC and it does 10 damage or is resisted, what's that?  Crap maybe? <P>What if some class could summon a pet that could cast and out-damage a mage/wizard with spells?  I'm sure you would "Bitch" about it or go play another class as you suggested.<P>My goal on posting to this reply is to bring to the attention of Verant that we aren't as powerful as necro pets and No, i don't want necro/mage pets nerfed.

How the hell does it affect you if a necros pet can solo stuff you cant?  well?  does that kill you?  NO, and btw shut the hell up with your willing to die for the group.  no one wants to die, but its a game.  ill die for my group if im in a posistion to let more ppl live than if i stayed id die.  <P>     also if you've never played a class, dont even ask for it to be nerfed.  as you have NO idea what their str's/weaknesses are.  Just ask for your class to be improved rather than bitch and moan about another class.  im gonna be dusting my magician off if they get duel wield for their pets.  but otherwise shut the heck up, there is no reason for a class to be nerfed.  just ask to get improved.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Derra Wildrunner</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I dont think a single person in this thread has once stated that necro pets should be nerfed.

Pets do more dmg than warriors and warriors want to be able to either do as much dmg as pets and/or have some way to make warriors more valuable to the group.(ie more defense/hp, a way to make the mob attack us more)<P>On a semi different topic, last night I tried dueling a necro friend of mine and was able to beat him under certain conditions. <P>I was a lvl 26 warrior and he was a lvl 30 necro.

And his necro barely hurt me, only doing about 19 dmg max I think, actually missed most of the time.<P>Then again it wasnt under the best conditions, I had full crafted and a mith 2 hander, but he also had some of the best non planes necro gear as well. <P>I would like to do a test where we are of the similar level, with appropriate gear, and maybe even some of those debuff stones so I can at least counter the darkness/dots  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> I still think the necro would win with all the tricks they have.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Wisted</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">you also need to take into account that not all warriors are large races, so slam isn't always an option</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Hivemind</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><BR>Hey Yodak!  I don't know about the others, but I really like to hear that we are appreciated.  I, and most warriors, have the attitude that their main job is to keep the party alive.  This often means us getting enough heat on us that we will definitely die, so that some of the others will get away.  Thanks!  Your message was the highlight of my day.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>On to the whole dual wielding mages pet thing.  I don't know exactly why it is assumed that all mobs over level 35 should dual wield, after all they get double attack.  Of course I don't know why a human npc can do double 80s with their fists either.  It's only natural for all classes to want to be improved, you don't need to look very far on this board to find a thread that doesn't have an idea for how we should be improved.  Do you really want all mage pets to become 75% more effective though?  This is Gordons estimate of the difference that it will make.  I'm just scared that they are considering applying this fix (or a partial of it) to all mobs.  I didn't see any message saying they had definitely ruled this out.  That would definitely make it a grouping game alright.  'I'm heading to town, might get attacked by a couple of skeletons on the way, better put a group together just in case.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">)  Just think of the poor newbies (if you can find any) they get no guise, no abu'kar, no planes twinking, no rubi and all the mobs are 75% harder than when we did it.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">  (I'm aware there are a huge number of improvements and things that make it easier since March too, so don't tire your fingers out attacking that point, it's a joke.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">)<P>Hivemind (aka Grak, Troll Warrior)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Asclepius</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">i love grouping with warriors.  i just get ticked when anyone wants to nerf a class.  i could have sworn i read it in this post somewhere, oh well.<P>     you got that equip at 26?  hehe  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">.  with magician pets, their looking into working it out so not all NPC's get the duel wield.  but from what ive watched my magician pet do, its not all that impressive.  it double attacks, and the earth pet hits pretty damn slow.  water is pretty good right now.  magician pets were supposed to have duel wield from the game release but it was bugged(what a surprise), so now their looking into fixing it.  magicians are supposed to be the masters of pets, but that isnt really the case with quad hittin necro pets.  plus ill just lose control if i see necros complaining about that.  they were not intended to have the best pets which quad for mid fifties+.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Arek of the Nexus Knights</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><BR> I have two remarks after reading this thread.<BR> one) Yodak I'm glad you took the time to post here. It does help alot of warrior's frustration to hear that at least some other people agree with us and are supporting us. <BR> two) And I suppose this is a flame but though you recanted somewhat Asclepius you did seriously offend me. Warriors aren't pet's that are controled by players. That seems to be exactly your mentality in your description of what warrior's do. Warrior's are a melee class that imo and alot of others have legetimite concerns about balance and viability in this game. I would also ask you this. Have you ever played a warrior for any length of time? Oh, just to clarify that question. Have you played a warrior untwinked. From first to even 20th lvl. Let alone any higher. Warrior's are a class. We officially have never been "nerfed" but the fact is it's because we can't have taken what we do not have. We have hp's and a slight advantage on certain skill caps compaired to certain classes. But we can't keep mob's on us. We can't heal or buff party member's and we certainly can't solo much anything. Our job is to get mobs, hit mobs and to take the hits from the mob. We also ideally, and I think alot of warrior's would agree with me on this, but ideally we should have the mob's attention so that if a pull turns bad the group can run and we can try and buy them time even dying as the resolute. These are what we are supposed to be able to do. Most of us aren't asking to be the major damage dealer to a mob. That is the caster's job. Or the monk or rogue's place. We do not want spells either that is the pervue of the hybrids. We do want to be competitive with pet's for damage. Not for ego but for in part pride true, but more as a way to perform our primary job. We want even to our death to be able to get and keep the mob's attention. We want to be able to have skills that we use at our discretion that will allow us the ability to keep ahead of anyone else in the mob hate list. That way currently means doing more damage because right now we can not compete. We have no new skills to look forward to after 35th lvl. The last skill we get is basically useless since mobs tend to do as much damage with there fists as they do with weapons. We currently have no new controled skills slated for us to our knowledge in the immediate future either. So to compete and to be able to fill the one role we are supposed to be the best in. We have to do more damage. Healers out taunt us because they repair the damage the mob's done which far exceeds ours. Hybrids out taunt us because they have multiple means to do so. Casters out taunt us because the do a tremendous amount of damage in very short amounts of time. Monks and rogues out taunt us because they simple out damage us. Is any of this wrong, no are we asking for any class to be nerfed, no. We are asking for a way to do our job and that job is primary tank. Right now that means we need to do more damage. If you still think we are whinning then just remember your position the next time a mob frenzies on you and a you watch for the duration of your life bar a warrior pound on it's back as you die.<P> On a side note, if they give creature's dual weild would that be for game balance? Will they bother to test this on the test server to judge the impact it would have. I also wonder why if verant and Brad's team love this game so much why do they not play it. If they did then I believe they would have a better understanding of the actual game enviroment. Figureing out 10 months after official release something as blatent as mage pet's not dw as they should have is unreproachable. It is fairley obvious that eq's team needs to spend more time focusing on game playability instead of it's marketability. Honestly I really like this game, I like my warrior. I just wish the keepers would develop it tend it and turn it into the great game it can be. Instead of simple focussing on marketshares and advertising it.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
