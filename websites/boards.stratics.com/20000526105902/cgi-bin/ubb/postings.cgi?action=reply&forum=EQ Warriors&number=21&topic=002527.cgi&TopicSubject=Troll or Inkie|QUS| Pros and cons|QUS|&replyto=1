<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by voards:
[B]i'm having fun with my dark elf warrior. it's a lot of fun being unique.  :) the plate looks good, except for the bronze helmet with those orange horns. 

i might have been able to do better on stats. if i could do it over, i'd take 5 or 10 off of dex and put it into str, but i still think i'm doing well. as he's getting twinked to some extent by my druid as a side project so i can group with some friends' alternates, i'm not as worried about loot. his stats are pretty balanced, and i love the high intelligence.

also, i think an agnostic DE can go more places with than a troll can, but i have not tried faydwer yet. i might do a suicide run to check out how the locals like me. he was not kos in rivervale or misty, and was only glared at threateningly at the cleric guild in rivervale.

the only advantage i can see to the troll aside from raw stats is the regeneration, and the slam ability large races get. this is balanced out by the size, and need for large equipment. you're also KOS in a lot of places, and the low int may hinder you on skill development at first.

The only time I feel a twinge of jealousy towards my larger friends is in the HP department.  The higher stamina and base hp of the larger races are an advantage, I think--at 33d level, I have a base of 1152 HP unbuffed; that's with 81 stamina (+6 comes from the charred BP I'm wearing until I can swing a crafted BP).  And I would like slam.<P>Still, I love the ultravision, the look of my character, the high intelligence, and the mobility--I've never had a worse reaction from anyone than "glares threateningly" regardless of where I've been (I've never conned the Faydark elf guards, though; not sure if I'm KOS there or not).  Only once have I actually been attacked by one of these glarers--the little cleric on the way into Rivervale.  So we can move around fairly well.<P>Oh, I'm a Rallos Zek worshipper, by the way.  I'd steer clear of Innoruuk when choosing your deity.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Tessa</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Oops.

At 32 I have 1085hp unbuffed, and am getting 34hp a level (hitpoints per level went up 2 or 3 after 30) so that would put you about 60hp behind me, with my 105 stamina. <P>Not that big a loss, just one extra full damage hit.. small sacrifice for being unique I'd say.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>Now those ogres with their 147 stamina would have a different story to tell I'm sure, but I'll just ignore them.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Thrud Gutchewer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I thank you all..

I would have put 10 into sta and 5 into dex, possibly a bit more towards dex... ah well.<P>When I made him, I was not overly concerned with str as I knew there were buku items to get it higher.  I put in enought str to give me a good base (80 base str) and depend on items from there.  It is still up in the air as to whether that was a good idea or not...<P>As for faction, I am basically banned from the dwarf continent but it's not because of base faction... I rather killed some slaves in crushbone some time back (hehe, "oops"...)  I am trying to save my faction in Ak'Anon so I can bank there, but I am going to have to do some mass mino slayings one day...  No, you can't bank in these cities by default, you have to really work the faction thing to be able to do it.<P>All of my skills are fully developed within the first half bubble of level so maxing my skills is not a problem at all.<P>Of course, I also worship Rallos Zek (the True God of War!)<P>I've only met one other inkie warrior.

I wore banded up until level 26, which worked fine with strength 95 (note that 95 strength to a Half Elf--who can only wear medium--is like having 80-85 strength on a Dark Elf or other small race), but when I made the fateful trip to Sol B (to buy Medium Bronze) I learned how bad it can be.  Fortunately, I wasn't stuck at 96/95 for long, having realized that I was ripe for some +STR stuff, and there were a few cheap things that took care of that.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Tessa</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">As a dark elf, I put most of my points into strength, myself, to get it up to a base 90; this seems to be about standard if you're wanting to run a class that's armor dependent.  My others I put into raising my agility to 100 because at the time it was thought to raise your AC more than it evidently does.  If I had it to do over, I'd probably put the points into dexterity to help a bit more with procs and critical hits.<P>Anyway, I currently have a modified strength of 116 when I have my LoW equiped.  I don't use any stat raising items that don't also give an armor bonus (with the exception of earrings--I'm still sticking with a couple of onyx ones as I have other spending priorities at the moment).  That's enough for an almost full set of crafted (not resized--never know when I might want to create a new warrior that takes medium or large), my LoW, my two one handed slashing weapons, a bow and some arrows, and a bag with 20 each of food, water and bandages.  I can't carry a huge amount of loot, so I just hit the bank a little more often.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
