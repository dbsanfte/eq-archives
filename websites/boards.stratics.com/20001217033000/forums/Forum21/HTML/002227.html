</FONT><HR>Yes this is going to be a rant but this has got to be one of the flat out worst weeks for me in EQ, espsically surprising since I have hardly played at all. <P><BR>The week seems to have started with the usual planes nonsens. In my constantly changing views of what my chances of getting any planear gear are they have returned to 0. Between tweeking the plane so that Hate is harder and decreasing the drop rates of the armor (I did not realize that one every 8 hours was too many) that I not have 0 chance of getting this stuff. <P><BR>Then Abashi posts some utter bull**** about melee and warriors that prooves that he has not clue as to what the warrior's life is like in the current Norrath. First he says that a properly equipped buffed warrior can solo a 37th Hill Giant. First question what buffs does this solo warrior have? Since we dont self-buff he could not have been soloing. At best he was powerleveling. He says he went 3 and 0. No warrior has yet posted they can solo any HG blue (35+) or green with gear ranging from mine to mostly potato armor.<P><BR>Then, for some stupid reason Abashi decides to test a 50th warrior against a 50th necros pet with the full package from the necro (2 daggers, augment death, whatever else necros do to their dead things). Well since the daggers are a speed buff, our soloing 50th ogre gets Swift Like the Wind and Reson (for the augment) etc...and still lost to the pet. Gee this may sound familiar, but warriors who are buffed arnt soloing. If I could solo while dragging Veronika and Story along with me then it would be a group (and thusly I woudl be buffed). After loosing the first round, Abashi says he changed tactics then won. He wont say what he did. Personally I believe that he either gave it a rust 2h sythe or went after the caster. Neitehr one of which is a reflection of the damage output of a pet in a PvE situation.<P><BR>The reason this is the fight debated (and it is stupid IMHO pets make wonderful tanks after ther first) is that it is a distilation of the classic PvE situation. Any buff I can get, can be cast on a pet. The reverse is not true (and I am not sure how I would feel about Soliel casting Aumgent Death on me). <P><BR>Then in this same pet vs warrior debate Abashi has the balls to day that crafted is not 50th level gear, at best it is mid level gear. If it is not what the **** am I suposed to be wearing at this point? Indilocite? Things I have only seen drop 3 times I have supposed to have a full suit of? Bugger off. Go play a warrior, on a real server then tell me we are doing ok. BS!<P><BR>Now I am thrilled that Verant has woken up to the fact that mages pets dont get DW only double attack but it is hitting me at the 100% worst time. The last think I need need to compete with is a focused Poo with Burnout3, SLTW, hitting for 60 with delay 19 and 20 daggers and more HP than me. I am thrilled for the mages but this is just no more nail in the coffen in melee.<P><BR>Then there is the other statement by Abashi that really burns my shorts. That becuase casters die more they get to bind closer. Where the heck did he come up with that. Maybe that is true before until 20th but after that (when the mana cost of gate is small) I sure spent more time dying than any caster and most hybrids. I cant count the number of times I died after some idiot pulled the wizards on the ledge in LG only to have the casters gate out, the monks and SK FD, the paladins using ther LoH to get out leaving me to hold the bag.<P><P>------------------<BR>You know, I wish I could be an arse-whupper because I'm a big ol' barb warrior who's learned to fight well, not because I happened to find some sword on a high level fish/frog/lizard/god. -Gnorst son of Gnorst<P>Kailyn Longstride<BR>50th Warrior, Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002227.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Can+I+rant...bad+week+for+melee">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>Thats what we are here for Kailyn, RANT ON BROTHA!!<P>Seriously though, I too wondered what "tactics" could be used in a melee match considering there are not "movement" tactics to speak of. I think one possible "tactic" that Abashi could have used is one that I do with all my melee characters- Carry Pumice stones with me at all times. So when you start to solo that necro pet, you debuff him. Bang, you should win.<P>The other tactic is collecting a potion from the Runed Lava Elemental. This gives you a 16 pt damage shield. So using those 2 "tactics" you could probably solo a HG / Necro pet pretty easily.<P>I think what really pisses me off is STILL our inability to use our Defense and Hitpoints effectively in a group. Last night when I was in the Guk King room for about 5 hours... I was with a Ranger friend of mine. He's lvl 39... and was using Ashenwood Short Spear and Dragoon dirk to work on his piercing skills. So most of the night he wasn't getting hit / taking damage. Then... we lost our Ice Comet and I told him for the next King to whip out his Dual EBWs because we needed maximum damage output.<P>So the next King spawns, and even with my taunting using Ykesha + Amy whip + FBSS, the King was hitting the damn ranger (with NO FBSS) A LOT more then me. I dunno, maybe it just seemed that way because the ranger was only 39.<P>Even so, a lvl 50 warrior with nice weapons and FBSS should be able to taunt a solo mob and keep it on him at all times or with a much higher success rate then 50% of the time.<P>A lot of warriors rant that we should have skills that cap at 255 like the other melee classes, be it defense, offence, a "specialized" weapon, what have you. Personally, if *I* could only pick one skill to cap at 255 it would be TAUNT!!!<P><P>------------------<BR>Grimdar Hillmover of Rodcet Nife<BR>50th Dwarven Warrior<BR>32nd Dwarven Paladin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002227.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Can+I+rant...bad+week+for+melee">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">

</FONT><HR>I must admit that i'm feeling a little inadequate as a player too.  I think the post by Abashi was what started it all.  That and grouping with a similarly leveled paladin that had a mith 2hander.  Here was this hybrid tank (with loh) doing as much damage as me but also healing, buffing, and nuking.  What's worse is that he went the ac route and therefore had comparable ac to me.  This is not a rant against paladins.  I can't taunt off a ranger with ssoys.  Sk's can go anywhere and do as much damage as me with a mith 2hander.  <P>So what sets us apart now?  Perhaps i was blissfully ignorant before and am now just realizing that we are just punching bags that pull.  I think what set it off is talking to several level 50 warriors that have shelved their primes and started necros.  Maybe i'll do the same soon.<P>------------------<BR>"First you cleave the knee, then you cleave the head."<P>Meyer Anklebane,<BR>on taking down Hill Giants<BR>43 Halfling Warrior, Xegony<P>"I am NOT a smurf!

</FONT><HR>Well, I am so with you on this one.... I have been playing a warrior forever....dont get me wrong...I love being a Tank...BUT....i repeat BUT they need to fix us so we can do our job.<P>The improved monks two ways...higher skill caps....and AUTO haste....   This made it much harder for me to do our job...taunt the mob off him and take the damage.<P>I have been level 50 for about 2 months and have yet to solo a HG successfully.....Its not worth trying because 9 times out of 10 even if you might win...you look like you are going to die (ie get down to a bubble) so you run to the zone....<P>Even on a funnier note....I can not beat up a level 35 gnome guard because with that Short sword he can hit for about 83 and does it quite often....<P>I also do not have much planes armor mainly due to the low drop rate and even if some drops good luck winning the lotto....<P>I am usually found wearing a combination of mith and crafted.....<P>Then the kicker of it all.....Give us a new skill that suppossedly only has a chance when we are berserk....LOL....Unless you are about to die...one does not stay berserk when fighting mobs in LGUK, SOLB, or Planes that hit in excess of 100 sometimes 200....YOU WILL DIE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so this skill is useless....<P>Anyway enough ranting......All I really think we need to fix us is raise the melee skills and most important Raise the skill cap for taunt to 255(PLEASE)<P>I can live with doing less damage but I cannot be useful in a group if I can not taunt the mobs off the casters or other tanks....<P>Grak<P>Kill em all let Innoruk sort em out!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002227.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Can+I+rant...bad+week+for+melee">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>Yes they do.  Cause casters are boring, but powerful.  Pet casters rule EQ- it sucks, but it is true.  This whole debacle has spread a mailse of discontentment throughout the warrior comunity.  I can see it here and feel it in myself.  It has caused me to get down on the class I love and the character I love to play, because DAMIT we want to be viable too (and not just with uber-hard to get- read CAMP for- gear).  I don't really want to play a caster to feel like I am powerful.  I think I'd rather quit playing.

</FONT><HR>*shrug* <P>I got 2 warriors as 'twinks'. gnome and a half elf. Hell, I wanted to play a warrior from the start, but my friends needed a cleric, so here I am. <P>But you're dead right. Warriors need *some* way to super taunt a mob. All the other hybrids can pop a spell or too and *blammo*, mob's all over them. Warriors are left with pure damage and the taunt button.<P>Frankly, it's not good enough.<P>Grimdar has to be one of the better taunters I've had the pleasure to group with, but he's right, that ranger got wailed on. I know because I was dumping Sheals into him. The reason he was getting rocked wasn't because he was outdamaging Grimdar, but because he cast A) stinging swarm. A 150 dam DoT that cranks Mobs out, so it turned on him. That DoT combined with his damage shield kept the mob on him for a while. Then later when the mob got to about half, he snared it, and was brutally beaten again.<P>Now, Grimdar was doing around *twice* the damage the ranger was (FBSS + hit 30% more)  as well as spamming taunt the entire time (guessing here) and *still* couldn't keep the king off him when the ranger cast snare.<P>*sigh* The problem is I can't think og any way to convey this as effectively as it needs to be to get some improvement done.<P>You know, Abasihi said something about the SK/Pally patch that really stuck in my craw.<P>"It's to help them draw more hits. Heck, if a class complains because the mob doesn't beat on them enough, who are we to argue?"<P>Who indeed? I think that said all we needed to know, so... what's the solution?<P>Keryath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=21&topic=002227.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=EQ+Warriors&TopicSubject=Can+I+rant...bad+week+for+melee">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">
