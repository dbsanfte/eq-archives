Woo!

What's funny is that I've ALWAYS wanted an EBW.  Waaaaay back in the dim mists of time, when my main character was a magician and I was toying around with an Erudite Paladin, I wanted one even then.  I mean, this is back when the Electrum Bladed Wakizashi quest involved chatting with Lorg Grimrot and going into the SK guild in Neriak.  And even then I was determined to eventually get one for my Paladin.

I dunno why I was so taken with them.  I think that it's mainly 'cause my image of my Paladin was the quick finesse fighter, as opposed to the big crushing fighter, and the EBW fit that image to a T.

Well, I stopped playing the Paladin at 11th level and haven't played her in months.  But I'm pleased to have finally gotten the EBWs.  I've been drooling over them for almost a year.

Much thanks to Shar of Rodcet =)<BR>-Keryath<P>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>NOTE: this is a post I put up on my home BBS, the Ranger's Glade, but felt it was appropriate to post it here as well. All references to other posts are ones on the Ranger's Glade: <P>I promised that I would post the results of my tests through a log parser so here they are. I will try to be as concise and to the point as possible with my results to prevent this post from turning into a book.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif"> As a result, certain details that I'm judging as trivial will be left out. <P>TEST PARAMETERS: Subjects, the Greater Kobolds of Solusek B, due to their raw melee power (ability to hit for 80+ dmg max) and ease to pull solo for good testing results. Each test was a series of 4 GKs for a total of 10 test runs done (40 GK total). I used myself as the base for these tests: a lvl 50 Ranger with all combat skills maxed, wielding a Revulent Whip (5dmg and 14dly) and a Flux Bladed Axe (7dmg and 22 dly, with a 150dmg proc). Wanted a proc'ing weapon to test the overall affects of procs in battle vs. a faster weapon with no procs in the primary hand. <P>NOTE: the following results would apply to Rangers, Warriors, Bards, SK's, and Paladins, but not to Rogues and Monks. Reason being is there are several rumors that certain stats affect them in ways that don't apply to the other melee classes, so I leave this research to someone else to prove or disprove. <P>RESULTS: <BR>DODGE: The ability to Dodge does not seem affected by any stat. No discernable differences in any test. <P>PARRY and RIPOSTE: There was a noticeable difference in the frequency of Parry and Riposte when using a DEX of 190, compared to using a DEX of 145 and 110. No difference was seen between a DEX of 145 and a 110. There may be a possible bonus applied to these skills when DEX is above 150+. However, the increased ability to Parry and Riposte did not change the overall damage taken in any discernable means in the tests where it was noted. Thus, DEX should not be driven up just to help Parry and Riposte. <P>STRENGTH: STR ranged from 205 to 155 in the testing. No discernable differences were noted in overall combat. Hit ratios remained constant in all eight tests (hit with a bit over half of my swings -average of 65% in all test). Only things that seem to affect Hit Ratios are the attackers level vs. the lvl of the mob being attacked, and skill lvls. Only change was to max. possible damage done, and this did not affect overall combat. <P>DEXTERITY: Test ranged from 190, to 145, to 110 for DEX. Did not affect the ability to hit the opponent in any way at all. Hit ratios remained constant (65% average) with no discernable differences in all of the eight tests. These tests only include the results of DEX based on melee - I have not tested it in relation to Archery yet. DEX does make a difference in the number of "critical hits" done by Warriors (and most likely by Rangers using Bows), and the frequency of Procs. 2 Notes on Proc'ing weapons and their relation to DEX: <BR>1) A proc'ing weapon in the off-hand is not affected by DEX in any discernable way. No real differences in total proc damage were noted when using a Flux Bladed Axe in the off-hand between a 190, 145, and 110 DEX. Damage remained constant in all test runs. <BR>2) A proc'ing weapon in the primary hand is affected by DEX for certain. No discernable differences in total proc damage were noted between a 190 DEX and a 145 DEX. There was a noticeable difference in total proc damage between a 145 DEX and a 110 DEX - around a 50% difference. Possibly the bonuses start to kick in after 110 sometime. Referencing other peoples' posts about this subject, my guess would be around 130+. Even in the primary hand, however, large amounts of AC should not be sacrificed in order to drive up DEX. Proc's are too unreliable to make it a part of a Ranger's (or any melee class) survivability for reasons noted below. <P>ARMOR CLASS: This is one of two things that if changed, caused the test results to greatly differ on all test runs (the second thing I'll get to in a bit). Comparisons were done with an AC of 795 and an AC of 755. I used methods of reaching a 795 AC with just raw AC items in a couple tests, while the other tests I reached a 795 AC with AGI buffs and Clerical/ENC AC buffs. It would seem that it doesn't matter how a person maxes their AC. Test results showed that the higher the AC, the less damage a person would take, no matter what means they used to max it. NOTE: AGI can be used to increase AC and be just as effective, but not as efficient. Typically a person would have to increase AGI several points just for an increase of 1 or 2 AC - an item in its place (if we are talking about an item that gives a bonus to AGI) that just gives raw AC may be more efficient in increasing the user's max AC. <P>The differences in the damage taken between 795 AC and an AC of 755 ranged from around 800-1000 points of damage in each test run (remember, a "test run" is 4 GK). Just 40 AC seems to make a remarkable difference. Damage taken in each of the two comparison ACs' remained fairly constant no matter what stats I had. In other words, the overall test data seems to suggest that sacrificing AC in order to drive up your stats is fairly useless for a melee class. <P>PROC'ING weapons in the primary hand vs. a notably FASTER weapon with no procs: This is the second thing that I mentioned, that if changed, yields greatly different results in over-all combat. Test results show, that even if you have a proc'ing weapon in your primary hand and a DEX of 145+, that you will be better off to have a NOTABLY (stress notably) faster weapon in your primary hand instead. Tests showed that with a whip in my primary hand I did more melee damage per second and finished off my opponents faster than when I had a Flux bladed axe in my primary. Even with the total proc damage done in the test runs, each test run lasted longer with the Axe armed in the primary, and as a result, I did less melee dmg per second, and took MORE melee dmg per second, despite my AC because of the lengths of the battles. I'll show a few comparisons below: (primary weapon listed first/off-hand weapon listed second) <P>Whip/Axe (759 AC & 145 DEX) <BR>Melee dmg/sec: 16.34 <BR>Melee dmg taken/sec: 6.81 (total of 2,205 dmg taken) <BR>Non-melee total dmg: 707 (procs with 3dmg barbcoat are these results) <P>Axe/Whip (759 AC & 145 DEX) <BR>Melee dmg/sec: 12.52 <BR>Melee dmg taken/sec: 7.37 (total of 2,615 dmg taken) <BR>Non-melee total dmg: 1,492 <P>Whip/Axe (795 AC & 110 DEX) <BR>Melee dmg/sec: 16.64 <BR>Melee dmg taken/sec: 4.41 (total of 1,410 dmg taken) <BR>Non-melee total dmg: 678 <P>Axe/Whip (795 AC & 110 DEX) <BR>Melee dmg/sec: 12.35 <BR>Melee dmg taken/sec: 6.26 (total of 2,881 dmg taken) <BR>Non-melee total dmg: 627 <P>Whip/Axe (795 AC & 190 DEX) <BR>Melee dmg/sec: 15.74 <BR>Melee dmg taken/sec: 4.76 (total of 1,657 dmg taken) <BR>Non-melee total dmg: 852 <P>Axe/Whip (795 AC & 190 DEX) <BR>Melee dmg/sec: 13.14 <BR>Melee dmg taken/sec: 5.47 (total of 2,460 dmg taken) <BR>Non-melee total dmg: 1,374 <P>Seems the old addage of "a good offense is a good defense" would apply here. NOTE: only if the non-procing weapon has a notably faster dly than the proc'ing one should these conclusions be applied. Also these results will only relate to those dual-wielding weapons. People using 2H weapons in battle with have to run their own tests to see which is better. But in general, proc'ing weapons should not be relied upon to make you a better melee'r in combat as they can turn out to be a penalty to you in combat when compared to faster weapons. (pre-nerf Mistwalkers wouldn't apply to this as well as some of the Planar warrior weapons considering the nature of the proc's). <P>Hope this helps some of my fellow Rangers out there concerned about what equip they should wear. All in all, my findings confirm what has already been posted by others that have done similar tests with log parsers on this board: AC is King for the melee class. <P>Shar Stormcloud <BR>Faydark Champion of Kelethin <P>=-=-=-=-=-=-=<BR>Follow ups:<BR>=-=-=-=-=-=-=<P>Something that should be noted about what I posted. My astute Ranger brethren pointed out that between similar ACs my damage taken/sec changes when it should not. If you look at my 4 examples that I posted with a 795 AC, my stats remain the same between each example, and yet every time I have the Whip in my primary hand, I take less damage per second than when I have the Axe in my primary hand. A longer battle would increase the total amount of damage taken, but since my AC and stats are remaining the same, my damage taken per second should as well. <P>The only thing different is what weapon I'm using in my primary. Our thinking right now is that its possibly due to stamina loss or health loss. The whip is a light weapon with minimal stamina loss, but the axe is not...it drains my stamina. Each battle shows that with the whip, I take less damage per second so perhaps as my stamina drops, it affects my ability to avoid damage - thus the increase in my damage per second when using the stamina draining axe in my primary. <P>It could be based on health as well. The whip, I destroyed my opponents in less time, so perhaps no penalties where given to me in my ability to avoid damage for a low health. With the axe, the battles took longer, and my health did drop dangerously low at times with some of the Kobolds (bubble and a half), so possibly a penalty was given to me to avoid damage at a low health. <P>Only way to test this: run the same set of tests again but with someone around casting a stamina recovery spell, and then run them again with someone keeping me healed. <P>Shar Stormcloud <BR>Faydark Champion of Kelethin <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Keryath</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">which basiclly just affirms what I already believed:<P>AC is god, and gimmie a better ratio weapon rather than some stinky proc =P</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Kailyn of Povar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Indeed you are correct.

At the time I was wielding Painbringer and EBW with Painbringer in my primary hand. (for the "procs")- figuring that "2 delay difference isn't that big of a deal". Then, after about 2 nights of killing I decided to switch em around just to see what happened. The guards dropped MUCH faster and thus- I took less damage. Previously, every fight I would need at least 1 Complete Heal. After switching I could sometimes kill a guard with NO heals (full cleric buffs + symbol).
