</FONT><HR>I have been reading over the message boards over the past few days and I have noticed a general concern as to the effectiveness of unarmed combat.  There is a solution that I believe would make the tool users happy without upseting us slappers.  Create more powerful weapons.  That way we wouldn't be stuck with impotent characters, and you would be dishing out the damage you feel you should.  I don't know if this is something that can be done on the actual server or if a patch would need to be downloaded.  At any rate, I think that would be the fairest solution.  Personally I haven't really seen a problem yet.  Thanks for listening...and careful, Dereth is full of dangers!<P>Flynn Bloodwolf.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000921.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=Nerfing+Unarmed+Combat.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>I agree.  I have a level 23 unarmed fighter and a level 22 blademaster.  For the longest time, I wasn't sure which character would be my main one.  My unarmed charcater could deal out higher damage initially (at around lvl 12).  However, as my blademaster got better, he caught up and, with a great sword, actually does much better in combat.  While unarmed fighting is pretty fun (espescially the speed), I think that in the end, the edge (while perhaps slight) goes to the weapon-user, assuming he is using anything other than a starter weapon.  Additionally, in unarmed fighting, stamina loss is a huge problem as fighting and defense skills increase.  In short, both are viable characters.  Blademaster is my choice, however, given the cooler weapons available and, at least at this point in my research, a slight edge in combat.  Nothing needs to be nerfed -- Turbine has done their homework and created balanced character options (in fact, a buddy of mine has created a lvl 33 dagger-fighter that drops monsters as fast as any player I've seen that same level). <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000921.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=Nerfing+Unarmed+Combat.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>I also have been reading a lot of the posts here concerning the effectiveness of weapons, apparent advantages of unarmed combat over weapon use, unfair advantages for mages and archers, etc.  While I agree with most of the posts (I have a blademaster as my main character, but I also have an unarmed expert who is pretty fun to play), I think I would be amiss if I didn't point out one thing:  roleplaying.<P>Believe me, I am not pointing fingers at anyone, but shouldn't we all be in AC to roleplay?  Isn't that the intent?  Don't get me wrong, I want a powerful character because he is more fun to play, but I use swords on Naamor because he is a long-time character of mine (a fighter from D&D way back in the early 80's who then became a Paladin in AD&D, and has had various incarnations since then  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> ).<P>Even if swords were totally bunk in AC, he would still wield a sword because THAT is Naamor.  I am not saying that perhaps some adjustments aren't needed, but I am a little disappointed that the majority of the griping seems to be based on power in the game.  When I was a budding RPG'er I will admit... my goals were usually power-based: I wanted a stronger character people would like at and say "wow".  As I matured, I found that the true fun of RPG is BEING the character!  For those of you who have not experienced the true thrill of serious roleplaying, let me tell you... it ROCKS!<P>For example:  when I developed Naamor all those years ago, I decided he would not trust magic.  To this day, Naamor has been involved in several games (including Diablo and soon to be Diablo 2) and in several of these, magic is quite powerful.  I could easily make him a stronger character by implementing some magic skills to augment his combat, but that would be ooc.<P>My bottom line as I close this tirade is this:  if you are constantly obsessed with making your character the "best" or "most powerful" (I have seen TONS of posts on here about this is better than this, or what skills make the best this, etc.) then you are not enjoying roleplaying to its fullest.  Develop a character in your mind, give him/her a personality, background, etc... then build him/her to match your template.  And above all, stick to it.  If you character is crass and rude, stick to your guns and play it out.  You will get a lot more out of the game, and those around you will as well.<P>Respectfully,<P>Naamor<BR>Leafcull</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000921.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=Nerfing+Unarmed+Combat.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>Perhaps.. it's fun.. or roleplaying for these "best" people to have their characters the best they can make them. again as i've said before. best is a matter of personal prefrence in all cases.. perhaps they are roleplaying or maybe they are just having fun trying to make their characters the 'best"! Not trying to put anyone down or make any disparaging comments.. just something to think about.. perhaps broaden the minds of all.. =) thank you and have a nice day! <P>------------------<BR>Pertial Redmond <BR>AC MorningThaw Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000921.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=Nerfing+Unarmed+Combat.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR><BR>I guess I can see both sides.<P>I am a roleplayer, and my primary character is a highly modified Blademaster. I spend most of my time in AC playing him, though if I wanted to powergame, two of my other characters would probably be a better choice...One is an Unarmed Combat specialist and the other is an Archer. But I want to roleplay a Samurai, so I play a Sho Blademaster.<P>At the same time, I do have a problem with Unarmed Combat vs Sword...Before you start flaming, I do NOT think they should nerf Unarmed Combat. It does tend to be very effective, but my biggest problem is that it is so much cheaper than sword in terms of skill points. You can become specialized in Unarmed Combat for 12 points less than it would cost to specialize in Sword. Why is that?<P>If we accept, for the sake of arguement, that the skills all work fine the way they are...what is the reason for having Sword cost so much more than Unarmed? <P>In terms of game balance, I don't see it. Those 12 points are a big deal. It will take the Blademaster 16 levels to aquire the same set of skills that the Unarmed Combat character started with, and by that point the Unarmed character has another 12 points they've spent on new skills.<P>If it is for the sake of realism - that Unarmed Combat is easier to learn than Sword, then I don't agree with that, either. I've studied both, and it is much simpler to inflict damage when you have a weapon. That's why people developed weapons to begin with.<P>I am totally against nerfing Unarmed...I just think it should cost more, or Sword should cost less...<P>-Jn-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000921.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=Nerfing+Unarmed+Combat.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>Agreed Jn.  Ask anyone who is in martial arts if they think it is easy to learn.  Another thing about weapons.  I don't know if this is how it is or not, but if Turbine were going for a realistic approach, there would be many more enchanted staves and daggers out there than axes or maces.  Mages, the ones who would have been doing the enchanting (this is in regards to prefab weaponry found in Dereth) would be much more interested in enchanting the weapons that they used.  There would however, be a large number of enchanted swords as well, since that is the everyman weapon.  Of course, there would be the occasional enchanted axe that the mage banged out for his favorite tank  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif">.  Just some thoughts while I plod along at work, waiting for my work day to end.<P>Yours,<P>Flynn Bloodwolf.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000921.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=Nerfing+Unarmed+Combat.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>I am not doubting that those who "powergame" find it fun, but I doubt very seriously that most of those who "powergame" have tried truly roleplaying a character.  I have been playing RPGs for 18 years now, and have done PLENTY of both... and I have played with many of both.  I can honestly say that I have never met anyone who had tried both powergaming and roleplaying and found the former to be more fun.<P>But to each his own, I just think it detracts from the game to have a lot of people trying to make their character in an RPG as powerful as possible while disregarding character development.  As for martial arts, I have had 3 years of it and I would NEVER claim it is easy.  Anyone who would is obviously delusional.  I have never trained in swords (although I have friends who fence and am eager to learn someday) but my guess would be it is not as difficult to inflict a fatal blow with a sword as it would be with bare hands.<P>If I were to set the stats, I would have unarmed do MUCH less damage than armed.  However, this is not the case in AC.  Powergamers should feel free to take unarmed and exploit its benefits to the max... as for me, I will use a sword, even if it does only half the damage of unarmed.  It is a matter of style and preference.  I would not be opposed to seeing some balance (I don't think making them cost the same is balanced either...) but then again, I chose swords even knowing the limitations, so I will not be unhappy should it stay the same either.<P>Naamor,<BR>Leafcull</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000921.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=Nerfing+Unarmed+Combat.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR><BR>Flynn,<P>As long as we're going to try to rationalize the distriution of magical weapons, you should keep in mind that most mages consider melee combat a last restort, so most magic weapons were probably created on commision. If that were the case, you could argue that the more commonly used weapons would be in higher demand, so there would be more of them made to begin with...which, coincidentally, makes for decent game balance - everyone has an about equal chance of getting ahold of one.  <P>Sometimes I think I've been gaming too long...usually about the time I start thinking about this sort of thing.

</FONT><HR>I sent in a feedback to the ac folks awhile back about this same issue.  It is 100% BS that a unarmed char should do the same damage as a sword, axe or spear weilding guy of the same level, then when you look at the fact that they do much more (it is frustraiting when my grrls 15th lvl unarmed char puts out twice the damage as my lvl 19 warrior).  I dont know what a happy solution to this problem is, I know more powerful weapons is not it, then you will have 100% gear warriors such as EQ.  I wouldnt mind seing something reasonable like one point of damage for every three or four hits or something, having been a boxer, beating stuff down is hard on the paws, regardless of how you strengthen them.  Or you could just make the weapons more powerful, not secret powerful weapons SoLL and what not, but do something to make all of them more powerful.  For as far as roleplaying, everyone is in this game for different things,  I love to RP, but it is frustraiting to have something 1/4 down and have a unarmed char four levels below you get loot rights every time.   It isnt a stat flaw either...<P>Str 120 (140 with a sheild I use)<BR>Stam 140<BR>Cord 110<BR>Quick 100<BR>Focus 45<BR>Self 10<P>I use a hammer with Blood II, even against things that you would think would be weak against bludgeoning I have the same prob when fighting with unarmed folks.<P>My biggest problem is if I am out hunting in the middle of no where and go down my hammer is history (Blood II and Defender II), I constantly see the Uber Class (Sho unarmed, Item so they can gate, life so they can kill through walls) out in the same areas I am in with no fear of using there weapon because they dont use one.. and they do more damage than the rest of us tool users.

</FONT><HR>There are two issues at stake here -- and the more they get talked about as one, the less likely it is that anyone will be satisfied with anyone else's point.<P>The first debate is over which is more powerful -- unarmed combat or sword.  This is an in-game question that, to some extent, can only be answered individually over time.  Many say the two balance out in later levels, and I'm inclined to agree at this point.  Some also say it has to do with weapon choice and the availability of powerful weapons to counter an imbalance that occurs during game play.  Others say don't worry about it -- just enjoy the roleplaying aspect of playing who you created and don't sweat the power unless you are a powergamer.  It would seem then, that most people think that Unarmed does not need to be nerfed and that Swords do not need to be beefed up.  Whatever one's answer to this question is -- it doesn't seem to be too much of a problem.<P>The second debate still is unanswered.  I'm not sure it can be answered by any of us who aren't involved in the game creation.  Perhaps we are all missing something.  This is, by the way, the quesiton I'm most interested in -- and the one that often gets side-stepped in favor of discussing balance in the game.  Read Joe Napalm's first post in this string (or ones in other strings from him and myself).  They'll explain it nicely. So...what's the question? <P>Why is sword so much more expensive to learn than Unarmed Combat?  <P>We can't even decide which of the two is more effective, but the Turbinites obviously think sword is the better one if they buy into the idea that you should pay more for better quality.  We who are playing the game don't seem to know which is better -- if we did there wouldn't be multiple strings on the same subject.  There is room for debate, and yet one skill is so much more expensive to get.<P>This is interesting to me, but I'm not sure anyone can give us an answer except perhaps the folks over at Turbine...<P>&gt;Bugly&lt;<p>[This message has been edited by TheBugly (edited November 23, 1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000921.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=Nerfing+Unarmed+Combat.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>i have played this game for only a short time, but i noticed one thing, I like unarmed combat, but i am also trained in the blade, and yes at first the unarmed do more damage 9although you must be epuiped with an unarmed weapon, not just fists like a boxer). This does come at a price, stamina, i eat more food in AC to get my stamina back up that i ever did playing EQ. Do i think that unarmed combatants have a very big advantage or people who play swords, no.. but IRL it is harder to dodge a quick fist that it is to dodge someone swinging a hefty bat or sword.

</FONT><HR>Actually - It's a lot harder to dodge the sword, believe me...I've taken enough bamboo to the noggin to know that. <P>The reason is this - someone with a sword has significantly more reach than with an empty hand, and contrary to popular belief swords do not weigh all that much. If it is properly balanced, you can swing a sword almost as fast as just your fist - at the hilt...due to length, however, the tip of the blade is moving much faster than you could ever punch. There is also a lot more you have to get out of the way of. To dodge a punch, move your head out of the way and they miss. To dodge a sword, move your head out of the way and lose an arm or a leg.<P>Of course, Real Life combat is much too complex to simulate in AC - I would be more than happy just to have balance. Make Unarmed more powerful than War Magic if you want - just make it cost more skill points.<P>-Jn-<P>[This message has been edited by Joe Napalm (edited November 23, 1999).]<P>[This message has been edited by Joe Napalm (edited November 23, 1999).]<p>[This message has been edited by Joe Napalm (edited November 23, 1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000921.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=Nerfing+Unarmed+Combat.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans"><P>All times are PST</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans"><A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum71&number=71&thisthread=000921&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum71&number=71&thisthread=000921&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
