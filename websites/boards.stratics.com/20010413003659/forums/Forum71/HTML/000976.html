</FONT><HR>After playing the upgraded game last night i was very pissed off at what they did to the mages. The warriors complained that the mages were to strong and they didnt have a chance at getting kills when a mage was around, so instead of fixing the warrior class, they just weakend the mages! WTF!<P>I dont mind that the monsters were made a little harder, mostly the high level monsters that low level fighters had no business camping on anyway, im guilty of that to :-). But why make them super resistant to magic? How are the mages supposed to fight then?  I am a War Mage im supposed to fight!!! <P>I was fighting the same Lugians i have been for the last week, i like how their speed was improved, surprised the heck out of me! But i was really surprised when my level 4 war spells which did 50-60 points of damage the previous night, did barely more than 20 points of damage!! The Lugian who was tough the night before was now almost impossible to kill!!! And it resisted half my spells!!! I was running all night, and was having no fun. <P>The archers and warriors i spoke to said they didnt notice a difference in their class. But now its the mages that are upset because we got screwed! My monarch told me to just create a warrior or archer then, EXCUSE ME!!! I am not going to go back to fighting rabbits and drudges because Turbine "fixed" all the wrong things, i would cancel my subscription before that!!<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>I can see why you upset, but I don't think that adjusting the warrior was the answer. I am not saying that they didn't screw up mages, I do not play one, so I am in no position to comment on that. What I do know is that when I was grouped with a friend who is a Lifemage and we were hunting, I made very few kills. In fact, I was lucky to get in more than two hits on a creature before it was dead. We could kill five or six creatures and I would not be able to loot any of them! The thing that bothered me most about this was that I felt like I was just standing around watching him play. Did I mention that he was 2 or 3 levels below me at the time?? I am not playing AC to make levels or obtain the best items, so it was not a problem of not getting the stuff, and since we were fellowshipped, I was still getting XP, so that was not it either. <P>In every fantasy novel or movie I have read or seen, mages were a rare and somewhat secret creature. They had very strong power, but  were also very limited in some ways. Mages should have some of the greatest abilities in games like AC and EQ, but they should also have some hefty drawbacks IMO. Too many people plays mages I think, which takes away from the mystic of the character. I mean why would anyone want to be anything different, when you can just stand back, cast a few spells to kill something several levels above you, and not even have to get you hands dirty. The way it was, I saw no reason for a mage to group with any other class of character. Playing a mage should be significantly more difficult and require a higher level of dedication. <BR> <BR>So, if you ask me do I think the adjustment to mages was needed... I would have to say 'yes'. I just hope that in the end it will enhance the gameplay in AC for everyone.<P>For the record let me say that these are just my opinions and observations. It is not my intention to offend or provoke, only to share my viewpoint for the purpose of discussion. :-)<P>------------------<BR>Vnayan<BR>Morningthaw Warrior</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>I too do not mean to be disrespectful, but I would have to agree. I think the update was necessary, and does not hinder mages more than it should have in the first place. I myself am not a mage, but my good friend is (she just started the character). Even after the update, she can still kill lv 11 mosswarts at lv 4! True, she has a little help with some nice armor passed on from her previous character, but that is rediculus! A warrior at lv 4, even with yoroi armor, would probably find it very difficult to take these on! But she could kill them before they even got up close. That is the sign of an imbalanced system. You should not have been able to do 40-50 damage to a lugian in the first place. A warrior would be lucky to do 10-20 each time, and they have to sit there and take the hits. Just as when archers were complaining in beta when they fixed the "super bows" problem, mages will complain now. But loosing something you shouldn't have had in the first place really isn't that bad. Be thankful for the time you had with the unfair advantage. Consider it a gift from our friends at Turbine.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>Halken the Bold<BR>Harvestgain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>Hmmmmm, any mages have an opinion? oh btw my character is level 18 with 150 war magic. <P>I know that mages did more damage but they deserve to! What would happen when those monsters did get close to a mage, the mage gets beat down because of low health and has difficulty running because of low speed, and it costs more to be a mage throughout their lives. Mages always have to buy components, and have to wait forever to regenerate their mana after a fight. <P>A warrior on the other hand can find good armor and a good weapon and shield and be good for a long time until they want to uprade. Now mages do less damage, run more, spend more money on regs because they are casting more spells to do the same damage they use to. The least they could have done was increase the speed that mana regens, i am out like 5 minutes after a fight, and mana potions are expensive. Do you call that balance?

</FONT><HR>Too many people here have their head on backwards. A mage and an archer for that matter at low level will cream things that a fighter can't touch till later and thats just the way it is. Idealy as a fighter what you need to do is get some thrown weapons and pepper a mob with them before it gets to you. Once it does you can take down the now already damaged mob alot easier. Any class that has a range attack will be able to take down more than ones without. I think that a change is needed in the mages and I'm not sure that what they did do is the best solution. One of the ways this was curtailed in EQ was the fact that you cannot cast on a mob that is to high ofa level for you to kill. The same with the warriors. They will always miss the mob if it is too high level. This gets rid of some of the problems that AC has with people killing level 33-45 lugians at level 5. Mages spells should be setup so that on any mob that is of equal level had the base chance of succeding and i the mob os lower level is has a much higher chance of succeding and if the mob is higher than the spell will almost never succeded depending on the level of the mob. Turbine would have to decide at what level should you take on what mob. <P>I can't believe how much I hear people complaining because someone else has a better character than them. If they are so great make a character just like them and play it instead. Otherwise shut the hell up and learn to play your class to the best of your ability. My buddies axe wielder passed my mage in level in the beta untill I learned what it was that I should be killing. Then I passed him. Then he discovered that above a certain skill level in both defence and axe that killing banderlings was like putting a hot knife through butter. With all the banderling forts around he again passed me up. If your too damn lazy to go explore then sorry. I happen to have played in the beta and knew where I should hunt up to level 20 or so and so do all of these other level 30+ people/powergamers that just kill everything in sight. <P>With a level cap of 150 noone is high enough level to be judging the long term balance of characters. Warriors flesh out at a much higher level than mages or even archers but if you know what your doing at low leves you can powerlevel just as fast as they can.<P>------------------<BR>'I drank what?'<BR>--Kinada, Morningthaw</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>Oh my gosh, if you are a level 18 mage with 150 war magery and can't kill lugians after the upgrade just as easy then you have'nt been doing your homework.  Every creature has a weak spot and you just have to find it.  I play a lvl 22 war/life mage with 130 in each and can kill them just fine.  Almost as easy as before with very little change in my playing style.  So you need to find their weakness and exploit it.  Turbine even put out in the patch that soft spots are even softer but everything else is hard.  Now you won't have joe blow i am a mage cause everyone thinks its easy just blowing through the game.  It will take a bit more forthought in your attacks and a lot better run skill hehe.<p>[This message has been edited by JTWing (edited November 24, 1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>Hello all. I am finally able to post. Yahooo! Everytime I tried to register before, it would never send me the e-mail with my password. Now I have to use the long name I have chosen, because the proper one is registered to me, without a password to use it. Oh well, back to the topic at hand.<P>I am a lvl 12 war mage with 120 skill. I also do life and enchant item, but they are not concerned here. I'm loving this patch. I went out lasnight and starting shooting flames and snowballs and such at a couple gromnies(rust and azure). Man was I surprised when they ran at me like a bat out of hell. I turned tail and ran for all I am worth, barely escaping. I was left with 3 health and a heart ready to explode from shock. I read later that the patch had changed this. My mistake for not reading it earlier. But you know what? I like it. I had stopped playing this char for a while because I was getting too bored with it. I seamed to be stuck in the middle, where either I killed creatures too easily, and getting bored, or there was no chance in hell I could kill them, and spent most of my time searching for my corpse. So I created a mace fighter, and made lvl 5 first night, about 4 hours. I don't know what people were complaining about with lvling warrior types. Seams just as easy to me. I can actually kill a reedshark pup, and an adult reedshark at the same time. As long as I don't let the adult get behind me(isn't it cool that they go for your soft spot as well??) then he hits me hard. But I digress.<P>Lastnight I popped the mage back in, like I was saying, and it was fun again. No longer could I just run into the mountains a smash a couple lugians. Collect the easy exp and loot, and go look for more. I had to use strategy, and outsmart them(not too hard) but it was more fun then just let go a load of lvl 2 spells, run a little distance, then come back and repeat.<P>So in conclusion, I like the new patch. I may be the only mage who does, but hey, it is making my main char fun again. And that is what the whole damn game is for.<P><BR>Zomax<P>P.S. Sorry for the long post, but I have been bottling it all up til finally I got a password. hehe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>Hey Kinada, I can't help but feel that most of your second paragraph was in response to my post. If that is the case, then I think you completely missed my point. My comments about my mage friend were an effort to backup my conclusions regarding why I thought the patch was justified and nothing more. I will be just as happy to make level 50 as long as I enjoy the game. As I stated, I am not after levels in the first place. If I was, I think I would still be playing EQ. :-P<P>And who brought up powerleveling?? Dereth would be a much better place without people in it who are trying to see how high and how fast they can go. I ignore anyone who I feel is playing for the levels instead of the adventure and atmosphere of the game.<P>------------------<BR>Vnayan<BR>Morningthaw Warrior<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>Here's a quick note I have on Powerleveling (as someone earlier brought it up).<P>The game has been out, what, maybe 1 month (4 weeks) and I've already seen people close to level FOURTY, with HUNDREDS of vassals.  Now if that's not powerleveling, I don't know what is.  I can understand if you put more than 12 hours a day EVERY day for 4 weeks and find the "perfect" things to fight to "up" yourself it's possible, but why the hell is most-everyone in a all-fire hurry to be "the best"?!  I remember the same thing happening over on UO where entire groups of people were talking about "Gawd I can't wait till I get GMX7!".  Sheesh, people, ENJOY the game.  Don't make it into a "I'm better than you are" kinda game.<P>Side note, since I play 4 different characters in the game (Archer, Macefighter, Life/War mage, and Mule) my highest level is 10.  The thing I like about playing multiple characters is it keeps the newness of the game-feel for myself.  If you spent all your time on 1 single character, I can see ya getting in the 30's in Levels already but it would still take some powerleveling to do it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000010&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with the last post, i have been playing since day 2 of retail almost primarily with one character (though i did try a couple others but gave up on them).  I am now a level 13 Blademaster.  I play some days for a long time , others i play just an hour or so.  I am in no rush to get to the Direlands or wherever, i just am having fun.  <BR>Powerlevelling is fine, but if you are doing it because most of your usual companions are level 15 and you havent been on in a while so you want to catch up to them, that's cool but to do it just to impress people that you are level 30 and have 100's of vassals, i'm sorry, but that doesn't impress me.  Usually the only ones it does impress are the newbies who come into the world naked and see this guy all decked out and level 30..WOW.  It was the exact same thing in EQ with people just trying to be the first on the server to reach level 50, who cares.  Just have fun, and relax, it's only a game after all, and if you think you are going to impress and win the hearts of damsels, well, you really should get out more often.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>Vnayan, My post was not really in response to yours. If you take a look at the thread about unarmed being too powerfull compared to swords I say the same thing. I can understand where your coming from though. I play many different characters and I think that the mage is too easy rather than too powerful. Turbine made them harder to play but just as powerful. With the cost of research and just components in general when you get into higher level spells mages tend to need alot of cash so they have to be powerfull. My warrior in the beta needed 2 backpacks just to carry all his trade notes. I had nothing I wanted to buy. Bottom line is that I'm not ripping on your post, I do agree with you that running around with someone that can kill faster than you can get disheartening. A mage can't take hits like a warrior can though. I have a character with melee defence as a specialized skill because if something can't hit you then you have all day (stamina permitting) to kill it. <P>My advise is to take your warrior into the dungeons. I have had more fun trying to complete dungeons that anything else. My mage gets rocked down in a dungeon unless I bring a couple of tanks. Dungeons have alot more treasure as well and a smart mage will be looking for your services as a tank to help get him through a particualrly nasty area. What weapons do you use anyway? <P>Back to mages for a quick second. I have noticed no difference in damage with my mage so long as I use spells that the creature is weak to. Plus with my life magic I can make them even weaker. Mabey I'm just desensitzed from the beta but I don't think that this is that impacting of a change overall. A smart player will have very little to change in his/her play style if anything. Either way, I'm still having fun, and when I do get bored I play a different character...or another game (Res Evil 3 happy, blow up zombies good) anyway I'm rambling now so I'll stop.<P>------------------<BR>'I drank what?'<BR>--Kinada, Morningthaw</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>I wonder if my EQ Stratics Forum account works here...<P>The reason I quit EQ is because of all the powerlevelers around.  In fact, I found the game to be quite small, especially compared to AC (squee!), which led to MANY people just powerleveling.  After awhile I realized that was all there really was (just my opinion).  Another thing I didn't like is how the classes are defined and restricted.  In AC you can CREATE your own class!  My only problem is coming up with titles to suit my characters' abilities!  Oh wait, this thread isn't about powerleveling.<P>I agree with whoever it was that said mage-types should be mysterious and rare, not overplayed by a hundred others who want to be the 'most powerful'.<P>I don't have a whole lot of experience with AC (yet) so I'm not going to put in all my thoughts for fear that I may be flamed/ridiculed because of my ignorance.  If any of the above writing does have 'ignorant' statements, please let me know in a friendly manner rather than a hostile one.  I know I probably seem a bit nervous about writing posts, but I used to submit into the EQ Stratics Shadow Knight Forum on a daily basis where there are many rude people who felt they NEEDED to point out my flaws in the most disrespectable of manners.  That also played a part in my quitting EQ, but not that much of one.<P>-The Duke of Frederick</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>Hi Duke.  Yep, your EQ-stratics ID should work fine since that is what I am doing.  Not sure why you would think that those evil old shadowknights would be nice...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif"><P>Just popped in to read a few AC posts after work.  I still play EQ and don't plan on quitting anytime soon, but you can only read a discussion/rant on camping, twinking, nerfing, etc. so many times before your eyes glaze over.<P>Hope you all are enjoying AC.  I think I wish more people would abandon EQ for AC since our servers are so crowded.<P>I will first I don't know hardly anything about AC, but I find that, in skill-based systems, even though you can design your own character, most folks pick a few sets of complementary skills (because they are the "most poweful" usually) and you tend to wind up with just a few character "archetypes" anyway.  I could be wrong... maybe that doesn't happen in AC.  Also, does AC have the old UO Tank-Mage problem (mages wearing heavy armor)?<P>Ah well, time to go home.  I won't post my Sig since it's just a bunch of EQ chars anyway.  Enjoy AC!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>About mages having no melee defense.  I would have to agree.  All the archetypes have strengths and weaknesses and that's a weakness of the mages.  A weakness of tank types are things like magic defense and the ID skills.  My level 13 blademaster will wade into a bunch of hunter shreths but runs from a bunch of blue phantos wasps.  Gromnies are truly terrifying.  I'm working on it but it'll always be a weak spot.  Likewise, I can't ID much of anything although I have almost everything trained (weapon ID is specialized).  This means that, even though I know that level isn't all that important, it's the only thing I'll get about a monster.<P>If the main point of the patch is to inject more strategy into the game then I'm all for it.  I wonder if the mages who feel like they've been nerfed are the ones who just never took the time to figure out what spells to use on what creatures.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>To answer Silvan's question, yes there are some skills and attributes that are better than others for certain character types, but the variety is amazing. I have not seen any "archetypes" become so prominent to become the majority by any means. It would be very rare indeed to find someone with the same or even similar stats and skills. Everyone seems to have their own preferences, and AC has a lot of customization. I give my advise to newbies on what worked for me, but even then, they tinker a little and put more into something than I did and less in another. There is certainly not a correct way to make a character, there are just so many good combinations...<P>As for tank mages, they would be laughable in AC. Anyone who tries to be a fighter and a mage is going to be much less of a fighter and much less of a mage than their single-minded counterparts. While this hybrid can be somewhat effective simply because you can fight with the aid of spells, but tends to not be as powerful as the "pure" fighters or mages. AC accomplishes this with its attribute and skill system. To be a good fighter you need to specialize in you weapon of choice, melee defense, and maybe healing, or at least train them. To be a good mage you need to specialize or train in your school(s) of choice and maybe mana conversion. You simply cannot have both...ever! You can only specialize in the beginning so you can never get specialized in everything. Even training in all of those skills would take a lot of skill pts, and then you would be mediocre in everything. Then there's the attributes. A mage's attributes are focus and self, a fighter's are strength, endurance, coordination, and quickness. These are obviously opposites. To do both you would have to split your exp, again making you just ok if not poor at everything.<P>Halken the Bold<BR>Harvestgain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F8F0E0">

</FONT><HR>Halken you are absolutly correct.<P> I play a level 20 pure war mage with 160 war magic and i tried to create the popular war/life hybrid but it is hard enough to spread xp in one magic school, let alone two. I reccomend just choosing one school and improve it to the point where you can cast level 4 spells, then go ahead and add another school to supplement the first. <P>For example i will be getting life magic in 8 more levels and it will make my war magic even more powerful with the vulnerability spells and mana regen spells. I waited on getting life so that i can devote all xp toward war magic and basic skills. Had i created a war/life mage initially, i would always be half the war mage or half the life mage i could have been had i just picked one school.<P>Also, now that i have spent more time playing the upgraded game i take back the bad things i said,except for the slow mana regen of war mages  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> . The changes were needed and added a bit more of a challenge for us war mages. I can no longer just pick one spell and kill everything, i have to find the monsters weakness and cast accordinly, and that makes for more interesting battles. And once i do find the weakness i can do more damage than before! The only thing i didnt like in the upgrade,besides the slow mana regen for war mages  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> , is the crazy speed of the gromnies, they went from slowest to fastest! But it didnt really affect me since i dont hunt them, so i guess that doesnt count. <p>[This message has been edited by City Hunter (edited December 02, 1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F9F9F7">

</FONT><HR>I have to disagree with you on that one City Hunter.  Although your therom is correct that a pure war mage has to less items to spread his exp over that his war magic skill would be a lot higher, i play a life/war mage and just made lvl 24, and i have 160 life, 150 war, 130 focus and 130 self with all other attributes around 100.  So i didn't see any major weakness in my character.  In fact I think I leveled a lot faster than a pure war mage because of less down time and my war spells hit a lot more often and harder.  I just wish i had learned item earlier to get portal spells because running everywhere gets tiring.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=71&topic=000976.cgi&ReplyNum=000019&forum=AC+Call+Hall&TopicSubject=They+cut+me+in+Half!!!!!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans"><P>All times are PST</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans"><A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum71&number=71&thisthread=000976&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum71&number=71&thisthread=000976&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
