[B]Well, Amelok, I'll be seeing you soon in Asheron's Call, since I just ordered the game from [URL=http://www.ugodirect.com,]www.ugodirect.com,[/URL]  since I had a thing for $10 off, I got it for 37.70 shipping included, and it should get here by the end of the week.  (hopefully)
So, see ya sometime soon in the game.  Hope it doesn't take too long for my UO oriented mind to get used to not having recall until I get stronger.  Ya could start off powerful enough to get recall in UO.  Besides, in UO recall is probably better than in AC also.  need about 40 or so magery to use recall with about a 50% chance of fizzling.  Need about 60 magery to use the mark spell with less than a 50% chance of fizzling, then ya just get runes, and mark them wherever you want, and then just recall, click the rune, and poof, you're there.  Just one speculation though, in AC, what happens if you cast portal tie to a summoned portal?  When you cast portal recall, will it take you to the location the portal was summoned, or the destination of the portal?  It'd be an interesting point to test sometime.  [/B][/QUOTE]

I saw like 50+ on some page, and at 5-25p on average, with some up to 500p it must be extremely expensive to be a mage.  On UO, at least there are only 8 different components, 6 are 3g each and 2 are 6g each.  How do you even have room for em all?  In UO, I make it common to carry at least 50 of each on me, but how can you carry 50 of over 50 different components, it'd weight a TON!  I know this system is different, but still, it seems like a bit much.  <P>__________________________<BR>Darkmoon Arunsun<BR>Still Waiting to Buy AC.<BR>DarkFhang@aol.com<BR>etc...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Vladaria</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Well there are alot of spell components, and it gets kindof annoying to keep track of them all - especially if you have different schools of magic. The weight and the cost really aren't that much of a problem, the most annoying aspect is when you have 25-50 of each component, but no powdered onyx -you cant cast any war spells  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/eek.gif"> But, usually if there are other mages around they will help you out  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><BR>                       - Vlad</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Darkmoon Arunsun</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Well, I know in UO you tend to use components kinda quick, with healing you gotta do and since most of the useful spells use the same types, (pearl & mandrake)  you tend to use up all your mandrake and not know it, and then you are left, stuck somewhere, with no mandrake, which means you can't recall, can't cast greater heal, can't cast explosion, can't cast magic reflect.  so, I would think that you would end up using regs in this quickly also.  In UO I usually bring 50 of each with me, and if I don't get pk'd, I almost always run out of something, right when I need it the most.  Another question, how hard are regs to get in AC?  I always have problems getting them in UO, you end up running around with 10000g on you, going from town to town, looking for reagents.  All the shops are always sold out, or have a little left for a higher price than usual.  Some people even buy all of em out, and leave one left in the shop, and the shopkeeper will sell it for twice the normal price, and since there is only one left, the vendor restocks less often.  My usual trip to gather reagents, I go to one town, that has one mage shop with like 10 vendors inside, all sold out, go to another town, has 3 shops, about 15 vendors total, all sold out, go to a third town with about 3 vendors, sold out.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/mad.gif">  So, are components easier to come by?  Do shops sell out or raise prices when stock is getting low?  Anything else worth mentioning?  <P>Darkmoon Arunsun<BR>DarkFhang@aol.com<BR>Still waiting to get AC</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Vladaria</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">For most of your basic spells the components are really easy to get. There are a couple of NPCs that don't sell the tapers, but you can usually run to the next town over and find them. When i was a low level mage i usually only carried about 10 of each component but as i leveled and my strength and money flow increased i started holding alot more components- This works out really well because when you are lower level you are usually pretty close to town. I think there might be some high level spells that require unique spell components - but im not sure. <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/confused.gif"><BR>                 - Vlad<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Amelok</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Your basic components are readily available in all starter towns.  That includes just about every herb/regeant/powder.  The more advanced (and more expensive) components such as higher level scarabs and tapers are found in non-starter towns.  I've never heard of components being 'sold out' in the game.  I haven't much noticed, but I'm quite sure the prices on components are set.  Anywhere from 6 pyreal for the simplest herbs to 40-100 or so for tapers and on up to 1800 for the pyreal scarab (Not to worry, you won't be using that for a LONG time).  <P>As far as component consumption, the higher level you get, the better you get at casting lower level spells and therefore burn less components.  For instance, when you're reliably casting level 3 spells you're chance of burning components during a level 1 spell is farily rare.  Conversely, casting a higher level spell (say level four) will burn components more easily.  By far, the component most readily burned is the taper (unfortunately).  The least burned seems to be the scarab.<P>By the time you get to casting level 3 spells readily you should probably be carrying 50 of the most often used component (onyx for war mages).  Probably 20-30 would suffice for the spells you use regularly and 10-15 of those you scarcely use.  Also, the better you get at casting level 1 spells, the fewer number of scarabs you'll need to carry (since you'll obviously be burning less).<P>I've found tapers and regeants to be the most burdensome component type.  The others seem to weigh significantly less.  With a little planning, you should not have to worry about running out of components.  (Although I'm always running out of tapers, especially during spell research)<P>As for cash flow and components, the most I've spent on components at any one time was 4,000 pyreal, but expect to spend an average of 1,000 - 2,000 per gaming session.  That's nothing when you can find a ring or bracelet worth 1,000 - 1,500 pyreal; usually once per outing if you're hunting in the right areas.<P>Obviously the higher level you get, the more you'll be spending thanks to the scarab and taper prices.<P>On a side note, have you decided on a server to join yet? =) (...Morningthaw... *hint hint* hehehe)<P>Best of luck.<P>------------------<BR>Amelok - War/Life/Creature Mage<BR>Morningthaw</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Darkmoon Arunsun</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">On the topic of what server I'll go on, I was thinking between Morningthaw and Thistledown, so there's a good chance you might see me around somewhere in a week or two or three.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Amelok</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans">Excellent!

Most people say that Holtburg is the best to start in but I'm kinda partial to Rithwic.  In Rithwic you can get to Holtburg from a simple portal hop, you can also get to Shoushi thru another simple portal hop, and Eastham and the beaches are only a five minute run away (a great place for a 7th level mage to jump up in level quick).  I personally think it's the best starter town and hey, the bridge there is pretty cool too. =)  (to my knowledge, the only spanning bridge in the game)<P>All starter towns should have a 'newbie dungeon' for you to blast through though.<P>In any case, whichever town you decide to start in, I can be there in 10 minutes or so.
