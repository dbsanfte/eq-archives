Today we started camping the Kitchen in Mistmoore around 8:00am.  I got my fangs about 1:30pm.  We moved from there to the Jail/Stair area, waiting for the Caitliff.  Alas, after another 4 hours, the Caitliff did not show up and I had to camp at that point.<P>Some notes on the personnel involved and the strategy used:<P>37th-38th level warrior (i.e. Me.  I dinged during the camp)<BR>34th-35th level Ranger (also dinged during the camp)<BR>35th level Druid<BR>30th level Paladin<BR>33rd-34th level Cleric (dinged during the camp)<P>This was the core group.  Over the course of the weekend others came and went, but we *can* break the spawn with just the group listed above (we can actually break it with 2 tanks, the druid and a cleric, but it can get hairy on the first pull of the Maid room).<P>Our first attempt on Friday involved trying to actually fight our way to the Kitchen, clearing the way through the ballroom.  Folks, lemme tell ya that I don't know how this can be done without a couple of 40th+ level Enchanters.  You can fight your way fairly easily into the front hallway of the catstle without pulling a Megatrain.  Clear the courtyard first, then head up the ramp and clear the entrance to the castle, then into the foyer to take out the two gargs and the spawn above the gargs.  But after that, it just gets silly.  You can't get into a position where you're close enough to harmony the MOBs but far enough away that they won't aggro on you.  We tried it.  Ranger and Paladin died before we could Evac.  I counted at least 9 MOBs, mostly from the Ballroom and Conference room.<P>After that fiasco, we just said "Screw it" and invised past the MOBs and ran to the kitchen.  Which was fun because the MOBs can randomly see through Invis.  Several trains were caused by MOBs seeing through Invis.<P>But we finally got our rhythm down.  The safe spots we found were:<P>(A) In the tunnel across from the Graveyard, leading to the courtyard<BR>(B) On the first ledge up the ramp to the castle<BR>(C) In the ballroom itself (!), on the left-hand side, right smack dab in the middle of the wall.<BR>(D) The hallway right outside the kitchen, as long as you weren't right in front of the door (which would aggro the hall spawn)<P>There are 10 spawns in the area, on a 25 minute cycle (maybe 25.5 minutes):<P>3 Kitchen spawns (2 Shadow Knight cooks and another random spawn)<BR>2 static hall spawns (random spawn)<BR>1 wandering hall spawn (random spawn)<BR>2 Butler spawns (1 Gargoyle and either the Butler or a random spawn placeholder)<BR>2 Maid spawns (1 Gargoyle and either the Maid or a random spawn placeholder)<P>The "random spawns" run from the high-20s to the mid-30s, and include warriors (Deathly Ushers, Deathly Heralds, and Deathly Harbingers), casters (dark offerers, dark ritualists, shadowy scriviners, shadowy sages), and Vampires (will pillagers, will sappers, thought spoilers, thought defilers, soul temptresses, soul seductresses).<P>The gargs are usually of the "leering" or "flouting" variety, and are low-30s.<P>At 37th, everything we fought was blue to me, even the Maid and the Butler.  Some of it was yellow and red to the 30th Paladin, however.<P>One of my biggest worries about this camp proved to be groundless.  Having heard about the buggy nature of Mistmoore, I was really worried about pathing bugs.  And although we ran into some in the Jail area, they were absent from the Kitchen.  Everything I pulled from the hallway and servant's quarters followed me straight into the kitchen where it was quickly dispatched.<P>If you camp this area, you'll probably end up with the following rotation:<P>1) 3 kitchen MOBs<BR>2) First Hall spawn and maybe the wanderer.<BR>3) Second static hall spawn plus the 2 spawns from the maid room PLUS maybe the wanderer if you didn't get her with the first hall spawn.<BR>4) Butler room<P>Finally, some general rules for this camp:<P><BR>Rule #1:  Runners are death.<BR>(Corrollary to Rule #1: It is impossible to root, snare, stun, or engulf a MOB too often in this area.)<BR>Rule #2:  If a runner escapes, evac.  Right then and there.  Don't wait to see what ugliness your runner just stirred up.  Trust me, you won't like it.<P>Hope this provides you with some useful info if you want to try for the EBW yourself.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Ruatha Kneeslasher<BR>Gnome Warriorette<BR>***<BR>Milady:  I greet thee, friend gnome!
