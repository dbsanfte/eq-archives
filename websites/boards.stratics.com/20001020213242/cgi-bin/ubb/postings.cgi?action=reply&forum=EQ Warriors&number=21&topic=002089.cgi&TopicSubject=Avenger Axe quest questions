I just have to kill Faldor who is a rare spawn in the North Qeynos Zone.  Has anyone who completed this quest or at least Killed Faldor know approximately what lvl he is?  I am a 19th lvl warrior.    <P>Also,  Before I go turning the Eye of Stormguard in, I want to make sure I have high enough faction to recieve the Avenger Axe.  Right now the Dwarven Guards regard me Kindly... will I have to get that up to Warmly before turning the Eye in for the Axe?  I read you have to have high faction to recieve the Axe.  <P>Thanks for any help you all can provide.<P>Gravid Thornhold<BR>19th lvl Halfling Warrior<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Darodar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">At 19, bring a friend.  I killed him at 21 and had about 35 hit points left.  But I may have gotten bad rolls.  I think he cons as 20, but almost all NPCs of PC races con lower than they fight.  Sorry if this is slightly inaccuate, it's been a long time since I did this quest.<P>As to the faction question, if the guy in Kaladim gave you the quest he will give you the axe.<P>My suggestion: Forget the axe.  Faldor is too rare a spawn to be worth the trouble.  Get a shaman or druid friend and do the langseax quest instead.  you might need 3 at 20ish for Paglan, but you will have SoW for following frostbite, so you can bail if you aren't gonna get him.  Paglan is the rare spawn (took me 26 times), but so is Faldor, and you can get tons of $$ and exp running the langseax quest instead of sitting in crows waiting for a spawn.<P>Darodar Steelstorm<BR>40 Warrior - Guild Leader of Griffin Claw<BR>Prexus</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Tadar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Thanks for the info.  I'll be doing the LotW quest after a few levels.  I got my Langseax's already while doing that quest, and we did 6 runs, all 3 of us warriors in the group got langs at that time.  I want the Avenger Axe because I think it looks really sweet on my Halfling.  Its weaker of course than the LotW and the BBC I have now, but at least its something I can obtain now, help is not a problem.  Plus it also has a few +3 stat bonuses, thats always nice.  Thanks again for the info. <P>Gravid Thornhold<BR>19th lvl Halfling Warrior<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Aeowyn Swordsong</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">The Avenger Axe is a very good weapon for your level. I also believe that it's easier to get than the LoW in my opinion.<P>Here are a few tips that may help you...<P>1) Faldor spawns about every 2hr 26min. There is a trick to this though. Both Faldor and a beggar will spawn in the room. The beggar will spawn 26min AFTER Faldor. So if you catch the beggar in the room you have about 2 hours to wait for Faldor.<P>2) You cannot camp Faldor inside the bar. I've waited over 10 hours on two different occasions inside the bar and he never showed. Wait outside the bar near the pond and check every few minutes for him. I've successfully camped him 4 times and this has held true every time.<P>Other than that it's a pretty easy quest. After a friendly warrior told me those two tips I have done the quest four times solo between levels 23-24. If you're lower than this you might want the help of one friend.<P>One final note is that the exp for this quest is great. Not counting the exp from killing Slaythe and Faldor you get almost one full bubble of exp for the quest. If you have good friends that can TP you between NK and Faydwer (I do)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> you can amass a good bit of exp rather quickly if you're in your low 20's.<P>This info has worked for me. Hope it helps!<P>------------------<BR>Aeowyn Swordsong<BR>Wood Elf Warrior of the 24th Order<P>Emerald Warrior and Sister of Erollisi Marr<P>Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Tadar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Thanks for that helpful informatio Aeowyn.  Unfortunately spawn times either vary by server, or have gotten all screwed up since the lat patch.  I camped the site for a good 3 hours yesterday, taking over after another warrior gave up after a 4 hours camp.  He never saw the beggar or Faldor.  I didn't see anyone either.  Also, I know he spawns in the little room off to the side with the secret entrance to the Rogues guild.  Should I drag him down there once he finally spawns... to keep me safe from the NPCs in the bar that con dubious to me.   I'm hoping to have gotten him killed before the end of this coming weekend.... I am anxiously awaiting my axe.  <P><P>------------------<BR>Gravid Thornhold<BR>19th Lvl Halfling Warrior<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">PackMan97</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Repeat three times: THERE IS NO ANTI-CAMP CODE.

I waited in the bar the time I got him.  I also heard all the 2 hour and 26 minute stuff, but that is not true.  Sometimes it works that way, but not always.  The one time I got him it did hold true.  I saw the beggar and logged, 1:45 later I logged in, and waited 15 minutes and he showed.  I fought him in the room he spawns in (was a little excited when he actually showed up!), although I wouldn't recommend this from what I have read since I did the quest.  Most people recommend following him out the front gates and killing him in the newbie zone.<P>Good Luck!<P>Darodar Steelstorm<BR>40 Warrior<BR>Prexus</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Aeowyn Swordsong</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">First I'd like to point out to Darodar and PackMan that at the bottom of my post I clearly stated "This info worked for me." I didn't say it was the gospel or hard fact. It also doesn't make it false just because you experienced something different. I've completed the quest 4 times and the 2 warriors who helped me completed it over 10 times. It worked for us that way everytime to my knowledge. Maybe it was good karma or luck who knows. I think that with 14+ successful completions this way I can theorize that the times might vary for some people....but that "seems" to be the norm. Believe it or not...it's up to you.<P>Now to Tadar. This all worked for me....but it might not work for you. Take it all with a grain of salt and good hunting!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Aeowyn Swordsong<BR>Wood Elf Warrior of the 24th Order<P>Emerald Warrior and Sister of Erollisi Marr<P>Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">PackMan97</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I'm not debating the spawn times...I have no clue.<P>However I know for a FACT that there is no anti-camp code. Once camping Trazdon for my Crafted Leggings the a party member CONVINCED us there was anti-camp code. We had seen Traz twice (out of 5 spawns) and no circlet. So we agree, move out of the room and get 4 Traz spawns in a row all with the circlet.<P>After a mishap getting my armor resized (oops) I find myself camping traz again with a new group. I try to convinve them that Traz has an anti-camp radius and the politely tell me I'm full of crap.
