</FONT><HR>I'm also very interested in the answer to the question about why the Specs aren't casting on the kiter.  I have a lvl 29 druid in my guild that will help, but she is worried about dying.  Anybody that has done this please shed some light on what the kiter actually did, cast AoE spell and then ran, or what?  Also is a particular direction better than others?  I'd like to not have the Specs killing innocent bystanders in the OOT.<P>------------------<BR>Myrth Grym<BR>Paladin of Light<BR>Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=001201.cgi&ReplyNum=000040&forum=EQ+Paladins&TopicSubject=Get+Deep+water+harpoon+at+lvl+1...heres+how">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>A Level 31 Druid friend of mine helped me get the Deewpater Harpoon (Thanks, Silinar!).<P>We started on the Sisters' island where he cast Spirit of the Wolf and Levetate on us and then turned himself into a wolf.  After arriving at the island, he went up to attract the attention of the spectres while I gave Sentry Xyrin the potion.  After a short bit, she ran up the hill, so I followed her.  She stood there for several minutes while I waited.<P>One of the spectres lost track of my friend and returned to the hilltop, so he came back and picked it up again (while I ran down to the water's edge).<P>While he was running around, they DID cast on him.  I saw his life drop a quarter, then to half.  I was panicing, but he said it wsa no problem and healed himself back up to near full.<P>Not long after that, levetate wore off, and he didn't have it memorized to recast, so he had to gate.  Fortunately, right as he gated, Sentry Xyrin left, thanking us for our help, and dropping the Deepwater Harpoon as thanks.  I swam off the island and picked up the ship as it passed.<P>As soon as I reached Butcherblock, I decided to test it out on those nasty bandits near the port.  I was happy to see it hit for up to 40.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>I had the opportunity to further use it in Najena the other night, and it did a good job -- well, that is, when I didn't miss. :p<P>In any case, it is a very nice weapon.  It sure beats the -8 DEX on the Bone Blade Claymore I had been using (which, fortunately, I had exactly balanced out with various equipment and jewelry).<P>So, the trainer doesn't need to be ultra high level, just high enough to be able to  survive a couple of casts from the spectres.<P>------------------<BR>Krystina, High Elf Paladin of Tunare<BR>Fennin Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=001201.cgi&ReplyNum=000041&forum=EQ+Paladins&TopicSubject=Get+Deep+water+harpoon+at+lvl+1...heres+how">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEE2EC">

</FONT><HR>Ok, apparently some people are disputing a few things about the procedure, or aren't very clear about what will work.  Here is a very detailed account of how I got my dw harpoon  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">.<P>1.  Get the bottle, and try to do a few +freeport militia faction quests if the guards are dubious to you to make things easier.  Just try not to hurt your faction with temple.  I guess this goes without saying though.<P>2.  Get a druid to sow you.  Levitate also helps, but is not an absolute.<P>3.  Don't worry about skels, gargs might be a problem, but I didn't see a single garg the whole time I was there. Besides, you have sow  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">.  If the gargs are there, you just gotta pick the right moment to pick up the harpoon, and you're ok.  Which brings us to 4...<P>4.  Target a spectre, give the bottle to the sentry, and then run up and shoot one of the spectres with your trusty bow.  A spell would probably be way too slow.  The spectres will ignore her, head for you.  You can also get the spectres on you first and THEN run them around the island to the sentry, then deliver the bottle.  The former is what I did, but I think the latter may be easier in hindsight.  The skells are INDIFFERENT to everyone now (I don't think they were before for some reason, I hunted that isle a long time ago with my lv 15 pally, and I think they were aggro to me).  Anyways, the skells are NOT aggro to you, they are indifferent.  They will not interfere with you or her unless you mess up somehow.<P>5.  Run the spectres in a big circle around the island.  It's not hard.  The spectres have an ABYSMALLY short casting range, which means they will have a hell of a time hitting you if you just keep your distance.  Stop every once in a while and make sure you dont' loose sight of them.  If you get too far ahead of them, they will find a way to sneak up on you at a bad time.  After using my 100 range bow at a range of about 50 or so to lure the spectres, they came at me full boar, they were NOT in casting range.<P>6.  When you get a chance, target the sentry.  don't shoot her or anything, just target her, and watch her to disappear from your targeting screen.<P>7.  When the sentry dissapears.  Run VERY FAST over to the place she was.  Pick up your new harpoon  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">.<P>8.  By the time you pick up the harpoon and put it in your inventory, the spectres will probably be on you.  Be VERY QUICK in moving forward as soon as it's in your hand, then put it in inventory.  Use the arrow keys to move forward, mouse to get inventory open.<P>9.  Get off the island if you have levitate.  They won't follow you forever, and actually will turn back fairly soon.  Just DON'T be a prick and head toward the sister island.  They won't go that far from what I've seen, but yes, they will kill everyone on the boat if they come in aggro range.  Head to the goblin isle, and they won't pose much of a danger to anyone, as they will stop half way and turn back.  Still, it's always nice to let people there know what you're doing.<P>10.  If you don't have levitate, or someone to gate you off the island, then this is the most simple part.  Sit down and prepare to die.  Don't try and swim for it, you will just make it impossible to get your corpse.  Trust me, it'll be quick, and painless, heheh.  Then get your corpse, lament over the exp you lost, but rejoice in the fact that you now have a killer weapon, heheh.<P>This plan works.  I got the harpoon pretty much solo with the notable exception of the kind druid who sowed me (thanks Hannin  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">).  While my way involves dying and loosing exp (who wants to do that?), it also shows that you don't even need a high level friend to kill the spectres or train them around.  I got the harpoon at lv 24, and didn't get hit once while training the spectres around the island (I did however get hit a lot once I realized the situation after getting the harpoon, heheh).<P>With 2 people of decent level this is even easier.  The trainer just gates away, and you get a killer weapon for free.<P>Now I know that SOMEONE is gonna find this post and scream and cry that life isn't fair, we get something killer for little or no risk to us, it's too easy, why doesn't my class get a shiny metallic robe or GZ at lv 1 too, waaah waaah waaaah.  In response, a lot of comparable weapons could be obtained by a high lv druid helping a lv 1 character besides this one.  So there :-P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=001201.cgi&ReplyNum=000042&forum=EQ+Paladins&TopicSubject=Get+Deep+water+harpoon+at+lvl+1...heres+how">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">

</FONT><HR>Another little trick I found out to get rid of chasing specs/gargoyles is to head straight for a canoe and man the helm... When you do that, the monsters chasing you will stop dead in their tracks, but they WILL come back after you if you get back off the boat, so once on the canoe, just camp and come back and the monsters won't be chasing anymore  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=001201.cgi&ReplyNum=000045&forum=EQ+Paladins&TopicSubject=Get+Deep+water+harpoon+at+lvl+1...heres+how">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/Forum14/HTML/001201-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/Forum14/HTML/001201.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PST</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=001201&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=001201&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
