Yeah, it's an amazing trainer.  I think you can make pretty good money at lower levels by getting a bunch of them in Rivervale and selling them in Kaladim where they've never heard of the thing.

But if you think 2H slash is the slowest weapon skill then I can tell you've never tried to raise your 2H blunt.  Yeesh, the good 2H blunt weapons have delays of like 50 and the really "fast" ones with horrible damage have speeds in the mid 40s.  I just find out about something called the Abandoned Orc Shovel which is like 2H blunt 4 dam 27 delay or so.

Bullsmasher is so great my friends get tired of hearing me talk about it.  You can get it by soloing Red V at level 6 if you're mean enough and it has a damage ratio that you don't see until you get up into level 25ish weapons.  I only wish it didn't look like a balpeen hammer when a Gnome picks it up  ;)  

And hunting Red V can get pretty mind-numbing after the 30th or 40th time.  When I got mine I started shouting "BULLSMASHER!" as the top of my lungs.  I ran through Ak'Anon shouting that.  I burst out into Steamfont shouting that.  A guy sent me a /tell.  "You want to buy one?  I'll sell you one for 30 plat."  On my server the going rate is 300 plat or more.  I'd have bought it off him in a New York second if it hadn't been a Lore Item.  "Why aren't you using it yourself?" I asked him.  "I'm a Rogue.  I only like Piercing", he said.  What a dope.

As for hobbits being the best warriors...most of my friends are hobbits and they do have good physical stats.  And they're so tall and buff!  They loom over you and they're so formidable looking.  So they'd be great to play if you didn't mind being thick as a board.  Bright as a 30 watt bulb.  Smart as a bag of hammers.

I even have a Warcry in my Socials stating "Fear me evildoers for I weild the Rantho Rapier!" I get a lot of laughs for that one. It is great for skill raising, as you said, and its a weapon of interest for those who have never seen a Rapier weilded 2Handed dealing out Slash damage at an excellent speed. I just wish it was higher in the damage department or at least Magical.
