Here's what I've learned about camping for it.  Generic info at the beginning, some melee-character-specific info at the end.<P>The Earring:  Stat is something like plus 3 dex.  Effect is UNLIMITED water breathing when it is equipped.  VERY cool.  It is LORE,<BR>so one per customer.  And, the word is that it's a one in six rare drop.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/frown.gif"><P>The location:  In Qeynos Hills, there's a pond in the north west corner of the zone.  On that pond, there's a shack with a bonfire in front of it.  The mob spawns right next to that campfire, OUTSIDE the shack.<P>The mob that drops it:  His name is Hadden, and he's a barbarian fisherman.  Spawns approximately once every 6 hours and 6 minutes, tho server loading seems to affect this.  He will ALWAYS be spawned when the server comes up from a reboot.  I'm sorry I don't have the faction hits for killing him, but one of them is with the merchants of qeynos. :/  He's 30ish level, and seems to have around 1000 or so hitpoints.  One ice comet drops himm like a brick, so it's less than 1100.  He hits for 50ish damage, but not terribly fast.  Did less than a bar of damage (300hp or so) to me at level 43.<P>The shack mob:  Axe stands inside the shack, and con'ed even to a 20th level character last time I asked someone.  He does a newbie quest, and isn't tough at all.. nasty faction hits tho.  He will aggro when Hadden is attacked, until you get into your mid 30's or so and he's way green to you.<P>The other mob:  Rephas is a high 20's level enchanter, and will proabaly have a pet summoned.  WARNING- Rephas is NASTY.  He will aggro if Hadden (and/or I belive Axe) is attacked and you are less than level 42-43.  He managed to charm a 40th level ranger 3-4 times, and a 43rd level warrior (58MR) once.  If he cons blue or high green, he'll come running when Hadden is attacked.  He also hates Ogres/Trolls (dunno about DEs) and even will aggro level 43+ if you get too close to him.  Good news is he's a brittle caster, and goes down pretty quick IF you can stay on him.  The pet's pretty easy too.  He and Axe seem to respawn every 10 minutes or so, maybe less.<P>Background info summary: if you are &gt; level 42 or 43, you can kill Hadden solo without much trouble at all.  If you are lower level, bring friends with eggshaped pumice (to dispel charms) and get MR buffs.  Plan on beating on each other a bit.<P>A note: my personal experience is that most people are typically decent folks IF APPROACHED CORRECTLY.  If you are polite and treat them with respect, most of the time they will do the same for you.  If you are hostile or rude, expect the same- and realize you just provided them their mental "justification" to KS you.  If someone shows up, be friendly and let them know what's going on- shouldn't be a surprise to them.  If they are abusive or rude, don't take the bait right away, be civil. You may and probably will get KS, so be ready for it mentally and do what you can to try and avoid it. Some people camp that fishbone as their primary means of income, and tend to start thinking of it as "their" spawn.  If they are in a guild, talk to any of their guildmates you know, or their GM.  If you don't know what their intentions are, ask someone you know if they know the person, etc.  Bottom line is you can avoid a LOT of problems, and even make a few friends, IF you aren't a jerk yourself. Sorry, getting off soapbox now.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>And, if the problem persists, petition a guide and POLITELY explain the situation.  I dont' know what their exact policies are, but Verant seems to frown on blatantly antisocial behaviour (repeated KSing), and right now doesn't seem to have ANY shortage of other, better behaved customers...<P>Now for the tips, in no particular order:<BR>When to go:<BR>-Show up for the camp very early, and plan on waiting for a LONG time.  If you know when the last time your server was rebooted, you have a good idea when Hadden will respawn.  People leave characters there and the very first thing they do when the server comes up is log in and try to nuke Hadden.  His life expectancy is on the order of 30 seconds or less typically, so count the number of six hour intervals since your last downtime.  You can also ask the people camping there when he's due, but even normally decent folks are typically VERY evasive and/or lie about it.  Worst comes to worse, sit and wait... when the casters start gating in, it's a good chance he's due soon.<P>Who to bring, pt. I<BR>-If you are lower level, bring friends to help handle Rephas.  If you are low enough that Axe isn't very green, you might want to wait a few more levels.  Note, using even the 39th level shaman pet WILL aggro both axe and rephas, you have been warned.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">  Also, if a lower level player even heals/buffs you during the fight, you'll have company...<P>Equipment:<BR>-Bring eggshaped pumice along for dispelling rephas and his pet's damage shields, and your charmed buddies. <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif"> 15-20pp, sold by npc potion vendors, 5 charges of cancel magic.  Very handy.  If you will be dealing with Rephas, bring any MR stuff you have, it won't hurt.  He's Qeynos Hills version of the Sol B Kobald Noble.  Oh yea, bring several fishing poles and 20-40 bait... the fish will help provide food, but make sure to bring a bunch of water too.  If you leave the camp fer a munchie run, you probably lost your turn.<P>Who to bring, pt. II<BR>The FBE is probably one of the most infamous killstealer hangouts there is.  For a high level nuker, it's paradise- no jeapordy, one cast and you have one of the primo trade items in the game.  This opportunity for quick easy huge loot brings out the very worst in people.  Some will lie about when the spawn is, and some WILL try to KS it from ya.  More on this in a bit.  If you have a high level, faction-hit-tolerant nuker buddy, you might ask him to bind there and recall in shortly before the drop to help you out with some backup firepower.  It doesn't hurt.  You don't HAVE to do this however, I've gotten several kills with no help at all (43rd warrior).<P>A tactic to deal with KSers:<BR>First of all, if it isn't your turn, do NOT use this to steal a kill, or you are as bad as the KS nukers are.  If you are meleeing Hadden, and hear casting sounds start behind you (as opposed to from Rephas...), jump into the water.  If you got the first hits on him, and act quick enough, he will follow you in.  Now you get to watch the lightshow as the KS nuker wastes his mana bouncing spells off the now INVUNERABLE to spells cast ABOVE water barbarian.  This MAY buy you enough time to finish Hadden off, or at least get him past half.  Shocks the heck out of the nuker too.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/smile.gif">  Once a KSer is burned like this once, he may try next time from in/under the water, etc.  If you know he's there, hop into the lake on the opposite side of the pennisula.  This gives you a chance at least, don't abuse it or I'm sure verant will patch it or ban you.  Suggest you invest in an enduring breath potion, or get a buff if you aren't a good swimmer and/or need more time to beat Hadden below half.  Note: I do not believe this is an exploit, but haven't gotten an official ruling on it.  My view: if Hadden's locked on you (i.e. you hit first), then where you take him, unless you train someone, should be entirely up to you.<P>A tactic to avoid Rephus:<BR>-If you are sowed and/or jbooted, you can probably run Hadden off, with Rehpas/Axe following, to a safe distance.  Apparently Rephas gets tired of following eventually.  This is more of a kiter tactic, you might manage it with a bow tho.  Haven't done this, but am told it works.<P>More KSer mitigation:<BR>The "favorite" spot for KSers is usually on the opposite shore, where they can see-look-shoot in basically total safety.  If you are an ogre/troll, they will have a bit of trouble targeting Hadden past you, so you might want to crowd the spawn a bit.  You could also have a bunch of friends stand all around the spawn spot to make targeting Haddy much more difficult for the KS nuker.  If the bad guy's in the water/near shore level, boats might make fine "target blockers" too... Also a potentially questionable tactic, so if you abuse it you desserve what you get, but should be "legal".  After all, the KSer DOES have the option to sit down there and melee Haddy the same as you are...<P>Whelp, that's all I can think of now, will add more if anything else occurs to me.  Hope it helps a bit-<P>Remf da Troll<BR>43rd (almost 44th) lvl warrior, karana</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
