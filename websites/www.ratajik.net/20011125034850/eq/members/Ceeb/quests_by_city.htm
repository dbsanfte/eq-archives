    <td width="14%">All</td>
    <td width="60%"><P>This entire quest takes place inside of <A 
href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/crushbone.html">Crushbone</A>. First thing that you need to do is 
go see the dwarven smith. He is located in the small building that is near the 
mine area. To get here from the entrance you must take a left and go across the 
bridge. Once you cross the bridge just basically follow the path. After you go 
down the hill you will see a building. Inside this building is a jailor who you 
will have to kill. Then you will see two dwarven smiths and an elven priest. 
Talk to the middle dwarven smith(actually you can probably talk to either smith 
but I always spoke to the one in the middle, so for safety purposes speak to 
him). Tell him that you are here to set him free and he will begin rambling 
about how he wants his freedom but the taskmaster scares them, yada yada yada. 
Then ask him about the king or emperor and he will speak of the high quality ring mail that is worn by this beast.</P>
<P>There are several parts of this quest but you really only need to concentrate 
on the final two(bracer of battle and dwarven ringmail). Each piece that you 
find can either be kept or turned in for the item that it returns depending on 
your class, race, and needs.</P>
<P>The first mob that you might want to worry about is the Taskmaster. He hangs 
out to the right of the castle near the slaves. He seldom spawns but when he 
does he has a chance of carrying some magic +2 AC earrings. You can either wear 
these earrings(for the armor class, although I feel that the <A 
href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/onyxearring.html">onyx earrings</A> are a better choice) or 
you can return them to the dwarven smith. If you return them to him he will give 
you a blade mold which can be used for blacksmithy.</P>
<P>The second mob in this quest is the Instructor/Trainer. This is a large orc 
who can be found training other orcs on top of the large hill in the middle of 
the zone. He very rarely carries a <A 
href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/shinybrassshield.html">shiny brass shield</A>. You can elect 
to keep this weapon(a wise choice or a poor choice depending on your class) or 
you can turn it in to the dwarven smith in exchange for a sludge mold.</P>
<P>The third item that you will need is the one that will be the most dangerous. 
You now need to kill the Emporer/King and hope that he is sporting the <A 
href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/dwarvenringtunic.html">dwarven ringmail tunic</A>. If you are 
a small race you might think about keeping this item to wear on your person 
until you get a second one. However you can turn this item in to the dwarven 
smith as with the items above. This time he will give you a dwarven mace which 
has a damage of 8 and an attack delay of 35. Not a bad weapon, however it's just 
a stepping stone. The smith will also send you to go speaking to the elven 
priest standing in the next stall. The priest can enchant this mace for you(and 
turn it into the screaming mace) but first you need to do something for her. She 
wants you to kill the Warlord and bring proof of his death.</P>
<P>The fourth item that you need is the hardest one to get. You need to find the 
Warlord. He can be seen patrolling the area from time to time. He is a level 14 
or so mob, but that isn't the problem. The problem is if you attack him he is 
going to run and bring help. So you must be careful to root him in place and 
then try to take care of him before root runs out. If you are lucky he will be 
carrying a <A href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bracerofbattle.html">bracer of battle</A>. This 
is a fine piece of armor for this level, however it can also be turned in. This 
time you will turn the bracer into the elven priest rather than the dwarven 
smith. The priest will give you a <A href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/prayercloth.html">prayer 
cloth</A> in return for the bracer. </P>
<P>Many players get to this step and think, what? What did I do wrong. Well it 
is important to NOT give the priest the mace at the same time as the bracer of 
battle. You need to give her the bracer alone first. Then after she hands you 
the prayer cloth you can give her the mace. When she asks, "do you have 
something else for me?" then you can hand over the prayer cloth and voila you 
get one shiny screaming mace.</P></td>

be required to kill a <A href="http://gameznet.com/eq/beastiary/treant.html">treant</A> and bring 
back the treant shards to the NPC. When you do so he will grind them into treant 
resin and hand them back to you. <BR><BR>You know must get the other required 
item to combine in with the treant resin to create the staff. Go to the vault in 
erudin(the bank) and talk to the banker on the far left. Tell him you are in 
need of some vasty deep water. He will tell you that you need a guild coin in 
order for him to give it to you. Now return to the clerics guild and tell them 
that this NPC sent you to get a guild coin. You will be given the coin. When you 
give it to the banker you will receive the vasty deep water in return. Combine 
the water and the resin in the staff and the end result will be a peacekeeper

two or three bottles of milk before you leave.  You must then travel to the West

south side of the lake in the zone.   If he is not there, wait for a few minutes

ask for a bottle of milk (yes, there was a reason you got them).  When you give 
him the milk, another NPC, Duggin Scumber, a level 2-4 monk, will charge up, 
steal the note from Mojax, and start attacking him.   Kill Duggin Scumber.  It 
is important that you be the one to kill him, and not Mojax, because Duggin's 
body has the note, and will disappear if he is killed by Mojax.   When you kill 
Duggin, take the note from his body, and return to the Temple of Marr in

tell him you are a WARRIOR OF THE STORMGUARD. He will inform you of a guard 
Bundin that has deserted. Your charge is to find, and kill the deserter, and 
return his head and axe to the warrior guild trainer. The guard will appear as 
Blyle Bundin, and can be found roaming the valley on the left just before you 
reach the gate to the docks. He wanders between the two guard stations, and its 
important to take him somewhere in between, as I've been told the guards will 
attack you if they see you fighting him. Obviously I didnt test this out but its 
no big deal to follow him into the valley. Blyle seems to be around lvl 12. I 
took him once at 9th lvl with a druid along to heal me, and solo'd him at 12th 
lvl with no difficulties at all. He hits for around 16-20 and fairly quick, and 
being a former Stormguard dwarf his AC will make it hard to hit him. My reward 
was slight xp, faction gain, a few coppers and a torch.</font></P>
