Number of Hours to Achieve level.&nbsp; Note finishing 20, 30, and 35.&nbsp; A Total of
22% of total play time was spent on these three levels.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="graphics/35-level-Line-Prc.jpg" alt="35-level-Line-Prc.jpg (16620 bytes)" WIDTH="385" HEIGHT="247"><br>
Number of Hours to achieve level, line view.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="graphics/36-TotalPlayTime-Line.jpg" alt="36-TotalPlayTime-Line.jpg (13881 bytes)" WIDTH="384" HEIGHT="253"><br>
Total number of hours played, by level.</p>

<hr>

<p>Each total played from&nbsp; the chart of numbers from the <a href="index.htm">previous
page </a>are the TOTAL time to achieve that level.&nbsp; So, for example, 31st level took
83 hours to achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, in other words, it took 83 hours to get through level
30.</p>

<p>The numbers are calculated by:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Each Level is translated into a number of total minutes played since starting
EQ.&nbsp; The formula is:&nbsp; <br>
<em>Mp = (D * 24 * 60) + (H * 60) + M</em></p>

<p>2.&nbsp; The total minutes played for each level is then subtracted from the next
levels, getting the total minutes between levels.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; This is then calculated to the number of hours <em>(Hl = Mp / 60).</em> &nbsp;
The Hours Played for a Level is rounded to tens.</p>

<p>I have only been tracking this info from level 13.&nbsp; There are two things of note.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Hell levels do seem to exist.&nbsp; 20, 30, and 35 took almost double the
amount of time of the other levels.&nbsp; The oddity here is 25 did not take as long.
&nbsp; I'm not sure what's up with this. </p>

<p>2.&nbsp; The slope(1.017)&nbsp; is rather scary... For example, it looks like the play
time for 46rd level will be something like 59 days, and 50th level will take 62 days.</p>
