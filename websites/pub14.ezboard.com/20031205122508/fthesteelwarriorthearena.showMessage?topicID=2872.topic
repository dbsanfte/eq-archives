We warriors have no way of guaranteed aggro, aside from AE Taunt.  We have no mana to budget and therefore the aggro we output is essentially always 100% of our maximum possible.  <br>
 <br>
If we are always generating the maximum aggro we can generate (and some may argue that's not very much), how can it be our fault that someone else steal the aggro?  Aggro for everyone else works in a deterministic manner.  If caster X manages to get himself overaggroed doing Y while a warrior is tanking, then that's going to work every single time thereafter too with the same warrior (barring usage of AE Taunt, procs, and success of the Taunt key).  <br>
<br>
Some of you say that aggro is necessary, like slowing.  But just because the aggro is necessary still doesn't make it our problem.  Just because a mob must be slowed doesn't mean warrior can turn on our super aggro mode to compensate for this.  It is still up to the slower or some other member to deal with the necessary aggro because the warrior does not have a choice with how much aggro he puts out.  <br>
<br>
I'm wondering if warrior aggro issues just comes from other classes not understanding how we get our aggro.  I have been in groups where people will complain I'm not taunting enough, even though this makes no sense since it's not up to me to decide how often Taunt succeeds.  Maybe the other classes think we can somehow get more aggro if we only try harder?  That is true for every non pure melee.  If you play smarter, you can usually get more aggro via spells (sometimes trivially, like Rangers and Paladins).  But not for us.  Our aggro is fixed.  It doesn't matter if that mob must be slowed or whatever, there is nothing more we can help.  Does every group really know this?  I don't have problems holding taunt, but I have been in plenty of pickup groups that'd say something like, 'Wow you hold aggro well our last warrior sucked&quot;.  But isn't that a silly thing to say?  It's not like my taunt somehow works more often than the last warrior because I'm pressing it in a secret technique.  Our aggro comes from our gear, and if it's not enough it will never be enough no matter how hard we try.  We know this, but does everyone else know?  I used to think yes, but now I'm not so sure.<br>
<br>
And if that's the case, then it can explain the problem pretty well.  If your group believes you can actually do anything to effect the aggro you generate (aside from weapon choices), it's no wonder the pickup groups think warriors suck.  The average LFG warrior in say PoV certainly lacks the gear that can effectively deal with initial slow aggro (probably the biggest compliant for warriors), and he will never be able to deal with the slow aggro effectively unless the group understands his weakness and compensates for this.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kilaara>Kilaara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/03 2:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2872.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is the warrior problem just a matter of midunderstanding</span><hr size=1> Thats it Phantron.<br>

Ppl. are lazy.<br>
<br>
Ppl. do not want to try to think about it.<br>
<br>
All they want is Exp and that fast without thinking about aggro generation.<br>
<br>
Today the ppl. do not go through dungeons to learn stuff like pre Kunark.<br>
Today the ppl. make the easiest circle ( LoIO / FM / OT / DL ) only to gain Exp.<br>
<br>
As an Example of that. Last year I was in a Sebi group with my 51 rogue. One mob runs away. I tells the group 'Hm did he resist snare' ... second mob.. third mob .. running.. I told group ' Hm did snare not work .... forth mob fifth mob .... <br>
In the end I asked the Wizard whats about his snare .. .then he said .. Shure I can snare if you want it. He was the one and only snarer in group. We were on way to chef area. 4 of the group died from the last runner.<br>
<br>
These ppl now are 60+ and looking for the maximum exp in game. Thats what they have done all the time. They do not think about the mechanisms of the game. They want EXP .. Thats it .. not more. EXP EXP EXP.<br>
<br>
When the Warrior is not able to hold aggro as they want him to do ... skip him .. take another one .. oh he is also not able to do it .. skip him try a palli .. oh he can do it .. Thats it .. They did their choice. <br>
<br>
Next time they will say .. Oh take that Palli he can hold aggro .. and dont take a warr .. they suck in aggro holding.<br>
<br>
I am a female gnome warrior.<br>
<br>
I have never had problems finding a group in around 15 Minutes. In my time in Sebilis between 55 and 60 I was often ninjainvited after logging in with a 30 AC chain BP at Level 60 and 4.3k HP raidbuffed at that time.<br>
Now I have 7.9 k hp raidbuffed and groupbuffed something ( only virtue ) around 6.7 k hp with 1500+ AC. I am one of the MTs in our guild for AoW/Creator/High Priest/Burrower Biest . . I am using one of the best 2h aggro dealing weapons in Game. I have Primals and lots of other utilityweapons/aggroweapons. I use all tricks I know to hold aggro like taunt after seeing the slowed message .... using /shield each time it is possible... <br>
Now I am standing at Zonein in BoT/HoH/PoV/PoS/CoD like half a dozen other warrior shouting for groups until I log out or I find a guild group which needed a melee or which has a free slot. <br>
Btw. cause of my different working times I can't make groups for the future so I leveled and played all my time ( around 180 played days on that char ) in PickUps for Exp.<br>
<br>
And thats a thing that Sucks and it is not only the problem of me .. its a problem of all these warr around who are Lfg for a Pick up in that zones.<br>

An SK or paly typically won't risk losing aggro to slows, damage dealers and healers so PoP groups don't need to reduce their effectiveness to compensate.<br>
<br>
That's why people prefer knights to warriors for MT in exp groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glatius2>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 798<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/03 7:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2872.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is the warrior problem just a matter of midunderstanding</span><hr size=1> It is human nature to be as lazy as you can get away with while still accomplishing your goal.

<br>
Can people work with the Warrior to make a situation viable? Certainly, no arguement, they absolutely can.  There is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>always</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a way to make a Warrior work.  However, it's much like pulling a plow yourself.  Using a Knight is much like hooking a horse up to the plow.  People are going to prefer the Knight because they're less work.  They require less thought on everyone's part.  The only one who might maybe have to do a little more thinking is the Cleric, and if they aren't having to heal anyone other than the Knight, it's a hell of a lot easier than the alternative, so they're okay with it too.<br>
<br>
Never under estimate the power of human laziness.<br>

Warrior tanking is not enough better than knight tanking in xp groups to make up for this difference in agro generation and the impact on a group IMO is the problem. <p>-Gorlab<br>

<br>
Think about when a shaman or enchanter slow a mob and then gets aggro. Well the mob is now doing about 1/4 the damage it did before - so that enchanter or shaman tanks a slowed mob better than you tank an unslowed mob. No biggie though, any smart shaman or enchanter isn't going to sit or throw out a lot of nukes or dots right after slowing. Just taunt and melee and most of the time you'll piggyback the aggro off the slow (when taunt succeeds).<br>
<br>
If slow aggro is a huge problem and taunt failed, try AE taunt or /shield. I usually go for /shield if slow stuck and AE taunt if it was resisted.<br>
<br>
Now the damage dealer classes are another type of aggro entirely, and this is where knights really shine... Knight aggro spells are pretty much like our high aggro weapon procs, but they only need mana for these, we need luck...<br>
<br>
And yes, people do often just want to play lazy. Nuke whenever they want, sit whenever they want, never have to turn off attack (god forbid, but they hate it). <br>
<br>
Anyone that tells you to taunt more is going further than just being lazy, now they just don't understand how warriors get aggro. Yep, I'm sitting here without aggro laughing at you while taunt has been up for almost a minute /sigh. There are lots of people in this game who don't have a clue how a class other than their own works though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aveenlucenthawk>Aveen Lucenthawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/03 12:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2872.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Aggro</span><hr size=1> My sister plays a rogue and we often play opposite together.

With a knight she doesn't have to work that hard. <br>
<br>
This facet of human nature (taking the easiest way out) coupled with the fact that warriors have only one job (tanking which is the superset containing agro control) is the chief cause of a lot of grief for a lot of warriors just trying to have some fun in an exp group. <p>Aveen Lucenthawk<br>

You're right, I don't think the term &quot;Warriors suck at taunting&quot; refers to the individual playing the warrior having the skill to taunt.   I think it refers to the fact that after doing all you can do, you're still limited to only that which you're able to do.<br>

I hear your point.  Let me ask you this, does a Knight have to brief their team on how to control aggro?  Does a Knight ever have a teammate say &lt;taunt&gt; in group chat, like maybe he wasn't?  Does a Knight have to wonder how he is going to tell the group Druid that maybe Ro's fiery whatever isn't such a great idea?  Does the Knight have to figure out how to explain to the group Necro that maybe laying down 4 or 5 DoTs one on top of the other isn't such a great idea?<br>
<br>
Does a Knight actually have to know more about the other classes in his group than some of the very people who play those classes and have to explain to them why they might want to change what they're doing to avoid pulling aggro off him?  The short answer is, no.<br>
<br>
Now, you're thinking, well if these people are doing things that are messing up the situation, doesn't the tank have the obligation to try and straighten them out?  Maybe so.  But most people don't take advice and suggestions well from someone they perceive as a no-brain meat shield who doesn't do anything but hit the attack button and the taunt button when it recycles every 6 seconds.  They're of course <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>far</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> more knowledgeable about how to play their class than any mere Warrior would be.  They really don't take into consideration that while they may know more about being Mr. Wizard than the Warrior, the Warrior has day in and day out dealt with exactly the same aggro control issues and may, just maybe, have some useful ideas.<br>
<br>
People don't want to hear it.  They want to do what they've always done and not have to think about it too much.  Before PoP a little over aggroing wasn't that big a deal, so they've gotten a little lazy about it.  Now, they could change how they play to accommodate this.  Or they can pass on a Warrior and get a Knight instead, where it's not an issue.<br>
<br>
Given the law of inherant human laziness, which would you think they might do? <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

  <br>
Thats usually my biggest problem, shamen slowing the mob before it even gets to the group.  But you know what?  If you let the culprit die a few times they figure it out real quick.  One of the only situations, in an exp group, that someone should be getting huge aggro would be heal aggro on an incoming.  And thats what DA is for (sorry druids..keep feedbacking).  <br>

Just keep that in mind when they're making you fight for it.  Let them die, its both funny and enlightening.<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://<br>

But if you think the way to fix the difference in aggro control between Knights and Warriors is for all Warriors to systematically allow everyone to die who over aggros when the Warrior thinks they shouldn't, I'm thinking Warriors in general will very quickly find getting a group even more difficult than it is currently.  <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

I have run into situations where I need to tell the healer/slower to use faster heals/cast slow sooner because I simply won't survive if they don't.

Me too.  My first day tanking in PoV I died 7 times in about a 4 hour period.  The Cleric was someone I played with a lot previously, and had always been solid.  But PoV really took some adjusting for him.  However it was a situation where it was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>obviously</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> something he had more control over than I did.  With aggro, who is the one blamed if a Shaman dies from casting slow, even if it's not said directly?  The Shaman because they slowed too soon or the Warrior because he couldn't $*#&amp; taunt or he couldn't #**&amp; hold aggro?  In most people's minds they're blaming the Warrior.<br>

<br>
Instead, I'm leveling a SK, who can do in essence everything my warrior could do and cast spells on top of it all.  At level 23, he generates and holds aggro better than my 61 warrior and he can do that for a total expenditure of approximately 20pp.  Not too many levels and another 5-10pp, he'll be able to do it even better.  Considering that with KEI I can chain cast Clinging Darkness, providing me with endless aggro and never lose mana, there is no incentive for me to play my warrior unless some of my friends want to hang out or just need a tank in a zone where my gear and warrior aggro issues won't get them killed.<br>
<br>
<br>
The basic point of the entire warrior aggro arguement is that no matter how hard we work and what groups do to accomodate our limitations, in the end it is far easier and safer for all xp groups in the planes to have a knight as MT.  <br>
<br>
No question that you can make a group work with a warrior, no one is arguing that.  But there is so much less guess work involved with a knight. <p>Ghune<br>

I really don't see SoE balancing the game to make it doable for people who doesn't know that putting 2 Ro's on a mob is basically a death sentence.  While this game might not be for the ubers only, it is certainly not balanced around the lowest denominator when you're dealing with tier2+ PoP zones.  <br>
<br>
I think people are just forgetting how hard the PoP tier 2+ zones are supposed to be.  I know in raid we always talk about like 'this guy ONLY hits for 3.5K' as if 4 clerics is supposed to never mess up healing a MT against this kind of damage.  I remember last expansion Imperial Guards in Ssra are supposed to be hard even though they only double for 500, which is less than most XP mobs in tier 2 planes.  In a raid you don't hear people complain warrior can't hold aggro because the slower died.  It is well understood that you steal the aggro from the warrior then you pay for it by dying, and if you must steal the aggro (Enchanter/Shaman in particular), then you're expected to die.  PoP mobs, especially for lower end of groups in terms of gear/skill, are really like miniraids, and yet not so capable groups are treating them like XP mobs.  I'm not sure if there is even a good solution to this.  Your generic level 65 warrior really isn't cut out to tank effectively in a tier 2 plane, but then there really isn't too many alternatives to XP anywhere else.  But you can't have an across the board changes because high end warriors really dominate in XP groups as well as raids.  <br>
<br>
The best solution I can come up with is itemization.  Put some reasonable 2H and 1H weapons with Taunting Blow that's tradeable.  They don't have to drop in the tier 2 planes but they should drop often enough (i.e. more often than Windblade) so your lower end warriors can actually buy them.  Or, if SoE isn't willing to fix the stun aggro issues, just give warriors more weapons with planar strike/stun lines (stun minus a negative aggro adjustment).  Even with the negative aggro adjustment, Planar stuns still produce plenty of aggro. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spinetwist>Spinetwist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.joydrop.net/spine/spineicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/03 5:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2872.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re</span><hr size=1> Warriors arent exactly swarming with potential here and I think you ppl on the opposite end of the MA dont realise we are trying to do a job to the best of our ability with limited options.

We are doing our god damn best to do our jobs and having ppl like clerics and dmg dealers bitch and moan about aggro isnt making solutions easier. When a cleric is late on a CH or when an enchanter forgets to mez an add you dont see me swarming on the boards protesting and bitching. Did any of you ever stop to think that aggro problems lie not only in the class but in the player? SMART warriors and ones who know how to tank are the best kinds of warriors and it shouldnt matter if you do have sub-standard gear. A precisely timed taunt and a cheap weapon like a frostbringer can still offer you fantastic aggro abilities. <br>

BTW I have no respect for a caster or a cleric who sits on their ass all the time and just bitches while the exp rolls in. The best kinds of ppl are the ones who are alert and awake and dont care if they get smacked in the head once or twice. Besides, it keeps them on their toes! haha.<br>

<br>
I'll grant you the point that PoP tier 2+ zones are supposed to be tough.  The toughness is uneven though.  If you can gain aggro through spell casting, then the only difficulty is standing long enough for CH to hit.  And that's primarily a timing issue, unless the character just can't survive 10 seconds from full health to dead.<br>
<br>
My gear is decent, but not terrific.  A combination of NToV drops along with a big chunk of Barbarian cultural.  I have 4500HP unbuffed and full raid buffed I top 7k HP.  There should be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>no</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> reason I'm not an acceptable tank in tier 2 zones.<br>
<br>
I tank fine in fact.  But I control aggro like garbage in the first 30 seconds of contact, unless I get a lucky proc or if the team is very careful. <br>
<br>
A Knight with 500HP less than I will still tank acceptably in teir 2.  And he'll control aggro fine.  The team won't have to be anywhere near as careful nor will he need to rely on a lucky proc.<br>
<br>
Now, if it's supposed to be so tough, why is it tougher for me than the Knight?  After all, I'm the specialist, right? <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>
