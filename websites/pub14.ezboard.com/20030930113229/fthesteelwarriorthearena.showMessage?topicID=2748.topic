We always play together, so we have 2 person teams. I'm interested in how roles change for classes post 50, as I've never gotten a character that high before and now I'm suddenly looking at more than one character moving pretty quickly in that direction. You guys seem to be the experts around, and many of you are post 60...warriors can always find a group, certainly, so I figure you've grouped with all of my alts and have a good idea about how they turn out in the endgame.<br>
<br>
I'm not worried about my warrior or my paladin...slightly about my paladin, as he's a silly high elf and I don't know if that's going to cost him the snot getting kicked out of him later, but I'm not too worried.<br>
<br>
I am worried about all the other characters we play:<br>
<br>
One - wizards. I have heard some amazingly disturbing news about wizards lately. Manaburn is gone, of course, but I've been hearing that mages are actually *outdamaging* wizards post 50. What the hell is that about? What's the use of a wizard, if they can't kill something faster than anyone else? I also noticed that my partner's wizard doesn't exactly have any interesting AA abilities....the usual stat kinds of things, of course, but her class and PoP advance things are amazingly lame. Much of it is based on evacuate spells....she evacs us once in a blue moon, it's very very rare. So how are wizards later on? Do you shun them from groups?<br>
<br>
Two - Rangers. My Ranger can still hold aggro fairly well, but it sounds like most people don't even consider them tanks post 50. I realize they can do a stunning amount of damage using archery, yes, and I am very aware of being able to get aggro any time I want it over any other class I am grouped with...of course, I know how to play a Ranger, which most people don't <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But what is the Ranger role in a group post 50? And is it even possible for Rangers to solo anymore at that point, without fearing animals? (which is kind of lame, imho, and way more pathetic than anything you're ever going to be doing with a warrior <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Three - enchanter. I hear fear doesn't work on most mobs above a certain level, which is a pretty big drawback...but only one spell in a large arsenal. Can enchanters still find groups post 50? And is it in any way shape or form possible for an enchanter to solo, or duo with a paladin partner?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aeaensabriel>AeaenSabriel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/9/03 10:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2748.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Post 50 role changes</span><hr size=1> Hmmm... All right, lemme add what I know on the topics here. I'm sure there are people on this forum that can provide better responses than I can, and it's likely that they've got some better insight into some of this... Still, here's my shot:<br>
<br>
Warrior - I'd say that the high-end game is not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>drastically</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> different from the mid-level game for warriors... Your goal remains the same: to maintain aggro and take the hits for your group. Equipment becomes a bigger factor in your ability to preform your role well in a group, the dogma of STA/HP as king, with AC close behind is the best way to go when equipping yourself, IMO. Proccing weapons are an important part of aggro management, as well. Of course, the other aspect of the high-end warrior is raid tanking, there are some good posts on these boards regarding that topic.<br>
<br>
Paladin - Not much to say here... As with pretty much all class debates over the best race to choose, I'd say that race matters little in the high end game. From what I understand, the extra WIS that comes with being a High Elf will be a boon to your character in the high-end game. There really isn't an error you could have made at creation that can't be mitigated with equipment / buffs / AA points.<br>
<br>
Wizard - Again, not an expert here, but... Yes, the wizard class abilities may seem a little lacking, but you'd be suprised at how helpful abilities like Exodus can be. Of course, it's always important to be able to evacuate when things get sticky, and not having to devote a spell slot to an evac spell can be a nice thing. I don't know where you and your friend have been duoing, but if you're doing some high-end dungeon hunting, Wizard AA Evacs are much nicer than a nasty CR. There are some other nice wizzy AAs - Harvest of Druzzil, Strong Root, and the abilities that allow you to further increase your spell critical damage come to mind. As to your question about Magi outdamaging Wizards, I can't really give you an answer, I don't pay much mind to the affairs of finger-wigglers all that often. Though, from what I understand, the Wizard PoP damage spells are quite impressive.<br>
<br>
Ranger - No, rangers are not adequite tanks post-50. Depending on your level right now, I'd be suprised if you're having success with a ranger tank in the mid- to upper-40s. Of course, this will change depending on equipment and the mobs you're fighting. However, even with above-average equipment, rangers will have some rather significant difficulties acting as tanks in the high-end game, in PoP especially. Rangers can be truly awesome to have in your group, assuming they know how to manage aggro and support the group well. They offer a few beneficial buffs to groups, and can act as a SoWer / Snarer / Puller fairly well additionally. The main strength of the ranger in a high end group is her ability to do really significant amounts of melee damage. You're still not on par with rogues, but rogues don't have the awesome archery skills you'll get with AA. Endless Quiver with good arrows and a good bow is really awesome.<br>
<br>
Enchanter - Enchanters are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>loved</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in groups post-50. They are almost indespensible (though not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> required) in most 50+ hunting grounds. Of course, CC remains their largest responsibility, along with mana regen, and they can always play mini-wizard if they're sitting around with an excess mana supply. Enchanters can solo efficiantly post-50 through a myriad of charming tactics... Check some enchanter resources for the best methods. In regards to a Pally + Enchanter Duo, I'm sure it'd be good enough to provide mutual gain. It's probobly one of the more untraditional duo makeups in the game, but I see no reason that it couldn't work.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps a bit, and I'm sure others will have better comments than me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.xmission.com/~jmark/alex/aeaensig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raunstoncutter>RaunStoncutter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 285<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/9/03 11:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2748.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/raunstonecutter/bunnyhop.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Post 50 role changes</span><hr size=1> Part of the boon to mage damage is that they are no longer the trodder along to keep everyone good on mana in a pinch.

<br>
Enchanters are wanted/needed in almost every 50+ zone.  Just keep in mind that there are a LOT of 60+ enchanters around.  I get groups faster on my warrior most of the time (my how times change).  Damage always stacks, enchanters don't.  That last can be argued, but it's pretty much true for exp grinding in groups.<br>
<br>
Both Paladin/Enchanter and Druid/Enchanter are excellent duo setups to 60-61.  Druid/Enchanter combo can take you to 65 relatively quickly, it gets boring though IMO.<br>
<br>
Warrior/Cleric and Warrior/Shaman are probably the most flexible duo around.  You can duo or be the core of a group just about anywhere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faederya>Faederya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/03 9:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2748.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Post 50 role changes</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Damage always stacks, enchanters don't<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You should invite two enchanters into your group and have them charm a pet.   Heck, sometimes I main box my enchanter and use her pet and just put my warrior in the back using her Vambracer for chain nukes.<br>
<br>
Charm is back in style.  My enchanter can clear out more camp spots faster then a well balanced group, given she has some mage summoned items.<br>
<br>
I hope I didnt chage the topic too much.  But back to the point.  Classes change ALOT, sometimes with expansions, sometimes with lvls, sometimes with new spells.  Its all about adapting to the &quot;cheese moving&quot; and coming up with new inventive ways.  Think outside the box.<br>
