You know keep a guild together?</span><hr size=1> I have been the leader of my guild since I created it January 2000.  I came from only a few members to over 150 now.  The one thing I have always found works best although its not popular is be firm.  Once you say something, don't back down.  People are like predators, they see you back down once, they will try to take advantage.  <br>
<br>
Cliques are hard to keep out.  No matter how much you try, they will form.  Usually they are just a harmless group of friends that play together more with each other than the rest of the guild.  I do however &quot;encourage&quot; them to group with others in the guild when I see this happening.  On one occasion, the &quot;leader&quot; of a clique has challenged my authority, demanding I do things different and layed down an ultimatum.  He was quickly booted.  Along with several members of his clique.  As leader, never let someone give you an ultimatum or everyone will start doing it.<br>
<br>
I see a lot of you saying a guild is all about the leader.  Although I have struggled and worked to keep my guild together, I wouldn't be able to keep it going if it wasn't for my officers.  A leader of a large guild can not do everything, so what I did was select officers that I felt could handle the responsibility.  Good officers are very important.  They need to be able to say no, they also have to be willing to solve problems and put the guild first.  They have to be willing to take charge in tough situations.  I fully feel that I could take two weeks off and my guild would still be running when I got back.  Thats because I know that my officers can handle the task I give them.  <br>
<br>
People need to understand that a leader can not make everyone happy.  Its impossable.  Also a leader's decisions will anger people, but if the leader is strong willed and follows through with what was said, people will give more respect and respect helps in holding a guild together.  <br>
<br>
To all regular members of a guild, just remember one thing, you wont always know whats going on behind the curtain, or why the Officers and Leader are doing something.  Before you start getting upset and before you start rumors, give them the benefit of the doubt, you might actually like what they are planning or doing.  <br>
<br>
Officers and Leaders, always be firm.  This will make you look like the badguy a lot of times and some people will hate you but never back down.  It is your guild after all.  Never be afraid to piss someone off, and most importantly never be afraid to boot someone who isn't right for the guild.  <br>
