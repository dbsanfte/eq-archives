<br>
So far I think I'm gonna be forced to admit I am underwhelmed with the end result of all the hard work I put into training them first in lieu of going 100% defensive to start.<br>
<br>
At the moment I have Ferocity 3, Punishing Blade 3, Tactical Mastery 3 and Ingenuity 1 as my unique offensive PoP abilites. I have not yet trained the upgrades to the lackluster SoL offensive abilties just yet, as I need to finish a couple of them before I do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;">Tactical Mastery:</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Tactical Mastery allows you to land a couple hits every once in a while that would have otherwise been parried/dodged/blocked/riposted etc. <br>
<br>
But, one of the biggest draws to the ability was the idea that when you land a hit through the mobs <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>riposte</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> we would be able to forgo the swingback the mob would get as part of a standard riposte. <br>
<br>
This lead most warriors to assume that this ability was multi-faceted in the fact that it worked both as an offensive AND a defensive ability, in that you would essentially take less damage over all when tanking a mob.<br>
<br>
But, as is being discovered in this <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=2617.topic" target="top">thread</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> it is looking more and more like Tactical Mastery is nothing more than an expensive method of geting in a couple extra swings on a mob.<br>
<br>
This entire skill seems to serve no purpose and could have just as easily been left out of the game in favor of them making Ferocity a little more effective, which I will discuss later.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;">Punishing Blade:</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This ability allows you to get an extra swing with all 2 handed weapons durring combat on an infrequent basis.<br>
<br>
The draw to this AA ability was specifically:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Greater 2h DPS<br>
More Aggro:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> generatedby the extra swings/damage<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>More Procs:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (which is debatable since some people are begining to think you proc relatively the same amount per minute on average with or without haste/extra swings etc, but that is better left discussed in another thread).<br>
<br>
As it turns out, with Punishing Blade 3 your overall DPS will only go up somewhere between 1-2% (about 1-3dps depending on your weapon) as described in some detail in <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showMessageRange?topicID=618.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20" target="top">this thread</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> over at the monk forums.<br>
<br>
Now, I understand that there could be slighty different implementations for the percentages as far as how PB monks over warriors, but I'd have to say that my own numbers (37% 51% 11% 1 %'s for my singles doubles triples and quads, taken from a 60minute log of me fighting 'river source' for coutning swings round rather than flat dps) match his almost exactly, even given the fact I have ferocity 3 and he has Ferocity 1 on his final test. <br>
<br>
He concludes that overall the effects of having maxed out Punishing Blade are neglible at best, and that the points may have been better spent somewhere else. The changes from level to level of PB seem so insignificant it is causing people to question whether the implementation of the ability is somehow broken.<br>
<br>
I am half convinced from my own tests that somehow PB and Feroicty aren't working in conjunction with one another and that somehow they are at odds, much like the SK lifetap crit abilities were at odds durring initial implementation for the chance to proc on the heal portion if you'd procced on the damage portion alreayd and visa versa. As it seems my numbers were even going down durring long parses (60 minutes or more of continuous fighting with a stationary 1 million hp mob that doesnt fight back).<br>
<br>
It seemed as if the more I trained Punishing Blade (after having ferocity 3) the less swings per round I would get in the long run, as if for every ferocity 'proc' to allow a double attack for the round I was less likey to get a natural double/triple + PB proc. But this is all conjecture, as I don't have a valid history of logs to back this up, just my latest 60 minute parse on 'river source' after training PB3/Ferocity 3.<br>
<br>
I am thinking that if Ferocity 'procs' it is negating you from proccing PB all together for the round, but like I said I have zero data to back this up, call it a placebo effect.<br>
<br>
Either way, this skill is alot of points wasted since out of over 17,000 rounds of combat you could end up with only 116 rounds where you scored a quad attack as an example.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;">Ferocity:</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The draw for this ability seems to be <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Greater 1h and 2h DPS<br>
More Aggro:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> generated by the extra swings/damage<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>More Procs:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (which is debatable since some people are begining to think you proc relatively the same amount per minute on average with or without haste/extra swings etc, but that is better left discussed in another thread).<br>
<br>
The benefits I get from having ferocity 3 should be apparent when looking at my %'s for single/double attacks. I should have a significanty higher percentage of double attacks (causing a lower percentage of single attacks) over someone without the skill.<br>
<br>
Looking at some numbers given to me from someone who has not trained ferocity yet and looking at some old numbers before pop (when I was 60) it appears as if I've gone from having a ~49% change to score a double to about a ~51% chance to score a double (this was parsing my 2 handed weapons, I rarely use 1 handers anymore) for a given round. This is an increase of about 2%. and only seems to add about 1-2DPS depending on my weapon setup.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;">Ingenuity:</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The draw for this ability was probably more for fun than utility more than anything else, as getting extra proc damage wouldn't exactly be a huge source of DPS, and believe me, in it's current form IT ISN'T.<br>
<br>
The damage on crits you get goes up as you train the skill more, but the frequency is still dreadfully low. For a skill that ultimately costs around 6 points to fully train, it would be nice to see it work more than 1-3 times every hour of constant combat. And this is with weapons that proc about 3-6 times a minute on average (I can average about 150-200 procs an hour dual wielding in constant melee). <br>
<br>
It seems as if this skill just gives you a 1-1.5% chance to crit on your procs with no ay to increase your chances. For the aa spent it seems as if you're only getting about 300-500 extra damage an hour on average depending on your weapons proc. Not exactly what I'd consider worth 6 points.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
I'd like to see any hard numbers any of you have in regards to these abilities. I've learned some good stuff about them talking with various people and seeing the various prases around. Couldn't hurt to have some of these numbers verified and checked and rechecked by others of us who have invested in these skills.<br>
<br>
Will be nice to get more data from people both AFTER you have them and BEFORE you train them to compare more thoroughly.<br>
<br>
I would ultimately like to see VI adress some of these issues by adjusting some of these abilities, or CLARIFYING EXACTLY what an ability will do for the points spent.<br>
<br>
The descriptions they give are so vauge as to make you wonder exactly what your new ability is doing even after spending your points on it. Would be nice to see some hard numbers in the AA descriptions so we know what we're working towards.<br>
<br>
Would be nice to have Tactical Mastery forgo a riposte completely on a successful process of the ability. There is no reason we should be giving our enemies extra attacks if we are avoiding thier riposte block, our TM should both negate the block AND the swingback.<br>
<br>
If they are not going to change Tactical Mastery so that it is more than just another method of gaining 0.5-1dps then they should refund our points spent and remove the ability all together and take the benefits of the ability and add that 0.5-1dps to the damage output of another ability like Ferocity, since they are both nothing more than a means of getting extra dps, the only difference is one requires more swings and one does not.<br>
<br>
I think that Punishing Blade needs to be looked at. They need to make sure it is functioning properly in conjunction with Ferocity, Flurry, Double Riposte etc AND they need to bump up the % chance we have of scoring an extra swing for the round.<br>
<br>
I am already dissapointed by how my SoL offensive AA abilities turned out. They were never adressed within the scope of that expansion, and instead received thier 'fixes' in PoP, by giving us the option of buying a fix by putting even MORE points into training flurry, double riposte etc to get almost acceptable performance out of them. I don't want the same thing to happen to PoP abilities.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
All in all i would have to say that unlike other classes offensive AA abilities where each ability helps the individual player; all of our abilities seem as if they are only going to be fully effective when ALL of the other warriors in your guild have trained the same offsensive abilities. <br>
<br>
Not until you have 5 other people with the same abilities as your own are we going to notice any real difference in warrior capabilities for adding offensive damage to a raid. And given the fact that 5 warriors with full offensive AA's can EASILY be outdone by a single paladin with trained AA (as an example) in certain encounters, I think it shows that some of these issues beg to be addressed if we want to retain a usefulness in anything we can bring to a raid other than the ability to hit /disc def every 12.5 minutes.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
On a side note, I am also of the opinion our defensive and offensive discs should be on thier own separate refresh timers(with reduced refresh times and extended durations for some of our shorter offensive aa's). I wouldn't mind it if we could actually use some of our offensive abilities without having to worry that we're going to be screwed if we need defensive or evasive in the next 30 minutes. <br>
<br>
Defensive discs should only interfere with other defensive disc refresh timers and offensive discs should only interefere with eachothers refresh timers. Although, you still shouldn't be able to use both discs at once.<br>
<br>
Putting /shield on it's own timer was a step in the right direction. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=160002"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimtag.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnimwit>Gnimwit</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimflag.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/12/02 5:32:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=toren2k>toren2k</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/12/02 6:13:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2624.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warrior Offensive AA: Not all they could be, letdown</span><hr size=1> Nice post Gnim, i must agree if this is true that its rather poor.

We get fixes to some broken from SoL, example in pov the other day at inner caves, the chanter dc green rusty armor pet did same dps as me (i used boc and Tunare whip, so not sucky weapons). I know we are here to mostly take dmg, but giving us 50 different exspensive aa skills that each doesnt make any differense  and even dont &quot;stack&quot; is utterly stupid. As you said our offensive and defensive discs should be on different timers and the offensive discs reuse time should be decreased greatly, because atm they SUCK. <p>Thundersam Theviking<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->60 Warlord<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=405263" target="top">Why i would be permacamped</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

But, seeing as how Ferocity should be triggering on a 'per round' basis and not a 'per attack' basis I wouldn't think it'd be intentionally applied to kicks.<br>
<br>
I also haven't heard from Monks if they are getting thier special kicks/attacks doubled with ferocity, or large races getting double bashes/slams etc.<br>
<br>
If you indeed can double kick/bash etc this probably would be the best method to determine your Ferocity percentage, too bad it would take hundreds of kicks to do this.<br>
<br>
I'll look into it and if I do see some double kicks I'll see if I can determine some specific numbers. Unfortunately, given the literal fraction of a % increase that ferocity is supposed to be giving it could take 1000 kicks to get an accurate % between 0-2% etc.<br>
<br>
Thats alot of kicks.<br>

I totally agree about the separation between offensive and defensive discs. I very rarely use offensive discs, not just because they are mostly pretty sucky, but also because it's hard not to think in the next hour of play time I might need defensive.<br>

I believe you still have to make a successfull hit roll, and thus can still miss after a successfull TM roll(?), so that 5.5% number is probably a bit too high, should multiply with 60% hitrate and you would end up with 3-4% DPS increase. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rani>rani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/14/02 9:17:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bozzhawg>Bozzhawg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/14/02 10:21:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2624.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warrior Offensive AA: Not all they could be, letdown</span><hr size=1> Ambidexterity gave ~ 10% dps increasee if I remember correctly.<br>

Any way thanks for these findings Gnimwit, this looks pretty broken (or a colossal waste of time) atm.

Well once you finish your defensive AA's you're going to be left with a bunch of lackluster offensive aa's to train anyway, so no reason not to have them at least prove effective for the points spent. <br>
<br>
Personally I already have alot of defensive abilities trained. Aside from the obvious DPS benefits one of my goals for getting my offensives done now asap was for better aggro management durring speedy trashmob clearing sessions in places like Tactics, Saryrns Tower, HoHB, Bertoxx Ring, Mez Breaking etc etc etc where the trash mobs are doing extrordinary damage per round. <br>
<br>
In most of these places we don't have the time nor do we want to take the time per kill just to stand around letting a warrior beat on it to gain sufficient aggro before calling everyone else in. What alot of guilds are doing right now is replacing warriors all together in these situations and getting a Paladin/SK to do all the aggro mgmt and tanking due to the fact they are flat out better at getting aggro faster and holding it more reliably than equally equipped warriors due to the nature of thier spells.<br>
<br>
Personally I just wanted an edge in the aggro control department to help me get and keep aggro durring these marathon trash clearing sessions. Boss Mob control is not an issue for me, since boss mobs are ussually properly respected by the players as something they should be paying attention to thier aggro for. <br>
<br>
I'm tired of being forced to sit on the side falling asleep durring a 4 hour snoozefest hitting auto-attack once every couple of minutes while a multi-functional class gets to play the ONLY role I have to offer the raid. These offensive AA's, to me, were my way of helping to overcome some of our shortcommings in the instant aggro and aggro management dept to help put myself back into the role I've played this character 3 years to fill.<br>
<br>
If I wanted to stand off to the side while another class did all the tanking durring these sessions I'd have made a rogue, at least I'd have sufficient dps to offer for my other shortcommins. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=160002"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimtag.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnimwit>Gnimwit</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimflag.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/14/02 11:26:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phantron>Phantron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/15/02 7:10:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2624.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warrior Offensive AA: Not all they could be, letdown</span><hr size=1> Nope, your hit rate can be 1% or 100%, TM3 will still increase your DPS by the exact same %.  This is because everyone use special defense before the hit/miss check (e.g. you will never 'miss' an enrage mob, and likewise a mob will never 'miss' a player using Nimble/WS/Furious.  Special skills are used before the hit/miss check is even computed)<br>
<br>
Let's use the example above, mob uses special defenses 10% of the time, you pierce through special defense 50% of the time.<br>
<br>
Without TM3, 90% of your swing actually goes to the hit/miss check, and 10% gets negated to nothingness.  <br>
<br>
With TM3, 95% of your swing gets to make hit/miss check, and 5% swings get negated to nothingness.  <br>
<br>
Old DPS is 90% X your hit rate<br>
New DPS is 95% X your hit rate<br>
<br>
Since your hit rate doesn't change, the ratio of your new DPS to old DPS is exactly 95/90, which is about a gain of 5.5% DPS.  <br>
<br>
Of course, we don't exactly how much TM3 pierces through defenses but 50% seems like a good estimate.  Note that just because it pierces 50% doesn't mean you'll hit a mob on enrage 50% because roughly half of your hits will be a miss even after you get through the riposte.  Although I obviously don't have an extensive log of fight against riposte, 1 out of 4 connect through enrage seems about right.<br>
<br>
I did the numbers for most using special skills 15% of the time and it turns out you get roughly 8% DPS increase.  Basically the more often a mob can use special defenses, the bigger the gains from Tactical Mastery, and since warriors don't always have the option of hitting a mob from behind, this DPS is considerable, especially for xp groups where we're almost always in the front.<br>
<br>
To put an extreme example, you get an infinite % improvement in DPS versus an enraged mob, from 0 before to whatever that actually hurt a mob through enrage.<br>
<br>
So assuming these numbers, 9 AAs for 5.5% DPS increase in xp situation isn't too bad, at least in line with most of the offensive AAs (in fact, I'm pretty sure Flurry is less than this).  The defensive part reminds unverified to this date as we only have enrage logs to test the defensive part, and it's not clear enrage works the same as regular riposte. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90049">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnimwit>Gnimwit</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimflag.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/15/02 7:42:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2624.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimp.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warrior Offensive AA: Not all they could be, letdown</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nope, your hit rate can .....<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So you can sum up Tactical Mastery as: <br>
<br>
Roughly same DPS increase as Ambidextery and same AA cost, but only working from the front. Does not reduce damage taken from ripostes at all. [EDIT: This is theoretical assuming 50% successrate on TM..]<br>

So if you dont have ambidextery and use dualwield, ambidextery is still the better buy, as it is not restricted to frontal attack only. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rani>rani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/16/02 6:22:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phantron>Phantron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/16/02 2:21:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2624.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warrior Offensive AA: Not all they could be, letdown</span><hr size=1> I've posted on another thread, but there is no definitive parse prove TM doesn't work against normal riposte yet.  So far the only proof is that it doesn't work against enrage, but not on normal ripostes (enrage isn't the same as normal riposte).  <br>
<br>
Let's assume for a moment TM actually works but only on regular ripostes.  We still can't tell.  Why?  Instead of:<br>
<br>
X hit you (or miss)<br>
You try to hit X but X Riposte<br>
<br>
You'd get:<br>
<br>
You try to hit X but miss <br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
You hit X for Y<br>
<br>
However, the two examples where it works is completely indistinqishable from a normal hit or a normal miss because you no longer see the riposte part (assuming it works).  In fact, the only thing you can observe from a log is where TM failed, i.e.<br>
<br>
X hits you for Y (or miss)<br>
You hit X for Y (or miss, but not riposte)<br>
<br>
since those two circumstances can never happen normally (assuming X isn't attacking you).  <br>

Mind you, no evidence to prove it doesn't work doesn't mean it works, but we still don't have conclusive proof that it doesn't work against normal ripostes.
