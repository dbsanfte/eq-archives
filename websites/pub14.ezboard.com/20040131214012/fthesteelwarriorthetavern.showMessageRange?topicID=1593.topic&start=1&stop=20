size=1> Dear Dev Team!<br>
<br>
Playing a meanwhile level 62 female High Elven Paladin with 29 AA points on MithMarr server since Aug 2000, I am very happy about the changes my class recieved with the melee balance patches, the skills and spells in the expansions Shadows of Luclin and Planes of Power. Earlier my further playing was more based on pride about what I had achieved, since those changes it is pride about what I achieved as well as about what I can contribute with my class skills when properly used.<br>
<br>
The certainly nicest change was the upgrades in the ability to &quot;tank&quot; for my class. Not only do we have a real role in a group now (and a nice backup role if the &quot;tank spot&quot; is taken), groupleaders are also able to choose from three possible tanks now instead of one as before. While Warriors can take a maior beating and turn spells like Complete Heal or the new Dru/Shm heals more efficient, Knights have a higher taunt ability to reduce the need of spread heals, mana expensive fast heals or group heals (Paladins even can take over the groupheals themselfs).<br>
<br>
The differences in HP, AC, Mitigation and Avoidance between Warriors and Knights are in place, and not so big that groups would still choose Warriors over Knights (while other way around neither, both of which is very good designed from your side). The difference between Warriors and Knights when taunting is yet too big though. So, while clearly not asking for a &quot;nerf&quot; of the Knight classes or spell agro in general, I'd like to ask you to slightely improve the aggro generating skills of Warriors. Not nerf but improvement for Warriors because most players of Casters and Priests, as well as offensive melees love to live and perform at their best most. Examples for not living and performing at ones best, related to the tank not being able to hold agro properly:<br>
- a Shaman that gets a beating on every spell: Slow they cast<br>
- a Ranger that has to turn off autoattack even though using spell: Jolting Blades every 15 seconds for a few seconds<br>
- Druids and Wizards sitting around and casting Spell: Ensnare (or similar) 45 seconds after the fight began while also not being able to cast direct Damage spells any earlier<br>
- Necromancers not being able to use their damage over time potential fully from fear of being wasted by xp-zones inhabiting mobs hitting fast for over 600 per blow<br>
<br>
<br>
I have made a few thoughts about how this topic could be adjusted as well - as I guess you get tons of feedbacks, emails and other submissions about it from many, many players:<br>
<br>
- The general Kick skill should have added a Agro increasing component which equals the Paladin spell: Stun. With that Warriors, and other kick enabled classes, could taunt a little bit better (without putting the other tanks into the dust) and still be able to choose when to use that taunt and when not to. They don't loose much DPS when not kicking because another Warrior is MT for example.<br>
<br>
- Maybe a nice gimmick would be to have an class AA skill called something aline of &quot;Leathal Defamation&quot;, creating a hotbutton, clicking which makes the targeted mob (caps at level 65) perma focused on the Warrior, reuse time as LoH or HT, with a PoP AA in 3 levels that reduces the reuse time by half at level 3 (as Paladins have for LoH)...<br>
<br>
- The Proc of the hate-producing part of the proc of the 2HS version of the Warrior epic could be improved to be similar to Knight epics.<br>
<br>
- Several 1HS, 1HB and 1HP weapons that are flagged &quot;Warrior only&quot; could be introduced in the level 55+ game that are either focused to generate Hate but have a relatively low taunt-factor, as well as weapons that clearly have low taunt but higher DPS. While being forced to maximize their HP more than any other class, it is the only option for gear choices of the Warrior class to go for taunt or DPS.<br>
<br>
- A rather fun AA (and not necessarily related to taunt) would be a PoP AA skill for Warriors of level 64 or 65 that turns Frenzy into an mob like Enrage with still allowing them to do those nifty crippling blows, but else auto-reposting every landing melee-hit. This ability should last 5 seconds max or until the char being healed and then (if the Warrior still lives) going on as the normal Frenzy. This class-skill should be delivered with one level for 9 points.<br>
<br>
With kind regards and thank you for your entertaining and fun game,<br>

P.S.: My final decision to post this here derived from a long talk with several Knights, Warriors and other representants of other classes on the server I am playing on. The decision to post it here instead of sending an email to the Verant Interactive customer relationship executives came from my trust of them reading this board as well as other classes' boards and the desire to have players of this fine class adding their comments as well.<br>
<br>
Edit: I was informed on my server that it is the reason that Warriors' disadvantage for their higher HP/AC/Mitig/Avoid is that everyone in the group/raid has to &quot;let&quot; the Warrior keep agro. This in opposition to Knights keeping the agro, letting everyone play to their max, but needing more heals. I knew that and it is basically right - fair is discussable. So please do not read the suggestions at the end of the post as all-to-max-extend solutions, but rather as either-or (except the Enrage AA, which should rather be a class defining AA like Slay Undead for example). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shayariel>Shayariel</A> at: 11/19/02 7:28:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brommixkotwr>Brommix Kotwr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/19/02 4:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1593.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dear developer team: One knight's view of Warriors.</span><hr size=1> Nice post <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aauminki>Aauminki</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 1240<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/19/02 6:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1593.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dear developer team: One knight's view of Warriors.</span><hr size=1> Very nice post, especially the idea about increased defensive measures while berzerk. While I don't think VI would improve warrior tanking <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>that</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> much (since you are asking for a 5 second immunity to melee death), I do believe that the idea has merit - let's say the warrior becomes more focused on his defense while berzerk, doubling the % of parries and/or ripostes. I like ripostes the best, because they would not help *that* much against flurriers (aow) or rampages (tvk) while still being a nice, albeit minor, improvement in tanking. Make it riposte-increase and put DoubleRiposte3 as prerequisite, Gods know that the skill is mostly useless as it is right now. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions ~ Team Headstart</a></i> <br>

The additions, no matter in what mixture, should not bring Warriors to an equal taunt level of Knights.<br>
And all that also means of course that the game content (revamps, new expensions, patches) doesn't get balanced around a certain class mix in a group (e.g. mobs that can't harm melee but /DT casters and need supreme taunting in an entire expansion or mobs that hit that hard and fast and are that focused on the the HP-fatest person that the 1000 HP of the Warrior makes it forced to use them in an xp camp).<br>
<br>
Tank balance is a very difficult balance, especially as it has been officially closed as being finished. Still there needs to be a slight (please stress: slight) raise in taunt skills - OR a vast improvement in raid skills (e.g. an AA that is comparable to Slay Undead, but works against all kind of mobs that are level 75 and up).<br>
<br>
About the Enrage AA: It doesn't necessarily need to be 100% Mitigation of hits, a Warrior being able to reduce the dmg taken down to 33% while getting an riposte-attack for any hit he takes, would still be way cool.<br>
<br>
For any wondering: I fully support class balance and I see that Warriors are a bit out of whack now. So I support your causes. I will not support those though, that ask to get improved to a level pre-melee patches. That is too much. Every tank class (War/SK/Pal) deserves a 33% chance to get the tank spot in a group, throughout the levelrange and from new player to uber. This is meant including the various preferences of players, it doesn't help if a class gets a selfonly instant CH with 1 sec cast time, 1 sec recast if people value the shine of the other class' epic more or their surplus in HP, spells, whatever...<br>

Warriors cannot hold aggro pre 53 anywhere close to the other hybrids who can use snare, stuns,engulfing darkness etc.   <br>
<br>
Warriors are way underbalanceed when it comes to aggro and general solo abilities pre 53..that is what needs to be addressed and fixed before adding more high end features.  Warriors do not need to be the boring work horse class anymore..give them better taunt and some solo abilities and not only will they be more fun to play, but if they can solo more, more groups will learn early on to grab hybrids..warriors are definatley chosen from levels 1 to 9 over all before the hybrids get spells.<br>

<br>
As for the clerics deciding which tank they want, the cleric community says they prefer the knights cause it is just as easy to heal them and they can keep agro. <br>

For the around-53 levelrange I'd think some proc-weapons with War-only tag should be enough though to get them closer to Knights.<br>
<br>
On another board I summarized again:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So basically while we are about equally desireble in xp-groups, we also have different roles on raids. These roles must be clearly worked out though. For Knights they are defined and well placed already, but - I think I am only repeating myself now - I think that Warriors need...<br>
<br>
... the Taunt-upgrade<br>
... AAs that improve the role tanking for raids while not touching xp-group-balance<br>

I'd really love to see the Enrage AA (in addition to Frenzy, even if only autoblocking 66% instead of 100% hits), an AA that gives you a 10% Avoidance and Mitigation boost when taking hits from mobs level 75+ and maybe also an AA Create Bandages (you can bind wound up to 100% by now, right? If not, that would be a nice AA as well).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I think most of us have seen that this doesn't work, due to the vast differences between people with Uberguild access with Uberguild friends and those with Casualguild access with Casualguild friends.<br>
<br>
If the equipment is available to everyone, then it more than likely will not be of use to those at the high end game.  If its only available to those in the high end, then once again the gap between uber and casual will widen~<br>

Improving both too much will make Knights obsolete in groups. If placing some of those items with maybe up to 160 raw HP and weapons with agro proc in PoP highest tier zones and some others with maybe 80, 90 raw HP or a lesser high agro proc in the relatively easy to access zones (which maybe will be revamped to fit that level range soon anyways) for the people that are 55 to 60 in PoD/I/N like zones, there should be no further discrepancy from ubers to non-ubers. Of course Warriors in uber guilds need to get some more absolute HP (while staying equal to Knights when comparing relative, maybe relatively 15% (??) more HP than Knights throughout the game).<br>
<br>
The problem is that, if VI increases the HP/AC to be constant 15% over Knights' HP/AC (and avoid/mitig as well) AND their taunt to be closer to ours, Knights will be pointless to chose for the tank spot, as Warriors have a too large advantage in efficiency in that core ability (Core abilities in EQ are in my eyes: tanking, healing, crowd controling, DPS, buffing unique and usefull buffs). Core abilities should always be fillable with about 3 different classes while being able to achieve the very same things in the same time with any combination of healer/tank/cc/dps/buffer.<br>
A combo War/Cle plus four others should not get more xp/hour than e.g. a combo SK/Dru plus four others, the only difference should be tactics needed. If one combo gets indeed less xp/h than another then the secondary skills of that combi are too bad (assuming equal gear, equal skill of players and so on).<br>
<br>
From the further discussion with people on my server, I think that Warriors mainly need a small Taunt upgrade for xp groups, and a stronger, and more defining skill that /disc def for raids, e.g. an AA that allows them to each mitigate AND avoid 4% more dmg from mobs that are lvl 75 at skill level 1, 71 at skill level 2 and 66 at skill level 3, CS3 and CA3 as requirements for this level 61 or 65 PoP skill, or even Class skill - just as an example. Together with the overall but small Taunt upgrade, this should define this class as the only real raid tank while not disabling Knights to tank the non-non-slowable boss mobs, which should be possible with some more efford for the case that a guild has no Warrior online, pure non-slowable endgame bossmobs (which I was told are about 2% in game) should always require a Warrior and nothing else.<br>
This raid role should offset the Knights' soloing advantage, in xp groups both Warriors and Knights should be equally efficient, and would be, at least with this changes...<br>

<br>
Get rid of Lamentation from the game.<br>
<br>
Replace Seb Guardian's loot table with this:<br>
<br>
Angry Blade of Lamentation<br>
MAGIC/LORE<br>
PRIMARY/SECONDARY<br>
DMG: 8<br>
DLY: 18<br>
STR: 6<br>
STA: 6<br>
HP: 20<br>
EFFECT: Taunting Blow (or some lesser but still useful variation of the effect they put on the Cord Hilted Spike Driver)<br>
<br>
CLASSES: War/Rng/Shd (just like lammy)<br>
<br>
Make it just as common a drop as lamentation. Make it proc at a useful rate.<br>
<br>
The lower delay helps offset the lower damage and worse ratio. It becomes a sought after tool for the warrior who wants to hold aggro at that level range. As well as adding a little spice back into Seb.<br>
<br>
Juts an idea.<br>

ATM, I'm just this || much left getting lvl 65.  I often group with high lvl Pally's and SK's.  If the SK can keep his voice spell up on me, I can hold aggro better.  If I'm grouping with a Pally... you can forget about me holding aggro, it's rediculous.  I'm using a Red Epic/Clearmetal Windblade combo, there is NO reason I should not be able to hld aggro with this.  It's fekking retarded you almost HAVE to have an EB weapon to hold aggro.  Taunt does not work for crap, you get top of the aggro list +1, then when Paly_01 or Ranger_01 or whatever_01 does just the smallest bit more dmg than you you have lost aggro yet again.  Make taunt have some lasting effect.  Make it top of the agro list +50 or +100 or something.<br>
     Another gripe I have is with AET.  I think it needs to be addressed just like I think regular taunt needs to be addressed.  Example.  Say your pulling for your group, you get 2 adds so you have 3 mobs inc to camp.  Ok so you have gotten beat on a bit and are going to need a heal.  You get back to camp with mobs close behind.  Cleric heals you to keep you from dying, Devine Light or something.  BOOM!  All 3 mobs are now on the cleric.  Clerc targets themselves and starts to heal.  You pop AET, now you have all 3 mobs back on you where they are supposed to be.  Well, remember the cleric targeting themself and starting to heal he damage they took?  Well that heal lands now.  3_mobs_01 say wtf!  Cleric is healing themself! KEEL!  Now you have once again lost aggro and the cleric is dying a painfull death.  WTF is up with that?  I spent 5 aa points to have guarenteed aggro off everyone in my party and this is the crap I get?  grrrr  Now AET does have it's uses and has saed my groups ass many times.  But I think there are some issues that need to be adressed.<br>

Why is that?  Even with no mana, that particular paladin was a better tank than I.  His DPS and taunt skill alone could keep taunt. I mean, that's what I work with... Pure DPS and taunt.

There is a little flaw in undertsanding of Hybrid Taunt as well as in the comparison itself:<br>

An oom Knight is worse taunting than a Warrior, except his weapon-proc and self-buff proc are sufficient and happen fast enough to hold agro (Epic and Tunare PoG quest sword are good examples as their proc contains a Stun which produces as much agro as the spell: Stun).<br>
If the weapons (and rest of the gear) of the Knight are better than yours though you cannot compare them to you anymore. A 51 Warrior in full Thurg quest armor with epics is also better than a 52 Paladin in Armor of Ro (midlevel quest) with a Wurmslayer and Shield of Mistmoore.<br>
<br>
Saying that no oone cares about Knight mana when they tank is as ridiculous as not taking them as tank at all, stating they cannot tank in general, or as leaving a 60 Druid in Sebilis at zin looking for a Cleric, having the opinion that Druids aren't sufficient healers in Sebilis (my non-uber 58 Druid healed in Juggs already, and our guild isn't even in NToV or ST yet).<br>
A Knight's taunt is based on their spells (for Paladins: Stuns) and their weapon procs. All Warriors I talked to were the opinion that tauntin with 2 1HS works better than with 1 2HS if both are procless and of comparable DPS. Else there would only be the taunt skill ehich caps lower as the one from Warriors for us, and the AA skills, where Warriors have AET and Paladins a 30 sec Stun - I wonder if that would be sufficient to outtaunt you.<br>
<br>
On raids anyways, the Knights are held to not get agro there and they manage it if they aren't total nerds or tremendously better geared than the Warrior. If that would be the case though, the RL should rather take the Knight as MT anyways, or would you - as another, but similar example - take a 50 War over a 65 SK as MT, a 34 Cle over a 58 Dru as MH, even if the two in both examples each have similar gear?<br>
