First, my appologies to the &quot;good&quot; wariors for all the monks who polute your boards. And a slap on the wrist to all the &quot;bad&quot; warriors who gloat over our nerfage.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, yes, the nerf was needed, and i'm saying this as a lvl 56 NON-TWINK monk with no serious alts.<br>
<br>
The only bad thing i can see about this is a little tactic i used myself to save my group when things go wrong, which wont work as good anymore. Basically i take aggro and tank a bit while the casters and the non-FD-ers run like the wind. Den FD or die.<br>
<br>
But yes, on absorbing damage, a leather class shouldn't be better then a plate class.<br>
<br>
On avoidance, yes, a leatherclass should be better at avoidance then a plate class.<br>
<br>
Yes, the AC nerf will damage our Fungi/Tstaf/Epic solo ability, solo blows anyways. Grouping is so much more fun.<br>
<br>
Monks should never be a one on one replacement for a warrior. I hope this nerf will wipe all the monk twinks who don't know how to pull a cow from a barn from the game,and leave the class to the people who like playing a monk not for powerplaying, but for fun.<br>
<br>
And Verant, FIX THAT DAMNED TAUNT, i hate FD-ing all the time to lose aggro for the Tanks.<br>
<br>
Now before any bad blood is created between the Monk and Warrior communities, please remember, not all monks are wining, jealous powerplayers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usurlok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Surlok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/15/02 8:00:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A different monk post</span><hr size=1> I was under the same opinion as you in that the ones that would be most affected by this change..Would be monk twinks...<br>

How do you 'fix' items by changing a class?<br>
What happens if you don't have those items that make you tank like a warrior?<br>
So, now all monks need to get those things to balance themselvs?<br>
Do the monks without those unbalanced items tank like a plate class?<br>
<br>
Ya see where all this hubbub is comin from?<br>
I personally don't play at a level where a monk can outtank me without bein a decent twink, but I still don't see the logic behind admittin what the problem is and then changin somethin else to fix it.<br>

<br>
Well the bad itemization has played a part but people dont realize that joe schmoe monk can tank in an xp group as well as little johnny warrior. you know why? they are on the same mitigation tables. Its as simple as that <br>
Equipment up until a certain point is easy for BOTH classes to get. Both can have the same ac all the way to the softcap from 1 to 60 without even being a twink, and when you have the same mitigation tables and similar to identical AC then you tank JUST the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwubaogoldenarmz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wubao Goldenarmz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/15/02 6:24:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   lol</span><hr size=1> &quot;but people dont realize that joe schmoe monk can tank in an xp group as well as little johnny warrior.&quot;<br>

Johnny SK can tank for an XP group too. As can Mikey Pallie. Freddie Beastlord, Fernando Bard AND even Danny Cleric with the new changes clerics have recently received.<br>
<br>
Having a person stand in front of some spiders in velk's or some frogs in seb or some mushrooms in FG ain't much of a big deal. Any old level 60 with some armor and a cup of coffee next to their terminal can do that for a few hours of pointless XP grinding.<br>

ac 12 hp 35 <br>
<br>
Level 1 human monk. all points in sta.<br>
ac 22 hp 29<br>
<br>
ouch. bad thing. then I checked on quest items, cause I figured quested items might have been checked by a different chimp than the all/ all items were.<br>
<br>
noob qeynos bp stats. 12 ac +20hp +2sta warrior.<br>
noob freeport tunic       6 ac +0hp  +5sta monk.<br>
<br>
thurg bp warrior          47 ac +90hp +10sta<br>
thurg bp monk            16 ac +60hp +  4sta<br>
<br>
kael bp warrior            59 ac +90hp +10sta<br>
kael bp monk              23 ac +60hp +13sta<br>
<br>
So, by that measure why shouldn't monks be on the same table? the advantage gained in mitigation certainly wouldn't make up for the lost ac or hp's in the long run. Short term with avoidance bonuses and plate mitigation would work out.<br>
<br>
When a  class is designed for armor with half the ac and around 70% the hps, with equal mitigation, stuffin them into equal armor will indeed throw the balance off.<br>
<br>
Simple solution? how about boosting the weight on some of those items? Monks could still wear a peice or two without the penalty, but not a whole set. That seems like a safer approach than changing a whole class to suit the item problems.<br>
Like I said before, it will either not fix anything or break everything below it. I'll see what happens.<br>
<br>
as far as tanking xp groups is concerned, depends on who's in the group. My druid was puller / tank for 4 wizzies and a cleric workin the tizmak's in GD. Didn't keep aggro long, but they didn't last that long either..<br>

That was never a problem before NToV and Luclin though. Why? Because all of a sudden monks were getting gear that gave them comparable ac AND hp to a warrior which they didnt have before. Well we had the similar ac, it is the hp that really causes the problem. Seriously, if the HIGHEST a monk could reach now was 5k hp fully raid buffed and in the best possible gear, would you warriors give a damn that we had the same ac as you? Nope, because we couldnt possibly compete for high end mob tanking jobs with so few hp. But now that the top monks have hit what? 6800hp? NOW there is a sudden interest in our MITIGATION for some reason! Oh of COURSE the problem isnt the fact that monks can nearly break 7khp raid buffed, the REAL problem is that monks have the same or close to the same ac as warriors! /rolls eyes. What they really should have nerfed was the hp on the all/all items when worn by monks if they wanted to keep a REAL balance.<br>
I DO agree however, that if Verant is just too damn lazy to fix the items, the mitigation nerf is the next best thing. I just hope they dont screw up too much and turn us into chanter tanks. /sigh<br>

Verant didn't intend the FD pulling thing, but they saw no-one was getting upset about it and knew it was an extra strategy being used. Putting more strategy into a game is never a bad thing.<br>

I agree, the arguing should stop, lets have a decent conversation instead =P<br>

Monks are getting &quot;tapped&quot; by the nerf bat, nothing that arguing on other boards can solve. I think the main reason the discussion heated this much is that people where always nasty towards monks(With reason, lotsa twinked mofo's outthere), but no reason to gloat or harass people(Got several tells in game basically telling me i was crap because i was a monk and should stop whining... I never whined..). But now by all this stupid crossposting on war/mnk boards, yer all starting a flame war which will leave a bad taste.<br>

Monk brothers, please return to your own boards, dont nag here.<br>
Warriors, if you visit the monk boards to gloat, pls have the decency not to.<br>
