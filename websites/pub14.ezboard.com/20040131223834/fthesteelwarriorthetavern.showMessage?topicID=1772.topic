I hope that maybe, just maybe, I might feel a bit better after doing so. Here goes...<br>
<br>
Im pissy today basically because ive been lvl 50 for about two weeks. I cant find a group anywhere. Lets cover the most common places to find groups at this lvl and ill give my expericances in the last week.<br>
<br>
First off we have good ole Karnors castle...<br>
-Train Hell- With the advent of PoP most of the people 55+ off hunting in glorious, made for druid, outdoor poop holes. This leaves KC, which used to be only 50+, subject to low lvl groups that are inexperianced in the zone and cant figure out which side to train their mobs to when they run. Typical KC group consists of camping either the left or right courtyard (better bring a chanter or shaman) or the captain spawn area toward the front. That makes room for only 3 groups. Do people ever camp any other spots for xp? <br>
<br>
Next on the list we have Velk's Labrynth (spelling)<br>
-Haven't found a group yet- Though I've never had an actual group here, I have spent a short bit of time being PLed by a buddy of mine who i teamed with while he was doing AA exp. I hit Velks every time I log in hopeing to get a group. The xp in there is great from what I could see. I usually see about 4 ppl sitting near the zone with the LFL flag up. Velks is definitely one of those places I dont take lightly. Back stabbing and invis mobs are no fun. Bring your see invis items and invis potions. Velks lately has been hideously overcamped <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Then there is good ole Kael...<br>
-would love to hunt here- So far I've managed to group once in Kael. Although fun, the day ended horribly when some A$$clown epic wielding fatboy decided to train 6 mobs on us. We were stationed near the bank area and out of the way of the normal training path. My hour of fun was followed by a two hour corpse run and 3 days of waiting for someone to rez my meat sack. The guy who trained us did it on purpose for reasons we will never know. He logged shortly after so we couldnt identify him. Even though my initial experiance wasnt too good, I still really want to do kael. The xp was good, I liked the atmosphere, I really want to build CoV faction (draconic pauldrons), and the rare chance to possibly loot some corroded plate. I make a trip to Kael everyday hoping to get a pick up group. When I zone in im usually met with a full group or a guild doing a raid<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Last but not least Old Sebilis<br>
-Never been- Nope...never been to Seb. Why you may ask? Well, I dont have a key. It's really unfortunate that a Warr cannot get a key solo until much later in life. My few RL friends that play online have hectic schedules (one just had a baby<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) so they cannot provide too much assistance. I am a new member in a guild and unfortunately being the new person has put me on the bottom of the totem pole as far as getting help goes. I've asked for assistance on the quest numerous times and have basically been ignored. I fully understand that people are busy doing their own thing and have their own business to attend to and I dont expect everyone to simply drop everything to help the new guy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's just really frustrating, though, when you drop everything to help fellow guild mates including powerlvling ppl's alts with my necro (same account), spending 3 hours doing spells research for those that need it, and attending and lending my services to those that need ppl for epic raids.  Speaking of epic raids, I participated in one last last night in Chardok but ill save that for another post. <br>
<br>
At this point I'm so frustrated with my warr that im about ready to give up. The main reason i made a warr was because I love to tank and I thought it would be easy to find groups, especially 50+. Unfortunately it has been far from easy and many people link this due to the release of PoP. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.<br>

<br>
Yeah, sometimes levels suck, sometimes zones suck. But don't get pissy and rant cause you can't get a group in your zone of choice. <br>

I hope you feel less stressed about being level 50 for two whole weeks now. <p>Aveen Lucenthawk<br>

Hell I'll take any group. The problem has been a lack of being able to get a group period. I'd be glad to hunt anywhere. The one's I put here were the most recommended by friends, guildmates, and those Warr's kind enough to post here. I could care less how long a lvl takes as long as I feel like im making some sort of progress. I realize that things are gonna slow waaay down once i get myself established in the 50's. I'm pressing myself to get 55+ so I can participate in ToV and any PoP activities. Like I said before, Im up for any suggestions. <br>

<br>
Now, what a far fuggin stretch... how the HELL did Frod pull that nonsense out of his hat?<br>
<br>
I'll tell you how...<br>
<br>
When Velious came out, it was a &quot;high level expansion&quot;  (High really being 30+, but it was primarily aimed at 55+ with a few bones thrown in for mid levellers).   The expansion wasn't what we know now as &quot;velious&quot;, it was SIGNIFICANTLY harder.  Siren's Grotto was so hard, no one even wanted to go INTO the zone, Velk's wasn't the joke it is today, the very same spiders that people exp on till 61 and fight over as thouh it was the last piece of bread on a desert island were harder than they are now (Velium Poison) and green to 55 and dropped no loot.  Most stuff had VERY high MR, and it was damn hard... They &quot;fixed&quot; it but overfixed it in the process.  Velks was turned into the gimp zone it is now, complete with mudflated drops from chintzy mobs like Frenzied, etc.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow, getting back to my point.... while everyone was fascinated with the progression of &quot;uber guilds&quot;... there was a large population on public bulleting boards who repeated as mantra &quot;Why does VI always cater to the high level players and uber guilds?&quot;  Over and over and over we heard this, many many many times...  &quot;Stuff is too hard, yadda yadda yadda&quot;.<br>
<br>
What ended up happenning was Vi THOUGHT they were &quot;giving the people what they wanted&quot;... here comes Luclin, an all levels expansion (the second one as a matter of fact).   They also made it &quot;easier&quot; and listened to the &quot;OMG we hate the holy trinity&quot; crowd... aka outdoor zones, lots of em, and easy mobs... but with a lot of HP/AC... But even worse, they added a LOT of mid-level zones....<br>
<br>
Ok here's where it starts getting ugly... Too many mid level  zones accomplishes one thing:  It spreads people out too much.  In pre-Kunark, everyone flocked to a few areas, and finding groups was a matter of waiting till a spot opened, and jumping in.    With Kunark, the 50+ crowd was still able to do this, but the 20-45 crowd began to suffer, because there were simply too many options.   The only viable alternative was to go to an easy outdoor zone and join a &quot;mini group&quot;, this is why the popularity of LOIO, Frontier Mountains, and DL as levelling spots...  When people got to their 50's... a few things happenned.  First, people who had never been challenged hadn't learned how to play the game in dungeons.   I learned a HELL of a lot in my 20's in Cazic Thule way back in the day.   It prompted my addiction to dungeons and risks.  That zone was revamped, and I've talked to lower level players (I do this a lot), and they have this concept in their minds &quot;Why should I go into a hard zone like SolB, when I can just safely group up with a druid and go to DL?&quot;    <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this is antithetical to the way of the warrior who is most at home in dungeons and high risk areas.   Groups generally avoid that which is high risk, so you end up flocking to the chintzy outdoor zones, and the great dungeons go unpopulated (7 people in Sebilis, 3 in Sol B, 50 in Maiden's Eye, 100 in PoN).    Also, in outdoor zones, casters and druids and bards can solo comfortably, so they don't group up because there's little incentive to.<br>
<br>
The problem turns out to be &quot;too many choices&quot;... The reason for his is because people complained about &quot;the uber guilds and uber hig level people&quot; getting the benefits of expansions, so more mid level content is added in response, which thins out the populations more and more and forces people to hunt in the areas of least resistance.<br>
<br>
Best thing VI could do for the &quot;mid levels&quot; (40-57)would be to either green out or pull a CT of many of their current mid level exp zones, forcing mid level players into fewer zones so they could group up and play EQ again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varaho1>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 1267<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/03 2:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1772.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ~</span><hr size=1> I blame the economy mostly.<br>

The other problem is that after 3 years, most servers have the semi-casual crowd above 60, especially with the easy levelling that is today's norm.

There are some really nice areas out there that nobody hunts in. I'm still frustrated as hell. Ive played this game for about 2 years now and now that I am finally set on a server and have a char 50+...I cant get a group hehe. <br>

As far as 2 boxing goes...I know too many ppl that do it. Half the Warr's I know have a shaman or druid bot. Didnt the new patch allow you to minimize eq? I havent tried it yet =(<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am a new member in a guild and unfortunately being the new person has put me on the bottom of the totem pole as far as getting help goes. I've asked for assistance on the quest numerous times and have basically been ignored.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The Seb key isn't really even a quest, it takes 15-20 minutes in Trak's Teeth to find/kill the frogs and another 10-20 to do the turn in.  If your new guild won't even help you with that after repeated requests, maybe you should look for another guild.<br>
<br>
Next:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's just really frustrating, though, when you drop everything to help fellow guild mates including powerlvling ppl's alts with my necro (same account), spending 3 hours doing spells research for those that need it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
...Sounds like they're taking advantage of your good-will and making you their bitch...dump 'em.  Having you PL their alts is gimp.  Unless you truly enjoy PLing strangers /boggle (it didn't come across that anyone in this new guild is actually your friend - can't say I blame you), why waste your time doing this?<br>
<br>
I've found that post-50, its very helpful (especially for a warrior) to find a home in a good guild.  It provides people to group with (90%+ of my exp groups have guildies involved), friendships, people you can count on to help you out in a jam, and a community to be a part of in EQ.  Finding a good guild is not always an easy task, but once found, is more than worth the effort!  Poke around and see what guilds have a good and friendly reputation - stay away from guilds that have no screening requirements...i.e. some guy shouting in the bazaar &quot;soandso guild now accepting members 20+&quot; or something to that effect.  If you get in a group with some guilded people who seem friendly, seek them out and ask if you could attend some raids with them to meet the others.<br>
I think once you find a guild you're happy with, the rest will fall in place.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>

I may be leaving my current guild in a few days. I havent really decided yet. As far as me helping ppl goes, it's just in my nature to help those that need it. It's one of the more satisfying elements in eq. I jump at the opportunity to help ppl that need it. My guild never asked or required me to help them. I offered out of kindness.<br>
<br>
If I choose to remove him, I will probably remain guildless untill im 55+. After my brief stint in this guild, I've learned a few things about guilds and what to look for in one. I'd like to find a guild that's friendly, enjoys playing, that's organized, and not a bunch of loot whores. Most of all, I want a group of ppl to hunt and have fun with. I'm sure there are plenty of guilds out there that meet this criteria. The only problem is that most of them are going to all be doing events that are out of my lvl reach. The only real solution would be for me to get more lvl's under my belt. <br>
<br>
Now that I think about it..I used to complain about the boredom of Dreadlands but at least I was getting xp and moving along. I spent all this time busting my butt to get to lvl 50 only to find out that 50-55 was going to be much tougher. <br>

The 50's flat out suck if all you do is exp grind.  Plus, at 50, this should be the time when you begin to gear up for the end game.  If all you do is exp grind, you wont have access to Champions armor and wont have faction up for HoT in Temple of Veeshan when its time to do that.  Of course, there are other reasons, but imho, you'll find yourself seriously behind in gear and faction at 55 if you remain unguilded.<br>
<br>
[edit - I'm sure if you posted your server here, people could offer some suggestions of guilds friendly to a 50 tank <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ]<br>

Exp &gt; all /grin.  Not that id consider myself endgame tho.<br>
<br>
I leveled up to 60 as fast as i could, and I had some damn gimp gear at the time too.  But with levels your options on raids open up and you'll get the gear more easily.<br>
<br>
Faction is dead easy to get once you get to 55, simple really, a couple of kael raids and you're there.  (at least on our server, they are run all the time) and then voila, you can go to HoT raids and get yerself some armor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But most importantly have fun whatever you're doingI guess.  I didn't mind the exp grind too much, usually plenty of peeps to chat with.<br>
