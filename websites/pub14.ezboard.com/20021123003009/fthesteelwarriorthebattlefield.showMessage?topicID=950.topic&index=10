Taunt is simply a chance to move to the top of a mob's hate list.  Each taunt is either a success (moves you to top of mob's hate list) or is a failure.  If you have aggro, then there is no need to taunt as you are already at the top of the mob's hate list.  When someone takes aggro away, i.e., they are now at the top of the hate list, then you taunt until you regain aggro.  Its a horrible feeling when you have just hit taunt needlessly and THEN lose aggro, because you must now wait for it to refresh or hope for a quick weapon proc while the mob is beating on your cleric, chanter, etc.<br>

Generally bought from towns with magic item (potions, chipped bone rods, summon food/drink stones) merchants (felwithe, rivervale, etc.).  Basically you use them for a long range pull where you want to pull but dont want to damage the mob because that would cause the other mobs around the target to aggro as well.  Prime example as I said before is Seb Crypt.  Since it's not top secret or anything I'll explain it in better detail.<br>
<br>
Deep in the Seb crypt camp there's a room with 1 mob who would either be the Blood of the Chottal or its PH.  After killing that, the next room has the Emperor Chottal or his PH as well as 6 spectres and/or skeletons that &quot;protect&quot; him.  Opening the door, targetting him and casting a non-damaging spell on him will pull the mob straight across the room to your group without having to deal with any of the other guard mobs.<br>
<br>
Also, another good feature about crystallize pumice is it doesnt need line of sight.  I've pulled mobs through/around walls before such as getting the 9th coldain ring mob Murdrick Tardok solo with the help of a druid or ranger. <p><Table Style='Filter: Alpha(Opacity=100, FinishOpacity=50, Style=2, StartX=85, FinishX=20, StartY=0, FinishY=0)'><B><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6495" target="magelo"><Font Color=#FFCC33 Size=3 Face=Times New Roman, Helvetica>Rula - warh0bbit, esq.</Font></a><br><a href="http://www.shattered-sorcery.com/blight/" target="Blight"><Font Color=CC00FF><i>&#60Blight&#62, Vazaelle</i></Font></a><br></B></Table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ujustfive.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Just Five</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 1:18:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=950.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: If you don't mind me answering ;)</span><hr size=1> Furor's gear didn't get him to whatever pedestal you are placing him on.<br>

I would guess it's a heck of a lot, although I'm not particurlarly sure why. Is it the class that atracts the type of 'thinker' to it or is it the simply the class at high level puts you right into the middle of the action so you are more aware of what's going on than some others?<br>
<br>
I wouldn't say I'm the 'tactician' for my guild but I'm one of 2 or 3 raid leaders and for a while I always made myself MT. Not because I thought I was the best warrior but because I needed to be in control. Again though not because I have a particularly controlling personality (although some would diagree :P ) but because if I had a clear idea of how I wanted the fight to go the best way to ensure the 'plan' was followed was to be the linchpin - the MT.<br>
<br>
It's much easier though for a bad MT to wipe a raid than it is for a good MT to win it. In our early raiding days I MT'd Terror once and forgot to press auto attack, many other raids I'm so caught up in other things I forget to press defensive. I think another part of it is if someone is going to scerw up the raid with a mistake I'd much rather it was me than someone else.<br>
<br>
Eventually though it became clear a lot of other tanks in the guild were not only probably more skilled than me but also getting bored as I guess for many it's like being the difference between making the team and being captain of it. Many people want that added responsibilty and a chance to better prove themselves. Others don't though - for god's sake don't force someone to MT if they ask not to, the fear of failure can take the fun away for some.<br>
<br>
A few, like Furor, have the 'magic' combination of a great 'EQ brain' and playing the class that is often the linchpin on raids. Sort of like the difference between a quarterback that can throw well and one that can throw well and has a great head for the game - the ones you see on TV are the latter type.<br>
<br>
These days I play a cleric 99% of the time on raids and whilst it's a bit frustrating at times not having the same degree of control over situations (mostly positioning - some things are jsut hard to describe in text in a 3d-world) I don't think it really matters too much, as long as the other warriors have the brain to adapt to situations etc.<br>
<br>
As for the key factors for being a good warrior - levels, AA and gear all the way. For being a good MT though I think adaptability and a good memory are key to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukilaara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilaara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/19/02 7:57:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=950.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.elchtom.de/Fantasy/f49.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: If you don't mind me answering ;)</span><hr size=1> Hm what makes a warrior better that others.<br>

Gear is nothing when you pull crap. <br>
Gear is nothing when you allways attack the mob the chanter plans to mezz.<br>
Gear is nothing when your behavior is uggly<br>
<br>
Reputation is the way. You enter a zone. Ppl. see you. You get invited before shouting for a group.<br>
<br>
I am a gnome warrior - means my hp arent so big than ogre ones.<br>
I had in Level 60  1 Part Indicolite 3 Parts Cobalt Rest this and that and a 25 AC Chain Tunic ( later upgraded to 30 AC ).<br>
I had nothing special in weapons ( Chelaki Tail Lammy ... )<br>
<br>
In my leveling time in Karnor , Sebilis .. I have never had problems finding a group in (sometimes seconds after logging in ) some minutes. Sometimes I couldn't say hello to my guild cause I was asked for a group .. .<br>
<br>
Why ? <br>
Hard to say why.<br>
Maybe that<br>
I never trained my group or others<br>
I am so good looking when I am fighting<br>
No one makes so good sounds when hes been hitted<br>
I made things ( whith pumice ... ) in a way ppl. never have seen in Sebilis before<br>
I played with my brain <br>
I always were able to hold aggro against (Epic monks Epic rogues Rangers )<br>
I did not hold my mouth when ppl. do not work like intended<br>
I knew how to manage the classes for best abilites and results.<br>
I made more exp with groups where ppl. thought that they can't stand there ( Hands in KC without Chanter (LD) for hours with a 53Level group .. Chef in Sebi without Cleric (LD) for hours with druid as healer :. )<br>
<br>
All and more .. <br>
<br>
The thing is<br>
<br>
Ppl. must trust you. <br>
<br>
I played between 40 and 60 95 % of the time in  PickUps. On my black list of not to invite ppl. there were lots of bad players. Bad in form of bad play. Ninjalooters. ..... <br>
<br>
Youre reputation is the only thing you can't really repair.<br>
Youre reputation is the only thing which is important in finding a group.<br>
<br>
I found groups with my &quot;decent gear &quot; when other Warriors in full Thurga  or indicolite ... with better weapons were looking for groups too.<br>
<br>
And when there would be a group or groupleader who would throw you out of group for a &quot;better equipped&quot; warrior ... put him on your list, cause he is a moron.<br>

Warriors need to be able to taunt effectively etc, but lets look at a roleplaying perspective:<br>
<br>
Warriors are the Kings of Combat. We know about everything. We have to know stratagies for mobs and be able to come up with them when we don't, we have to know zones like the back of our hand, we have to be able to correct other people when they screw up as well as take criticism and learn from our own mistake. Warriors have to be able to make quick descisions in combat (such as evacing or camping a cleric). Warriors need to have a commanding presence.<br>
<br>
Now, from a real life perspective: Just know your @#$%. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukilaxin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilaxin</A> at: 6/19/02 11:43:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uthehavocblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheHavocblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 266<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/19/02 2:33:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=950.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.guardianalliance.org/cgi-bin/upload/Thaknew.gif h=40 w=30></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: If you don't mind me answering ;)</span><hr size=1> hmmm...I'm thinking there's one thing that's lurking in the background here, but hasn't been said.<br>

Good stuff here, a caster sitting down when you bring a mob into the camp after doing this won't take aggro - you have hard aggro as opposed to soft aggro, which is attained by moving into the mobs reaction radius (monks often do this).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  as well as taunt once or twice before I ever get back to the group<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You might as well not bother, taunt is a yes/no skill - either it moves you to the top of the hatelist - or it doesn't move you anywhere, seeing you're already on the top of the hatelist either option spells the same oucome.<br>
<br>
Lots of good stuff in this thread, I've been living a sheltered life as a twink warrior - have almost always exclusively grouped within the guild where everyone know and trust each other to do the right thing (tm).<br>
<br>
What is most important is:<br>
<br>
1. Know your stuff, all of it<br>
2. Get to know the stuff you don't know all of<br>
3. Learn what other classes are capable of, and in particular incapable of (ie. mages don't get root, necros do get undead slow etc.)<br>
<br>
You'll need 3. for when you plan your groups, back when I played a wizard I'd oftentimes arrange, or help arrange, a group the day before trying to get a well balanced group together. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions</a></i> <br>

People nailed it on the head, just read all the previous posts.  <br>
<br>
To tell a little story though which kinda applies to the original post.<br>
<br>
Back in the day when I played (No Flames Please) A Paladin, I was in the long forgotten Cazic Thule (Great zone).  Along came this Barb Warrior name Draviin (I still remember his name after 2 years).  He had some pretty decent gear for his level, but that isnt why I remember him.  <br>
<br>
He took charged of the group.  Not bossy, but he let you know what was going on.  How it should go, and corrected you if you were wrong.  But did it nicely or with humor.  He knew exactly where to pull, when to pull, what to pull, and how many to pull.  Knew when to stop for breaks, mana, nature calls, etc...  Even when things got outta control with agro's or trains, he handled it perfectly.  No one ever died on his watch.  Though he leveled faster than me, the 3 or 4 times I grouped with him has stuck with me until now.  <br>
<br>
Moral:  Everything that was posted before mine  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
