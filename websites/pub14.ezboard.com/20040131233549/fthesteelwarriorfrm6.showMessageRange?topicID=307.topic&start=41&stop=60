<br>
I dont know a hell of a lot about the other epics (they are not compariable in terms of items or reward) But in the pain factor off the top of my head: <br>
<br>
Phingel is a repeated kill for wizards, for a RARE staff.  They gotta kill VS for a staff that drops 'sometimes', they gotta kill the broken golem in a zone that must be cleared before they get to it.  <br>
<br>
Bard - White / Red / Green scale ??? Plus they gotta get something for the Trak area - If the bard is 53+, thats Scalekeeper for white scale, or Gorenaire(the hardest dragon outside VP??).<br>
<br>
Paladins - Vox/Gorenaire - Make that a level 58 Paladin - that leaves him / her Gorenaire for a RARE drop.  Then of course, they like warriors have a few sources for the other paladin book.<br>
<br>
Severilious drops the Green Scale as a common drop. Each and everytime I have killed him (5 in total) he has dropped a Green Scale.  If he dosent c'est la vie. <br>
<br>
Enchanters - They have their bottleneck in Neriak on our server, plus the Shissar is a KILLER.  Gotta clear the zone in the hope that he pops, then kill him ... I mean comon.  <br>
<br>
In comparison for the one of the sources for the Green Scale - he is in an open area ... accessible, relatively easy to kill, drops the green scale as common drop.<br>
<br>
I mean comon guys in comparison with those pieces, location, repop timers etc....is Sev really that bad?<br>
<br>
And to Hagus, your right the cleric epic is not EXACTLY the same as Sev, it is EXACTLY the same as in you would need to camp the mob.   The last cleric I know to complete their epic camped Ragefire for 72 hours solid.  That's a long time. They also have to camp mobs in LR and SolA (again off the top of my head)<br>
<br>
Your taking things too literally.  <br>
<br>
If you would talk about bottlenecks that need correcting, then you would prolly need to upgrade to the Legends server.  Under no circumstances will Verant start making mobs on a 10 minute timer such as these.  I would personally love for Lozidal to be on a 10 minute timer, but its not gonna happen.  <br>
<br>
Why ? cos people all have certain targets in EQ, once they have accomplished them .. they will decide whether they want to continue or not.   I have taken 2 breaks from EQ, because I have met my goals on each occasion, that was my epic and finally completing my armour after 3 years of playing. <br>
<br>
I'm not gonna grumble about this mob, or that mob because there are alternatives available to you.  <br>
<br>
Its an epic quest, because you gotta work for it.  <br>
<br>
It does actually look like you want to buy it from Shady for 20pp<br>
I will stand by what I say <br>
5-6 sources of Red Scale<br>
2 Sources (whether one is difficult to get to or not is irrelevant - look at the other epics) <br>

How long did you say you played this game?<br>
<br>
&quot;Your taking things too literally.&quot;<br>
<br>
You're taking things too lightly.  Just because you lucked out on your green scales doesn't mean it's like that for the other 99% of the population.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not gonna grumble about this mob, or that mob because there are alternatives available to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's just the problem there.  People don't want to buy their epics from Shady, they want to have an epic quest with an epic reward.  Not the epic quest, with the replaceable reward we have now.  Changing Sev will not make our epic a cakewalk.  We still have a ton of other harder-than-most-epics crap to go through.  The green scale puts it over the top compaired to most epics, yet our epic won't be in our hands for very long if you have the power to just &quot;go get one&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Ragefire part is actually quite different now that you put it in a 72 hour light.  Sev is a 168 hour pop... yet you feel Sev is &quot;EASIER&quot;?  You're still defying common sense.<br>
<br>
Since you're making outlandish put-words-in-his-mouth comments such as &quot;It does actually look like you want to buy it from Shady for 20pp&quot; when all I did was question why you would say something like 72 &gt; 168 (Sev being easier than Rage), I guess I'll make my own comment in the same.  Since you seem to think you know what I'm thinking even though I offered no such evidence, I'll just state this as fact of what I know you're thinking in the same way:<br>
<br>
It does actually look like you would care about this subject if you didn't have your epic &quot;already&quot;.<br>
<br>
Wanting Sev to be toned down, oh maybe like 72 = 72 in comparison to some other peoples epics, isn't even REMOTELY close to 20pp off Shady.  When I receive your apology for such a baseless remark I'll apologize for mine about your epic above. <p>--Hagus Bruichladdich<BR>

<br>
As far as I am concerned, we are talking about the same issue - Sev re: warrior the epic V the other epics.  <br>
<br>
I have been playing this game for 3 years and I worked like hell to get my epic.  Yes, I did it in one month ... but in that one month .. I turned down all sorts to get there.  I normally abide by rules that I dont let EQ take away my normal sleeping pattern, but was up in PoA until 10am in the morning, killed Talendor, cleared Chardok, got a friend to MQ the PoF piece, went to PoH and waited my turn -  I basically used the network of friends to help me as I has helped them before.  I put the time in, I got the reward.  Same with Sev, I didnt camp him so I didnt get lucky, but I had a friend camping him whilst I was camping the old ragefire for my friend(which I had to camp for 3 separate people - only once was I lucky)<br>
<br>
I despise doing quests of any kind and Warrior epic was no exception.  <br>
<br>
Although Sev is quite a long camp granted, the reward is there to be had.  <br>
<br>
The warrior epic imho is no where near one of the hardest epics.  On the rare occasion, Verant has made us an exception and given us definitely not the easiest epic (monk/shaman/druid) but definitelty not the hardest (paladin/SK/mage or necro - cant remember which?) .  Again I dont know enough bout the stages of their epics to comment on them. More of a case of the nightmare parts.<br>
<br>
The is no other replacement for the cleric epic, that means EVERY cleric wants and needs it, same goes for the other classes in a lot of cases.  <br>
<br>
For the warriors, this is different kettle of fish. There are so many weapons just as easy to access that are compariable or better than the warrior epic.  I have had a Silver sword of yelnak cross my hands not long back thats 13/24 - thats not bad, Willsapper 13/20? or 12/20 or something + slow = a great weapon - Vaniki is not tough at all.  Prolly easier than Sev, I came across a mob that drops a 15/20 weapon in Griegs end.  Never fought him before but he dont seem that hard tbh.  Frostbringer aint far behind the epic.  There are loads of weapons better than the main hand epic, and plenty to replace the offhand.  <br>
<br>
The warrior epic is awkward, and yes a bottleneck has occurred with Sev ... but I dont find people camping Sev on our server.  ever.  Everytime I have passed through EJ, Sev hasnt been camped.  <br>
<br>
Ragefire is always camped without exception.<br>
<br>
This (from Quellious experience) has made Ragefire more of a target for KSing than Sev.  Sev has never been KSed on our server - we would have heard about it.<br>
<br>
I was being sarcastic with the 20pp epic from the Shady bro <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I think prolly the only shortfall in the epic quest, to oppose the things about better weapons being available is that the warrior epic should be better than 14/24 ... maybe 16/24, or 14/22.  <br>
<br>
I dont mind, Ill live with it.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uraluvinssteele.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raluvin Ssteele</A> at: 3/28/02 7:54:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufuloriancavestomper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FulorianCavestomper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/28/02 3:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=307.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Scale mess</span><hr size=1> Silver Sword of Yalrek is 13/24, without a proc.

Have the t-shirt.  Yes it is awkward, but hard??? no its not hard at all.  <br>
<br>
Which is the hardest of all the mobs that we have to fight ? I would prolly say the golem in PoF ... thats not hard its awkward to get to.  <br>
<br>
None of the epics are particularly hard thinking about it a little more, they all go on levels of awkwardness.  Correct me if I am wrong as I am not 100%, but out of all of the epics ... what is the hardest mob to drop ? Gorenaire??.  <br>
<br>
And if the greenscale dropped everytime, you would have classes like wizards screaming at Verant because VS dont drop their staff everytime or Phingel has to be killed 20X + to get their staff.  Kedge sucks big time.  <br>
<br>
I still think it should not be changed.  I am open minded re:  discussions with warriors, but from Verants point of view it has to be balanced.  On reflection, it is balanced.  <br>

The cleric epic seems to encourage more enadom people to help out than any other, which doesn't bother me at all.  Rogue and shaman are so easy that people make jokes about them being issued at 50 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Personally, if any epic changes should be made I believe it should be to make the common ones harder to obtain, not make one of the few that is truly requires epic effort to achieve easier. <p><html>

For the larger guilds that have 20+ people on at anytime of the day, Sev probably doesn't seem like that big of a problem.  On the other hand, the warrior in a small guild or not in a guild at all, Sev and the Green Scale can be a HUGE obsticle.  I feel I got extremely lucky when it came to the Green Scale.  I logged on my druid, he was parked in EJ, around 8:30am one morning and there Sev was on track.  I quickly logged off, posted to my guild's forum, then logged on Balker.  After two hours I still was short people, but we went for it anyway.  We wiped.  We reassembled, more people showed up, and another guild was starting to form up to take Sev.  We rushed our forces to get ready and attacked.  This time we were successful.  With the guild I'm in we were barely able to handle Sev in enough time.  I can only imagine what people in smaller guilds or no guilds at all are going through.<br>
<br>
Just to comment on a few things people said above.  The &quot;New and Improved&quot; Ragefire camp is arguably worse than the old.  One of the clerics in my guild just got off a 135hr RF camp.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if increasing the spawn time on Sev is a good option.  Right now, people say they don't see others sitting in EJ camping Sev.  That's because most have a ranger or druid camped there waiting for the spawn.  If you lower the spawn time, you will probably turn it into a camp-a-thon, or worse, it will turn into something like what Lod is on Xegony, 1 group of Ebay bought level 60 characters are camped out in Iceclad, as soon as Lod pops, this guy or these guys, log on and kill Lod before any guild has a chance to even think about heading to IC.  That would really screw a warrior if someone was perma-camping Sev.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think they should leave the Sev spawn alone and either add another mob that's accessable or make it possible for Nortlav the Scale Keeper to drop the Green Scale.  I don't think either will make the warrior epic trivial by any means. <p><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~goodonion/_uimages/BNLFG2.JPG>

I have organised pretty much an FFA raid on Sev, I was asked to help out and a lot of people respected this ... and random people sent me tells also.  <br>

They werent clowns about it, if you communicate well then people wont screw you over (in general - well not on Quellious anyway).  <br>

With Lozidal and the GM issue, I personally would not have got involved and would have preferred for the GM to de-spawn it rather than anything else.  <br>

Untill I started to camp him. I parked a 41 druid close to the staircase and would play my warrior on my main machine while tracking SEV on my POS second machine. Here is the info I gathered from 2 weeks of tracking SEV:<br>
<br>
1) Have your guild on call, so to speak. Post on your boards that you are camping this mob and need forces within a moments notice to gather to EJ and prep for SEV. SEV is a GUILD DEPENDANT MOB. You need your guilds support to drop everything and come to EJ on your call. Establish this first and foremost. <br>
2) SEV is a 3 day spawn. It's not exact, but I watched him spawn 4 times in 12 days, with no patches in between. I would say give or take 2 hours inbetween last death and new pop. After patches, Im not sure the spawn time. I would just try to watch zone as much as you can after patch or find out when he was killed and come back 3 days later. If another guild kills him, start the timer, you have a advantage now, use it. <br>
3) EJ is very easy to get to and fast, you can port right in and run to the staircase in 2-3 minutes, depending on your zone times.<br>
4) When SEV does spawn, scan the zone for people. If no guild has started gathering (meaning you don't see more then 6 people of any guild here yet) call out in guild chat to get to EJ ASAP. <br>
5) Its now just a rat race to get the forces there first. Win the race, win the spawn. <br>
6) Once you have people there, try to get everyone to 160+ PR 160 + MR. On pull have guildmates remove haste from SEV ASAP, cancel magic. Then have shammy Malo and Slow him. MA engage, go defensive, build agro, call in troops, nuke at 55, dead dragon. <br>
7) If he doesn't drop scale, go smoke and calm down, write down time he died, and come back in 3 days, and track him again. <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If you are persistant and put in the time, you'll get the scale. <br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents of advice on what worked for me. I agree, its a bottleneck and the alt option Hoskgar (sp) sucks balls. Your best bet is SEV, just get your guild ready to drop EVERYTHING and get to EJ ASAP and youll get the mob eventually. <br>
<br>
And reguardless of what people say about replacing it, it's still a great weapon and it holds agro very well. What other weapon has the ability of being able to be used has a 2 hander or two 1 handers? The 2 hander version procs so much for me (I double proc it alot) I can hold agro with a 2 hander over some duel wielders =) The epic gives a huge DEX increase as noted in this thread, and helps it proc alot. It has about 190 HP on it, with the 15 stm included. 12 AC on the blue one to make up for lesser weapons that had AC on them you were probably using before. 10 to all resists. It's not a super fast weapon in the 1 hander mode like Zek but with haste item and chanter haste, your doing some nice damage, and you hit harder then with Zek by far. Try out your mightystrike now =) It's look, (IMO), is unmatched by any other epic by far. <br>
<br>
Good Luck to all warriors questing this gem...When you get it, you'll have a perma smile for weeks =) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=124692" target="_new"><B><FONT COLOR="#1E90FF">Riggens Warchild </FONT></B></a>

change the damn quest from getting both swords at once, to being similar to the ranger epic, where we can get one sword then the other, and if we want to combine them we finish out the rest of the quest....<br>
