I have read many post consisting of problems with warrior argo control.  Imo there is nothing wrong with how a warrior taunt works, or how well we maintain argo.<br>
<br>
Argo management is a hugh issue while we play this game everquest.  The biggest issue we have here is lack of understanding on how other class's work and general idoit behaviour.  I do not expect everyone to be an expert on every class, but I do expect them to be an expert in their class if they are 61+.  Common sense is over rated also.<br>
<br>
If a shaman/enchanter slows a mob while standing max distance half way up a mountain... who's faunt is it you could not control Argo?<br>
<br>
If a Monk/Rogue/ranger are using procing weapons with high taunt value... is it your problem they get smacked on?    Most of the time I refuse to even taunt it back when i see one of these class procing and gaining argo.<br>
<br>
If a Pallie/SK are casting every available spell they got during a battle is argo control a warrior issue?<br>
<br>
If a wizzie (standing up on the wall with the shaman) decides to nuke their ass off, but you see no concussion spells between nukes... who is at fault?<br>
<br>
Mages/Necro's that are 61+ that still sit and /pet attack.  I still chuckle when i see em die in under a second  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
There are numerous other little things that could be mentioned.  I am just trying to make a point though, not here to educate.<br>
<br>
You don't have a horse, you don't like horses?  Go back to exping pre pop.<br>
<br>
I for 1 have no issues with argo control as a warrior, I only have an issue with argo management from others.<br>

No one in a guild worth a damn has this problem in raids.  The occasional aggro strip is accidental and after the rez, is forgiven. <p>Glachum McShlachum<br>

<br>
~Who's problem is it?~<br>
<br>
Its your problem and I tell you why ....<br>
<br>
If you dont taunt agro back off someone that steals agro Shm/Ench or High DPS class and they die, guess what happens??  You have to stop pulls .. cleric has to rez .. there are rez effects .. you have to rebuff that person, ~YOUR~ xp goes  down the shitter (thats right, you just hurt yourself indirectly).  Guess who the others are going to attribute this to???  Thats right .. YOU.  They'll start saying &quot;Wtf should have had someone that can hold agro better like Pally / SK tank, none of this @#%$ would have happened&quot;.  Its a direct reflection on you.<br>
<br>
For each time a SR has to be cast its the equivalent to a CH, so I mean, if you dont hold agro guess who you hurt?  Not just your party members but yourself also by slowing down your xp with less effienct usage of cleric mana.<br>
<br>
Why would anyone want to group with a class (for a pick up group) where they cant fully function as their own class .. they have to hold back?  Obviously preference would go to the class that would complement the others in the group and allow them to do their job, when they want to.<br>
<br>
Alittle food for thought and reasons you SHOULD be concerned over agro control. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glatius2>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 760<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/28/03 11:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1833.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: It's not your job to &quot;control&quot; argo...</span><hr size=1> You're singing an old song.  It used to be valid, it is no longer.  The facts of the matter are this, people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WILL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do what is easiest, fastest, and most effective.  You can in fact ride a horse as your major mode of transportation, however the majority of people will use an automobile.<br>
<br>
You also obviously haven't read the various threads explaining <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>exactly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> how slowing early is safer for the group as a whole, particularly when the tank <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>can</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> snag and hold immediate aggro.  A Warrior can't do this reliably, a Knight can.  Ergo, here is the huge leap of logic coming, if the Knight can otherwise tank the mob just fine he will be considered a better choice over the Warrior.<br>
<br>
People don't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>want</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be hindered with controling their aggro to the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>huge</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> degree a Warrior requires, particularly when they can get a Knight to perform the same function just as successfully and not have to worry about it.<br>
<br>
How hard is that to grasp?  Why are people unable to understand this extremely simple logic?  If you were a slower, would you want a tank that could ensure that you hardly ever got smacked around or would you prefer one where every single pull you got anywhere from a minor up to a major ass whooping?  And maybe you even died once in a while as a result?  Why by all that is holy would you even consider the second situation as attractive?  What does the Warrior bring to the situation that makes it acceptable for the slower to take a beat down?  The Knight can tank perfectly fine for the majority of experience groups and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ensure</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that the rest of the party can contribute to the highest possible degree with least amount of risk.<br>
<br>
Yes, there are ways to work around it, but why bother if you all you have to do is avoid the Warrior and take the Knight? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WHY TAKE THE WARRIOR?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
More DPS?  Who gives a damn?  The DPS of the group as a whole can be much much higher with the Knight.  More HP?  Who gives a damn?  If you're spending more mana on healing the other members of the team the Warrior's HP are completely irrelevant.  Defensive?  Who gives a damn?  Who the hell uses defensive regularly in an experience group barring a situation that has gotten out of control?<br>
<br>
Why take the Warrior?  Give me a solid reason why a Warrior is a better choice when a Knight allows early slowing with minimal risk and otherwise the Knight can tank just fine.  Warrior = High risk.  Knight = Low risk.  And we want the Warrior because??????<br>

I have no complaints about maintaining argo.  I have no issues with it at all.  I know when and how to use my taunt key.  I tank better then any other class as it is.<br>
<br>
What you guys are referring to is the &quot;idoit&quot; effect of grouping.  You think a shaman can't slow right away?  Sure they can.  Just get down off the wall and stand next to the warrior so they can return any argo gained.<br>
<br>
Why should a warrior get changes in it's class abilities due to the &quot;idoit&quot; effect of grouping?<br>

The problem is, and you stated it.<br>
<br>
 In the 6 seconds it takes to cast forlorn deeds or Targur's I have either proced my SoD or my off hand weapon once or multiply times.<br>
<br>
See, you are relying on the random generator. I sure as hell wish I could have guarenteed procs every 6 seconds.<br>
<br>
Now, compare that to an SK/Pal, who can lock agro when the mob is inc and you might get an idea.<br>
<br>
I rarely use my discs in an xp setting, so why would a group want a warrior who has to rely on proccing weapons or a taunt button that catches up to others agro gain, when they can get someone who can stack hate on its way into camp?<br>

<br>
I have 325 AXP.  I have every offensive/defensive AA a warrior can have.  I have 2 weapons with sub 20 delay and stun procs and I still lose aggro.  <br>
<br>
Now, I don't lose aggro very much in any exp group I have been in in recent memory.  The occasional SoS crit early on will grab it from me sometimes if I havent proc'd enough.  So yeah, killing random Valor_Mob01 or random Plane_of_Fire_Mob02, I hold the aggro pretty well. <br>
<br>
Wait, what did I say?  If I haven't proc'd enough.  That is basically my taunt.  My procs.  DPS is a decent taunt in a normal exp group and will hold aggro to a fair extent.  Get 60 people hammering, nuking and healing and you better be procing if you are gonna keep that aggro.<br>
<br>
Is it my job to control aggro?  Yes and no.  Everyone has a responsibility to control their aggro to some degree.  <br>
<br>
The questions I guess should really be, should I have to work so hard to do what a SK or Pal can do with ease?  <br>
<br>
I am all for the Knight classes being powerful.  I don't need to do rogue DPS.  I don't need to be able to crank out 5400 crits like a wizard.  The one thing I would like to do is be able to hold aggro without having to pray to the Random Number God as often.<br>
<br>
Everyone is gonna lose aggro sometimes, I understand this and expect it.  I just don't like the feeling that I am constantly trying to swim upstream when my raidmates are doing the same thing I am, playing their class.<br>
<br>
I love my warrior.  He isn't the best, he isnt the worst but he is mine and I have spent a ton of time making him what he is.  Can a SK or Pal hold aggro better than I can?  In the broad sense, you betcha.  Have I ever been told &quot;Let the Pal tank&quot;, not once.  I wouldnt even be offended if they did.  Hell its nice sometimes taking a break from getting pummeled.<br>
<br>
This is long, sorry I am bored at work.  Overall I think warriors are pretty damn well balanced.  I think we could do with a little more aggro generation but if they don't change a thing I will still be playing my warrior... <p><table width="50%" border="0">

<br>
I agree.  I use a Blade of Carnage for aggro and sometimes I do get lucky and proc in the first second or two.  When that happens the debuffers can do whatever they want and the mob sticks to me.  But there are most definitely cases where I don't get a single proc in the first 15 seconds or so of a fight and where I get a bad luck streak on taunt and have it fail 5 times in a row.<br>
<br>
I don't see anything wrong with the ability of warriors to sustain aggro once they get it if they get weapons that have decent aggro procs.  Hell, I used to do pretty well holding aggro with a Windblade and that doesn't even have any proc.  The problem is generation of that initial aggro.<br>
<br>
AE taunt is the only tool warriors have for generating fast aggro that is not 100% reliant on the random number generator.  If the recycle time on it was low enough to use more often I would have no issues with warrior aggro but it's not. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=472195">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Taunt = random successfull Effect which  raised the taunter one single point on top of the hate list.<br>
Refresh Time = depending on speed around 6 seconds.<br>
Weaponproc = random timed effect which is affected by the players dexterity<br>
<br>
So you say <br>
1. Mob is incomming<br>
2. My weapon is always most multiple procing in the first 6 seconds.<br>
3. My taunt ( wich is nearly useless in the beginning cause of the low aggro the inc mob has ) goes to 95 %<br>
<br>
I Say <br>
When that what you say is right .. Youre a CHEATER and you should be banned for it<br>
When that what you say is wrong ... Youre a MORON and a DUMBASS for telling lies.<br>
<br>
I have normally ( Avatar ) between 250 and 285 Dexterity so my weapons should proc fairly easy and often. Hm they do not do it. Heck the Hammer of my 56th Cleric 130 dex procs way often then mine ( including Primal proc ).<br>
<br>
When there would be a warrior usable Weapon with a proc rate like the Cleric weapons ( thats around the proc rate youre talking about ) that weapon would be found in the List of the most aggroing weapons on this board.<br>
<br>
Hm you do not see such specific weapon ? Maybe cause its not there.<br>
<br>
Your Taunt is so good. What are you using? Sometimes I am using the Garished Head Dress out of Griegs End with a 10 % modifier to taunt so my taunt skill is around 253 ( 230 basic 23 ( 10 % ) but that success rate you say to have .. nope never.<br>
<br>
Maybe you learn when you can answer my question right.<br>
<br>
Who will grab the aggro of the monk pulled mob first.<br>
1. Furor with his sword(s) and taunt ( hope you know who Furor is )<br>
2. Anonyme_Paladin_Leve_60 with his Stun spells <br>
<br>
Oh you say Nr. 2?<br>
<br>
Yeah thats the problem were talking about. <br>
