He swears he gets hit less often, and does more damage that way.  We hunt well together; if mend is up he takes the initial damage, once he's down 2 bubbles *after* mend I taunt the mob off of him.  If I can't, he feigns it off onto me.  The reverse is true too though - -if we start the fight with me in better health, I start it and keep the mob on me till I&quot;m getting low, then back off to let him taunt it off me.  Since he does more damage, he generally can.  Also, mobs die more than twice as fast as a pair then they do if I solo one.  In the fights where we each are on a different mob, his dies first, and he doesn't tend to take any more damage then I do.  Currently we are both 40, we have been hunting together (sometimes with a cleric, sometimes with a full group, sometimes as a pair) since we were 20. <p>Loredena Frisealach Mainacier<BR>

<br>
There've been so many schools of thought on this subject. When I started my monk, it was the Dex/Agi school of thought and I bought into it. I split my starting points into dex/agi.<br>
<br>
Then it was the STR school of thought, so monks were scrambling to get their strength up.<br>
<br>
Then AC/hp and this is the current thinking, I believe. One of my friends is a similarly leveled monk and he is a stat junkie -- he swears by dexterity and agility. When I was 2 levels above him, we dueled. Me with a focus on AC, str, and hp, and him with his focus on dex/agi. It was a damn close fight.<br>
<br>
I believe a monk's AC functions differently than a warrior's -- damage avoidance for the monk vs. damage absorption by the warrior -- please correct my thinking if it's flawed.<br>
<br>
Based on my experience, I'd suggest going the dex/agi route since it is easy to modify your stats however you please later in levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ushikariiapoccalypse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shikarii Apoccalypse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/01 10:04:47 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.takase.com/TattooDesign/images/AH98070402.gif border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Monk as hunting partner??</span><hr size=1> you can always head over to the Monkly-Business boards and drop a few questions there as well .<br>
<br>
More than half my guild is comprised of Monks, and, basically there is only 2 warriors in my guild who are at the minimum planes level , myself 52 and my friend 54.<br>
 <br>
I wish i had more of this information available the time i made Shikarii ( being a former Bard and all ). I think at the time i just dumped all his points into Strength not knowing the full outcome at the +50 game; but at the time i made him crafted armor wasn't even a concept, and 50 was the max. Now the game seems so more wide open in choices of armorment and weaponry that you can almost correct your mistakes you have made. <br>
<br>
Either way with your friend when he makes his character get as many opinions as you can from the proper people. If he's intent on making a Monk check out the monk board. <br>
<br>
My RL friend i hunt with is a monk, and, it's definately fun. Just the downtime healing kinda sucks. Talk him into being a Cleric or Shaman <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>

Mages pre-50 are hands down one of the most powerful classes in the game.  They nuke just a good as a wizzy, the pets are great, mages have the best damage shields in the game, and he can summon food/water, bandaids, arrows, coldstones, etc for ya. <br>
<br>
And if you learn how to utilize the pet(specifically the post 20 fire pet) you and him can be one heckuva team. I have duo'd with many warriors with my mage. The only downfall is you'll pretty much be at 50% health most of the time. But hey we all need to work on that bind wound skill dont we? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yeah a shammy or cleric would be an ideal partner for you, but those classes just arent much fun to play IMO.<br>
<br>
Of course if he doesnt want to really play a caster then maybe suggest a bard.<br>
<br>
Monks aint bad if that whole 14 stones thing doesnt bother ya... Im too much of a Fred Sanford to play a monk.<br>

I suspect that those who like playing monks don't like playing healers, but that's hard to prove on a small sample ;0.  To the point though -- we actually make a pretty good hunting pair.  Yes, the downtime sucks -- but I let him tank a bit, and start taunting off of him once he's used mend AND has taken some damage.  As a result, we generally end up down similarly.  We bandage to half (soon he'll be able to bandage higher than that! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  heal up a bit and he mends, and off we go again.  Life is best when we can get a healer to form a trio with us, but we're pretty effective anyway.  He can split pulls so we don't have to face swarms, he dishes out massive damage, he can feign the mob off on me if I can't taunt it off, and I can take the damage.  We have to pay attention to where we choose to fight, but it works.  We're both 41, and we've hunted together since 20, sometimes as a pair, sometimes with a cleric or a druid. <p>Loredena Frisealach Mainacier<BR>
