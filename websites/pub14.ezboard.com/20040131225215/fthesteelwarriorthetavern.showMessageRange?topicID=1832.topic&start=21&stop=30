My idea would be to tie it to your actual taunt skill, so that when you taunt something, you move to the top of the hate list + your taunt skill on top.  On an unsuccessful taunt, just move up the hate list an amount equal to your taunt skill (or half your taunt skill, or whatever).<br>
<br>
If knights (and rangers) got the same improvement to their taunt ability, I know I wouldn't bitch about it, it's not like they need the button anyway.<br>
<br>
I don't have much faith in this though.  Yeah /shield is nice and casters love us when we use it, but it doesn't really address the primary problem facing warriors.  Every hybrid can gain and permanently hold aggro and do it over a long distance as a pull comes in.  Back in Seb, this wasn't a big deal, knights were still better tanks than us back then, but the difference wasn't large and we still got plenty of groups with people who were ignorant of the superiority of knights in terms of aggro control and utility.  Now when xp mobs are hitting like Vindi, soft-skinned caster types have far greater incentive to group with any hybrid because they won't have to worry as much about being plastered all over the plane.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll be wrong and there will actually be a substantial fix for warriors.  Chances are that any &quot;fix&quot; is likely to be yet another AA and a few more weapons that 99.5% of all warriors will never see.  Either that or an unneccessary nerf on the hybrids, bringing them into our world of suck. <p>Ghune<br>

<br>
Message I just posted to my guild, OEM over on Tunare.. A Raiding guild.. <br>
<br>
Paladins were a weak Class from the regular EQ release through the Kunark expansion. They had (as all hybrids: Ranger, Bard, Sk, Pally) an experience sink factor for any group they joined. <br>
<br>
They had Poor Ac, weak weapons, no Duel weild, No Kick, Low hit points,weapons designed for rangers instead of Paladins, small mana pools, Extra cost on all spells, no Specialization, Too little too late in the healing line and loosing all this for the ability to cast weak spells, which amounted to a little Post battle downtime healing,and a decent Stun array for casters, and LOH which was a nice ability every 90 minutes. But once again, once every 90 minutes.<br>
<br>
Several things were done to bring the Pallys back in line, as a useful class. All hybrid exp Penaltys were dropped when I was ~55. The Hybrids were given the same mana pool as their Parent class, for us a cleric. The Per cast spell cost penalty was removed. Now the Difference is we have no Specilization, which is good and as it should be, thats the only penality we need there..(along with the reduced set of parent class spells). A lot of very nice two handers were brought in Post Velious that the Knights as well as the other melee could use(and some nice 1 handers) All Paly/Sk one handers, must be designed for a Knight, that single weapon has to be stronger than a warrior/ranger/Rouge one hander, VI finally figured this out. (The other melee Duel weilds). All Paladin Defensive skills were brought up to the Warriors level, and the Offensive abilitys were raised too within about 10% behind a warriors,<br>
That was really all we needed to be useful again, the Hybrids have allways been able to Take aggro at will on any mob, Pallys/Sk/Bard/ or ranger (God forbid), that was part of the benefit for Pallys/sk's that having spells gave us.. Yes ,we could take aggro at will and get owned.<br>
<br>
The warriors have very good mitigation, Great Hp, Great Ac, the best in game damage absorbtion, and just kick a lot of arse, And Disciplines that Roxor, while ours (except for one for undead are worthless).<br>
<br>
Yes, VI has closed the gap quite a bit, and made the Pally/Sk once again a usefull group member, and with a whole lot of work in AAxp, they can become quite powerful.. Too powerful ? hmmmm.. I don't think so, The warrior is always the tank of choice in 99% of the big events, mainly for the &quot;defensive&quot; disc ability alone, plus they generally have ~1k more hp than a Pally or Sk, If Warriors/Pallys/Sks are all in very equivlent gear, the warrior is still the best tank by ~15% overall. Remember in Defensive disc, heal mana is greatly reduced.<br>
<br>
What I support for the warriors is to make sure, that they have the ability to control mobs in regular exp group settings in a better manner , I really think they just need a minor twink (In the regular taunt department, Instead of just moving the Mobs aggro to the top of the list +1, a successful warrior taunt should add like +100 , or what ever it takes to make it more effective ....and leave the rest of our taunts where they are now. For example Over Zealous Wizard_01 has a death wish and begins nuking way early, a warrior may have trouble saving him, where a pally will Stun/Stun/Fol(Group heal etc).. and the Wizard_01 takes a little damage but survives... VI has given us the gift of tanking very well in normal exp groups, with our abilitys all group members can start unloading a whole lot more damage earlier without having to worry about getting ate. We need to make sure that we help Support the warriors in this area.... The Pally/Sk/bard Should still be the king of aggro control (leaving Rangers out intentionally they own with Bows), But I think the warriors need a boost in this area IMHO.. and I support it fully. I really think this is all thats needed. ( at least fix it first so we can see if that balances things out better).<br>
<br>
 you guys and gals own, And I will always perfer seeing you tank, The Pallys/Sk's with good gear can fill the roles  and I hope you don't mind seeing us have some utility for a change. I see the Pally as a good Support tank, to help in healing in a pinch, good overall Damage support now, and the ability to step up if the Stench hits the fan, the Ablity to SA on some raid mobs etc. After setting in the shadows watching the warriors get groups, while Sk's, and Pally's had to set and Beg for one, or go with friends that didnt mind the exp loss, and having a &quot;weak&quot; warrior, for a couple years, I can say certainly, that I don't want to see the roles reversed and the warriors having to sit, and not be able to get into a good exp group, . All the classes should be fun, and have good utility, especially the classes that aren't fantastic solo classes.<br>
<br>
The warrior Should have good utility in all grouping functions, not just raids. <br>
<br>
***********************<br>
Yes , we have seen VI swing the Nerf bat too many times. A good portion of the Knights from a cross selection of the Servers, support the warriors in this matter,as posted on the PON Site (Although some bitter ones don't). I hope they beef you guys up some in the aggro control area, I really think all you need is a minor tweek.<br>
<br>
Hopefully verrant ends with:<br>
Warrior Tanking abilitys &gt; Knights (but Not absurdly)<br>
Knight Aggro Control &gt;Warriors (But not absurdly)<br>
<br>
Good luck, I hope you get it....<br>

<br>
Actually I would say that most of these classes deal with agro differently.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Shadow Knights</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Gain Agro: Taunt, Lifetaps, DOTs, Nukes, Snare, +Agro Buffs<br>
Shadow Knights pretty much rule everyone with gaining agro, and they also have the most options agro gaining options. They outright suck with shedding unwanted agro.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Paladins</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Gain Agro: Taunt, Stun, Heals, Root<br>
Drop Agro: Root<br>
Paladins have solid agro gaining abilities as mobs react well to stuns and even attempts to being stunned. Even their heal spells can be used to gain agro by healing that person who is outagroing them thus transfering the agro. Their only real method for dumping unwanted agro is to root and back off. While this works in many situations, it will not work on mobs which are immune to run spead changes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bards</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Gain Agro: DOTs, Slow<br>
Drop Agro: Escape<br>
Other: Mezmerize, Charm, Invulerability<br>
Bards are more limited in their agro gaining abilities, and often times the group needs to work with the bard to ensure he keeps it. If they need to shed unwanted agro quickly, they can use Escape [which I think is an AA skill.] They also have songs to mezmerize and charm mobs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rangers:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Gain Agro: Taunt, Snare, Nukes, DOTs, Root<br>
Drop Agro: Jolt, Root<br>
Rangers are very flexable due to being very good at both gaining and dropping agro. Both our bows [requiring one to step away from the mob] and more limited tanking abilities keep us from running around trying to tank everything in sight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Warriors</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Gain Agro: Taunt, AE Taunt<br>
Warriors clearly need some help here. The fact that they get Enraging Blow weapons makes this even more apparrent that a warrior on his own does not have everything he needs to deal with agro. They seem almost the opposite of rangers in this regard being more limited in dealing with agro, but having high tanking ability in return.<br>

It seems the caster community is always in favor of a new agro buff or somthing to help the warrior, but its never OK for us warriors to be self sufficent at our own damn jobs. <br>
<br>
And when we finally get some support it seems everyone favors a slight improvement - just as long as warriors remain inferior, but not equal too any other class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crydeeossiriand>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/30/03 12:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1832.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://questing-ranger.com/images/autosigs/archer.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heh</span><hr size=1> forgot about feign death.<br>

Divine Aura and Harmsheild are kinda iffy simply because of the low health agro thing. Rangers have weaponshield, but I don't always drop agro completely by the end of the 30 seconds and I can still attack them. Bard invulnerability songs might be more effective. Also I know that with Divine Aura and the bard song, you cannot do much of anything while it is up.<br>

Crydee's main point remains valid and it's the same point many of us have brought up, all we have is taunt and gear.<br>
<br>
It's like I've said before, even with all the armor and hit point gear to make a warrior into Norrath's biggest pinata, the only difference between us and a pinata is that the pinata gets hit.<br>
<br>
It's not hard to outaggro a warrior and many times the people who are outaggroing us are folks doing essential parts of their job in a group (chanters, clerics especially).  Those casters have no incentive to group with a melee-type that can't reliably keep aggro when they can get sometime who they know can.<br>
<br>
We aren't talking about Sebilis anymore, in the days when if you lost aggro, the chanter would take a few hundred points of damage even if taunt failed once.  Back then, yeah aggro was an annoyance and knights did it better, but the difference was marginal.  Guess what?  Times have changed and we're the dinosaurs, defined by a 3 expansion old ability and slowly on the road to becoming the 5th choice for xp groups.<br>
<br>
I'm a good tank, I know my job, I do it well, but my gear isn't good and I'll never see an EB weapon, so instead, I'm leveling a SK because I don't want to have to scrape my friends off the ground after every other pull. <p>Ghune<br>
