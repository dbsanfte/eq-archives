<br>
I have serious concerns about the marginalization of the pure melee classes, starting in Luclin and becoming a serious issue in PoP. Looking back, there was a time (eg. late kunark/early velious era) when melees were far more powerful than casters. SOE realized that casters and especially hybrids were inferior to their pure melee counterparts, and sought to enchance them in new and creative ways, sometimes by making them more powerful in combat, sometimes by giving them new utility where they had none before. While I commend SOE for doing an excellent job in making hybrids and casters viable classes again (people actually want to play paladins, rangers, mages, and necros!), I believe the pendulum has now swung way too far and it's time to back off a bit and reconsider class balance as a whole.<br>
<br>
There is no one single change that SOE made that caused this. Rather, it's been the cumulative effect of many small changes in game philosophy and implementation that have served to drastically alter the balance of the game today. There are two main factors in PoP that we need to look at. First are the environmental factors -- facts about the places we fight in and the things we're fighting. Second are the competitive factors -- facts about how one class stands up next to another and the strengths/weaknesses we bring to the table. I will try to focus on the environmental factors as much as possible, lest this turn into a caster vs. melee flame war.<br>
<br>
Speaking generally, the classic balance between the offensive capabilities of melees and casters has always been that casters can do burst damage in exchange for being mana limited (and thus excel in short fights), whereas melees can provide a steady stream of damage at a consistant and mostly unalterable pace, not limited by anything other than staying alive (and thus excel in longer fights).<br>
<br>
The classic balance in environment has always been that zones vary in terrain and mobs vary in their capabilities, giving different classes opportunities to shine at different times. Some zones require or influence the use of particular utility functions (eg. lev, EB, lock picking, disarming traps, COTH, etc..). Some zones have had mobs that have special characteristics or qualities, such as being undead, highly magic resistant (or resistant to one type of magic), poison or disease or curse attacks, have high mitigation, etc... This encourages a wide variety of tactics. <br>
<br>
PoP, more than any other expansion, brings with it a change in design philosophy. Fights tend to be shorter and more intense, exping is faster and less dangerous, CRs are easier, environments are less cramped, getting around the world is easier, and other small changes were made that generally make the game more fun (or at least less tedious). PoP also, far more than any other expansion, presents us with a very hemogenized view of the world as far as environmental factors go. The mobs tend to follow the same design patterns, as do the zones, and these patterns almost exclusively are to the detriment of the pure melee classes.<br>
<br>
Now, let's get into the specifics.<br>
<br>
One of the most major changes in PoP was the change in how mobs were made tougher to stay competitive with the ever mudflated playerbase. In previous expansions, the philosophy was &quot;make the mobs hit slightly harder and have slightly more HP&quot; to account for mudflation. In PoP, the mobs hit MUCH harder, and have less HP compared to their velious/luclin counterparts. This fits right in with the &quot;shorter and more intense&quot; philosophy SOE sees as the way of the future -- and rightfully so. Hour long boss fights are undeniably boring.<br>
<br>
In exp groups, mobs having less hit points doesn't make much of a difference as far as caster vs. pure melee goes. If the mobs die faster, in the absense of other factors, groups will just pull faster to compensate and keep the same approximate ratio of uptime. However, for boss mob fights, the effect of this change is enormous for the pure melee classes. Caster classes (and some hybrids) now often find themselves with more than enough mana to last an entire boss mob fight. Pure melee classes, once relished for their ability to produce consistant damage over the long term of a fight, no longer have a long term to work with. The net result is that casters (and some hybrids) can use their burst damage capabilities for the entire fight, while the pure melee classes are left doing a comparitively insignificant amount of damage. It is not uncommon for me to see casters outdamaging their pure-melee counterparts by a ratio of 3 to 1 or more on such fights!<br>
<br>
As a counterbalance to the mobs having fewer HP in PoP, mobs were made to hit much harder. The reasons for this change were obvious -- if the mobs had less HP, then need to hit harder to remain a suitable challenge and keep the fights intense. However, this change ends up favors casters in both exp situations and raids. Mobs that hit harder require melees to be healed more often, and mana used for healing is mana that is not going to make the mob dead any faster. Effectively, that means that harder hitting mobs causes melees to increasingly lower the effectiveness of the priest classes in doing damage themselves. The second effect of this is to requires more sturdy tanks, effectively making classes that could tank sub-optimally before (eg. monks and maybe rangers and rogues in a pinch) not able to as much any more. The practical end result in PoP exp groups is that the pure melee classes MUST be supported by a solid tank (unless you're a warrior, in which case you are one), a good healer (necros don't generally cut it), and a slower/haster. Casting classes are not subject to the same constraints. <br>
<br>
Wait a minute, you might be saying. Isn't that only true for the first melee added to the group? Regardless of how many melees are added to the group, as soon as there is one, the infrastructure (healer, tank, slower) must exist to support them. No infrastructure, no group, and the none of the pure melee classes has the tools to solo (or even duo?) in PoP. Further, due to issues of agro (flip flopping the mob) and lag, issues like riposting, enraging, and rampaging become increasingly large problems for melee classes as mobs hit harder, and these things affect all melees in a group. Even as a rogue, when I am standing behind the mob most of the time where it can not riposte me, I still take a fair number of them when I catch agro, the mob flips for any reason, etc... And classes that use fast weapons (eg. rogues, monks, and rangers if they're meleeing) tend to get the worst of the riposte issue. This requires additional healing. In an exp group, this is not generally a significant problem -- however, when mobs riposte hard and often, it has the unintended consequence of turning monks into rogues who can't backstab.<br>
<br>
On raids, it's presumed you have all the necessary support classes available -- however, raid mobs also hit MUCH harder than exp mobs and turn the riposte, enrage, and rampage issue from a minor one into a major one. As an example, some of the boss mob giants ripose for 1500 damage in the Plane of Storms, a tier 2 PoP zone. I've been killed before because someone flipped agro and the mob riposted me two or three times in quick succession before I could turn attack off. Even taking one riposte from such a mob means a pure melee needs a large heal, reducing the effectiveness of the priests around him, whereas casters are not affected by this. If nothing else, I firmly believe ripostes need to be toned down in PoP.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse, many boss mobs were also given heavy hitting short range AEs or AE rampages. This was perhaps the most devistating change to the pure melee classes, as there is no effective way to avoid these. While casters and some hybrids can sit outside of the range of the AE and do full damage, the pure melee has to stand inside it and take it's effect. The end result is that melees end up either having their effectiveness reduced further (if the AE is a stat drainer), or require additional healing support (that possibly would be better used just nuking!). A good example of a design that looks good on paper but doesn't work so well in practice is the recuso house in HoH. Mobs there have 3 types of AEs, depending on the type of mob. They either stat drain (reduce atk and AC), drain mana, or put a large dot on that can kill a non-warrior melee without healing. This seems pretty reasonable in theory: the stat drain effects pure melees and hybrids, the mana drain effects casters and hybrids, and the dot effects everyone. However, in reality, the stat drain affects pure melees and meleeing hybrids, reducing their effectiveness. The mana drain affects hybrids only because casters simply stay out of it's range. The dot affects pure melees and meleeing hybrids only because again, casters stay out of it's range. Thus, it's the melees and hybrids who eat the effects of the dots, lose even more efficiency, and require additional caster/priest support, while the casters continue on like they always have.<br>
<br>
As far as other environmental factors go, the generally wide open, mostly-outdoor zones benefit soloing-capable casters more than melees, as it gives them room to kite (if they're a kiting class), solo, and charm (negating most of the downsides of charm). All casters and hybrids can benefit from the extra mana regen from the use of a horse, and rogues benefit slightly since mobs aren't pushed into walls so much. Even the indoor zones are more spacious, with mobs spread farther apart, making pulling a less difficult task, especially in conjunction with the new lull spells. Monks are not happy about this. Also, the increased space gives casters a lot more options in regards to positioning, the most important by far being the ability to stay out of AE range of most mobs.<br>
<br>
In Luclin, AA abilities were introduced, and it is worth noting that casters and hybrids were given marked boosts to their offensive capabilities (mostly in the form of more mana efficient and high powered spells), but in the cases of rangers the new archery skills and paladins the cleanse undead skills. In some cases they were added given utility as well. The pure melee classes got mostly defensive abilities, the offensive abilities were minimal to the point of being trivial, and at least as far as rogues go, most of the added utility was deemed completely and utterly useless (the one exception being escape, which is self-only utility).<br>
<br>
In PoP, 5 new levels and 2 tiers of AA skills were added, giving everyone new advancement opportunities. However, from these, casters again benefit more than the pure melee classes. First off, the addition of 5 levels brought with it new spells for casters. While the method of distribution of these spells is undoubtedly frustrating and casters/hybrids have good reason for complaint, there is no doubt that these offer a reasonable increase in damage capabilities, flexibility, and/or utility. For example, the new magician and shammy pets are awesome DPS machines. New nukes for the offensively minded caster classes offer either higher damage for the same mana, the same damage for less mana, or more damage for more mana, which increases their ability to burst damage over a short period of time. As far as utility goes, the new lull spell capabilities are very nice (even post nerf) and reduce the utility of the monk class in some situations. The charm spells are powerful to the point of being broken. When an enchanter in your group can charm a mob that does 4 times as much damage and is 10 times harder to kill than any of your other group members, something is wrong). The lifting of the stat caps also gives casters a larger mana pool, which can translate into more damage depending on the length of the fight.<br>
<br>
Melees, on the other hand, got no new disciplines, a marginal increase to primary hand damage, a few HP, and theoretically a new damage table. The end result, in my estimation, is about a 10% increase in melee damage at 65 over level 60, and zero added utility. As a rogue specific issue, our minimum backstab went from 120 at level 60 to 130 at level 65, which is pathetic. When I hit level 60 I felt like it was a huge deal. I could feel the increase in damage I was doing, and I got assassinate (which has since been totally trivialized since it's level cap hasn't been raised) -- at 65 I didn't get anything I felt really helped me. It was very anti-climactic. The entire climb from 60-65 was totally and completely anti-climactic as a pure melee.<br>
<br>
The AA skills that came with PoP in my understanding were fairly low-key for all classes. My understanding here is incomplete so I will not speculate outside of my own class, other than to say that once again melees were mostly neglected in terms of offensively minded AA skills (at least ones that add more than 2% dps). As a rogue, the Shroud of Stealth AA skill is very nice for getting me from point A to B while I'm watching TV and eating dinner and not really paying attention (yes, that's humor folks). The rest of the AA skills are uninspired and generally just extensions of the lackluster Luclin AA skills we got. Perhaps someone else can fill me in on this area -- I'd like to learn more.<br>
<br>
Focus effects were initially an awesome idea to boost caster power and give them more variety in gear, now overdone when put in conjunction with other caster power boosts. Between focus effects and AA skills, casters receive a tremendous boost to both their damage producing abilities, healing abilities, and mana pools (in the form of spells that cost less). When combined with new forms of mana regen (eg. better spell regen, new item regen, more FT items, horses, etc...), this makes for casters that suddenly are a lot more efficient -- they nuke often, nuke hard, and don't run out of mana, even in longer fights. While undoubtedly they needed a boost to become competitive with melees, the fact that all of these boosts stack together have produced casters that probably more powerful than intended.<br>
<br>
Speaking as a rogue, I find PoP also ate most of our other utility -- CRing is not necessary with graveyards. I love graveyards, by the way! GREAT change! But it takes away from my class. Pickpocket was effectively nerfed by making most of the stuff we'd want to steal magic. GREAT change in terms of game balance! But it takes away from my class. PoP is totally lacking in locked doors and traps. GREAT change because these things are horribly misimplemented and it is NOT fun to sit there for an hour repeatedly clicking while your raid slowly moves through an area. But it takes away from my class. About the only utility we have left is as a scout (through Shroud of Stealth), and an Eye of Zomm can do that almost as well as we can in many cases. For monks, with the plethora of outdoor zones, well spaced mobs, and new lull capabilities, pulling is no longer what it used to be for them. With the hard hitting mobs and mitigation nerf, they can no longer effectively tank like they used to. For warriors, they are no longer the best taunters, as hybrids have become formidable tanks themselves and can hold agro better through use of spells. Pure melees never had much utility anyway, and now what we do have is worth even less.<br>
<br>
Also, consider the gear dropping out of PoP. Unlike previous expansions, which had a plethora of gear dropping (the early expansions were melee-centric, Luclin imo had the balance a lot closer to right), PoP seems to have relatively few drops, and what does drop seems to be weighted towards casters. Part of this is undoubtely due to the lack of raid zones available to non-uberguilded players in PoP. Furthermore, most of the melee gear dropping in the Tier 1 through Tier 3 zones is INFERIOR to the stuff found in ToV and Ssra Temple off mobs as easy to kill as Rhag 1 and 2. Especially the weapons. Although melee gear is finally starting to show up in the Tier 4 zones, and some of it is very nice, it's fair to say the majority of players will NOT be seeing these zones. Ever. Even a not-so-uber-guild can take out Rhag 1 or 2, or make a foray into ToV these days. Flowing thought gear has been sprinkled throughout Luclin and PoP, yet vengeance and atk gear remains almost unheard of outside of Vex Thal and the elemental planes... It's also rather amusing that many of the 2h weapons dropping in the 4th tier planes are sub-28 delay, negating the extra damage bonuses that were added to 2h weapons to make them competitive in the first place.<br>
<br>
Other non-PoP specific issues have become prevalent as the game has advanced. Pure melees are all &quot;specialized&quot; in doing consistant damage over the long-term. Not only has the PoP philosophy been &quot;faster and shorter!&quot;, but the increase in caster/hybrid offensive power means old-world mobs that used to take 20 minutes to kill now take 5, pushing yesterday's long battles into todays short ones. The nerf to mod rods and the subsequent rebalancing of high end mobs exaggerated this effect further. Pretty soon there will be no long battles left. The long battle, if not dead, is dying. While I do not lament it's passing at all (as I said above, long battles are tedious and boring!), I can not help but wonder what role is being left for pure meleers.<br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong -- I'm not calling for a nerf of casters because THE PROBLEM ISN'T THE CASTERS! The problem is the recent game philosophies that have been used in designing PoP for the level 61+ crowd are almost universally anti-melee and melee utility has been reduced across the board. In exp groups pure melee classes still do good damage with the proper support classes, but are often outdamaged by a number of other classes that need less maintainance/healing -- so why take them? And what about next expansion, where the mobs hit even harder, further exaggering the effects mentioned above? On PoP style raids, the damage all pure melees do compared to casters/hybrids before the mob dies (or more likely, the pure melee does) is trivial compared to what casters are currently capable of. So why bring them? There have been recently circulating stories about mobs in the elemental planes that riposte and AE rampage so hard the rogues and monks sit around and throw daggers at the mob for 5 minutes (doing 20?DPS in the process) from outside of AE range because that's the only way they've found to contribute without dying! That's not inspiring, nor is it balanced (and if someone who's actually been there can enlighten us all on the truth or falsehood of such things, I'd be much obliged). If it were just a few encounters or a few zones, that would be fine -- but the mold with PoP has been homogeneality, and these anti-melee-damage patterns are ubiquitous. If the next expansion is like this one, I suspect you will see an awful lot of warriors, rogues, and monks quitting to play casters and hybrids. I sincerely hope this is a one time occurance -- but SOE has always been behind the player base in realizing where potential problems are.<br>
<br>
Rogues, monks, and warriors (and other classes where partially appropriate), we're all in the same boat together here. Let's put aside our past animousities and tensions, work together to identify the sources of our mutual issues as pure melee classes, and ensure that we are not inadvertently obsoleted from the game. Three classes together are much harder to ignore than one.<br>

It is very frustrating as a warrior to be told by all the casters in your guild that unless U are lvl 65 U are pretty much useless.  Now they are a little nicer than that but the message is still the same.  GET 65 NOW, not to mention the AE taunt thing.  It is hard for some of us to advance in lvls as we have just recently got flagged, well that is great there are now over 50 people in PoV/PoS and when there are people that are 65 doing AA farming it is a slim chance that joe blow warrior(or any class) lvl 61-63 is gonna get a group.  Now u take into account the fact that these mobs are hitting that much harder and the fact that everyone knows warriors pretty much suck at agro control and we are losing our spots as MT's to Knights.  I am not bitzing I dont see anything wrong with taking a knight for ur mt.  BUT passing up a warrior who is two lvls higher than the knight, just because the knight can better hold agro??  Yeah U have to do that but it is frustrating.  I think that the above post has hit the nail right on the head, shorter fights more intense(thus demanding agro control) yet no improvements to the pure melee.

Our role as MT still stands on raids vs mobs that hit too hard to be reliably tanked without a disc.<br>
We got massive armor upgrades and a lifted AC cap so that we mitigate damage way better than any other non plate class.<br>
We got increased defensive AA, and increased offensive AA.<br>
We got new weapons (massive ratio 2h) that when coupled with our new offensive AA, make us one of the most powerful melee.<br>

Other than our taunt issue, which concerns itemization and exp groups more than anything else, warriors should be very happy with PoP.

<br>
In the past 5 months since PoP came out, I have gotten 4 drops, 2 for sale, 2 for use (one of those is only usable because my gear is pathetic).  When I go lfg, it's usually a good chance to catch up on reading and laundry.  When I am MT in groups, I get to watch my casters die with remarkable regularity when taunt fails 2 or 3 times in a row.  When I am grouped with a Pally friend, I only get to MT when he's eating because the casters much prefer him as MT.  My guild hasn't hit the nasty AE rampage bosses yet, but trust me, I'm not looking forward to getting to sit outside melee range and play ranger (a crappy one at that).<br>
<br>
Yeah, this guy is dead on and it's comforting to know that it's not just warriors suffering. <p>Ghune<br>
