So, like it was mentioned, Circle of Seasons and a bard.  For a troll, there are times when my FR is aver 380 with just those.  As a MT, you need to be all AC/HPs.<br><br>One note about defensive disc....most of the people who don't use it are level 60.  Some have points into Durability and stability, etc etc.  They can usually get away with skipping /disc defensive in a fight.  You will find that at level 58 you still get the boots put to ya purdy gud.  Don't be shy using it.  At your level it has a 12 minute refresh time and at your level, depending on average level of raiding party and raid strength, each fight may take as long as 3-5 mins.  If you don't slow the bugger, he is gonna go to town on you.<br><br>Another thing....on enrage.  What we usually do is have an enchanter chuck an aggro enhancement buff on the MT just as it enrages so that when auto attack is turned off he doesn't lose aggro.  Later on you will start getting players with insane haste items and you can lose aggro relatively quickly if they don't know how to manage it.  Case in point: epic rogue with VoG and 30%ish haste item whose evade button has never been found.<br><br>TTFN<br> <p><CENTER><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59492" target="_blank">Tuggbar's Stash</a></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwandork.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wandor K</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will KICK YOUR @$$</span><br>  Posts: 504<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/02 3:09:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Main tanking in HoT...</span><hr size=1> Let me give you the perspective from a lower level ...<br><br>On occassion I have to use my 52 warrior when we only have 1 plate class along so we have someone to mezz tank thats not too soft skinned. Wurms and most drakes I can tank no problem but it does take more healer mana than our 60s of course. At your level I wouldn't bother with defensive on wurms or drakes unless its a named drake.<br><br>Wyverns and Rancars are a different story - they hit hard and fast particularly until they are slowed so I would use it if you have it.<br><br>In all cases go for a nice balance of AC/HP. The more HP you have the more efficient your cheals are going be. I would recommend keeping enough AC gear on to stay above 1200AC buffed then go for HP.<br><br>Definitely turn off attack on enrage. Taunting isn't going to matter because everything is 60+ in HoT so you can't taunt it anyway. Everyone on the front side of the mob will be turning off attack as well so as long as your backstabbers know a thing or 2 about managing agro the mob should stay firmly planted on you. If it turns whack it since it won't be riposting until it turns back to you. <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial"><img src="http://www.bfdesigns.net/eq/wandor_sig.jpg"><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor's profile</b></a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.exarch.net/"><b>Fusion of Flame</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6102" target="_blank"><b>Moordian's profile</b></a></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukeniden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keniden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 260<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/02 5:29:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Main tanking in HoT...</span><hr size=1> Just a few comments from my experiences...If you have a level 55 bard or higher, then his resist song will allow you to use much less resist gear.  I'm by no means uber, and I still wear a froggy crown even with the bard resist song on.  I believe the point of diminishing returns on resists is about 260.  Still, as long as your resists are over 100, thats ok and let your clerics worry about healing you.  You should concentrate on positioning the mobs so that the rest of the raid's melee force can get a good wack at the mob.<br><br>On the big wurms (ancient guardians and such), you should tag the mob from the puller and back up behind a fire pot (the one furthest away from the rest of the casters).  If you do this right, the mob will eventually have his head pointed towards down at you and the rest of the body stuck in the air up high.  <br><br>For the smaller mobs (raptors, drakes, and such), you again tag the mob from the puller and position your yourself against the wall so you are perpendicular to the firepot.  Try to keep the mob in front of you, but sometimes it will be hard especially if you have monks.  They have a tendency to push a mob sideways so make sure they are applying equal pressure from both sides.  In the event that the mob goes sideways, you continue to tank with your side to the wall.  It's not as optimum as you have effectively resticted half the mob's rear to attacks, but it's better than having some rogue tank <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>At level 58, you have to remember that you will have a hard time maintaining aggro unless you have some godly weapons.  Those mobs are all 60+ and you won't have the ability to maintain reliable aggro on them until you reach level 60 yourself.  Your aggro situation becomes even worse with defensive up and I practically guarantee that you will lose aggro to the shammy whose casting slows on the mob.  But don't despair.  Keep attacking and taunting.  You'll get aggro back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>You should use defensive for every fight youre in, but you should also have another defensive-capable tank there to switch off.  By the time the other warrior's fight is over, your disc will be up again.  If this isn't possible and youre the only MT available, then make sure your clerics' mana is good and suck up the all that damage.  You'll at least have defensive up for every other fight.<br><br>When a mob enrages, it means it's almost dead.  Stop your attack until the mob is no longer enraged.  Only then will it be safe for you to attack the mob again.  In the mean time, let your damage dealers do their thing.<br><br>Good luck to you!

Wurms hit for 350, smaller stuff 250, and fast as hell.  No point in worrying about 300 dmg on a AE when you getting hit like that.  If you have a bard that has AE resist song that helps a lot.<br><br>As for tanking, I guess it depends on the situation.  Personally, I do not use Defensive at all, unless there are named mobs up.  Even then sometimes I do not get to use it, pulling three named in a row and such.  If your healers are on top of things, you have nothing to worry about.  Good communication between your healers and you is more important than defensive.  I usually have Furious ready for the high level Wyverns and Rancors that will catch a healer off guard.  Use it to buy myself 8 seconds of time for a CH to land.  <br><br>I set up on the right side, when we are at the door, everytime.  Keep the casters on the left.  The left side firepot gets people trapped behind it, so try and keep mobs away from it.  For the wurms, pull them straight back, and put them on top of the firepot.  Have everyone beat them into the corner.  This way your casters can hide from the AE.<br><br>For any mob that is smaller than the wurms, especially the Wyverns and Rancors (and any drake), you want to maneuver them around.  Many mobs enrage, and the wyverns and rancors reposte and such a lot.  I usually pull them in on the right side, and on the pull move them over toward the casters and other melee.  I then flip around right in front of the melee, so the mobs back is right in front of them.  Call assist, tell them to keep on the mobs back, and push it back toward the right side.  If you get too close to the wall, flip it again, so that the melee are always on the mobs back.  This way max melee damage is incurred, it is easy for all to attack the mob (without repostes, parrys, etc), and it helps a little with the gating mobs.  HoT is a very nice place to practive maneuvering mobs around, it is something you are going to want to learn if you become a MT.<br><br>Other than that, stay on your feet, adjust to any situation, and if I were you, I would learn HoT.  Learn the halls, learn to pull them if you can.  That way, when a mob does gate, you know where it was, and how to get it back before the entire raid is summoned.  Knowledge of a zone is key for any MT.<br><br>Keep in mind with the furious vs. defensive, it may be different between a level 60 and a level 58 tank.<br><br>Best of luck.<br><br>Bayho Bumblebear<br>A Warlord of the Watchkeepers <p>Loyalty above all, except Honor.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ureinholt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reinholt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/16/02 7:25:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: yea</span><hr size=1> As it's been said, don't stress resist gear much.  Once you get yourself in some plate armor, you'll boost your resists a pretty great deal anyway.  As for defensive, I use it on things like the wyvern, rancors, drakes and also the red wurms.  Burning wurms can do some hardcore damage.  If you're on a small raid where mobs aren't dying fast and you have a lot of downtime between pulls, you pretty much don't have a reason not to use defensive on every mob...it conserves mana and at 60 the refresh time is hardly noticeable. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>But again, and this can't be stressed enough, positioning the mob is key.  Make sure the other melee stay at the mobs backside and they stay as far away from the mob as they can while still doing damage (on wurms, that's pretty far away).  Since it is believed that aggro is based also on proximity range, the fewer the people that are close to the mob, the better.  If the melee stay at the backside, they can do max damage, hit more and avoid things like ripostes, parries, dodges, etc.  Of course this can cause a lot of push since you'll be the only person attacking from the front while 10 melee attack from the back and side.  To counteract this, I &quot;spin&quot; my mobs.  When I see myself getting too close to the ledge or wall, I turn the mob and all the melee turn with me.  It takes some practice, but it's very effective. <p><p align="center"><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=104582"><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/tinvic/sig4.jpg"></A><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=104582">Magelo's profile of my corpse</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uzebedi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zebedi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~zebedi/images/smallz.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/16/02 8:54:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~zebedi/images/Zebface.jpeg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  HoT Tactics</span><hr size=1> Ah, the good ole days. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Some things to think about when you're the MT pre-60 in HoT.<br><br># Proc weapons are Good Things(tm). I'm not sure what you're weilding, but some weapons that are particularly nice for HoT include the Frostbringer, Silken Whip, Fleshgrinder, Red Epic, Dirk of the Dain, Club of the Ice Ocean, and Truncheon of Doom (for tank mezzing, proc a 50% slow on a mob and you own it).<br><br># Proc weapons on other people are a Bad Thing. Epic Pallys are real bad about getting aggro, the wurms just hate stuns. If your rangers and rogues are using Venemous Axes or Frostbringers you're going to have problems. Gently hint to dual-epic rangers that proccing a 50% slow after the shaman has slowed for 75% = ranger paste.<br><br># Quality time with the mob. When the puller brings in the mob, take some time to get to know it before going defensive. What I used to do was tank just out of aggro of the pit away from everybody else until something procced, then tank some more until the shaman landed slow. Then I'd hit my &quot;/gu MELEE IN on %T&quot; hotkey. This works well in HoT, not so good in the rest of ToV. <br><br><br>Remember those pallies with the insane aggro from procs? If you tank the mob until it's slow, and have a pally in decent AC/HP gear, you can pretty much let THEM tank it, your rogues will appreciate it, your pally will feel usefull, and your exp bar won't suffer quite as much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Pre-60 you're going to be holding back the DPS of your entire raid because your taunt key just won't work. Letting somebody that can survive a slowed mob and aggro the snot out of it will improve your guilds overall performance. Once you hit 60, that flips right back to you, since a 60 war can hold decent taunt on mobs there.<br><br>Sk's could do the same, but your SK is pulling.. RIGHT?<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uxorizjebekis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xoriz Jebekis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/16/02 12:39:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: HoT Tactics</span><hr size=1> Ditto on good aggro weapons.
