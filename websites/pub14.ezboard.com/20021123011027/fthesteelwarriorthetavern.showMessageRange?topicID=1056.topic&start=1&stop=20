<br>
One could address it many ways the monk tanking ability.  I'd address it only one way.<br>
In PoP make the following additions to mob damage<br>
<br>
The following is for all mobs in PoP lvl 52+<br>
If warrior +0 damage when pc hit.<br>
If paladin/shadow knight +10 points of damage per hit.<br>
If ranger/rogue +25 points of damage per hit.<br>
If cleric/bard +40 points of damager per hit<br>
If monk/beast lord +45 points of damage per hit.<br>
If shaman +50 points of damager per hit.<br>
If druid+ +60points of damage per hit<br>
<br>
If wizard/enchanter/necro/mage +75points of damage per hit.<br>
<br>
This allows there to be a clear choice in grabbing a tank.  It also allows monks to be unusable as tanks.  Monks were never supposed to be tanks but I will not support a dirrect nerf to rebalance the game.<br>
<br>
As for the taunt issue some less skilled warriors have complained about.<br>
<br>
Warriors have complained they can't aggro mobs above their level.  last time I checked almost all exp grinds are done on blues.  If you aren't 60 you aren't leading raids on even conned or higher mobs.  This complaint in my view is class envy.<br>
<br>
Warriors have stated concerns about holding aggro better in groups.  If their aggro ability is increased as much as most have asked for the game will brake.  <br>
<br>
What is a resenable fix I'd support a class type aa ability that gave you a 40% chance to get an insint double taunt when you press the taunt button.  This is the most I'd give.  Why?  because taunt is barely an issue and PoP will release better taunting weapons.<br>
<br>
Odd thing is I've seen warriors roll on higher damageing lesser aggroing weapons when there is a ranger or rogue who could use it.  That's akin to a paladin asking for a hate generateing weapon over any warriors present.<br>
<br>
Sorry this is as polite as I get.  The idea though is valid if you can read pass my manorisms (sp)?<br>
<br>
Remember you still are the best damage absorber when compared to sk/pal so that small dif in damage per hit will add up n stack well with your current abilities.  Just don't forget to support paladins getting ToK and DS fixed while you try and get these issues addressed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukeryath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keryath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/7/02 1:08:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fixing the warriors in PoP and addressing taunt concerns</span><hr size=1> I'd suggest:<br>

Would also suggest a % based system that scales. A fixed point damage system wouldn't work.<br>

I also 100% disagree with what you said about taunt. I think taunt proc weapons are retarded and should be removed from the game. Fix the damn skill instead. I shouldn't have to bank my weapons of godly destruction and bust out 2 crappy gnoll whips to hold aggro. That's dumb. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uchavr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>chavr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/7/02 1:32:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fixing the warriors in PoP and addressing taunt concerns</span><hr size=1> I can handle the armor type base dmg mitigation.

Taunt is a bit tougher to work with.  I'd just make sure that taunt works the same from 1-59 and then at 60 you can taunt mobs that are 61+ or maybe 65+.  Would have to have warrior input on that for an exact number.  <br>
<br>
Taunt is tricky to work with though cause if you make it too strong for warriors the game is gonna warp. <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

Seems to me the only ones really complaining about taunt are the lower ability players and the class envying folks who feel there should only be one choice for group tank.<br>
<br>
There are many choices for group damage dealers.<br>
<br>
There are many choices for group healers<br>
<br>
Yet we are to believe from this board that only warriors should be a real choice for group tanks.   <br>
<br>
From what I can tell?  druids ain't got no game on whines that equal this board.<br>
<br>
As for the CR board being closed?  It was closed because it was a 100+ post thread and the moderator had whines from warriors to close it.  If it was a thread where the warriors were winning the argument would they have asked for it closed?  No they'd want it left open to prove their points.  Trouble was warriors from level 60 and down to like level 40 were comming in and agreeing with deadhorse.  In other words the whiners were loseing the argument and begged the mods to shut it down out of fear of people knowing the truth instead of the garbage warriors there had whined about.<br>
<br>
If you are winning a debate why would you want a thread locked or deleted?  That's like politions asking for the goverment to cancle all the adds when their side is winning in the add wars.  It just doesn't make sense.<br>
<br>
As for who I am and weather or not I'm deadhorse?  pfft like I care enough to deny or confirm.  It has no relevence to a debate.<br>
<br>
Anyways I've spoken my mind and I've let you know what I'd support for you and under what conditions.   Of corse you can flame me and get no support and possiblely lose support from others but that is your choice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/7/02 3:48:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fixing the warriors in PoP and addressing taunt concerns</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Seems to me the only ones really complaining about taunt are the lower ability players and the class envying folks who feel there should only be one choice for group tank.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You're amusing Seventhsword.  With a total of 7 posts on this board you think anyone is really going to take your opinion too seriously?  I doubt it.<br>
<br>
That statement alone brands you as a troll to me.  Surprisingly enough, equally skilled players can actually disagree.  It doesn't make either of them worse players, just people with a difference of opinion.<br>
<br>
See around here, people can disagree without one person being superior to the other.  It happens in real life too.

<br>
I agree, with warriors, the following is true<br>
<br>
Monks should not be tanks.<br>
<br>
Rangers should no longer be tanks.<br>
<br>
Rogues should not be tanks.<br>
<br>
I agreed change should be made to the game to further seperate the tank classes from the melee damageing classes.<br>
<br>
I even was supporting a small increase in warriors' abilities to taunt.<br>
<br>
I was far more polite then the posts that followed mine.<br>
<br>
Since the warriors who have looked at this thread have spat in my face, I've re-examined my previous conceptions.   <br>
<br>
Taunt works fine in the game.  Classes can now choice between the following tanks<br>
<br>
Warrior fine tank last longer then pal/sk but brings less versetility to a group. average damage is above pal/sk and below monk.<br>
<br>
Monk last longer then pal/sk/war brings the least amount of aggroing abilitiy to group.<br>
<br>
sk/pal tanks less then both of the above but have utility and hold aggro the best through this utility.  They also do less damage in average groups.<br>
<br>
End result is the warrior class is working as intended and needs no upgrades to stay balanced.  It should only recieve upgrades if pal/sk/monks/ect recieve upgrades of their own to keep the current balance.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
p.s. If you want to know what made your groups harder to get it's two fold.<br>
1 pal/sk are equaly good yet different at group tanking along with a couple of other classes that shouldn't be in the 3 classes of tanks.<br>
<br>
2 AoE groups are done by many and soloing is done by many as well. <br>
<br>
wizard/mage/enchanter/bard/cleric/paladins in later levels can be in AoE groups.<br>
<br>
Necros/shaman/druids/shadowknights/rangers/monks/paladins in later levels can solo efficently<br>
<br>
Rogues can join any fearing soloing class and bring great damage.  <br>
<br>
This means the only class left out in post 58 soloing and AoE groups is the warrior.   You've protected yourselves right into a few hard levels right at the very end.  Every class has had their herdals.  Welcome to the first you've had in far too long.<br>
<br>
When you finaly come to terms on shareing tanking slots fairly, feel free to give us paladins a polite and respected call.  Unlike the majority of the warriors here, we truely do wish the game to be FUN for everyone cause we know itimately how unfun it can be.<br>
<br>
<br>
by the way do you expect me to be all friendly and ass kizzing when in the past you have all been resposible for enourageing the following.<br>
<br>
/ooc pal/sk were paper tanks and not worth a group slot as much as you were.<br>
<br>
spreading lies that paladins could solo effectively pre SU3.<br>
<br>
whineing to verant so much for power that they gave in and broke paladins for 2+ years and durring that time the warriors posts and replies I've always read read like this &quot;Paladins are broken but they shouldn't be upgrade to be group tanks post 50 and they shouldn't be good healers and while I'd like them to get groups I don't want them in my groups or takeing slots in groups I'd like to join&quot;<br>
<br>
or all the other insults you've given paladins in the past.<br>
<br>
I don't want to be the best tank because I have the best abilities.  I want to be the best tank because I play better then the next guy.  Can any of you guys say the same?  <br>
<br>
How was the pal/sk/war orginaly attended to be?<br>
<br>
The warrior was to be a solid tank with easy ability to play.  It's still the easiest class to play in general.<br>
<br>
The sk and paladin were ment to be lesser tanks if they didn't use mana or know how to use their spells.  However if they did know how to play with their spells and mana they could be as good as a warrior and if they were exceptionaly talented they'd be better then the warrior.  This is where reputation used to be the make or break point.  &lt;-- this is currently where we are at in traditional groups as soon as those in traditional groups figure it out the better eq will be.  <br>
<br>
I was far more polite and considering of the steel warriors then they have shown me.  <br>

<br>
<br>
Its simple why warriors need to be re-balanced:<br>
<br>
We were balanced in with the all other melee classes in SoV era based upon our superior armor and how much melee power and class abilities we had vs the lesser armors, different melee powers and class powers they had.<br>
<br>
Now we no longer have the best gear, instead the same gear is shared by most if not all of the other classes. Warriors lost nothing directly here, however the other classes became as powerful as a warrior in this point.<br>
<br>
The hybrid classes, sans bards, have received the full force of the caster balance without suffering any drawbacks to the melee side of their powers. The healing hybrid classes have also received part of the priest balance as to date. <br>
<br>
So yes the other classes did receive more. Now it is time to give warriors something to restore the balance, the only question left is what. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uthehavocblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheHavocblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 328<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 9:10:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.guardianalliance.org/cgi-bin/upload/Tha.gif h=30 w=20></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fixing the warriors in PoP and addressing taunt concerns</span><hr size=1> This has been gone over ever so many times.

They need to be dealt with differently, so I'm going to break them apart the following way:<br>
<br>
1) Mitigation AC is completely broken at the high end of the game. I can't speak to this with any authority, but if Monks can be preferred tanks due to their mitigation working as well as a plate class, AND they have better avoidance skills, that is completely hosed and needs to be fixed. NOW.<br>
<br>
2) Warriors have trouble getting groups at the high end of the game, because they cannot generate aggro fast enough to make them useful tanks in that most highly sought after situation, a &quot;max efficient xp group.&quot; This is one issue that I think needs to be addressed.<br>
<br>
3) Warriors of all levels are unhappy because they think the warrior class should always be the clear choice as a tank. Under any circumstances, they think a warrior should be picked over a Paladin or SK.<br>
<br>
To address 1) several good ideas have been suggested. The best of which is a &quot;defensive table&quot; or a mitigation fudge factor. This would multiply the damage done to non-plate classes by a certain amount, or divide the damage done to plate classes by a certain amount. There are a bunch of different opinions about whether the groups should be made by class (Heavy plate=warrior, SK, Paladin, Light plate=Cleric, Bard, etc) or by armor type (plate classes, chain classes, leather classes, etc). Myself, I think any implementation of this idea would require a LOT of tweaking, so I'm not particular about what particular form of it gets rolled out initially.<br>
There's also the idea to adjust hp recieved on All/All items for class, where Warriors would get 100%, SK/Paladins 90%, etc. This seems like an okay idea to me too, as long as it's not applied to mana as well. The Hard Cap on mana affecting all classes, it seems to me that +mana items that are all/all should give the full benefit to all the listed classes.<br>
EDIT:  The more I think about it, the more appropriate I think it would be to limit +mana items this way, despite my objections.<br>
<br>
To address point 2), I think perhaps Verant should consider lowering the Taunt refresh timer from levels 53 onward, by about half a second each level. At 53, taunt refresh would drop to 5.5. At 56, it would drop to 4 seconds. At 60, any class with the Taunt ability would be able to taunt every 2 seconds. Yeah, this would apply to paladins and SK's too, but what the hell? It would only really help the warriors, and hopefully it wouldnt' be too overpowered. If so, the timer could just be adjusted again. (wonder if evade is tied to the taunt skill, only works in reverse?)<br>
<br>
To address 3), the idea that warriors should ALWAYS be the number one choice for tanking anything, anywhere.  I think this idea is completely messed up, and I have no patience for those warriors that make this claim. <br>
<br>
I recognize that if a paladin chooses to go the Templar route over the Crusader route (read: focusses on improving healing and mana, rather than offensive/defensive attributes) with his AAXP, then he becomes a very viable xp group healer, but that does not mean that at any point in the game, paladins should return to being the tank outcasts they were after Kunark. And being always second (or third) choice as a tank would relegate <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  non-AAXP</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> enabled paladins back to that point, despite the other abilities we might have, in my opinion. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=268670" target="new"><img src="http://www.emeraldis.com/~booraembj/smallbah.jpg" align=left> </a> <br> <br> <br><center><font face="coronet, comic sans ms" font size="6" font color="191970"><span style='filter:glow(color=#87ceeb,strength=3);width:100%'> Aragir Lancot</span> </font><BR>

<br>
And so it makes more sense to you that Warriors should always be the second (or third) choice as a tank instead?  Okay, I want better solo ability and some spells to compensate.  Or better yet, FD.<br>
<br>
Do you know why Paladins will have any more attraction over a Warrior as a tank?  Three primary reasons.  They can stun to generate agro, they can heal, and they can root park.  With high end gear their AC is effectively the same as a Warrior's and for experience groups the difference in HP is not a major factor.  And with high end 2handers the DPS difference is minor.<br>
<br>
Your spells are your attraction more than anything else.  Take away a Paladin's spells and the Warrior would clearly be the better choice.  But that isn't going to happen.<br>
<br>
If a Warrior can't noticeably take damage better than a Paladin, there is no reason to have the Warrior.  Thanks for wanting to condemn us to exactly the position you were in for Kunark.  No thanks, we pass.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 11:44:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warrior issues</span><hr size=1> Glatius,<br>
My apologies, I tried to make it clear that I don't want paladins to relegate warriors to the ash-heap.  I favor class balance, where a group that has a slot open and has a Warrior, a Paladin, and a Shadowknight campaigning for the position will have a hard choice on their hands.<br>
<br>
I don't, however, feel that the way to reach that balance is by making the warrior head and shoulders above the other two classes.  I geniuinely think that the changes I mentioned in my previous post would help reach this balance, and if you think that the ONLY way for this balance to be reached is for warriors to be the ultimate tank, then I'm afraid we will just have to agree to disagree.<br>
<br>

<br>
EDIT:  Incidentally, a less inflammatory way of stating your opinion (I think) would be to say that &quot;Paladins do currently tank less well than warriors, yes.  But the margin by which Paladins are below warriors is less than the amount of utility granted by the spells and abilities a paladin can bring to the table.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, other classes can do all the other neat things that paladins can do.  We know, we explored all our options after Kunark.  There's not much reason to pick a tank that can back up your druid/shaman/cleric/bard, since they won't be able to do it terribly well, and you really only want a tank anyway.  If their ability to soak up damage isn't up to snuff, their utility won't make them any better at tanking. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A> at: 8/9/02 11:50:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ushelrabbi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shelrabbi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 12:33:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warrior issues</span><hr size=1> Goody, someone to pick on.<br>

Let me be more clear: No one cares what you think. No one cares what you have to say. On this board, no one cares if you live or die. Do you get that? You could leave this world and not only would none of us even know, but if we found out, we would say &quot;awww&quot; and completely forget about you. Your existance is irrelevant to us. <br>

<br>
Perhaps this would have been a better way for me to say it, it is essentially my meaning.  If you have two tanks standing side by side, both of which tank perfectly well for the situation, and one has additional spells and utility, who would you most likely select?<br>
<br>
Should a Warrior tank head and shoulders better?  I don't think so.  Should it be enough to make a Warrior the better choice based on tanking alone?  Yes, or you completely invalidate the reason for playing a Warrior.<br>
<br>
Which tells me that either mitigation needs to be fixed above the soft cap or different defense tables need to be introduced.<br>
