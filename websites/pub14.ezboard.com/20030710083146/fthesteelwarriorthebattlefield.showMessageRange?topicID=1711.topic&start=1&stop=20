It was me (62 warrior), 62 wiz, 61 bst, 61 cleric, 61 chanter, 62 mage.  We handled every single mob perfectly, even the round where we got three rocks and one named.  In fact, we only missing getting the to the executioner one time.  <br>
<br>
My problem is this, I'm having the worst time on the executioner.  First time to him, the plan was to kite him while casters medded.  Well they sat before I had gotten agro, so that didn't work. <br>
<br>
Next time, kiting just seemed hard.  The casters stood in a corner till I got aggro then sat.  I kited him around, but was low on HP &amp; cleric missed heal by a second.  <br>
<br>
On another try, caster said they had enough mana to go at it without med time.  We engaged, but when I hit the defensive disc, I lost agro to Beastlord &amp; he died.  Cleric was oom and I had the attenton of the exec.  I guess maybe I should have stepped back when I had no hp left or maybe kited him??<br>
<br>
The grp could not have been any better and we're all meeting back up again tonight.  I'm sure you warriors will understand what I mean when I say I don't want to let this grp down again.  I need help with good tactics on how to finish this.  I know this is all about how well you play your chacater &amp; I feel like I'm just not getting the job done on this.  I'm sure y'all will understand when I say being the MA in trials is very nerve wracking.  Trying to get targets off fast etc just wears you out.  My hands are usually shaking by the boss from excitment.  It's a great event, but I don't want to let my grp down anymore.  So please, share any strategy that might help.  Maybe a do this in case of type of run down.  =)  Thanks! <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://pic2.picturetrail.com/VOL36/883708/1607625/18869473.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

You aren't letting anyone down. Keep up the good work.<br>
<br>
With that said, assuming you have the same group as you had before:<br>
<br>
1.) Kiting - I've never had to kite the executioner. Ofcourse the cleric that I've always passed it with has 350 wis so mana wasnt a problem. I see kiting as a very risky manuever that cannot always be completely controlled reliably, in the trials that is. Using it is a double edged sword. I think instead of figuring out how to kite the executioner, your focus should be on why you are needing to kite him. Yes the simple answer is because the casters are oom.<br>
<br>
a.) Make sure that all of your party members are getting raid buffed before the trial, including you. I noticed that you dont have a shammy. I'm -sure- that you are getting some shammy buffs b4 the trial. Don't settle for khura's focusing, or talisman of the bear, or aego etc. You and your party members want the good stuff. Make sure you are getting your virtue, your focus of spirit, your endurance of Boar. Make sure you are getting the top quality version of all class buffs. Get all the mana regen buffs you can. If this means u need to donate for this stuff, or that u need guild friends to help out, get it. Get c4 or c5. Yes they dont last as long as c3, but you dont need a long duration clarity, you just need one that lasts as long as the trial. So get the one that has the best mana regen. Get ranger buffs. You want the higher attk. Get BMB, the extra 100hp over its equivelent ranger buff is just as valuable as the +100hp bracer you payed 50k for. Just make sure you aren't settling for the second best version of these buffs. I've noticed that people in the trial area are usually very helpful about buffing other groups if they need it. The difference between 60 buffs, and 62+ buffs is ~600 hp and decent stats. Get the good ones. nuff said<br>
<br>
2.) As far as holding agro on the executioner, it should be considered the same as any raid mob. It isn't your responsiblity if you are losing agro, its the responsibility of your party members. High level beast lords /w pet do an insane amount of dps. MAKE SURE that you solo the executioner down to about 95% before the beast lord starts attacking. Raise or lower that as u see fit. If your weapons aren't cutting the mustard then wait a litle longer before calling assist. That should firmly put you ahead for most/all of the fight. If the beast lord keeps taking agro, its not because you aren't good enough, its because hes not good enough. Make sure that he stops attacking when he gets agro. The only reason I can see him maybe taking agro is if the cleric runs oom. Its a risky manuever, but having a cleric oom at this point is even riskier...<br>
<br>
The above should allow you to fly through the trials. 90% of the work is getting to the executioner. If you can make it to the executioner, you can definitely beat him. If after all of this you still cant make it through the fight, you may need to look at your cleric. You also may want to look at letting the BL and mage pets solo the executioner until they are low on health (u dont want them dead, good dps.) I'm confident you can make it through without trying stunts like that. Make sure you post back here whether you keep failing or you make it. I'll be interested to know how it goes either way.<br>

There are lots of different ways to do the Executioner, but here are the key points that work for me. I'm part of my guild's &quot;get em flagged&quot; team and we've managed to get up to 3 sub 60's through at once using these tactics and have beat him the last 6 runs straight.<br>
<br>
1. Get proper buffs, as stated above.. you want the best you can get.  Do NOT forget grm. DO put on some resist magic gear.  Getting slowed loses dps and can ping pong agro.  Give the pets Virtue and haste also.  If possible get Avatar on the MT.<br>
<br>
2. Don't let any casters sit unless on horse when a wave is about to pop.<br>
<br>
3. Make sure you are the closest person to the benches and everyone else is right behind you when a wave pops.<br>
<br>
4. Make casters nuke from mellee range so you can hold agro and mobs dont ping pong.<br>
<br>
5. Don't slow any mobs except the Executioner.. keep that mage Damage shield working hard for you.<br>
<br>
6. Don't have nukers &quot;save mana&quot; for the executioner.. I tell nukers to burn 30% of their mana per wave (they'll regen at least 20% by end of 4th wave) I want them oom at the time the Executioner pops.  Because that way we've ensured that we get to him by nuking the waves down and we've used less of the critical cleric mana due to shorter fights.<br>
<br>
7. Make sure your banishers have hotkeys made in caps saying &quot;attempting BANISH&quot;  and &quot;BANISH succesful&quot; ..it can be confusing when a mob is banished because it looks like he got pingponged before he poofs.<br>
<br>
8. Treat the executioner like a raid mob..go in first and pop defensive and build some agro.  Cleric should try to use a heal over time spell while he gets slowed and then use CH on you as normal. If any other people take agro from him they're not doing their job.  Despite having some decent duel wield weapons, I use a Windblade exclusively in trials to cut down on riposte damage from Exe.<br>
<br>
9. Make sure pets are all attacking the Executioner from the back.. they'll do more dps and the executioners enrage will kill just about any pet attacking from the front and healer mana will probably be critical. Fortunately your nukers will have medded up enough mana by now to help finish him off.<br>
<br>
While its desireable to take out the named and rocks first, its not the end of the world if you don't.  Never switch targets once you engage something.  Remember that named rocks can't be banished.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps and let us know if you get through !<br>

Best kiters i've found are rangers &amp; druids...mainly cause they kite a lot.<br>
<br>
Also, you cant kite him after you fight for a while cause he summons.<br>
<br>
If your cleric has decent gear, you wont need to kite him though - when I play my cleric in exe trial I usually have like 80% mana left by the time we get to exe &amp; thats way more than enough. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=412980">Lorcann</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

A lot of the things you mentioned we were already doing, but there were a few things we have not tried.  I think sometimes it takes one little change to make all the difference.

<br>
I got one advice when tanking exe(or any other hard hitting mob for that matter).  If for some reason your getting pounded to the ground and getting very low on HP, turn off attack, you will hold aggro fine until a heal lands because of low health aggro. It should at least reduce the extra dmg taking from ripoestes and maybe save your hide. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sashiasoulslayer>Sashia Soulslayer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://img1.ranchoweb.com/images/nyx/sparkly.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/26/03 2:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Advice on taking down the Executioner</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the awesome advice everyone!

I think that becuase it was a one grp thing that I wasn't treating Mr. Meanie like a big mob.  Well he is.  I think the best two pieces of advice was to get agro and call attack just like any other major mob and get the best raid buffs even if you're asking outside the grp.  I wish I could pass along advice on how to get my hands from shaking after, but I can't.  Besides thats the fun part!<br>

I know I need to attack immediately but I'm afraid to pick the &quot;wrong&quot; target. Do you waste time picking the &quot;best&quot; first target or just grab one and wail on it?<br>
After the first mob the mobs are strecthed out...do people use F8 adn just attack the closest, or do they try to decide?<br>
<br>
This is helping my skills as a tank, but it is nerve wracking!<br>

For initial wave I found it best for the MT to stand in the middle slightly towards the platform, and facing to either side to see initial pop. Try to find rocks first or if you have druis and/or mage in group just find a mob and hit it. The druid/Mage can take care of the rock. Also make sure the group is informing you where mobs are or at least you try to get an idea of where they are, searching for mobs to kill is less dps which = failure.<br>
Last but not least F8 target if no more rocks up nukers/rogues are waiting on you to target so they can attack  also dont be choosy just attack get in a zone. I have found that the last wave comes all of a sudden cause I lost count of waves just to target - attack so make sure group tells you when last mob. That killed me one time last mob died I'm thinking one more wave and PEV is kicking my arse. <p><p>

Pretty easy to stand near enough the spawns while remaining close to the corner your group is and hit that as soon as you see mobs spawn...if you get nothing, go F8 and go to town.  If you see multiples, just hit it after a mob dies.  Works like a charm.  F8 + target hotkey. <p>Good travels,<br>

Thanks for these suggestions. Usually I like to manually target my mobs but in this zone I need to be much quicker... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=366288">Quakr's profil</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sirspliskin>Sir Spliskin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/18/03 3:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.heppler.com/akanae/smallsnake.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My problem I need help with in this encounter:</span><hr size=1> Well, I've tanked the Exe trial for my guild to flag people a lot and we've won 13 out of the last 14 attempts (we lost when the shaman went LD on wave 1..)<br>
<br>
Generally speaking I just grab the closest mob per wave and look over the rest for Nameds while we're fighting the first one.  With decent MR you'll resist the dazzle spell the nameds try to cast on you even if you get tashed.   By the time the named stops casting and wants to mellee you usually have the first one almost dead anyway.<br>
<br>
I dont like to use f8 to target because the nearest mob may be behind me.. and I want to do as little position changing as possible in order to keep the rogue in position and pet beating on mobs backs.  Also, i may have 2 mobs beating on me but one beating on the rogue..so I'll target that one next to get it off the rogue and save cleric mana.<br>
<br>
As has been posted, theres lots of different strategies for doing Exe but I find the named mobs a non issue really unless you get several per wave.  <br>

pull him with an arrow to where the sage is, then take him down, but make sure you got at least 4 people 50+ with you because hes tough, especially when he has the axe.<br>

Two wizzies, cleric, tank, chanter, and last spot is misc, melee is usually best, like monk or rogue.  Shaman will also work.  Basically u AE the waves, then when Exec pops, you move to the back left corner (left if facing the back wall).  Chanter runs out (yes, chanter) and aggros the Exec, then kites him.  As he kites him, he tashs and slows him.  Once the Exec is slowed, the rest of the people in the corner can sit down, since Chanter now has secure aggro.  Chanter kites the Exe around till everyone is FM and buffed, then brings him back to group where Tank engages and hits Defensive.  chanter unfortunately dies about 40% of the time, but he's not really needed after that point anyways.  once tank has good aggro, he calls for assist, and the other melee engages, or the nukers start with small nukes.  Once he's down below 50%, they can really nuke away, and he goes down quick.   <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-family:copperplate gothic light;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>They come like sacrifices in their trim, <br>

I would like to add that you should remember, Enchanters have the ability to rune. This saved the day when I was at 10% and Cleric was waiting for Mod Rod to reset. A few runes, got me to where the CH landed and we were able to finish off Exe. Only death was the Wizzie. <br>

Also, Pets... Pet aggro when he Casts Armor Break Sucks! Make sure to have pet casters control them or lose them if you want to Kite. <br>

<br>
instead of setting up in the middle, just have the casters sit in the corner, then you stand next to them in the first row of benches. the mob's will still aggro on you first. and then it's just like your nose. pick a mob and let the chanter PEAE stun, the wizards drop PBAE nukes, takes about 20 seconds per wave to drop them all, and you get some med time between. when the 4th wave falls, just swap out weapons and then tank the big guy. just like tier 2 planes..use 2h weapons because his riposte will eat you up fast. i dont' even use defensive.<br>
