this. If it DOES come down to a choice, say one of each sends you a tell afer you ask for a tank you SHOULD take the warrior first, that is the warriors one and only possible role. If there is no warrior then choose that paladin. THATS why warriors need to be noticeably better at tanking than any other class. If tanking is all that they can do then why shouldnt they be the best at doing it? Just like a wizard is best at nuking, or a cleric is best at hp/ac buffs and heals, or a shaman is best at stat buffs. Warriors are SUPPOSED to be better tanks than anyone else! Remember back in the day when paladins were lughed at for wanting to be the tank in an exp group? Groups would almost rather disband than try to let a paladin mt. Now if there is no warrior then SURE! Bring that pally down here he will tank just fine! Not as well as a warrior but good enough to do the job. THATS what I meant about choosing. <br>
Quite frankly, there arent a large number of warriors in the 55 and under range to choose from. Thats probably why I end up tanking alot in exp groups. But I have also had a number of groups with paladins or sks as mt and done just fine.<br>

<br>
let VI fix the @#%$ from the get-go. waiting 51 levels to finally be able to tweak your class into doing what the @#%$ is supposed to do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> in the first place</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is retarded.<br>
<br>
Why warriors aren't on their own defensive table is stupid as well. Monks and Rogues were clearly designed to be able to outdamage most other classes and VI made their own offense tables at 60; what is VI's malfunction into seeing that Warriors are their so-called &quot;standard&quot; of what Melee Damage absorbtion should be and we also <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be put on our own defensive table. And as most have said; and i'll repeat it again for those not scrolling through the 20-odd pages here..<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Defensive Discipline is a Crutch</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Period. If that is the only class balancing factor that VI can think of they surely better lay down the crack-pipe because they've basically made Warriors good for 3 minutes every 10 minutes of time ( at level 60 ) and the rest is spent trying to keep up with what most other classes can easily produce in the way of Damage, Group Helpfulness, and overall completion of a task as per fighting a MoB. The Vision as designed for Warriors never made a wrong turn anywhere; it just flat out came to a screeching halt in the middle of the road right after Velious was opened and we've been the brunt of the other classes jokes ever since. <br>

<br>
First off i do feel that warriors do need help. Somethign really needs to be done soon because its only going to get worse in PoP.<br>
<br>
Sorry i dont have time to read this whole thread, but here is what i think needs to be done.<br>
<br>
1) Mitigation is ass broken. Somethign is really wrong when a tank class values their avoidance skils 10 times over their mitigation skills. And thats the way it currently is, i dont give an ass about my mitigation ac but ill take all the avoidance i can get. AC hasent really ment anythign since kunark, and that really needs to be changed. The whole mitigation system really needs a rewrite. Warriors need to be either on a much higher mitigation table or need some kinda built in defensive skill making them take less then max hit 100% of the time. In addition to that i feel knights also should be on a higher table and/or have a build in type of defensive, BUT we should definately be lower then warrios. In short tho the tank classes need to be set apart from all the rest in the area of mitigation, right now were all the same.<br>
<br>
2) Shields dont do and never have done anything. When tanking people really should be using shields, be it a knight or a warrior. Right now youd have to be a moron to do so. Main reason being shields dont do anything they only add stats. Second reason being you lose a huge amout of DPS when you equip a shield, lower dps means you cant maintain agro as easy. Sheilds really need a purpose in the game. If they gave you a 20% chance to outright block a skill youd see people using them, if they gave a 20% defensive youd see people using them. But, they also need to do somethign about the reduced ability to control agro when a shield is equipped or fixing shields still has that glaring flaw. In short a 1h weapon + shield shoudl be a viable form of combat. Rigth now it is not to any class.<br>
<br>
3) +Hitpoints on items. +hitpoints should have scaled based on classes. +100=100 for a warrior and much less for other classes. But, this late in the game i dont know if they coudl get away with fixing this correctly, and thus they will probably leave it alone. If they however fix mitigation properly it will help the situation a lot. From day 1 hitpoints really should ahve scaled tho. This would have allowed the tank classes especially warriors maintain their hp leads over other classes.<br>
<br>
4) agro management. I dont know if you can just outright give warriors a much better taunt without breaking the game badly. I do agree somethign needs to be done in this area however. A warrior shoudl nto have to rely on proccing +hate weapons as much as they do. However they should also not have the ability to control agro as well as a paladin/shadowknight should. Warriors should be the better tank, but we shoudl be the better agro lockers. I dont know how they can corretly fix this without trivilizing the game. If you have a warrior that can maintain perfect agro then thigns are way too easy; but it is a joke right now and needs work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for the people who like to bitch about the paladin class in this thread, a large /ruide. Dont even try to give the old well they get this skill and that skill blah blah blah and we dont. Or the old my skills suck but yours are godly. If you are gonna post any comparison of skills do it with the facts not some bloated comparsion of blatent exaggerations. For the first time in 3 years my class has not been severly handicapped. We are not godly, but we also do not have anymore glareing holes. We still have a few issues, but that will always be true for any class.<br>
<br>
In short to verant, fix mitigation damnit! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucslochraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CSLochraven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 8:08:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=418>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gs.cdnow.com/graphics/COVERART/local/L/80/01/00138001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rofl</span><hr size=1> I like the idea about shields.<br>
<br>
Real fighters usually don't &quot;dual wield,&quot; they have a sword and a shield.  <br>
<br>
The problem is that for us to keep aggro with a 1hander and a shield would be either to have the weapon be godly or make taunt much more effective.  Which causes problems with both areas.<br>
<br>
Our damage mitigation should be improved.<br>
<br>
I think our ability to hold aggro is fine.  YES, sometimes the mob will run and hit the shaman.  YES, sometimes the mob will turn and attack the rogue.  YES, you will get some ping pong occasionally.  In an exp group it doesn't matter most of the time.  On raids the MT losing aggro shouldn't even happen often at all if everyone does what they are supposed to do. <p><b>Lochraven<b><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> End result is the warrior class is working as intended and needs no upgrades to stay balanced. It should only receive upgrades if pal/sk/monks/ect receive upgrades of their own to keep the current balance.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Its simple why warriors need to be re-balanced:<br>
<br>
We were balanced in with the all other melee classes in SoV era based upon our superior armor and how much melee power and class abilities we had vs the lesser armors, different melee powers and class powers they had.<br>
<br>
Now we no longer have the best gear, instead the same gear is shared by most if not all of the other classes. Warriors lost nothing directly here, however the other classes became as powerful as a warrior in this point.<br>
<br>
The hybrid classes, sans bards, have received the full force of the caster balance without suffering any drawbacks to the melee side of their powers. The healing hybrid classes have also received part of the priest balance as to date. <br>
<br>
So yes the other classes did receive more. Now it is time to give warriors something to restore the balance, the only question left is what.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uchavr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>chavr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 11:13:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=421>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rip</span><hr size=1> Warriors set the standard.  They are 100.  Balancing started to happen.  The hybrids were at 40 or so.  Now hybrids are at 100.  Warriors see this as them losing power.  All that really happened was the huge gap between them closed.<br>
<br>
When adjusting anything to do with mitigation include the knight classes along with the warrior class.  We are the only tanks in the game.<br>
<br>
Someone posted that warriors only bring tanking because their offense was well below the other melee.  Thank you for proving my point about paladins.  We have even less offense then warriors.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer to not be the main tank in a group.  It's not what I enjoy doing.  Sadly there are only two ways I get in a group though.  The first is because of friends/people I've grouped with before.  People know me and know I'm a damn good paladin.  This is probably the majority of my groups now a days.  The second way is when a group is looking for a tank.  Usually in these groups I tank as long as it takes to get a warrior in the group and then let them take over.  At that point I do what I enjoy doing most.  All sorts of different things.<br>
<br>
Before the upgrades luclin brought to us I didn't get groups that needed a tank though.  The only time I got in a non guild group was when there was no one else left lfg in the zone.  I had to be in guild groups and then would meet new people that filled in the holes that developed.  Once these people got to know me and how I played I could get in groups with them again.  It was a very long and drawn out process to make connections in such a way to get a group.<br>
<br>
I fear that if the tank label is once again removed from paladins things will go back to the way they were.  If you ask for adjustments to warriors make sure knights are not left out when it comes to tanking.  <br>
<br>
I can't convey to you the way it used to feel to play a paladin.  I can not get you to understand the frustration one felt some days.  The only reason I got groups remotely easily is because I could eek out every last trick from my class.  There was no other option for me if I hoped for people to invite me again.  Finally though I don't have to be frustrated anymore.  My class has finally come into it's own, and it's only a matter of showing people that paladins are no longer the black sheep we once were.  <br>
<br>
Then I find out about this thread and start reading.  I see warriors saying that paladins are getting groups all the time.  I see warriors complaining because paladins are being picked now for one of the 6 spots in a group.  Warriors are saying they've been left behind.  They are no longer useful.  Warriors should be the only viable option for a tank.  No one else should be able to encroach upon this holiest of holy spots.  Yet, they totally neglect the fact there are 3 plate/tank classes.  They ignore the fact that we are tanks too.  That if warriors are made into the best options for tanks, groups will no longer want us knights.  You say we have utility and that tanking isn't our only option.  You forget that there is almost never a group looking for a utility class.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Do warriors need looking into? Maybe, I honestly couldn't make that opinon.  I am an expert on paladins.  That is who I am and what I know.  When I tell you that placing warriors definitevly above paladins in tanking, again, will hurt us severely, then trust that I am right.  Find a solution to your problem that will not hurt my class along the way.  <br>
<br>
Finaly, remember this.  Even with all the balancing and things done for paladins there is one true statement.  Warriors are still better tanks.  The difference is Paladins now bring enough other things to the table to offset their weaker tanking ability.  Finally we have become even in desirabilty to groups, and now you want to elevate yourselves again. <br>

Paladins <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tank worse than a warrior, and considerably so (I believe VI stated 80% of a warrior) - just as well as they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> heal worse than a cleric.

If you are only 1% better than the next melee, you are STILL better. Point is, everyone is freaking out about Super Monks and Godly Knights, but really...there are a handful of them at BEST on any given server. So there are 2 Monks and 3 Knights on your server that are better than a 60 Warrior? So f*cking what??? Are they fighting with you over every xp group/raid you try to get into? And NO, there aren't going to be hundreds of them in the next few months. Those that are Godly are going to be rare. Why? Warriors usually get the best gear first, and if you don't...thats between you and your guild (or your DKP). <br>
Hybrids are just fine. The Melee classes are the ones that are screwed up (Warrior-Monk-Rogue). Rangers and Rogues own DPS over Warriors..but wear Chain and have far fewer HPs. Monks are the sh*t when it comes to avoidance (which is a game design flaw). Knights are close to Warriors but do less damage. And they Do have less Hps. Not as less as a Bard-Rngr-Rogue, but less. And the object of the game is to do damage to the mob &amp; kill it (raid or xp grp) before it kills you. Currently, Warriors &gt; All for Hps. It shouldn't be too hard to code some Mobs to have thier own damage tables relative to AC (damage mitigation). Some zones like CT-Deep-Acrylia Cavs are very Warrior-friendly. Other places, its fine to have a Knight or Rngr to MA for Xp. Never should a Monk MA, regardless of thier mitigation. Lack of any triggerable agro is what disqualifies them. As an example, take a lvl 51 Shammy into Pit Spiders in Velks. I would rather have a Ranger or Knight MA to keep the resist agro null and void. But that is an exception, the rule is generally to get a Warrior and appropriate levels around them. *Note: If any of you wish to quote anymore, post the whole quote...stop taking sh*t out of context*<br>
<br>
Now, to get back to the original theme of this thread: I see no reason for Offense/Defense upgrades to Warriors. (/duck) What I DO see a need for is some utility based in the offensive/defensive realms. Don't want to have Warriors replacing any other classes, as no other classes are replacing them (contrary to popular belief). Some long duration Stuns/short duration Debuffs could be some cool skills under offense. Some improvements vs certain weapon types (higher mitigation or avoidance vs 1hb, 1hp, ect..buy em in AA) could be some cool defensive skills to implement. Try to think of something besides just jacking up the scale of a game that is currently f*cked up. All you would get then is a game thats f*cked up with higher numbers.<br>
<br>
No More Pally Vs. Warrior crap! Get this thread back on track peeps...<br>

With equal quality gear, in XP groups :<br>
- Paladins/SKs handle mobs better (aggro management), and tanks almost like a warrior... And almost is, for paladins/sks that know to play, very near of warriors' tanking capacity.<br>
- Monks have some problems to initiate aggro (only the first swings) but he can aggro well only with their damage output (and their insane weapons that proc stun like hell), and they tank better than warrior. With equal gear. Not that they absorb damages better, but they take less hit. The only problem is that a monk is more difficult to heal than a warrior (monks' hp diminution are quite erratic). That's all.<br>
<br>
On raids :<br>
- The only advantage to warriors over other tanks is 2 disciplines : Evasive, and Defensive. Their duration is about 3min. On Luclin mobs, 3min mean nothing.<br>
- I'm curious to know how many warriors are MT's so they have to use defensive/evasive, and how many are only damages dealers, so they have *NOTHING*. I am lucky : I am MT.<br>
- With godly weapons (for instance, the 1HB 40 damage, 35 delay, from Grieg's End, easy to get for a non-Vindi capable guild !), damage output for paladins (I don't know well for SKs) is almost... or maybe more than warriors one. *with equal difficulty gear* (try to list warriors' only weapons dropped on mobs that are on the same difficulty than for paladins' one, and take a good laugh).<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong. I don't want damage increase. I don't want nerfs on other classes. I don't want to be able to solo some dragon.<br>
I only want to do my job : to be the meat shield and actually to have tools to assume this role.<br>
And I want to be UNIQUE. I *WANT* to have something, even if not really useful (like criticals before AA), that makes a warrior not only an ersatz of a paladin/sk.<br>
Now, our class ability only resume to this : Defensive. <br>
And this is quite sad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

There are not 2-3 paladins on any one given server bigger than warriors.  <br>
<br>
My friend paladin who I gerouped with has 3600 base hps, he is not uber.  He is wearing full SS armour, has some decent weapons and miscellaneous stuff.  <br>
<br>
As a contrast, I have full warlord (NTOV) armour excluding bracer(champions/SS), Helm(SS), BP(Cobalt), I duel wield epics, have a CoF and some decent supplimentary stuff.  <br>
<br>
He has 200-300hps more than me. <br>
<br>
He is not uber, I am considered to be more uber than him. <br>
<br>
If we are 1% better than any other tank, then we are still better ? Sure we are, but you are so single minded as to not realise.....HELLOOOO!!!! We dont get FD, we dont get celestial heal, SOW, Snare, DoTS, Ressurection.  <br>
<br>
EVEN IF we were 1% better than everyone else at doing OUR job, I would personally have a paladin anyday of the week.  They hold aggro better anyway and can heal themselves.<br>
<br>
What class are youagain ??? You mention zones such as CT are much more friendly for warriors.  <br>
<br>
Question:  Have you ever been a warrior in CT ? <br>
<br>
Allow me to demonstrate a warriors life in CT...Puller brings something in(could be warrior), cleric heals - aggro to cleric - warriors fights for aggro off cleric - cleric DAs, warrior has aggro, Ench tashes and slows(if you dont have a shaman), mob goes for enchanter and bashes ench until it has around 50% life back.  Warrior finally gets aggro when mob at 50% then it ping pongs between the melees(and possibly cleric). <br>
<br>
This equates to around 40-50% of the overall warrior's point of view in CT.  <br>
<br>
Granted I dont have brilliant weapons, but they are better than most of my level.  So, if I have trouble what about a warrior with &lt; weapons than me.  <br>
<br>
Sorry bud but your FoS (and I have provided you with enough evidence to support this)<br>

<br>
Completely incorrect.  Sorry.  The point is not to make Warriors the ONLY viable tank class.  Paladins and Shadow Knights will still retain their status versus the mobs.  The point is to make Warriors significantly better at absorbing damage that if you have a Warrior and Paladin standing side by side in exactly equal gear and you need someone who will main tank, you'll pick the Warrior.  Because thats all we do and all we can do.<br>
<br>
If we can't do it significantly enough better than the Knights  and Monks, then why have a Warrior when you can get a Knight with their additional spell abilities?  Or a Monk with their additional pulling abilities?<br>
<br>
Granted, Knights probably get the majority of their groups because of their ability to tank.  But the point is they CAN do other things.  A Warrior can't.<br>
<br>
So yes, all other things being equal, a Warrior should clearly be the better tanking choice.  But Knights should still be able to do the job.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uthorena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 10:22:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=428>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  dont understand</span><hr size=1> I really don't understand the warriors complaint.  <br>

60 warrior full ss gear epic<br>

If a group gets generated and they want a tank they will grab the warrior and head down to exp leaving the paladin still lfg.<br>

Warriors have trouble getting agro but fact is you pay for that difficulty by having higher hps ac and dps.  <br>
<br>
If paladins are so overpowerded how come when sleeper key time comes several warriors will have keys before paladins.  <br>
<br>
Sorry warrriors are still the best tanks you may have trouble getting and holding agro but you have skills that offest that difficulty.  The only difference now is that when the group is generated next time and that warrrior isnt around the paladin can fill in.  When groups start taking a paladin 5 or more lvls lower then a warrior that is avaiable then you can complain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhulanta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hulanta</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 11:12:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=429>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: dont understand</span><hr size=1> If I am in Sebilis and I can choose 2 guildmates of any class to group with me to kill, (pretend that I am any class), If I have a shaman, I would pick a warrior.

<br>
Basically, what I am saying is that it becomes vary situational.  At the level 60 with lots of aaxp part of the game, pallies are great healers for zones where the mobs do very little damage because they can tank AND heal.  If you have a shaman with torpor, the pally is probably not needed for healing, and maybe a warrior is a better choice, or a rogue, or a monk...  <br>
<br>
I have ALWAYS believed that you can throw any 6 players of any classes of similar levels together and get decent experience in some zone (exception being 6 clerics).<br>
<br>
Duoing with a pally is pretty good experience.  Duoing with another warrior isn't nearly as good.  Duoing with a monk makes me feel pretty stupid because the monk can tank weak mobs much easier than I can.<br>
<br>
Pallies can be tanks for groups.  But they can also be the crowd control for a group.  Or they can be the group's healer.  Or they can be the damage dealer if undead is your target.<br>
<br>
Warriors can be tanks for groups.<br>
<br>
Because of this distinct difference, warriors do truly need to have an edge on tanking mobs.  I don't mind seeing pallies being the tank for a group.  But I should be better at it since I can't do crowd control or be a group's healer.<br>
<br>
I am one-dimensional.  I chose it.  I wanted to be a tank.  I wanted to be the one taking the beating.  <br>
<br>
Pallies CHOSE to be multi-faceted.  Pallies knew when they became pallies that they were going to have spell casting abilities.  They knew that they were going to have some advantages versus undead.  They had to have known that since they had these advantages that their tanking ability would have to be less than warriors.<br>
<br>
Warrior vs Paladin should be a dead issue.  Both classes chose what they would be.  The only difference is that besides some extra hps, warriors are now not that much better than a paladin for tanking.  If my cleric can sit there full mana in an experience group and start nuking like crazy to ease the boredom on an experience grind, then it doesn't matter if I am tanking or a pally. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20383">Hulanta</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 11:19:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=430>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  ROFL</span><hr size=1> &quot;If paladins are so overpowerded how come when sleeper key time comes several warriors will have keys before paladins. &quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps for the following reasons?<br>
<br>
- Warriors will generally GREATLY outnumber Paladins<br>
<br>
- BECAUSE Warrior taunt is screwed, warriors need as much prosthetic help as they can get to generate aggro, and Avatar helps this<br>
<br>
- BECAUSE warrior defense is not up to par, dead warriors are a fact of life and backup tanks need the same prosthetic help as above to maintain taunt.<br>
<br>
Warriors don't get primal weapons because of strict DPS additions, they get it because Avatar helps us in maintaining aggro by adding +100 Atk, and Maxing proc possibilities.  In ohter words we get it because we're broken as a class.<br>

I am leveling my Warrior, so I am not just some troll here to b*tch. I have seen a decent chunk of the high end game, and know what is in store for my Tank.<br>
<br>
And your CT story...obviously you played with some peeps that don't know how to manage agro. I was MA there for a bit (60 Ranger), and could hold agro fine, but was dying or running the group lom. Once we got a Warrior in the group, we mopped the place. You see, you don't HAVE to tash-slow immediately if you have a Warrior with better than Cobalt bp *cough*. Nor do you have to worry about Heal agro on Cleric if Cleric knows when &amp; what to heal with.<br>
<br>
You think this game would be any better if a Warrior could just Taunt &amp; hold a mob while debuffers/damage dealers just waxed it?. The AI in Everquest is stupid, but its not completely retarded. So as to me being FoS, get a clue...and some gear.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this thread should be about adding utility/fun to the Warrior class, not complaining about other classes abilities. It seems very easy for critics to freak out on other melee, yet offer nothing to the debate on what Warriors could gain. Other than just upping the offense/defense/agro scale....which is not a solution. It would just be a continuation of the same problem.<br>

<br>
Well said!  I agree, and I think most paladins agree, that warriors should have an edge on tanking.  I think mostly we are just arguing over the degree of superiority your edge should provide you.<br>
<br>
Bear in mind that a generic paladin, level 52-58 can tank for a group moderately well.  Depending on gear, he might be able to do almost as well as a warrior.  At 59 paladins get nice spell that will help them out tanking, and at 60, most paladins start to invest in AAXP.  HOWEVER, and this is pretty important, a paladin doesn't really become a threat to the warrior as group tank until he invests in several of the Melee Archetypal AA skills.  And a paladin can't really own the role of group healer until he has several Priest Archetypal AA skills.  Before that point, the paladin is similar to a warrior a few levels lower, but who can contribute some mana to the group.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I don't want to take away from the core point, which is that most paladins agree warriors should be able to tank better than us.  But the consensus is that warriors shouldn't be A LOT better than us.<br>
<br>
Fixing Taunt and mitigation seem to be the two things that really ought to be done to straighten out the high-end game.  <br>
<br>
Would a gradual decrease in the delay of the taunt skill to 2seconds at level 60 help warriors enough?  What about the oft-suggested &quot;armor mitigation factor&quot; where damage taken is modified based on armor type (heavy plate, light plate, chain, etc)?<br>
<br>
Perhaps these two in conjunction could boost warriors to a point where they would be happy without leaving paladins in the Dark Ages of Kunark again.<br>

<br>
or something like that *smiles*<br>
<br>
It's just like when Verant nerfed (or fixed) the extra regen trolls and iksar got from AA points. Were lots of angry trolls and iksar posting that they were meant to be x % better and now they were just ending up the same after having thought they were making the 'smart' choice<br>
<br>
maybe its time you feel a little bad after 2 years of feeling smug at making the 'right' choice<br>

<br>
&quot;I really don't understand the warriors complaint. <br>
<br>
You guys are still the best tanks in game. Your skills are higher in offensive and defensive. <br>
<br>
Take a paladin and a warrior in seb<br>
60 pally full ss gear epic<br>
60 warrior full ss gear epic<br>
<br>
If a group gets generated and they want a tank they will grab the warrior and head down to exp leaving the paladin still lfg.<br>
<br>
Warriors have trouble getting agro but fact is you pay for that difficulty by having higher hps ac and dps. <br>
<br>
If paladins are so overpowerded how come when sleeper key time comes several warriors will have keys before paladins. <br>
<br>
Sorry warrriors are still the best tanks you may have trouble getting and holding agro but you have skills that offest that difficulty. The only difference now is that when the group is generated next time and that warrrior isnt around the paladin can fill in. When groups start taking a paladin 5 or more lvls lower then a warrior that is avaiable then you can complain.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
THE COMPLAINT ISN'T THAT WARRIORS SUCK AT TANKING NOW, IT'S THAT IF THINGS CONTINUE ON THIS CURRENT TREND, WARRIORS WILL HAVE EVEN LESS VALUE THAN THEY HAVE NOW! Jesus.<br>
<br>
Why the hell are paladins/SKs upset? We're @#%$ asking for an upgrade to PLATE CLASS (hello, ring a bell?) mitigation tables. <br>
<br>
Warriors (for the most part) aren't complaining about SKs/paladins being more preferable tanks, but rather monks.<br>
<br>
How many god damn times is the same tired, old &quot;but you have defensive discipline!&quot; argument going to be used? It holds no weight.  The fact of the matter is, warriors have far outgrown the use for defensive and evasive. They should be removed from the game, and a SEPERATE mitigation table for warriors, SKs, and paladins should be implemented.  Any tank class that can wear plate should benefit from this, though paladins/SKs to a slightly lesser extent than warriors.<br>
<br>
And then there's taunt, and I found this quote very amusing:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry warrriors are still the best tanks you may have trouble getting and holding agro but you have skills that offest that difficulty.&quot;<br>
<br>
We have skills to offset that difficulty? Oh, you meant BANDAID FIXES? How very silly of me! What skills were you referring to exactly? AE taunt? Chuckle. Warcry? Laugh.<br>
<br>
Warriors should never have complete control of agro, but we should at least have some ability to garner agro aside from holding hands in a chanting prayer vigil, hoping, begging, PLEADING to the powers that be that we can get the attention of Ssra Snake_00.<br>
<br>
Did I state that taunt doesn't work on mobs above level 60? And that this is AFTER it was upgraded back in Kunark? It SHOULD have a chance, however miniscule, to help the warrior get the mob on him, no matter what level it may be. As it stands, we rely on lame ass enraging blow weapons or using AE taunt, a skill that was NEVER intended to be used in the way it is now.<br>
<br>
And let us not forget that for every all/all +100 to +125 hp item released in this game, we narrow the gap in hitpoints.  A gap which, mind you, is the ONLY thing that seperates warriors from other classes at this point.<br>
<br>
You can't say we have higher ac, because we don't, thanks to the AC softcap.<br>
<br>
You can't say we take hits better than other tanks (monks specifically, and yes, I DID call monks tanks)because we don't, once again, thanks to the AC softcap.<br>
<br>
So the only thing we have going for us right now is pure, raw hp, and, my friends, that divider comes closer to cracking every expansion that has been released. Unless we receive some type of upgrade now, or actually get a designer that KNOWS what a warriors' job is in EQ, we may very well be seeing what is becoming the uselessness of the warrior class (and to an extent, knights as well). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
