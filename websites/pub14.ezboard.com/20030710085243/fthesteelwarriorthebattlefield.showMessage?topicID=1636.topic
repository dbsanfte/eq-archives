I am concerned about my damage output. While using both Centi Long and Short swords my hits are averaging about 25-45 points each time. I have the Hitpoints and ability to keep the creatures taunted. My fighting skills for the 1hs, dual weapon, and double attack are maxed as is my taunt. However, it takes me 1min and 30 sec (minimal) to kill a Dark Blue Froglok in Lower Guk. Is this normal? Should I be using different weapons? <br>

<br>
Well, here's one meatshield's opion of when you're doing enough damage.<br>
<br>
1)  You know you are doing enough damage when the cleric heals you, sits to med and the mob sticks to you.<br>
<br>
2)  You know you are doing enough damage when a rogue in the group backstabs the mob for X amount of damage, everyone in the group says holy *** AND the mob still sticks to you.<br>
<br>
3)  You know you are doing enough damage when the monk in the group does a flying kick on the mob for the 90th time for 500dmg each, the necro says 'Is it possible to stack more than 12 dots?', the wizzie starts to melee as he/she is oom and the shammy stops buffing people so he can try to out damage the necro AND the mob still sticks to you.<br>
<br>
4)  Lastly, if the cleric tells you 'I'm amazed you survived that last pull, I did it the other night and X class got smoked', then you've hit the pinacle, you ARE a warrior, you took your beating and asked for more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Kilzalot already pointed it out, but I had to toss an extra penny in.  Now, if the above is true when you're the MT then hey you are doing enough damage as your primary job is keeping aggro while others cream the mob.<br>
<br>
However, if you're a secondary tank in a group then you need to dish damage.  In that case, think of the following:<br>
<br>
1)  Do you have enc/shammy haste?  A haste item?  If you're in lower guk, go pickup a flowing black silk sash.<br>
<br>
2)  You have some decent weapons, especially considering you wouldn't really be able to obtain them at your level (other than purchase/twink).  In that sense, you're pretty high up on the damage scale.<br>
<br>
3)  Personally, I loved my wurmslayer at that level.  Yeah it is 'slow', but with my enchanter hasting me plus a fbss I was swinging pretty damn fast.  Your damage bonus isn't that high at that level so a high damage weapon makes up for the low dmg bonus on primary hand.<br>
<br>
Lastly, yeah, wurmslayer aka staminaslayer does suck the yellow bar, but that doesn't hurt too much.  My cat warrior loses 20 str &amp; dex when his yellow bottoms out, which isn't too bad.  You have a very very high strength for a half-elf, so I'd say you can afford to drop the str a little to up the butt kicking power.<br>
<br>
Good luck and happy hunting,<br>

In the normal exp group im in, I tank with a 2hander and hold aggro just fine.  the three dmg dealers are mages in my group.  Gotta worry about keeping them alive ;P <br>

In favor of getting the Trakkanon Idol and kiling 1 of the Frogs .. it took my cleric casting 5 complete heals before the slaughter was complete. (Frog conned Dark BLue to me I think) <br>
<br>
Your right - I have really sacrificed in the STA / Hit Point department and that is what is draining my team of Mana. I think asking for ZING constantly is driving my cleric nuts. <br>
<br>
So in the interest of being a better warrior I started an Ogre. With a full set of Crustacean Armor my STR and STA are already over 200 at level 28. HOwever, the downfall to this is my DEX. Which I need to work on. But the main difference is that my Ogre is hitting for the same damage as my level 47 Half-Elf. Which absolutely floors me. The STR is about the same and I am using the same Centi Long and Short Sword I had on my Half-Elf. What other factors determine DPS?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=procrastination77>procrastination77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/22/03 3:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thanks - and for another part to my question...</span><hr size=1> Odd that your level 28 ogre warrior does the same damage as your 47 HE warrior. There's a much different damage cap at those 2 levels. And with the same weapons and same STR on both toons, too? I didn't think race made a difference with damage. <br>
Unless maybe your ogre had unusually good ATK buffs like SoP/SoT/SoV at the time, I'm not sure how this is so.<br>
Maybe some scholar can clear this up. <br>
<br>
And for a warrior, putting out more damage is really not going to help as much at later levels.  With rogues and monks putting out 150+ dps, you will be sorely left in the dust, and losing aggro like no other.  It becomes more about getting a weapon that procs a good aggro spell.  I wield pretty good weapons, and if I got 2 rogues in my group, I NEED my BoC to proc or taunt button ain't gonna do crap. <p>Procrastination<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net">Science of War - Stormhammer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

There are better tricks to doing more damage and agro, and hps/sta.<br>
<br>
For your level, I'd suggest:<br>
<br>
1.  Work on armor.  If you are low on sta/str, go crusty.  If you can, go to PoH, the indo would be a great AC upgrade.  Velious Quest and Cobalt is another good option.<br>
<br>
2.  Weapons:  Wurmslayer should be losing ground to a fast 1h.  I would suggest a lamentation as it's getting much cheaper as more new weapons come out, and as they continually drops in seb.<br>
<br>
3.  Get atleast a FBSS for haste.  Haste will make a major difference.<br>
<br>
4.  If you want a good 2h, there are a number of good ratio 2h's out there cheap.  Two that come right off my mind are the Centi War Spear (20/30), and a step up is the Sarnak Battlehammer (30/40).  These two are going to be very cheap.  Another option are the Dragon Necropolis weapons ( some kind of velium weapon).  They keep getting cheaper as well.  A 30/37 should be fairly inexpensive.<br>
<br>
Changing races is a bad idea IMO.  Anyone can tank as well as anyone with similar gear.  Sure, any RZ race has an advantage, so do tribunal worshipers, but I know I have never been able to afford even one piece of RZ armor if I were a RZ race.<br>
<br>
If you can learn and figure out how to get the job done with lesser stats, then it would be a waste of your time to go back to a lower level oggie warrior.  But if you absolutly feel like you NEED to switch to an oggie, its your game after all. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=31658">Raun Stonecutter</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.swordoffate.com">&lt;Sword of Fate&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
