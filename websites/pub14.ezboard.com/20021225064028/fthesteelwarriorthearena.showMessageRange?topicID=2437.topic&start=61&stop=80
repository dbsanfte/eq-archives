(just using capitals cause you did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
When you hit something that is yellow to you, you hit it LESS hard then when you hit something that is even. When you hit something that is even, you hit it LESS hard then you hit something that is blue. When you hit something that is blue, you hit it LESS hard then you hit something that is green. Likewise, if you are yellow or red to a mob, it will hit you LESS hard then if you are even or blue to it. When taunting, YOU CAN NOT TAUNT ANYTHING ABOVE YOUR LEVEL, so obviously level DOES matter. As well, here is a copy of the devs talking about the fact that the higher LEVEL you are (not skill) the better you taunt via a new scale method they introduced with the taunt upgrade: <br>
<br>
&quot;Right now Taunt seems to take a second place to Enraging Blow items – is this intended? <br>
<br>
Taunt has been reviewed and should work much better now, on any NPC level, and have a sane progression up to the characters’ 65th level. We are aware that the Enraging Blow items are subjugating the Taunt Skill and we will be looking into this. We don’t particularly like when abilities are obsoleted by items. Enraging Blow items were a temporary fix for a systems problem that has unfortunately stuck around too long. <br>
<br>
We’d much rather have character skills make more sense. Please check out Taunt again as you progress – It now has a much better chance of working for PoP-level players vs PoP-level NPCs.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, to sum up, your damage, the damage you take and the mobs you can taunt are all DIRECTLY related to your level vs the level of the mob. End of story. No question, no supposition, this is FACT. <br>

I ask this...at 65, how many zones can you get xp in?  A lot less than I can at 60.  For me personally, it doesn't matter what my xp rate is, I get bored of zones eventually.  For me, I'm in no hurry to green out areas that I do get xp in..because I know I won't be going back at 65. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Marshall Haass Wolvesbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
And there is as much room to level in PoP tier 2 planes and up as there is in all of luclin for a 60-65. The zones are huge and the mobs are plentiful. <p>Shelrabbi Hassida<BR>

Slight increase in minium and max damage.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I would exp to 63 than go all out AA.  at 63 you can get great AA in PoV ~1 per 1.5 hours.  If PoV isn't an option, get 61 so you are enabled for Planar durability and go all out AA till you can get inot PoV.  Here's why.<br>
<br>
1) ND3 and AE tuant are a MUST. Period. Its all about hp.<br>
2) after this go Physical Enhancement.  I don't know why this wasn't mentioned really, it can give you 2% hp increase which is signifigant, as well as profiding some mitigation to damage and avoidance.<br>
3) Planare duarbility is enabled at lvl 61 (High More HP)<br>
<br>
After that, depending on where you are, you can go CA3, and CS3.  At this point you have to ask yourself what kind of tank are you? are youa MT in a raiding guild, or are you a casual exp player. if you area casual player AA is the way to go. These AA skills do make a noticible difference. and there really isn't a major difference between say a lvl 62 and a 65 tank.  The level does not make you a better tank.<br>

<br>
Did you even read the previous posts?  Level DOES make a big difference.  Level increases HPS, increases your chance to hit, increases your damage output, decreases your aggro radius, increases your resist chance (even with low resist gear on), decreases mob hit and damage rate (independent of AC).  Some of the AAs have a significant effect but aside from AE taunt I challenge you to come up with ANY AA ability that makes as much difference as an added level.<br>
<br>
If you don't believe it take a warrior just high enough level that their skills are capped (don't remember what level this is) and compare their tanking ability to a level 65 warrior.  If you want the difference to be glaringly obvious have them tank a level 65 mob.  I guarantee that the lower level warrior will tank like a wet paper bag compared to the 65.  You can even give the lower level warrior superior buffs so they come out to the same HPs.  The 65 will still EASILY out tank them.  The difference is obviously smaller if there's only 1 level difference but it scales proportionally. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85547">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
I don't believe it.  If there's any 65 warriors with no AA on CT, look me up, and we'll do just that test.<br>
<br>
If that is true, then there should be a huge difference between a level 65 with no AA and me, with nd1, cs1, ca2 and PE.<br>
<br>
Of course, if there isn't, then I guess that'll prove I was right all along.  I'm more than willing to give it a go..the problem is finding a level 65 warrior with no AA, or at least not past baron yet.<br>
<br>
Levels makes a difference..sure, i'll agree with that.  Does it make as big a difference as people claim?  Lets find out. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Marshall Haass Wolvesbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

I am hoping to be 65 by the beginning of next week and will not be getting any further AAs until I do.  The level difference between us is not very large so the best test would be if I had the same defensive AAs as you and the same AC.  HPs don't really matter because what we are interested in is the rate at which we take damage.<br>
<br>
If you want to do a test where you are at now and make note of what your AAs are, I will get the same defensive AAs as you have and do a similar test.  It might also be interesting to see the difference on a mob that is blue to both of us vs a mob that is blue to me and red to you (ie level 64 once I am ready to test). <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85547">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Looks like we're just about at the same gear level, so that should work out great.<br>
<br>
Only reason I was wondering about no defensive AA's is for curiosity if 65 is worth forgoing AA's for...I could easily get the defensive aa's I have in the time it took you to get to 65, I just haven't been XP'ing much lately.  So that right there would help determine if you are a better tank for being 65, or if I am for getting the AA's.  Right now i've got 17 points in defensive AA's, which is pretty reasonable I'd think for the difference between 61 and 65..maybe a little low.  Could do it both ways tho...maybe if we're gonna do that, i'll rack up CA3 and CS2 and 3 next here before I do ND.<br>
<br>
Any ideas on decent targets I should be looking towards?  I've got 2 comps and clerics avaible, so I'm sure I can get a decently long parse on anything that can't kill me in less than about 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
This question's been debated for weeks now on pretty much every message board...maybe it's high time we put an end to it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Marshall Haass Wolvesbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
I suspect the largest difference will be on mobs that are higher level than you but lower level than me.  Probably won't be a very large difference on stuff that is blue to both of us but that's just a guess on my part. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85547">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If you can get logs from groups you can still make a valid comparison just by calculating avg damage per hit and hit/miss ratio. Neither of these will be affected by the amount the mob is slowed or how soon the mob is slowed. These stats will be a very good way to determine if a higher level tank mitigates damage better than a lower level one.<br>

Now, is a significant modifier..that is the question.  The dual wield formula, if I remember correctly is <br>
<br>
(Skill + level)/400<br>
<br>
Now, in that scenario, how much difference is there between level 61 and level 62?  The answer is &quot;Not a whole helluva lot&quot;  Skill is the main variable, because it's larger and goes up in larger increments..and it also stops going up post 60.  If all equations in EQ use a formula similar to that, like lets say your chance to hit a mob is ==<br>
<br>
(Offense + weapon skill + level) - (mob ac + mob level)/ some variable<br>
<br>
Does level play a part in there?  Sure it does.  Does it play a drastic part?  No, it doesn't.<br>
<br>
I'm not debating whether level makes a difference..I know it does, I've seen formulae where it's used.  However, how it's used is such a small variable that I doubt it makes enough of a difference to be parsable.  We shall see. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Marshall Haass Wolvesbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

No, Haas...  Level is a much larger impact than you wish to believe.  Indeed, if we were to put level as a ratio or as a comparison, you would likely br much closer to the truth.<br>
<br>
EQ is about comparisons...<br>
<br>
First it compares your level and the mob's level and creates some sort of modifier.<br>
<br>
Then it takes ATK (tohit/dampotential) and AC (avoid/mitigation) and compares them.<br>
<br>
Mobs do no have &quot;skills&quot; as you do.  Your skills are a factor in your ATK and AC... only skills such as taunt and Riposte and Parry and Dodge are rolled separately.. and I bet even those have some sort of level based modifier.<br>
<br>
Take your 60th warrior and beat on a greenie... notice the greenie barely touches you and you hand the greenie its butt.  As mobs grow closer in level to you, they deal more damage and you don't ignore their armor.<br>
<br>
Now take you fully buffed warrior and try beating on an even con or higher... I betcha it hurts you something fierce.<br>
<br>
This advantage happens for characters as well.<br>
<br>
Take your 60war and stand-up duel a 65 warrior nekkid ( I'll bet the higher warrior hands you your butt so to speak. (yeah yeah, its slow, but should be decisive if you are same race, same class)<br>
<br>
The level DIFFERENCE modifier is why level&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;AAXP.<br>
<br>
Its more than Haas wants to see.... if 60 with 50AAXP isnt better than 65 with 5, then the modifier is quite a deal...  think of what you could buy with 45 extra AAXP.<br>

<br>
Levels make a difference..sure, but ya know what, every level before 60, with the exception of 43-50 had skill increases.  And ya know what...from 43-50 was probably the hardest time for most warriors before the dreadlands was introduced...because Dar Ghoul Knights beat our asses at 43, and they beat our asses at 50.<br>
<br>
I&quot;m not disputing whether levels make a difference, it's obvious they do.  What I want to know is exactly, quantitatively and scientificly (sp?) and logically how much of a difference 65 makes over 60.  I'm willing to bet it's not much, and i'm also not afraid to be proved wrong.  That's science.  Sometimes you're right, sometimes you're wrong, but you don't KNOW for sure until you've got some numbers in front of you.  Precedent from 1-60 is flawed, because you gained skills in that time.  Logically, it's incorrect to assume 61-65 will have the same impact<br>
<br>
Oh, one other thing struck me as odd, but i don't feel like bringing up another web page to quote it, so i'll do it halfassed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Mobs don't have skills&quot;<br>
<br>
My ass they don't.  That level 64 wyvern in ToV sure double attacks me WAY WAY WAY more often that that Lion did when I was level 10, so that throws off that entire argument.  You don't know what mobs have, you're guessing, and you're basing a conclusion on the guesses, which can't be done.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I've got zero issues being wrong, and I've got zero issues admitting it.  But i'm not gonna sit idle while everyone else spouts &quot;facts&quot; and conclusions based off of incorrect and illogical assessments of the situation. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Marshall Haass Wolvesbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>
