<br>
I picked up Run3 when I was in my mid-50's and it was well worth it. At that point it only takes a few gaming sessions to pick up the skill and it's great in terms of self-reliance, safety and convenience.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Is Level &gt; AA?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The very first question to ask before the comparison can be made is what is your goal?<br>
<br>
If your goal is to become as powerful as possible as quickly as possible then the answer is pretty clearly weighted to LEVEL (the majority of this post will go to illustrate this point). Level as quickly as possible and then round out your character with AA skills.<br>
<br>
If your goal is to have fun, pick up some neat skills and make each level more effecient then there is no clear answer. Some of the AA skills will be really fun because of eye candy (Combat Fury). Others will make you more effecient than a paladin of the same level without the skill (Mental Clarity).<br>
<br>
One of the questions you can ask to assess the answer is whether a 55th level paladin with a bunch of AA skills is &quot;better off&quot; or &quot;more effective&quot; than a 60th level paladin with few or no AA.<br>
<br>
A second question to ask is does it take more total play time to get, say, 30 AA points and THEN get 60th level or to get 60th level and then get 30 AA points?<br>
<br>
Those two questions sum up the issue of power &amp; effeciency. If you don't care about become as powerful (or as effecient) as possible in the shortest amount of time, then the following evidence is close to irrelevant for you. Pick what you will have fun doing. You can get AA points faster than levels (assuming you are higher than 51st level). You can get &quot;fun&quot; skills in your mid-50's - pick what you think will be the most fun for you.<br>
<br>
If, however, you want to know what the most effecient path to &quot;power&quot; is, then the following evidence is for you (since you actually asked the question, one might assume that you care <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  How does levelling increase power (post-50 specifically)?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The short answer is that almost everything in EQ is based on level - gaining a single level, even without skill increases, makes you substantially more powerful. The ways in which it makes you more powerful are detailed below.<br>
<br>
1. Hitpoints. As perusal of the board (and common sense) will tell you, hitpoints are extremely important. We do almost anything we can to increase them, in most situations. Consider how much better an item with +75 HP is than an item with no hitpoints - levelling gives you those hitpoints for &quot;free.&quot;<br>
<br>
2. Mana. Our mana pool can have a large impact on our effectiveness - how many times can you heal or stun? How much of your mana pool is used for buffs? As with hitpoints, we focus on getting wisdom/mana items to increase our mana pool and levelling gives you mana for &quot;free.&quot;<br>
<br>
3. Defensive skills. Higher Riposte, Parry and Dodge means taking less damage. Higher Defense means better AC (better mitigation and/or avoidance). You will be able to tank tougher mobs or tank lower level mobs better than you could before you got those skill increases.<br>
<br>
4. Offensive skills. Higher Offense, Weapon Skill and Double Attack skills increase your DPS. The mobs you were fighting will die faster, increasing experience per hour.<br>
<br>
5. Better Spellcasting skill. Your skills increase but you also just get better at casting. You fizzle old spells less as you level (even without increases in casting skill). Also, the hybrid penalty on spellcasting diminishes as you approach 60 so the same spell costs less mana to cast each time you level. You can cast through interruptions better.<br>
<br>
6. New spells. It is difficult to overstate the extent to which our spell selection determines our utility. The spell arsenal of a 60th level makes the spells of a 55th level paladin look like a poor jest. Gaining spells like Healing Wave of Prexus, Superior Healing (not great, but effective in small experience groups), Celestial Cleansing, etc. make you a much better addition to a group or raid than if you don't have them. (Of course we have many poor spells but the few gems ARE gems.)<br>
<br>
7. Aggro radius. In a typical experience group, being able to pull well (few adds) can be very important. This is even more true for soloing. As you level, the aggro radius of mobs below your level decreases - you must be closer to them to aggro and if you do aggro a mob, it is less likely to aggro nearby mobs (almost like a form of Harmony). A 58th level person can pull single mobs from an area where a 55th level person would pull 3 - reliably. New areas to hunt open up as you level.<br>
<br>
8. Equipment. Unless you are twinked by another person or character, you gain access to new equipment (particularly no drop) as you level, and you can make money more quickly.<br>
<br>
9. More damage output. As you level, your damage bonus with a 2hander increases. This results in an appoximately 1 damage per second increase each level (actually a bit more due to weapon skills) even if you do not change equipment. Since the damage bonus is applied every round, a small increase has a substantial effect over time. A 50th level fairly equipped paladin may produce approximately 20 DPS. A 60th level paladin WITH THE SAME EQUIPMENT will produce closer to 30 DPS - if you include the fact that the 60th level paladin will probably have much better equipment, you can expect about a doubling of DPS from 50th to 60th level.<br>
<br>
Those are the major ways a character's power increases as they level. You also gain disciplines, though hours are mostly worthless and I won't consider them here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  How does effeciency of AA vary with level?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The premise here is that the amount of experience needed for one point of AA does not vary with level. In other words, the exact same amount of experience must be collected for an AA point whether you are 51st level or 60th level. (This is supposed to be the case, but it's always possible that it has changed or could change.)<br>
<br>
The answer to this question is closely tied to the previous issue of power. A more powerful person collects more experience per hour than a less powerful person. This is due to:<br>
<br>
a. Killing more powerful mobs.<br>
b. Killing the same mobs more quickly.<br>
c. Having less downtime to meditate/heal.<br>
<br>
Some combination of a, b and c should hold. Additionally, higher level people can hunt in zones that now have an extra experience bonus (e.g., UP or CT). These zones have extremely powerful mobs (for experience-level mobs) that are challenging and would be nearly impossible for people in their low 50's.<br>
<br>
So, if the amount of experience for an AA point does not change AND you can collect experience faster when you are of a higher level, then it must be the case that AA experience is faster at higher levels. <br>
<br>
Note: If either of the two premises is not true (static cost and faster experience at higher levels), then the conclusion does not follow by necessity. There are complicating factors. For example, it may be easier to find GOOD hunting grounds at 53 than at 60. I was able to find hunting areas from 51 to 54 that allowed me to kill dark blue mobs with NO downtime. I have not found such an area from 55 to 58 (57 and 58 seem to be generally difficult levels for soloing, however).<br>
<br>
In terms of the time it takes to gain a particular level, there is no doubt that having AA skills will make you more effecient. Having higher HP regen, higher mana regen, more effecient heals, better mitigation/avoidance, etc. will make a level go by faster. A 56 paladin with 30 AA points will get to 57 faster than a 56 paladin with no AA points (assuming they start the level at the same time).<br>
<br>
However, one has to consider what level the 56 paladin with 30 points COULD HAVE BEEN had they not focused on AA.<br>
<br>
Based on the information above, it should be clear that getting to a point of being 60th level with, say, 50 AA points will be FASTER if you get 60 first and THEN pick up the AA points instead of getting AA points as you level. (The question of which person has more fun getting to that point cannot be answered analytically.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Splitting Experience</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Another issue that frequently arises is how to assign experience to AA, if you are not waiting until 60.<br>
<br>
The worst thing you can do is split experience into AA AND regular experience at the same time. This postpones BOTH the level AND the AA point, meaning that you spend more time gathering experience before you have anything to show for it. <br>
<br>
Take the extreme of splitting your experience 50/50. In this case, you just doubled the time it will take to get a level AND doubled the amount of time it will take to get the level - you've put both rewards further off so that you won't have a new level to help get AA or a new AA skill to help get another level.<br>
<br>
In terms of effeciency, focus on either getting an AA skill (not just point, but a skill) OR focus on getting a level. You want to actually have the skill or the level to help you get your next point or level. Putting BOTH off further greatly diminishes your effeciency.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Run Speed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I break this skill out into a separate section because it is the ONE case where a case can be made for postponing levels in the name of effeciency.<br>
<br>
One of the biggest time sinks in EQ is travel time. If you can reduce travel time, you increase your experience per hour. If you have constant access to Spirit of Wolf (or jboots, etc.) then run speed is much less helpful for doing so. However, for cases in which those spells/items are not available or usable (e.g., in a dungeon), run speed can be very helpful. The fact that it cannot be dispelled is additionally appealing (try pulling in a location and have your SoW dispelled while doing so).<br>
<br>
Run speed 1 is fast enough that you will be able to just barely stay ahead of most mobs. Run speed 3 is fast enough that you literally may not notice that your SoW has faded (assuming your are not running at the moment it fades). It is fast enough that I will intentionally drop SoW in a dungeon so that I have room for another buff.<br>
<br>
Run speed has saved my life in a handful of occasions. It is the case that at higher levels you rarely have the chance to FLEE from a mob, especially in a dungeon - you either evac or die. However, I still find occasions when running is feasible (e.g., in some of Chardok). In those cases, Run Speed makes your Divine Aura more effective - you cover more ground while invulnerable.<br>
<br>
I can't convey the amount I fretted about spending the 3 points to get Run Speed but I will say that it is a choice I really do not regret. I put it off until 57th level and, if anything, wish I had gotten it earlier. Your mileage may vary, but it is the one case in which many people agree that the skill is worth waiting to level. No other single skill can have a case made in such a way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Conclusion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If you're after effeciency and power, gaining even one level provides many benefits that can't be matched even with multiple AA points (particularly in the General pool).<br>
<br>
If you want enjoy the journey to 60 as opposed to racing there, then effeciency is not your primary concern and you shouldn't be asking which to do. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>
