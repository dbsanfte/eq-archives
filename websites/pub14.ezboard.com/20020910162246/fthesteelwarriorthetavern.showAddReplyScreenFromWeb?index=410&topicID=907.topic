Those disciplines were given to us in an era when AC meant something. Even at the end of Kunark the most uber warriors (i.e. Me and a small handful of others) could barely reach the AC softcap, a cap which was never raised in Velious and only marginally increased in SoL - over two years later. Conversely, the average fight times versus uber mobs were raised almost exponentially while the DPM from mobs barely changed; and in MANY Velious and even Luclin uber encounters, remained BELOW the DPM of Dragons in Veeshan's Peak - the Vision took a wicked, wicked wrong turn in game design. How could they have not seen this mess coming?<br>
<br>
In those days, the term monk and tank were only used in the same sentence when you were talking about what it felt like to get rolled over by a twenty ton tank if you were a monk that tried to tackle anything larger than a bread box, head on.<br>
<br>
Additionally, due to the fact that fights hardly ever lasted more than 4-5 minutes, the disciplines made sense - two years ago.<br>
<br>
Right now they are only a vestige; a remnant of a bygone era: A time when Armor Class meant something and the warrior class was more than a mish mash of bad coding and lost grey matter.<br>

<br>
Let's see if I can make this easy enough for even our new Paladin friends to understand.<br>
<br>
You seem to think that....<br>
<br>
Having the same AC as warriors is ok<br>
<br>
Having approximately 90% of the HP as a warrior is OK<br>
<br>
Having the same defensive skill as warriors is OK<br>
<br>
Having AA skills which brings you closer to warriors' ability is OK<br>
<br>
Having superior weapons which brings your melee DPS so close to warriors that it's insignificant is OK<br>
<br>
Basically, what you're saying is that you want the line between Paladins and Warriors to be so thin in terms of melee that it's barely recognizable at all.<br>
<br>
I would be ok with that<br>
<br>
-IF-<br>
<br>
You didn't have the same manapool as casters<br>
<br>
You didn't have LoH<br>
<br>
You didn't have the ability to recover from solo fights at 4x the rate of warriors.<br>
<br>
You didn't have the ability to create situations where while soloing, it's always you +mob, and any adds can be rooted safely out of melee range<br>
<br>
You didn't have server numbers which allowed you to be equiped on items which are class or 2class specific at a rate which is 10x faster than any others.<br>
<br>
You didn't have a free resurrection so that soloing is without any risk whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Incredibly enough, Paladins are the second or third best healers in the game.  In an exp group, a Paladin is a wiser choice than a druid for healing because a Paladin can correct larger problems fast using LoH, whereas a druid cannot, EVER.  If something goes a little wrong in a group setting, the Paladin is ALWAYS the better groupmate, even if they're not doing the primary tanking.<br>
<br>
So, what I'm getting at is that you guys really DO &quot;have it all&quot; and you're sitting here wagging your finger at us, who have given up any right to ALL of that which has been described above and in return we have gotten.....nothing, we've gotten told by you guys that we should be easily replaceable by you guys, that Everquest should be easier for you to play than us, because once upon a time, when Kunark was the latest, you couldn't get a group in Sebilis over a warrior and had to /lfg, and because once upon a time /disc defensive was really powerful.<br>
<br>
What you're saying is that your paranoia over being the CLEAR 2nd choice for a tank, we should simply bend over and take it.   Paladins SHOULD suffer some penalty, enough to make a difference in both areas of their existence, in melee AND in casting, for the benefit of having both.  Paladins seem to be the ONLY class that I've ever seen who says &quot;Well, we can get aggro without effort and we should not have to worry if we do&quot;.<br>

<br>
I've grouped with many many Paladins in my time.  And the best ones don't have to be main tank to prove their worth.  They back up heal as needed.   They throw in some stuns here and there to keep casters from casting, particularly gate.  They do some crowd control if needed.  They help pull mobs off casters when a caster makes an oops.  They can root runners.  They can successfully tank unmezzable, unrootable adds.  They are effectively able to do a little of just about everything, and do it pretty darn well, if the player is skilled.  And for experience groups they do make a respectable main tank.<br>
<br>
If as a Paladin you feel you HAVE to be the main tank to have value, you're playing the wrong class.  You should be a Warrior.  Because a Warrior HAS to be the main tank to be fullfilling their full potential.  Otherwise they are merely mediocre damage dealers that should probably be replaced with a Monk or a Rogue.  Not so with a Paladin.  They can be either a Main or Secondary tank and still add significant value beyond their damage output.<br>
<br>
Warrior contributions?  Only two to speak of.  Damage absorbtion and damage dealing.  We have already agreed and accepted that our damage dealing is going to be third or fourth tier at best (Rogues, Rangers, Monks, Wizards, Mages with pets all do better damage).  Now you are saying we should also accept that our damage absorbtion (without disciplines) should only be slightly better than the other Plate melee and slightly worse than Monks?   And what exactly do we get to counter balance this?<br>
<br>
The Paladins are rending their clothes and beating their chest about how there just aren't that many places they can go to fight undead so they can solo effectively.  Well, those few places are WORLDS more than a Warrior has available.  Soloing is not a viable option through most of a Warrior's career.  Grouping is our only option.  And we don't think its unreasonble we a margin of attraction over an SK or a Paladin for that.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usmushums.showPublicProfile?language=EN>smushums</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Steel Warrior Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 1133<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 9:45:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=414>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rofl</span><hr size=1> VI should fix our aggro management by adding AA<br>

If it DOES come down to a choice, say one of each sends you a tell afer you ask for a tank you SHOULD take the warrior first, that is the warriors one and only possible role. If there is no warrior then choose that paladin. THATS why warriors need to be noticeably better at tanking than any other class. If tanking is all that they can do then why shouldnt they be the best at doing it? Just like a wizard is best at nuking, or a cleric is best at hp/ac buffs and heals, or a shaman is best at stat buffs. Warriors are SUPPOSED to be better tanks than anyone else! Remember back in the day when paladins were lughed at for wanting to be the tank in an exp group? Groups would almost rather disband than try to let a paladin mt. Now if there is no warrior then SURE! Bring that pally down here he will tank just fine! Not as well as a warrior but good enough to do the job. THATS what I meant about choosing. <br>
Quite frankly, there arent a large number of warriors in the 55 and under range to choose from. Thats probably why I end up tanking alot in exp groups. But I have also had a number of groups with paladins or sks as mt and done just fine.<br>

<br>
let VI fix the @#%$ from the get-go. waiting 51 levels to finally be able to tweak your class into doing what the @#%$ is supposed to do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> in the first place</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is retarded.<br>
<br>
Why warriors aren't on their own defensive table is stupid as well. Monks and Rogues were clearly designed to be able to outdamage most other classes and VI made their own offense tables at 60; what is VI's malfunction into seeing that Warriors are their so-called &quot;standard&quot; of what Melee Damage absorbtion should be and we also <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be put on our own defensive table. And as most have said; and i'll repeat it again for those not scrolling through the 20-odd pages here..<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Defensive Discipline is a Crutch</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Period. If that is the only class balancing factor that VI can think of they surely better lay down the crack-pipe because they've basically made Warriors good for 3 minutes every 10 minutes of time ( at level 60 ) and the rest is spent trying to keep up with what most other classes can easily produce in the way of Damage, Group Helpfulness, and overall completion of a task as per fighting a MoB. The Vision as designed for Warriors never made a wrong turn anywhere; it just flat out came to a screeching halt in the middle of the road right after Velious was opened and we've been the brunt of the other classes jokes ever since. <br>

<br>
First off i do feel that warriors do need help. Somethign really needs to be done soon because its only going to get worse in PoP.<br>
<br>
Sorry i dont have time to read this whole thread, but here is what i think needs to be done.<br>
<br>
1) Mitigation is ass broken. Somethign is really wrong when a tank class values their avoidance skils 10 times over their mitigation skills. And thats the way it currently is, i dont give an ass about my mitigation ac but ill take all the avoidance i can get. AC hasent really ment anythign since kunark, and that really needs to be changed. The whole mitigation system really needs a rewrite. Warriors need to be either on a much higher mitigation table or need some kinda built in defensive skill making them take less then max hit 100% of the time. In addition to that i feel knights also should be on a higher table and/or have a build in type of defensive, BUT we should definately be lower then warrios. In short tho the tank classes need to be set apart from all the rest in the area of mitigation, right now were all the same.<br>
<br>
2) Shields dont do and never have done anything. When tanking people really should be using shields, be it a knight or a warrior. Right now youd have to be a moron to do so. Main reason being shields dont do anything they only add stats. Second reason being you lose a huge amout of DPS when you equip a shield, lower dps means you cant maintain agro as easy. Sheilds really need a purpose in the game. If they gave you a 20% chance to outright block a skill youd see people using them, if they gave a 20% defensive youd see people using them. But, they also need to do somethign about the reduced ability to control agro when a shield is equipped or fixing shields still has that glaring flaw. In short a 1h weapon + shield shoudl be a viable form of combat. Rigth now it is not to any class.<br>
<br>
3) +Hitpoints on items. +hitpoints should have scaled based on classes. +100=100 for a warrior and much less for other classes. But, this late in the game i dont know if they coudl get away with fixing this correctly, and thus they will probably leave it alone. If they however fix mitigation properly it will help the situation a lot. From day 1 hitpoints really should ahve scaled tho. This would have allowed the tank classes especially warriors maintain their hp leads over other classes.<br>
<br>
4) agro management. I dont know if you can just outright give warriors a much better taunt without breaking the game badly. I do agree somethign needs to be done in this area however. A warrior shoudl nto have to rely on proccing +hate weapons as much as they do. However they should also not have the ability to control agro as well as a paladin/shadowknight should. Warriors should be the better tank, but we shoudl be the better agro lockers. I dont know how they can corretly fix this without trivilizing the game. If you have a warrior that can maintain perfect agro then thigns are way too easy; but it is a joke right now and needs work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for the people who like to bitch about the paladin class in this thread, a large /ruide. Dont even try to give the old well they get this skill and that skill blah blah blah and we dont. Or the old my skills suck but yours are godly. If you are gonna post any comparison of skills do it with the facts not some bloated comparsion of blatent exaggerations. For the first time in 3 years my class has not been severly handicapped. We are not godly, but we also do not have anymore glareing holes. We still have a few issues, but that will always be true for any class.<br>
<br>
In short to verant, fix mitigation damnit! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucslochraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CSLochraven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 8:08:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=418>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gs.cdnow.com/graphics/COVERART/local/L/80/01/00138001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rofl</span><hr size=1> I like the idea about shields.<br>
<br>
Real fighters usually don't &quot;dual wield,&quot; they have a sword and a shield.  <br>
<br>
The problem is that for us to keep aggro with a 1hander and a shield would be either to have the weapon be godly or make taunt much more effective.  Which causes problems with both areas.<br>
<br>
Our damage mitigation should be improved.<br>
<br>
I think our ability to hold aggro is fine.  YES, sometimes the mob will run and hit the shaman.  YES, sometimes the mob will turn and attack the rogue.  YES, you will get some ping pong occasionally.  In an exp group it doesn't matter most of the time.  On raids the MT losing aggro shouldn't even happen often at all if everyone does what they are supposed to do. <p><b>Lochraven<b><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> End result is the warrior class is working as intended and needs no upgrades to stay balanced.

<br>
Its simple why warriors need to be re-balanced:<br>
<br>
We were balanced in with the all other melee classes in SoV era based upon our superior armor and how much melee power and class abilities we had vs the lesser armors, different melee powers and class powers they had.<br>
<br>
Now we no longer have the best gear, instead the same gear is shared by most if not all of the other classes. Warriors lost nothing directly here, however the other classes became as powerful as a warrior in this point.<br>
<br>
The hybrid classes, sans bards, have received the full force of the caster balance without suffering any drawbacks to the melee side of their powers. The healing hybrid classes have also received part of the priest balance as to date. <br>
<br>
So yes the other classes did receive more. Now it is time to give warriors something to restore the balance, the only question left is what.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uchavr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>chavr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 11:13:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=421>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rip</span><hr size=1> Warriors set the standard.  They are 100.  Balancing started to happen.  The hybrids were at 40 or so.  Now hybrids are at 100.  Warriors see this as them losing power.  All that really happened was the huge gap between them closed.<br>
<br>
When adjusting anything to do with mitigation include the knight classes along with the warrior class.  We are the only tanks in the game.<br>
<br>
Someone posted that warriors only bring tanking because their offense was well below the other melee.  Thank you for proving my point about paladins.  We have even less offense then warriors.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer to not be the main tank in a group.  It's not what I enjoy doing.  Sadly there are only two ways I get in a group though.  The first is because of friends/people I've grouped with before.  People know me and know I'm a damn good paladin.  This is probably the majority of my groups now a days.  The second way is when a group is looking for a tank.  Usually in these groups I tank as long as it takes to get a warrior in the group and then let them take over.  At that point I do what I enjoy doing most.  All sorts of different things.<br>
<br>
Before the upgrades luclin brought to us I didn't get groups that needed a tank though.  The only time I got in a non guild group was when there was no one else left lfg in the zone.  I had to be in guild groups and then would meet new people that filled in the holes that developed.  Once these people got to know me and how I played I could get in groups with them again.  It was a very long and drawn out process to make connections in such a way to get a group.<br>
<br>
I fear that if the tank label is once again removed from paladins things will go back to the way they were.  If you ask for adjustments to warriors make sure knights are not left out when it comes to tanking.  <br>
<br>
I can't convey to you the way it used to feel to play a paladin.  I can not get you to understand the frustration one felt some days.  The only reason I got groups remotely easily is because I could eek out every last trick from my class.  There was no other option for me if I hoped for people to invite me again.  Finally though I don't have to be frustrated anymore.  My class has finally come into it's own, and it's only a matter of showing people that paladins are no longer the black sheep we once were.  <br>
<br>
Then I find out about this thread and start reading.  I see warriors saying that paladins are getting groups all the time.  I see warriors complaining because paladins are being picked now for one of the 6 spots in a group.  Warriors are saying they've been left behind.  They are no longer useful.  Warriors should be the only viable option for a tank.  No one else should be able to encroach upon this holiest of holy spots.  Yet, they totally neglect the fact there are 3 plate/tank classes.  They ignore the fact that we are tanks too.  That if warriors are made into the best options for tanks, groups will no longer want us knights.  You say we have utility and that tanking isn't our only option.  You forget that there is almost never a group looking for a utility class.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Do warriors need looking into? Maybe, I honestly couldn't make that opinon.  I am an expert on paladins.  That is who I am and what I know.  When I tell you that placing warriors definitevly above paladins in tanking, again, will hurt us severely, then trust that I am right.  Find a solution to your problem that will not hurt my class along the way.  <br>
<br>
Finaly, remember this.  Even with all the balancing and things done for paladins there is one true statement.  Warriors are still better tanks.  The difference is Paladins now bring enough other things to the table to offset their weaker tanking ability.  Finally we have become even in desirabilty to groups, and now you want to elevate yourselves again. <br>

If you are only 1% better than the next melee, you are STILL better. Point is, everyone is freaking out about Super Monks and Godly Knights, but really...there are a handful of them at BEST on any given server. So there are 2 Monks and 3 Knights on your server that are better than a 60 Warrior? So f*cking what??? Are they fighting with you over every xp group/raid you try to get into? And NO, there aren't going to be hundreds of them in the next few months. Those that are Godly are going to be rare. Why? Warriors usually get the best gear first, and if you don't...thats between you and your guild (or your DKP). <br>
Hybrids are just fine. The Melee classes are the ones that are screwed up (Warrior-Monk-Rogue). Rangers and Rogues own DPS over Warriors..but wear Chain and have far fewer HPs. Monks are the sh*t when it comes to avoidance (which is a game design flaw). Knights are close to Warriors but do less damage. And they Do have less Hps. Not as less as a Bard-Rngr-Rogue, but less. And the object of the game is to do damage to the mob &amp; kill it (raid or xp grp) before it kills you. Currently, Warriors &gt; All for Hps. It shouldn't be too hard to code some Mobs to have thier own damage tables relative to AC (damage mitigation). Some zones like CT-Deep-Acrylia Cavs are very Warrior-friendly. Other places, its fine to have a Knight or Rngr to MA for Xp. Never should a Monk MA, regardless of thier mitigation. Lack of any triggerable agro is what disqualifies them. As an example, take a lvl 51 Shammy into Pit Spiders in Velks. I would rather have a Ranger or Knight MA to keep the resist agro null and void. But that is an exception, the rule is generally to get a Warrior and appropriate levels around them. *Note: If any of you wish to quote anymore, post the whole quote...stop taking sh*t out of context*<br>
<br>
Now, to get back to the original theme of this thread: I see no reason for Offense/Defense upgrades to Warriors. (/duck) What I DO see a need for is some utility based in the offensive/defensive realms. Don't want to have Warriors replacing any other classes, as no other classes are replacing them (contrary to popular belief). Some long duration Stuns/short duration Debuffs could be some cool skills under offense. Some improvements vs certain weapon types (higher mitigation or avoidance vs 1hb, 1hp, ect..buy em in AA) could be some cool defensive skills to implement. Try to think of something besides just jacking up the scale of a game that is currently f*cked up. All you would get then is a game thats f*cked up with higher numbers.<br>
<br>

With equal quality gear, in XP groups :<br>
- Paladins/SKs handle mobs better (aggro management), and tanks almost like a warrior... And almost is, for paladins/sks that know to play, very near of warriors' tanking capacity.<br>
- Monks have some problems to initiate aggro (only the first swings) but he can aggro well only with their damage output (and their insane weapons that proc stun like hell), and they tank better than warrior. With equal gear. Not that they absorb damages better, but they take less hit. The only problem is that a monk is more difficult to heal than a warrior (monks' hp diminution are quite erratic). That's all.<br>
<br>
On raids :<br>
- The only advantage to warriors over other tanks is 2 disciplines : Evasive, and Defensive. Their duration is about 3min. On Luclin mobs, 3min mean nothing.<br>
- I'm curious to know how many warriors are MT's so they have to use defensive/evasive, and how many are only damages dealers, so they have *NOTHING*. I am lucky : I am MT.<br>
- With godly weapons (for instance, the 1HB 40 damage, 35 delay, from Grieg's End, easy to get for a non-Vindi capable guild !), damage output for paladins (I don't know well for SKs) is almost... or maybe more than warriors one. *with equal difficulty gear* (try to list warriors' only weapons dropped on mobs that are on the same difficulty than for paladins' one, and take a good laugh).<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong. I don't want damage increase. I don't want nerfs on other classes. I don't want to be able to solo some dragon.<br>
I only want to do my job : to be the meat shield and actually to have tools to assume this role.<br>
And I want to be UNIQUE. I *WANT* to have something, even if not really useful (like criticals before AA), that makes a warrior not only an ersatz of a paladin/sk.<br>
Now, our class ability only resume to this : Defensive. <br>

My friend paladin who I gerouped with has 3600 base hps, he is not uber.  He is wearing full SS armour, has some decent weapons and miscellaneous stuff.  <br>
<br>
As a contrast, I have full warlord (NTOV) armour excluding bracer(champions/SS), Helm(SS), BP(Cobalt), I duel wield epics, have a CoF and some decent supplimentary stuff.  <br>
<br>
He has 200-300hps more than me. <br>
<br>
He is not uber, I am considered to be more uber than him. <br>
<br>
If we are 1% better than any other tank, then we are still better ? Sure we are, but you are so single minded as to not realise.....HELLOOOO!!!! We dont get FD, we dont get celestial heal, SOW, Snare, DoTS, Ressurection.  <br>
<br>
EVEN IF we were 1% better than everyone else at doing OUR job, I would personally have a paladin anyday of the week.  They hold aggro better anyway and can heal themselves.<br>
<br>
What class are youagain ??? You mention zones such as CT are much more friendly for warriors.  <br>
<br>
Question:  Have you ever been a warrior in CT ? <br>
<br>
Allow me to demonstrate a warriors life in CT...Puller brings something in(could be warrior), cleric heals - aggro to cleric - warriors fights for aggro off cleric - cleric DAs, warrior has aggro, Ench tashes and slows(if you dont have a shaman), mob goes for enchanter and bashes ench until it has around 50% life back.  Warrior finally gets aggro when mob at 50% then it ping pongs between the melees(and possibly cleric). <br>
<br>
This equates to around 40-50% of the overall warrior's point of view in CT.  <br>
<br>
Granted I dont have brilliant weapons, but they are better than most of my level.  So, if I have trouble what about a warrior with &lt; weapons than me.  <br>
<br>
Sorry bud but your FoS (and I have provided you with enough evidence to support this)<br>

<br>
Completely incorrect.  Sorry.  The point is not to make Warriors the ONLY viable tank class.  Paladins and Shadow Knights will still retain their status versus the mobs.  The point is to make Warriors significantly better at absorbing damage that if you have a Warrior and Paladin standing side by side in exactly equal gear and you need someone who will main tank, you'll pick the Warrior.  Because thats all we do and all we can do.<br>
<br>
If we can't do it significantly enough better than the Knights  and Monks, then why have a Warrior when you can get a Knight with their additional spell abilities?  Or a Monk with their additional pulling abilities?<br>
<br>
Granted, Knights probably get the majority of their groups because of their ability to tank.  But the point is they CAN do other things.  A Warrior can't.<br>
<br>
So yes, all other things being equal, a Warrior should clearly be the better tanking choice.  But Knights should still be able to do the job.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uthorena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 10:22:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=428>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  dont understand</span><hr size=1> I really don't understand the warriors complaint.  <br>

Warriors have trouble getting agro but fact is you pay for that difficulty by having higher hps ac and dps.  <br>

Sorry warrriors are still the best tanks you may have trouble getting and holding agro but you have skills that offest that difficulty.  The only difference now is that when the group is generated next time and that warrrior isnt around the paladin can fill in.  When groups start taking a paladin 5 or more lvls lower then a warrior that is avaiable then you can complain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhulanta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hulanta</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 11:12:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=429>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: dont understand</span><hr size=1> If I am in Sebilis and I can choose 2 guildmates of any class to group with me to kill, (pretend that I am any class), If I have a shaman, I would pick a warrior.  If I have a wizard, I pick the pally.  If I have a monk, I pick an enchanter...<br>
<br>
Basically, what I am saying is that it becomes vary situational.  At the level 60 with lots of aaxp part of the game, pallies are great healers for zones where the mobs do very little damage because they can tank AND heal.  If you have a shaman with torpor, the pally is probably not needed for healing, and maybe a warrior is a better choice, or a rogue, or a monk...  <br>
<br>
I have ALWAYS believed that you can throw any 6 players of any classes of similar levels together and get decent experience in some zone (exception being 6 clerics).<br>
<br>
Duoing with a pally is pretty good experience.  Duoing with another warrior isn't nearly as good.  Duoing with a monk makes me feel pretty stupid because the monk can tank weak mobs much easier than I can.<br>
<br>
Pallies can be tanks for groups.  But they can also be the crowd control for a group.  Or they can be the group's healer.  Or they can be the damage dealer if undead is your target.<br>
<br>
Warriors can be tanks for groups.<br>
<br>
Because of this distinct difference, warriors do truly need to have an edge on tanking mobs.  I don't mind seeing pallies being the tank for a group.  But I should be better at it since I can't do crowd control or be a group's healer.<br>
<br>
I am one-dimensional.  I chose it.  I wanted to be a tank.  I wanted to be the one taking the beating.  <br>
<br>
Pallies CHOSE to be multi-faceted.  Pallies knew when they became pallies that they were going to have spell casting abilities.  They knew that they were going to have some advantages versus undead.  They had to have known that since they had these advantages that their tanking ability would have to be less than warriors.<br>
<br>
Warrior vs Paladin should be a dead issue.  Both classes chose what they would be.  The only difference is that besides some extra hps, warriors are now not that much better than a paladin for tanking.  If my cleric can sit there full mana in an experience group and start nuking like crazy to ease the boredom on an experience grind, then it doesn't matter if I am tanking or a pally. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20383">Hulanta</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 11:19:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=430>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  ROFL</span><hr size=1> &quot;If paladins are so overpowerded how come when sleeper key time comes several warriors will have keys before paladins. &quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps for the following reasons?<br>
<br>
- Warriors will generally GREATLY outnumber Paladins<br>
<br>
- BECAUSE Warrior taunt is screwed, warriors need as much prosthetic help as they can get to generate aggro, and Avatar helps this<br>
<br>
- BECAUSE warrior defense is not up to par, dead warriors are a fact of life and backup tanks need the same prosthetic help as above to maintain taunt.<br>
<br>
Warriors don't get primal weapons because of strict DPS additions, they get it because Avatar helps us in maintaining aggro by adding +100 Atk, and Maxing proc possibilities.  In ohter words we get it because we're broken as a class.<br>
