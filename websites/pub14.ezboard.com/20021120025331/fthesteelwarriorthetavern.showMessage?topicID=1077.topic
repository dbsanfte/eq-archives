I admit that I have little tolerance for foolishness.  I have an even lower tolerance for biase and bigotry.  Most folks who read my posts see that I am a big advocate here for fairness and equality. Most folks here know that I do not go out of my way to cause conflict or provoke an argument.<br>

Will this post be mysteriously deleted because it does not attempt to sweep things under the carpet?<br>

How sad is it that I would even wonder such a thing.<br>

<br>
One was the opinions on what people wanted to see done with the threads and stickying them; began working on one in word using the layout of what Adex started ( still there; copying and pasting notes from it )<br>
<br>
2nd one was the whole thing with the contest for new mod there. I decided to have a bit of fun with all the conspiracy rumors people have or still hang onto about the whole thing ( c'mon, it came down to a dice roll. deal with it. don't like it; eh...nothing i can do about it )<br>
<br>
Besides that; nope. haven't touched a thing there besides editing my typo errors on replies. <br>
<br>
If those are the answers you want; there ya go. In writing.<br>
Also, since you found your way here you saw the thread I started here on the conspiracy theorys you all made up; so Xexys can watch the whole thing and there'd be nothing I could do about it.

I couldn't be more disgusted if I tried.  What a joke.  A dice roll on a message board?  Making fun of people for having different opinions then yours and calling them conspiracy theories?  /boggle<br>

<br>
Five,<br>
I've always respected you. I thought of you as one tough cookie who'd never back down from anything.<br>
I never would have thought you had personal issues aainst me. I never would have thought you'd walk away from something you've been a part of for so long so easily.<br>
Got a problem with me being a mod? Tell Jaikar. He'll take me off the Mod list. /shrug. It's just a game. So what if I don't get to be Moderator. I'm not going to lose sleep over it. Even if Aniela or CJ would want it ( I talk to CJ most nights in game and he's really cool; I've seen Aniela a few times but she's usually logging off as I log on or the opposite ) i'd gladly pass it onto them. Us 3 at the end came down to what it did because, well, I don't know. Jaikar's been spending less and less time here; perhaps even in EQ itself; and just wanted to leave it to the people who have been here from the early days of the boards. Everyone started screaming &quot;no more half elves&quot; and I personally though it was funny ( c'mon, everyone loathes half elves. Except us Half Elves ourself ). So I decided to have fun with it. I'm a big X-Files fan and love all this conspiracy rumour stuff. Don't like my sense of humor? Tell me. Don't like my controversial personality? Tell me. I'm probabally the most controversial person you've ever run across ( ask anyone in my guild or on terris thule or even here ) and it's just my personality. I live life by one rule : &quot; If people can't talk about you, you must lead a boring life&quot;. Don't like my personality? Tell Me. Tell Jaikar. Don't come here suggesting that Jaikar did something when you damn well knew you wanted to say you knew it was me. I got more respect for someone who can tell me to my face what they think of me than some random innuendos of alleged actions taken from somewhere. <br>
<br>
If you got a problem with me being a Guy or somehow harbouring all the Bigotry or Immaturity or whatever you've accused me of than tell me flat out and tell Jaikar to remove me. Either way I know i'll be here; either trying to keep the Bunker Neat and trying to organize the years of information there or sitting back here in the Tavern drinking a Cold Ale with Xexys, Talic, and Garyen enjoying the game and our lives out of it.<br>
<br>
But either way i'm not going anywhere. I dealt with it. I suggest for all your friends here that you do the same because, along with myself; I'd hate to see you go.<br>
<br>
You've become a part of the Place. And no matter what you decide to take with you when you go you'll always have something left here with everyone; a Lot of Great Memories. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ujustfive.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Just Five</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/13/02 10:50:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1077.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Posts being deleted?</span><hr size=1> 1.  I have nothing against you, personally, Shik. I could care less what sex you are IRL, how old you are IRL, what stupid pixel represents you in EQ. Get it straight. I don't need to have any emotional investment in a person to understand and point out when they do something wrong or should not be doing what they are doing.  I will just as quickly tell a friend they are screwing up as I would someone I didn't care for at all.<br>
<br>
2.  I feel you were a poor choice as you do not demonstrate the abilities a good mod has, the ability to *not* touch anything they shouldn't.<br>
<br>
3.  This is Jaik's board. If he doesn't want the responsibility anymore, than he knows he can either leave it to pasture away or transfer ownership to someone else. I have an EZboard of my own as well as moderate others, so I'm more than aware of what can and can not be done. As to the actual fairness of how mod's were chosen, please, the &quot;magic&quot; dice thing was &quot;cute&quot; but anyone who thought the result would be actually fair was fooling themselves.<br>
<br>
4. &quot;Cleaning&quot; up the Bunker seemed to only include deleting posts about your being a moderator.  Please do not insult my intellect by coming up with lame excuses.<br>
<br>
5.  Favoritism is rampant in life, I certainly do not see why it should be any different here.  Point is, we were lead to believe that would not be the case here. We were lead to believe that actual *abilities* and *temperament* would be taken into account. We weren't told that any jackass with an EZboard account since the day they started up was going to be a factor.<br>
<br>
6.  I've &quot;spoken&quot; to Jaik via email once in the past, about getting spam mail from him because his contacts had somehow gotten a virus via Allakazams.  If you hadn't jumped right in with some incredibly heavy-handed things, making it painfully obvious that you didn't understand what being a mod was really about, then I wouldn't have made any comment at all, let alone think of emailing Jaik.<br>

Being a mod takes a lot of work. I have had a few sites of my own and with an EZboard integrated there. But it's quite clear that this board has lots of half elf favoritism. I mean... we are warriors... we play the most dependant of all others class in the game. We do it cause (I hope in most cases) we love getting beaten to pulp by godforsaken mobs 10 levels higher than us. We come in all sizes but in the end we are just as good the next man. (Even though some get punted.)<br>
<br>
Would I have had better chance becoming a mod if I played a half elf? Maybe. Would I have had a better chance if - god forbid - I had called my warrior something else and chosen to play a male character? Dunno really. High heels in real life don't make me a worse warrior. They just give extra edge in kicking shins.<br>
<br>
Ah well, I'm supposed to be on a PoH raid and not reading the boards.

This wasn't directed towards you **<br>
<br>
Hmm, okay Five. Let's start here with a rebuttal towards all your points you've made :<br>
<br>
1. Point Well Taken. I can tell by your tone of post and obvious feeling of superiority over someone else you're clearly not harbouring any resentment at all. Glad you can take this all in stride. <br>
<br>
2. Nope; I have never been a moderator on an EZBoard. Never for a direct game brand or title. I'd be glad if you allowed yourself the time to tell me what makes a Good Moderator. Tell me what it is. Is it a stance where you're first words do not take a defensive tone? Is it clearly not letting said topic hold any personal issues? Or is it in light of carrying someone elses cross around to champion a cause for freedom or some other horseshit of that nature? Please, give it a rest. Put that cross down you've been lugging around and carrying all this repressed feelings of anger. I'm just me. No one cares what the hell I have moderated; nor do I feel the validity to show you or anyone else a college degree on human relations to be a moderator. It's a game, remember? You drive that point to the point of exhaustion yet you use that at your platform to convict others.<br>
<br>
3. You honestly think there was some kind of biased opinion before Jaikar did the magic dice thing about who was going to be mod? Jeez. Now you put Jaikar and I and all the others here in a bad light. Call for a Re-Roll. Impeach my ass. Send me packing and Ban me. Christ; burn me at the stake. Funny part was I honestly would have thought Aniela or CJ would have won. If they want it, than I will repeat myself; Give them the job. I'll high-five them to Heaven's Gate because it's all just a Game and they can do a fine job with it. I think they are both wonderful people and only wish I could hat with them more while online. <br>
<br>
4. Cleaning the place up. As I previously posted; I deleted the 2 threads ( one which I started <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> myself</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on what people would think of what could improve the forum; the other was the Infamous Dice Roll Thread ). Did you want to have proof later on about what happened; or were you still looking for hidden clues to a make believe scam set up to make me a mod? You tell me. Now I wish I hadn't deleted it; but rather just moved it here because the thread had <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> no relevance to The Bunker forum except for who was going to mod it</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Did it belong there any longer than what it did? In my opinion, No. It was a closed Topic. Should have just been locked after Jaikar picked the new Mod. Or let him delete it. <br>
<br>
5. Favoritism. Try substituting it with Jealousy on your part. Sure as hell sounds like it. I know too that no matter what happens after this my friends here will still be my friends, and my enemies will still be my enemies. Such is life. Friends know when to congratulate the others on doing something good. You've; since I've opened my mouth about becoming a mod; thought I wouldn't be good ( in your opinion ) at being a mod here; yet you just left innuendos towards picking others. It would have been nice to just come straight out and say &quot; if he wins i'm leaving&quot; since it was your intentions from the get-go. Correct me if I am wrong.<br>
<br>
6. See my reply to point 2 that you made. Being so quick to prove me wrong; I hold You responsible for fixing the subject you feel so inclined to comment on. Does that make me a good mod in your eyes? Either way the sun's going to rise again tomorrow. I just feel that I've served some great injustice to the community according to your accusations and if you want to be the Judge of my integrity of character I hold you responsible for it's outcome.<br>
<br>
Either that or just let it go. Funny how CJ haven't said a thing about it besides a thanks for the fun and if I needed help with anything to talk to him.<br>
<br>
So, to Aniela and CJ; I am sorry this came to this and this whole thing became so tainted with lies and such.

Can someone please explain slowly what exactly the problem is and why. I myself do not see any problem with the deletion of two threads that normally have nothing to do with the forum they're in. Or at least the locking of. Are there other missing threads? Or was there something in those threads that you feel Shik is trying to quell? Please explain.<br>

one down from that was from Grimmlokk<br>

Unfortunately the only thing I can do here is Lock a topic, or delete it for content / lack of content / blood in my alcohol system. I'd have to report it to Jaikar to ban by name / ip address<br>
<br>
<br>
This is all from my somewhat cloudy memory. Than about 15 minutes after that I reached the conclusion that the whole thread no longer held relevance to the Bunker and decided it's seen the light of Day enough.<br>
<br>
The other post I started was on what people would liek to see with the Bunker; I offered to make a AC'HP benchmark per 10 levels or so up to 50.<br>
Than some suggested that It would help to have UI's listed.<br>
Than someone linked the UI's to Garyen's forum ( he mentioned he'd sticky it )<br>
Than smushums said he'd wish there was as sticky forum so he could skip it<br>
Than I ( evil that I am ) told him i'd make the whole 1st page stickied to mess with him.<br>
Than started to make a page in MS Word and add the stuff from Adex's Thread to make it less congested and deleted the topic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utalicmoore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talic Moore</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/images/icons/Yin_Yang.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hero of the Realms</BR>Guardian of the Keep</BR>STEEL WARRIOR Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1041<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/13/02 12:06:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1077.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eyesonff.com/ff1/fighter.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Posts being deleted?</span><hr size=1> I would, at this moment in time, like to interject my singular thought/comment/witty invective for the day, after which, I will leave everyone to their thoughts.<br>

Aniela, please, honestly, do you really believe there is half-elven favoritism here? That isn't a rhetorical question, I am openly curious. I recall Jaikar *not-knowing* all the moderators, when chosen, were half-elves. He was surprised. Perhaps I am merely a naive and silly individual who holds idealistic dreams of honor, respect, and compassion within the ranks of warriors as a truth, rather than a hope, but perhaps not.<br>
<br>
And now, I resign the podium to those more affluent than I, so that they might, in the throes of righteous and passionate speech, enlighten one so humble as Talic... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 525<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/13/02 12:11:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1077.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Posts being deleted?</span><hr size=1> I have it ! <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Now then, what was the question?<br>
<br>
Is something wrong with Shik as a mod because he is easily manipulated deletes things and likes to stick his nose into allot of places?<br>
<br>
Well you know and I know that the best mods are the ones that read what is in their forums and respond to what people say there, with a reply or sometimes locking or deletion of a thread.<br>
<br>
Is something wrong with someone else not being a mod because they do not play a game with a type of character?<br>
<br>
We all know this is a Warrior board so no person that only plays a Ranger or a High elf will never be a mod here.<br>
<br>
Is it wrong for someone to be a mod of because the owner of the boards happens to be an old friend of theirs?<br>
<br>
I wouldn't let some stranger come in and be a mod my forums, I would pick someone I knew I could trust.<br>
<br>
Is a dice roll on a forum a cheesy gimmick to solve a problem quickly? <br>
<br>
Yes, but sometimes things have to get done ASAP.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170513">Varaho Carnicero</a>

Jimbob, there isn't one good reason for you to request removal of your status.<br>
<br>
Not a one.<br>
<br>
Sounds to me like some people here have a major case of &quot;Luigi Syndrome&quot;.<br>
<br>
You were picked. As far as I'm concerned, you should have been picked the first time around, but I don't even know if you applied for a position or not, so I'll leave that alone.<br>
<br>
You were, and still are, the most qualified for the job. Yeah, you got the standard &quot;I know how to do your job better than you.&quot;-esque replies, but hell, we all get em, for everything.<br>
<br>
To the folks who believe that you were stepped over because you don't play a half-elf, or because you're female, or disabled, or homosexual, or have purple hair... grow up. Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
The fact that all of us play Half Elves in game has nothing to do with it. Hell, I don't even play Xexys anymore. I play a Dark Elf Shadowknight. It's common knowledge.<br>
<br>
As for the argument on &quot;I guess the date which your EZboard account was created counts for something&quot;.... no, it doesn't. But your seniority and post counts do.<br>
<br>
Shik's been here for two plus years. He's got more posts than anyone, everyone knows him.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but casually posting on the board for three months means dick.<br>
<br>
I'm really sick and tired of all the bleeding-heart bullshit that goes on around here.<br>
<br>
Oh, you abuse your moderator powers. Oh, they only pick half elves as moderators. They're biased against me because I'm in the minority aisle.<br>
<br>
Grow the hell up. You didn't get picked because there was someone more qualified for the job.<br>
<br>
Jaikar shouldn't even have rolled a dice for ya. Shikarii's been here since the dawn of time. He's paid his dues.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the bottom line sums it up quite nicely. If you don't like it, leave. It's that simple.<br>
