<br>
This is a story about a brave band of adventurers who heard about a dragon stronghold in the ravines of the western wastes. These people called themselves Ascent and bravely set forth on their expidition. It was not long till they found a ominous entrance guarded by several dragons and they decided that this must be the place of ledgends. Out manuvering they moved into the fortess of dragon kind.<br>
<br>
First they encountered several types of drakes but they were no match for these hardy adventurers as they moved deeper into the depths of this temple. It was not long untill they reached a band of hardy wyverns that provided a challange but no match for the party but as their were soon to find out, the wyverns had a leader known as ikitiar the stinger. Battle commenced and the wyvren was slain without too much loss. Next they came upon a drake called eashen. His breath was cold and his teeth were sharp but yet again he fell before the steadly advancing party. A little further in they came to a lair of a huge dragon on a size what they had never seen before. A Challange he was taking a few attempts before he fell to our swords, little did we know that that would be one of the hardest fights for a while. <br>
<br>
Carefully the adventures crept forward and came under attack by drakes that attacked with lightening speed, but these too fell to the wayside as we advanced. Lord fleshlak and dagarn were the next two dragons to fall and it was decided to set up camp for the night. <br>
<br>
The next day they party began again quickly felling lady nevederia, jelloreg, zlexlax, koi doken, lord kriszen, lady mire, and others till just Vyemm and Vulak remained. Camp was set up again and the final push would commence the next day.<br>
<br>
As day broke the adventures prepared themselves for the toughest tests yet and set forth to slay the remaining two dragons. Vyemm was the first target and a challange he was twarting our efforts twice to fell him. A third attempt was called and we were about to commence battle when an emergancy siren went off. A cataclymic event was about to hit the world in around 15 minutes and everyone was suggested to find a safe spot to weather out this tradegy. However We knew no fear and decided to go ahead with the third attempt anyway, calling for helm from the gods to delay the impending danger to the world.<br>
<br>
As we engaged Lord Vyemm a god appered and watched the battle. As the battle raged on it became apperant there was only 1 outcome and vyemm fell, minutes before the danger to the world was due to hit. The god assured us that we would be safe if we camped there so we did.<br>
<br>
After the event we met up with the god again who decided that we would be allowed to have the chance at vulak that we had earned and he removed the resurrected dragons and wished us luck. We thanked him for his kindness and prepared for the final battle.<br>
<br>
Vulak was engaged and the battle raged on. for 5 minutes the combined force of 60 adventures wore down this great dragon, 10 minutes and the fight was still raging. 15 minutes and Vulak was starting to look the worse for wear.<br>
<br>
Finally after over 20 minuted he finally took his last breath and fell to the feet of his competitiors. Vulak was slain!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
(OOC: Vulak was killed for the first time on rodect nife last night by a band of 60 ascent members/recruits. Drops were Shoulders, robe and druid arms. For full ooc info goto www.ascentguild.com. HUGE thanks go to GM-Ozuri and to Jeff Butler without whom this would not have been possable last night, due to server reset.)<br>
