Seventh, you asked how often I see no warriors in a zone? I RARELY see more than one or two warriors in a zone at a time. Warriors are MEANT to be the clearly superior tank no ifs, ands, or buts about it. I play a monk and if I was lfg in a zone and a warror was too then I would EXPECT the warrior to get chosen first because a warrior should be the best choice for a tank. In the absence of a warrior though paladins, sks, and monks will do just fine. That is how the whole order of things was meant to be from the day eq was released! Yes btw, monks WERE included as tanking classes right from the beginning. Let me quote a line from the monk description in the kunark strategy guide.<br>
&quot;Monks are great TANKS and great pullers, so if there is another puller in the party take turns to keep things interesting.&quot;<br>
Sorry but I had to throw that in for all the warriors and pallys who think that monks came out of nowhere to become skilled tanks lol. Back on subject, paladins no longer suck as tanks, quite the contrary, but warriors are meant to be THE tank of choice. At the high end game the advantage of ac no longer exists and the hp advantage has been shrunk to the point where its only one single hit by a ubermob apart. That is just plain wrong. No other class, monks included, should be nearly as good at tanking as a warrior.<br>

<br>
Don't assume that warriors in high end guild are idiots and that we need to be told by you or 7 that we should switch to high end 2h for DPS when we don't MT.  Somethings are just a given.<br>
<br>
You also need to understand that warriors can't use the same uber 2h that are available to hybrids.  It's my understanding from my guildmates who've bothered to parse that warrior and paladins/sk DPS come out to about the same number(warriors have higher skill cap, hybrids have better weapons).  <br>
<br>
So then the question is, what good is that non MT warrior doing your guild?  Compared to a paladin that can keep his group alive without any help from a cleric that's in CH rot anyways and still puts out the same DPS as a warrior, that warrior is a dead weight.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to be blunt, but at 52, you simply don't have the experience necessary to contribute to the discussion about balance at the end game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uraluvinssteele.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raluvin Ssteele</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/22/02 7:23:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=583>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Aragir</span><hr size=1> Thoric, <br>

<br>
Thoric makes an important point here.  One that has been implied but not said directly.  When putting together a guild primarily for raiding purposes, currently you will have a number of Warriors.  Only one will be the main tank, but if he drops you want some back up.  So perhaps you take 4 or 6 Warriors with you, if you have them.<br>
<br>
If Warriors are no longer the main tank of choice, for whatever reason, do you want 6 characters that do similar damage to a Paladin but require their own healers in any situation where they might take some colateral damage?  Or would you fill their slots with Paladins?  Or, if you felt you had plenty of Paladins, wouldn't you fill their slots with Rogues?  Get the point?  With nothing to add but damage, the damage a Warrior brings isn't enough to justify their participation. <br>
<br>
Do you take Paladins on a raid because of their uber damage output?  No, you take them for brells and their various heals, their damage output is a bonus.  Do you take a Warrior on a raid for their uber damage output?  No, you take them for their ability to tank, their damage output is a bonus.  Take away a Paladin's heals, and he won't be wanted on a raid.  Take away a Warrior's tanking advantage and he won't be wanted on a raid.<br>
<br>
Hell, if I was setting up a raid and Paladins and Monks tanked as well as a Warrior, I'd bring nothing but Paladins and Monks because of the heals, buffs, damage output, and FD pulling.  And I would fill any left over melee slots with Rogues and maybe a couple of Rangers.<br>
<br>
And the tanking advantage for Warriors has eroded.  That is a fact. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/22/02 7:42:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=585>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Thoric</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm sorry to be blunt, but at 52, you simply don't have the experience necessary to contribute to the discussion about balance at the end game.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

LOL yeah, I get that a lot, here and at the paladins of Norrath.<br>

But here's the thing.  If you can't explain it to me and persuade me (who has no experience at the end game, and freely admits it), then don't expect to persuade anyone who's been there, seen it, and done it, but has a different opinion.<br>

PS You think warriors are dead weight because they aren't main tank?  How do you suppose a paladin feels when there's a warrior to main tank, a cleric to heal, and a druid to spot heal?<br>
<br>
What does the paladin do in the above situation?  He off tanks, he adds more spot heals, he acts as backup tank and backup support healer.<br>

What should an extra warrior be doing?  Trying to maximize his DPS, I would think?And be ready to take over as main tank if need be?  I get the point that all you think you do is tank, but that's just not true.

Once again, let me point out that the issues I'm addressing concern the end game.  I haven't been less than 60 in well over a year and a half so I'm no authority when it comes to xp groups in 50s.<br>
<br>
All I know is, the warriors in their 50s feel they are becoming marginalized and having looked at various PoN threads gloating over your superiority to warriors, I can only accept this complaint as true and makes sense to me anyways since far superior aggro control, heal and cc with good tanking is better for xp groups than slightly better tanking with nothing else to contribute.<br>
<br>
Now, concerning the end game, there is no doubt that paladins are preferred over non MT tanks for the reasons I outlined in my earlier post.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps you understand the situation better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thoric>Thoric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/22/02 8:17:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=587>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Raluvin</span><hr size=1> Defensive/evasive has relevance for non MT warriors how?

<br>
Here is the premise.  The Warriors are NOT main tanking at all.  None of them.  Not a single one.  Because it has been determined that a Paladin or Monk can take the damage within an acceptable margin and hold better agro.  So your tanking line up consists completely of Paladins and Monks.  This is the hypothetical scenario.<br>
<br>
If Warriors are completely and utterly NOT your first choice, for tanking the boss mob, does their DPS justify their participation?  Think about it.  All the tanking will be done by Paladins and Monks.  If you are talking damage output, wouldn't those Warriors, who AREN'T in the MT rotation, be better off as Rogues?<br>
<br>
There are four factors to a successful raid, for the most part.  DPS, healing power, debuffs and damage absorbtion.  You pack your ranks with the best of each you can find, as a rule.  For healing power you take Clerics.  For damage absorbtion, currently you take Warriors.  For DPS you take Wizards, Rogues, Monks, Rangers.  You throw in a few Paladins for the combined value of their DPS and their healing power.  You throw in a few secondary healers.  You take Shamen and Enchanters for their debuffs.  You take a couple of each of the other classes to contribute those things unique and desirable from their class.  You've got a raid force.<br>
<br>
Neither Warriors nor Paladins are on a raid because of their outstanding DPS.  The Paladins are their for their DPS, their Heals, and ability to tank when needed.  Warriors are there for the ability to tank and their DPS.  Take away the Warrior's tanking and his DPS alone is jack.  Get Rogues instead.  Replace ALL the Warriors with Rogues.  Get it?<br>
<br>
The only reason you take more than one Warrior on a raid now is because there is a chance the MT might drop.  Not because their DPS is that attractive.  If the class of Warriors aren't MTing, YOU DON'T WANT THEM.  At least not from an efficiency stand point.<br>

<br>
Balth above underlined/agreed that the only difference between warriors/hybrids above.  <br>
<br>
When your fighting any mob whatsoever at the  mid/high end or even end game, it is all down to healing efficiency and making sure your victorious.  <br>
<br>
Even IF the paladins have more hps/ac than your warrior defensive/evasive = greater for healing efficiency.   <br>
<br>
Examples of this:  Vindi, Vaniki, Ikithar the Venom, Dain etc.<br>
<br>
Any more than 4 warriors in a raid is utterly pointless, as all they are doing is waiting a) for their turn to MT and b) to deal with rampages.  <br>
<br>
Any paladin/SK/monk can of course deal with Rampages np anyway.  <br>
<br>
However, I understand that PoP is gonna introduce blocking with shields.  Do we use shields ? no...<br>
<br>
Why dont we use shields ? because we need the damage output to hold aggro.  <br>
<br>
Who uses shields ? ohhhh Paladins and SKs - so it looks like another upgrade is around the corner for them increasing their defensive capabilities.  <br>
<br>
Because then the hybrid tanks get the ability to block as well as having moreorless comparibable HPs/AC and they hold aggro better than warriors - what exactly is our place then ???? <br>
<br>
Will the block skill negate our defensive abilities ? <br>
<br>
If so, then we will definitely become obsolete.<br>
<br>
Then its a case of breaking out the bandages, cos we are useless as tanks then. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugeppoleadbelly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geppo Leadbelly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/23/02 6:30:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=592>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The State of Warriors in EQ</span><hr size=1> Ok so no offense to some of you, but stop bitching and whining about any more than 4 warriors is useless and suggest something to make them less useless offensively.<br>
<br>
for example:<br>
Aaxp ideas:<br>
All that we have left for our glitz and glamour as far as I can tell, however small that may be, is our crippling blows, so first lets focus on that. However, in the end game by the time we can do Crips and not MT'ing we have low health aggro and will die. therefore:<br>
<br>
How about suggesting aaxp that (A) increases the percentage at which we start doing crips; ie, first point raises it to 60%, second 80%, third 100%, etc. along with this might be something tie'd to that (B) have another 3 pt ability which raises the max crip we can do, what is it currently 3x normal damage for a crip, raise it to 3.25, 3.5, then 4x or 3.5, 4x, 5x. I dont know just throwing out numbers<br>
<br>
Another Suggestion for a Aaxp if its possible (I dont know to what extent VI can, or is willing to program) is make a Aaxp basically at which we can drive ourselves into a berserker rage at will, so basically a on/off toggle, (off = normal). When on, we gain basically something to the effect of an atk buff via ability (say maybe +100atk /shrug), and maybe do crips instead of crits no matter the health, BUT at the cost of a severe defensive penalty while in rage mode on. This would basically make any more than the required tanks into a class that would now be a &quot;Berserker&quot; persay and basically make them a damage dealer. If possible have a &quot;cool-down&quot; period of 10-15 minutes which would be another downside of just turning it off and jumping into tanking. To keep it balancing and all.<br>
<br>
honestly, for a class thats supposed to be strong and take situations by the horn and take control of it, there's a lot of whiners out there.<br>

<br>
Back on page 10 or so someone mentioned something about how could a headband have 40 ac and how could a warrior in full plate be expected to be dodging. Couple of things about plate and ac. First of all, it's a common misconception that plate is heavy...it really isn't. Chain is actually much heavier than plate (having worn armor before at SEA events/Ren Fests, I can attest to this personally). Plate is actually much lighter than chain and in many cases leather armor and the padding that go with it, and has been since the advent of the blast furnace in the 1200's. It just looks heavy, so Hollywood has always portrayed it as such and now everyone expects that it is. Second of all, there is a misconception about AC. Most of this game is loosely based off of the original D&amp;D/Dragonlance concepts for classes and gear. AC isn't just something that causes a character to be missed outright. It is also the armor turning blows, and thus what ac &quot;does&quot; takes to forms...it's sort of a catch all to explain many of the details of how damage is avoided in combat, without having to make 20 different skill checks. For the monk, the mystical headband makes somehow easier for them to do the Jackie Chan thing and use the best defense of No Be There. For the plate classes, it's the ability of the armor to turn a blow, ala most of the fighting in the movie Excalibur.<br>
<br>
That being said, I have a different perspective than alot of the views that have been posted by alot of the warriors here. Most of the discussion and counterpoints have been talking about end game and very high level equipment. I'm currently lvl 59 and probably will remain so for a very long time. I'm in a fairly large guild with about 150 members, but one with very limited raiding capabilities due to many factors...we just took down Vindi for the first time and are pretty pleased with ourselves and although we haven't takend down Doz yet, we do own the rest of HoT and have done rhag1 and 2 etc. Our guild is filled with people who are there as a group of friends who happen to raid from time to time, so alot of this discussion about &quot;Would you want a second warrior for a raid...&quot; etc doesn't apply to us because we'll take the second warrior and anyone else who wants to come along because we're friends and we're here to have fun. This isn't a knock on raiding guilds, we just aren't one. I will never be in a raiding guild no matter how bad ass i get or want to be because I can't make the commitment to raid that is usually the price of admission. If I want to take on the big boys, I just join another raid and contend with the likelihood that I will not ever get the prime loot, and just enjoy the fun of the takedown, which I do from time to time.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my main point. I have, like many here, watched the steady errosion of my utility since Kunark came out (yes, I've been playing since the pre kunark days and still am not level 60). All of the points made here with regard to endgame warriors are very valid and concern me just as much as it does those that posted them. However, the majority of the players on just about every server are Not in one of the uber raiding guilds and probably never will be. Therefore, the assertions that there are &quot;taunt weapons&quot; in the game for warriors are pointless, as you are never going to see one of these weapons ever. My guild will likley Never even Attempt the AoW or Creator and will never see the inside of Vex Thal, and that's fine with us. But why should I, or the other warriors in my guild, or those in other smaller, non raid oriented guilds, have to contend with the mediocrity and in many cases, outright uselessness that our class has been relegated to over the last year, just because we can't get the top end gear. If we have to have an enraging blow weapon just to maintain taunt on HoT yard trash and Vex Thal gear just to be able to do our single focus job, then there is a fundamental flaw with the warrior character class<br>
<br>
There has been much discussion here, and on other boards, about warrior dps vs pally/sk with the knights saying we have more and the warriors saying that isn't necessarily true. I say it's completely true if you aren't in the end game, don't have 25AA pts, and/or aren't in a high end raiding guild. I currently use an Ornate sword of the General and a CBoL as my only weapons. I use these piddly damage weapons because the Only agro i can generate is from hitting the mob as rapidly as possible, and they are the best I've been able to get.  I parse our raid encounters as do others in our guild and find, time and time again, that the paladins and sk's of our guild, even those as low as lvl 54, equal or better my damage every time unless I'm the MT and hitting the mob before anyone else. Because of agro issues, I usually tank for up to a full minute before the assist is called to insure I'm far enough up on the hate list to maintain some agro. It's a 50/50 shot that, even after a minute, a ranger or monk with epics inadvertantly taunts off a mob or some dress wearer gets a free trip to bind point just for doing a normal nuke. <br>
<br>
My panoply is mixed champion/cobalt/SS armor with IGS, CoCW and other easily obtainable items...I have 6k in the bank, which is 4kk shy of the most I've ever seen at one time and for me, the biggest upgrade i'm likely to see for the forseeable future is full SS armor. I am at 4800 hp with about 1300ac fully raid buffed by our level 60 buffers. Pitiful, I know, but that's where I am...and that's where alot of other warriors are as well. The upgrades to the knight classes have given them not just near parity to people like me, but in many cases, superiority. <br>
<br>
I don't begrude the knights a damn bit the improvements they've been given...they were pitiful when Kunark first came out. I don't want to see anything taken away from them...in fact I am in agreement that they need what is coming from the new shield upgrade, even though it will cause me to quit the game if there aren't vast improvements made to warriors at the same time that this comes out. I'll but completely useless unless i want to get a shield myself and cut my pitiful damage output down by 1/3 to 1/2 what it is now. Then ill only be partially useless.<br>
<br>
The fact still remains that Warriors are a single focus class. We are THE melee class. All other classes are specialists in one aspect of melee or generalists that dabble in magic. By the very nature of our class, we have given up any rapid movement, healing, buffing and everything else in the pursuit of pure martial ability. We should be able to take twice the damage of any other class...not avoid it, but absorb it. We should Not be the greatests damage dealers by any stretch of the imagination, but it should be damn tough to make us go away. In my opinion, knights Should do more damage than warriors in any situation with the undead or those in diametric opposition to thier god, as they are supposed to be mortal avatars of thier god. They should never do more damage (equally equipped) on any other types of mobs as they are still mortal men using the same blades warriors are. Monks have trainging in mystical arts that should allow them to know how to deal maximum damage with the open hand ( i personally think they should do as much or more damage barehanded than with a weapon), but they should drop quicker than my ex wife at fleet week if they fail to avoid being hit. Monks don't absorb damage...they avoid it...remember...&quot;best defense, noooo be there&quot;. Where the warrior should shine is in his ability to shake it off. At no time should anyone even consider having any other class stand before the badguy and take the blows. There has to be a trade-off or you might as well get rid of the warrior class. <br>
<br>
To those knights out there that feel &quot;it's about time&quot; or &quot;We should tank every bit as well as warriors&quot; you are wrong. You have to pay to play...if you want the blessing of your god which allows you to heal or do other spells and kick the living crap out of the undead (hell, i say make them even more effective than they are now in this regard), then the trade-off has to be made. In standard rpg's the trade-off is that you could not anger your god or you would lose your powers. That would mean, in this game, that if you attacked enough creatures on the same faction as your god, you'd cease to be a paladin but would become a warrior, but half as effective in all areas because you weren't as martially trained. If you, as a knight, want to tank as well as a warrior and want to have parity in hp/dps/ac then that's the trade-off you should have to face. That isn't an option here...the god's aren't PC's with the capricious whims they would have in a normal rpg. So you have to make another trade-off...you can NOT be as effective of a tank without completely marginalizing the warriors. If you want to tank, be a warrior. If you want to use melee and spells, then deal with being much less effective at absorbing damage and keeping the interest of the mob. <br>
<br>
There should be only one instance where a knight is a good choice to be the tank in my opinion, and this is gonna piss off alot of warriors, but it's still my opinion. Knights are holy/unoly warriors...they should be equally if not marginally better main tanks against the undead. They should have a defense table just for the undead that gives them the same damage absorption capabilities a warrior has for every mob. They should also always be able to easily out taunt a warrior when facing the undead or followers of a god at war with theirs. This would make the game much more true to the intended natures of each class and would make a raid need both warriors and knights to be raid capable everywhere. Knights could be the badass in some zones and warriors in others when it came to xp grind and as most boss mobs are not undead, the utility of a knight would still make them sought after for high end encounters.<br>
<br>
It's our one and only thing and it needs to be restored. It needs to be done quickly and without being at the expense of the gains that have already been made by the hybrid classes.<br>
<br>
Sorry to be so long winded, but I had alot I wanted to say after reading so many posts.<br>

<br>
What you're talking about here is what was known once as the &quot;Holy Trinity.&quot;  Back in the Age of Despair, there wasn't a role for ANYONE, really, who wasn't a part of the trinity.  That's why there's so many rogues around, and warriors.<br>
<br>
Now, it sounds like the warrior spot in the Holy Trinity is threatened, although the Trinity isn't as solid as it once was, due to a lot of changes that have been made over the last year.  With the new Heal spells for Shamans and druids, the cleric role is being threatened as well.<br>
<br>
Somebody needs to put the screws to the rogues, I think.<br>
<br>
For those of you who don't remember, the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; was the concept that the core of a raid only needed to consist of Clerics, Warriors, and Rogues.  Clerics to heal the Main tanking Warriors, and Rogues to do damage.  Sure, sure, a shaman is nice to slow, an enchanter to buff, a druid (or two) to port, one mage to DS the main tanks and make mod rods (before FT items), a monk to pull, etc etc.  But really, any more than one of those extras is just creating extra lag, so make sure we don't have more than one Wiz, mage, druid, chanter, shaman, etc.<br>
<br>
My point is, sometimes the Holy Trinity demands a knight class to main tank.  I would guess that in anything other than a top-level end-game guild, the Trinity still requires a warrior to tank.  /shrug   If you find that unreasonable, I don't think we're ever going to agree on the subject.<br>

<br>
Yes. Do you understand why the trinity was made so powerful in groups and raids? They had next to nothing in the way of soloing ability. These three classes absolutely NEEDED a group. They gave up any additional abilities to focus entirely upon doing that one thing better than anyone else. Guess what, they can't do that one thing so much better anymore.<br>
<br>
What now? Should warriors, rogues, and clerics take the shaft for being specialists?  Look at test server *right now* and see how clerical healing advantages are being marginalized. You're already taking aim at rogues too now. <br>
<br>
Kind of a moot point as I see it. We're taking it, and will continue to take more and more of it until this game is broken beyond repair or verant wakes up and realizes &quot;class balance&quot; is more than a catch phrase to add to statements to their playerbase.<br>
<br>
You want GOD.MODE. To play duck hunt an inch from the screen like back in the day, yo. <br>
<br>
You want to have all that nifty hybrid spell ability, and yet you believe you should be on even footing(oh, maybe a miniscule amount less) as the specialists who gave up so much. People who play nonspecialized classes have whined, cried, and begged until they got what they wanted- abilities/items/aaxp that should never go to anything but a specialist- and class lines are reduced to being almost nonexistant.<br>

So who is opposing the extent of the upgrade?  Paladins.<br>
Not sk's, no one else.  What I want to know is why.  I know what I have read on this board and on paladins of norrath.  They are scared of being useless again.  It simply won't happen.  Knights have been given the absolute best utility of any  class I have encountered.  No upgrade given to warrior can take that away or make it less useful.<br>
<br>
I have heard the fear that you wouldnt compare to warriors in tanking.  Wake up call on this one.  YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO.  I don't see what the problem is with it.  I'll put my magelo link on this post and tell me where my utility is.  Tell me where the advantage to giving up EVERYTHING but melee ability is.  Tell me what I can give to my group but melee ability.<br>
<br>
And the talk of it being a &quot;high end game&quot; issue is crap.  It is an issue for warriors of all levels.  Since I hit 50 it has been even more noticeable.  <br>
<br>
Everyone chose the class they play, it didn't choose them.   I chose warrior because it was what I wanted.  I knew I wouldn't be able to solo effectively, but that was something I could give up.  I knew I wouldn't be able to cast spells to help with damage, heals, etc.  That is what I chose to give up to be the best at what I do.  After the paladin upgrades, what has the class actually given up?  Lower skill caps? Slightly.  Lower hps, armor class, mitigation, weapons?  PFFT!  Like I said in an earlier post.  It seems to me that the only argument against necessary warrior upgrades are coming from paladins who want to be warriors with spells.  I'm sorry if that offends some people, but that is absolutely all I have seen.  Pallies already make great tanks, and I'm happy that they do.  But you shouldn't be able to touch a warrior at it.  That is the price all warriors have paid for their class, and to marginalize it by saying that an upgrade shouldnt happen because you want to tank as well as a warrior is ridiculous. That is the price you paid when you chose your class.<br>

<br>
No, that statement is incorrect. I know people hate it but...<br>
<br>
WTB Nerf Stick.<br>
<br>
Upgrades is what got us here in the first place. <br>
<br>
Paladins got upgraded 10x in both combat ability AND spellcasting, now they are a little too powerful. Monks have had weight limit removed, new damage tables, obscene aa, etc... now they are the big chiefs, that's why 75% of twinks are iksar monks. <br>
<br>
I went to Monkly business, you wonder how many posts I saw that complained about monkss being weak or needing help.<br>
<br>
Zero.<br>
<br>
Monks need to be beaten so bad with the Nerf Stick it's not funny.<br>
<br>
I don't want warriors to be upgraded. I want other classes beaten down. Or else we will continue this horrible ability 'inflation' which is the original source of today's BS. PoP will roll in and we'll have 5 million HP boss's. <br>
<br>
It's just getting absurd now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a
