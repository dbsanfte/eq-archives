<br>
I'm done here.  I've completly spelled out why it would be bad for some of the things warriors want and agreed with some of the points they make.  I'm sorry if you don't feel defensive and evasive are good enough disc's to balance you out.  Your taking them for granted and that is something I can't help.  <br>
<br>
I'm not worried about warriors getting most of the stuff they are asking for, because I believe the designers at verant understand the balance of classes now and are no longer going to skew things in favor of one class as previously.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if you thought that before SoL paladins &quot;whined&quot; alot on our boards.  If you have spent as much time lfg watching warriors get spots, or being near useless at raids you would have spoken up too.  Paladins feel that we are now balanced with warriors.  When you add up the sum of the two classes they both have jobs to do and both are useful/needed.  <br>
<br>
Before luclin came out I was a big supporter of paladins getting defensive.  I see how that would be wrong now though.  The only thing I'd ask for at all would be to have ToK and DS fixed.  Both are broken but verant has decided to ignore them.  No biggie though cause overall we are a happy class.  <br>

I have seen NO arguments against putting monks on a higher offensive table than all other melee, why such a fuss about doing the SAME thing for the ONLY pure defensive MELEE ONLY class in the game with the defensive table?<br>
<br>
I'll tell you why.  Because Paladins and SK's are scared.  Irrationaly so I might add.  Almost hysterically so.  You're scared that rebalancing warriors would put you in the same position that you were in Kunark.  This is UTTERLY FALSE.  <br>
<br>
You guys had it REAL bad in Kunark, no one has denied this once.  But, your balancing didn't occur with the &quot;melee balancing&quot; patch.... it occurred in waves, and it was overdone when the sum of all parts was added together.<br>
<br>
- Exp Penalty done away with<br>
<br>
- Mana pool drastically increased <br>
<br>
- Defensive table adjusted <br>
<br>
- Spell casting during combat adjusted<br>
<br>
- Pal/SK only weapons introduced with drastically superior stats<br>
<br>
- 2 Hand damage upgrade<br>
<br>
- Hybrid OFFENSE upgrades<br>
<br>
- New Spells at every expansion<br>
<br>
- All/All or Melee/All Equipment which completely obliterated equipment based superiority<br>
<br>
- AC Soft Cap Stopping the progression of warriors<br>
<br>
- AAXP....this one is HUGE.  Did you know that warriors did not get a SINGLE defense based AA class skill?  NOT ONE, and Defense is our lifeblood.  Paladins/SK's not only got the SAME defensive AA skills as warriors, but to compound it, they got an addition class skill which FURTHER erodes into the difference.<br>
<br>
-Priest AA Archetype skills.  Again, on the surface, this doesn't seem like much, but it's in essence, quadruple regen for Paladins.<br>
<br>
Ok, so to improve warriors' defense to such a degree that there's some real difference, would NOT throw Paladins &quot;back to where they were before&quot;.  The only way that this would happen is if there were an introduction of mobs which based on the difference, that a Paladin COULD NOT function, as was the case before.   The problem with Paladins before was that they sucked....BAD.  They were broken in SO many areas that it wasn't even funny.  This is not only no longer the case, but it's come to the point where they are WAY more powerful overall than warriors, and have encroached even onto warriors' sacred ground.... Melee defense.  When there's not enough difference to make a clear choice on a melee based skill between a pure melee and a hybrid... THE MELEE IS BROKEN.<br>
<br>
You should NOT be chosen based on your defensive tanking skills, but based on your inherent group value.<br>

And what would that be? Assume the paladin isn't tanking and tell me what other skills besides that we bring to a group and why someone would pick a paladin over some other class. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

Ill tell you why. Just from my gear which is BARELY average if not a bit below, I have 1602hp/936 ac. Not too impressed? Well counting mend which heals 25% of my life every few minutes I now have a total of 2000 hp to tank with. On top of that monks on average get hit 8% less than a warrior. The fact that we can solo so effectively should show you what decent tanks we are unbuffed. Now as I said, my gear is barely average at 52 for a monk. There are a number of monks on the top end guilds that are topping 4khp unbuffed and hitting the 1400 ac mark with ease. When you take into consideration the 8% less damage taken you have a tank capable of staying alive through almost any fight. About the only thing keeping a monk from being mt in a raid is that lack of a reliable taunt. Sure we deal out massive taunt just by virtue of the insane amounts of damage we deal but since we have no reliable way to pull an uber mob off a caster fast we just shouldnt be in that situation.<br>
In an exp group though, I can be mt just fine. When it comes to killing dark blues monks are probably the best tanks around. We get to deal out our full amount of damage, we take much less damage than your average tank, and by having a monk there the mob will die much faster than if it was a warrior standing there.<br>
Back to the subject of this incredibly long debate, I had said way back on one of the earlier pages that my personal thought would be to put warriors on a new defensive table. One that wouldnt be HUGELY better but still noticeable. Just enough so that if it came down to whether that 56 paladin, 56 monk, or 56 warrior should be mt, you would pick the warrior just for the slight advantage. I have news for you pallys, you arent broken anymore, there is no need to worry that actually improving the warrior class will make you somehow worthless. Warriors ARE supposed to be preffered as main tanks over all others. You may not like the fact but its true. You wont go back to the days when people would giggle if you offered yourself as a tank because you are now very effective at tanking. I dont even PLAY a warrior and I think warriors should be the first choice when it comes to tanking. <br>
I think improving the taunt would make the game a bit too easy personally though, mainly because if taunt worked any better than it already does, at least at 60, then it would be far too easy for a warrior to hold agro even over chain nukers and healers. I dont know about agro from 51 to 59 since my guilds mt is a warlord but at least in exp groups, unless I am a couple levels above the warrior or he is using really crappy weapons, he can normally hold agro off me when he is supposed to. Once again, it sounds like for raids its different, I wouldnt know because I normally only have 60 warriors as mt in my raids.<br>
Ah well, ive rambled on long enough. This has deviated far from its origional purpose,(thank you paladins) so hopefully this will put it back online.<br>

<br>
&quot;I have seen NO arguments against putting monks on a higher offensive table than all other melee, why such a fuss about doing the SAME thing for the ONLY pure defensive MELEE ONLY class in the game with the defensive table?&quot;<br>
<br>
Offense stacks, defense doesn't.  How many tanks do you need in one exp group?  How many damage dealers do you want?  Nuff said.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Exp Penalty done away with- yes, but warriors still have an exp bonus.<br>
<br>
- Mana pool drastically increased- All that was done was penalties removed.  We received no special upgrades.<br>
<br>
- Defensive table adjusted- Yes, but our other mitigation skills are still capped lower then a warrior.<br>
<br>
- Spell casting during combat adjusted- Yeah, because casting during a fight would half your dps.  If you didn't time spells just right you seriously cramped damage output.  We still can't fight while casting, but we no longer reset wpn dly on every cast.<br>
<br>
- Pal/SK only weapons introduced with drastically superior stats- Our wpns were subpar previously and warriors have gotten new wpns with superior stats on them compared to previous expansions.  Even with these new wpns you talk of we do less dps then a warrior.<br>
<br>
- 2 Hand damage upgrade-  This affects every single class that uses a 2hdr and not just knights. In other words warriors got this upgrade also.  If 2hdrs really are that much better now perhaps you should try using one.<br>
<br>
- Hybrid OFFENSE upgrades- paladins still capped at 225.  yep, still lower then a warrior by a good bit.  Turn on others misses one day and stand next to a paladin fighting.  You'll get a good laugh out of it.<br>
<br>
- New Spells at every expansion- Yes, and warriors have gotten new armor and wpns at every expansion.  We are part fighter and part caster.  They both have to be maintained as the game grows.<br>
<br>
- All/All or Melee/All Equipment which completely obliterated equipment based superiorit-  Agreed.  No problems at all with making more warrior gear to fit their needs.  Gear isn't a huge balancing area.  <br>
<br>
- AC Soft Cap Stopping the progression of warriors-  Show me raw, hard data from verant on the soft caps per class and how they affect gameplay.  Sorry, but this isn't something you can point to and say it's imbalanced.  There is just too much speculation and not enough hard facts for it.  This deserves looking into, but isn't really a valid argument for this topic.<br>
<br>
AA skills-  I checked out the list of warrior skills.  They looked like some nice stuff to help increase your damage.  I could understand warriors being miffed some about PE though and I dont' think it would warp the balance if warriors were to get it.  2% isn't that much of a boost to really have much of an affect in the long run.  You may think paladins have better skills, we may think you have better skills, but in the end the skills are pretty much balanced out.  We get a mixture of utiltiy type skills to be selected on how we want to shape our character, and you get mainly damage upgrade skills.  <br>
<br>
Saying we get priest skills too and implying that is bad is ridiculous.  We are both a fighter and a caster.  We are not the best at either, but we are able to do some of both.  Once again, you can't neglect one of the parts because you will ruin the whole if you do.<br>
<br>
Remember also.  When chosing gear hybrids have to worry about more then just hp/ac/sta.  We have to add in wis/int/mana too.  Factor in focus effects for either our melee side or our casting side.  It's difficult to find a balance in gear for us with all the things we have to watch out for.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You should NOT be chosen based on your defensive tanking skills, but based on your inherent group value.&quot;<br>
<br>
What exactly is our inherent group value?  What is the spot you would have us fill?  Lets break down your average exp group.<br>
<br>
Cleric/druid -more then likely a cleric, but you have to have a healer<br>
<br>
Chanter/bard/shaman -mana regen/crowd control/haste/slows... someone has to do it<br>
<br>
Warrior/paladin/shadowknight -Tank, someone has to take the hits in there.<br>
<br>
Monk/rogue/ranger/mage/wizard/necro/beastlord/warrior- these are your damage dealing classes.  They fill up the last 3 spots.  <br>
<br>
Now then, if you were to make warriors the best tanks you can drop the knights out.  You can't stick them in with the dps classes, because we have the lowest dps out of all those.  Warriors do about 40% more dps in comparable gear if memory serves correctly.  <br>
<br>
So where exactly would you have the knight classes go?  Where is our inherent group value?  Shadowknights could take a monk spot for pulling sometimes.  They also have offense based spells that are good when a necro isn't around.  So they will be able to get some groups.  <br>
<br>
Paladins though don't have a special ability like feign death.  Our strength lies in our healing when it comes to spells.  Healing doesn't really stack though because you can only heal so much before everyone is full health.  You don't need 2 clerics in groups because one is able to keep up with heals.  You don't need a cleric and a paladin to keep up with heals because a cleric is plenty.  How many times in an exp group have you asked for a backup healer?  How many times have you looked for added dps?  It makes more sense to invite someone that will help you kill mobs faster rather then someone that can backup heal.  Remember that paladins do about half or less damage when compared to rogues/rangers/monks.  That is a huge difference in damage output and a much longer fight.  <br>
<br>
So what exactly would you have us offer a group if we aren't desired as a tank?  Tell me how I will still be desired once it is known that warriors are once again the best tanks and a group is much better off with a war for tanking rather than a paladin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Right now warriors think they are underpowered because a paladin can get in a group as a tank.  Ya'll are saying that paladins should not be chosen as tanks, we should be chosen for our inherent group value.  Your not realizing that our group value is that we can tank (although still not as good as a warrior) and at the same time we can heal/park/stun/taunt.  Take away the tanking part and you just have a class that can do alot of stuff that groups can do without.  Warriors are the best tanks still.  It's just no longer such a wide gap.  <br>

?Because Paladins and SK's are scared. Irrationaly so I might add. Almost hysterically so. You're scared that rebalancing warriors would put you in the same position that you were in Kunark. This is UTTERLY FALSE.&quot;<br>
<br>
How do you know it is irrationel?  When was the last time you spent 3 days lfg and never got a group?  When was the last time you sat for hours watching as warriors that were levels under you got groups?  When was the last time you were told that a raid couldn't happen because there were no paladins?  I'm sorry, but the fear we have is from past experience.  It is a situation we never want to see again.  If you had gone thru it you would feel the same way.  <br>
<br>
How do you know it is utterly false?  Can you garuntee to me that upgrades to warriors will still make me desired in groups?  You can't.  Anything you do to improve warrior tanking is a direct threat to a paladins role in a group.  <br>
<br>
<br>
 &quot;Just enough so that if it came down to whether that 56 paladin, 56 monk, or 56 warrior should be mt, you would pick the warrior just for the slight advantage&quot;<br>
<br>
If you pick a warrior everytime then a paladin has no spot in a group.  We do not have the offensive skills to have a group chose us because of our damage output.  We don't have the healing ablities to have a group chose us to be the healer.  We bring tanking and some utility to a group.  If a group doesn't want us for our tanking then they have to drop a damage dealer to get our utility.  Maybe in a few select spots this will work, but the majority of groups will hold out for more dps and ignore us.  <br>

<br>
&quot;I have seen NO arguments against putting monks on a higher offensive table than all other melee, why such a fuss about doing the SAME thing for the ONLY pure defensive MELEE ONLY class in the game with the defensive table?&quot;<br>
<br>
Offense stacks, defense doesn't. How many tanks do you need in one exp group? How many damage dealers do you want? Nuff said.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Exp Penalty done away with- yes, but warriors still have an exp bonus.<br>
<br>
***But it is noticably harder for warriors to get groups in general.  I dont have this problem though due to networks etc.  Plus we realitically cant solo, paladins can***<br>
<br>
- Mana pool drastically increased- All that was done was penalties removed. We received no special upgrades.<br>
<br>
***This is an upgrade then?***<br>
<br>
- Defensive table adjusted- Yes, but our other mitigation skills are still capped lower then a warrior.<br>
<br>
***True****<br>
<br>
- Spell casting during combat adjusted- Yeah, because casting during a fight would half your dps. If you didn't time spells just right you seriously cramped damage output. We still can't fight while casting, but we no longer reset wpn dly on every cast.<br>
<br>
***IF we are talking about tanking here, its not DPS people want its holding aggro.  If a paladin stood there stunning his ass off he's got aggro.  MTing isnt about giving damage ever! its about soaking it and focussing damage***<br>
<br>
- Pal/SK only weapons introduced with drastically superior stats- Our wpns were subpar previously and warriors have gotten new wpns with superior stats on them compared to previous expansions. Even with these new wpns you talk of we do less dps then a warrior.<br>
<br>
***Your weapons should never fall within the strength of warriors.  You should never do more damage than a warrior.  Your a hybrid class meaning your strengths should not be 100% in both classes.  More like 70% in one class, 30% in the other.   With the warrior weapon upgrades, may I point out that the weapons with superior stats to epic weapons are extrodinarily tough to get.   What do you want the melee / defensive skills of warriors AND CH also/LoH Celestial heal.   Hell lets give ya aego also****<br>
<br>
- 2 Hand damage upgrade- This affects every single class that uses a 2hdr and not just knights. In other words warriors got this upgrade also. If 2hdrs really are that much better now perhaps you should try using one.<br>
<br>
***True but there is a severe lack of true warrior 2hs weapons that are useful and easily obtainable ***<br>
<br>
- Hybrid OFFENSE upgrades- paladins still capped at 225. yep, still lower then a warrior by a good bit. Turn on others misses one day and stand next to a paladin fighting. You'll get a good laugh out of it.<br>
<br>
***And this is prolly the reason why your damage dosent = warrior dps.  Which because we are a pure class, we gain these benefits.  Because you are a hybrid, you shouldnt be 100% warrior, 100% cleric.<br>
<br>
- New Spells at every expansion- Yes, and warriors have gotten new armor and wpns at every expansion. We are part fighter and part caster. They both have to be maintained as the game grows.<br>
<br>
***Warriors have received armour which is correct.  However, its usable by all plate classes, so we havent really received any armour, we have received what everyone else has.  In addition to this, the majority of warriors are agnostic which means that they are not assigned diety armour either.  See previous comments on weapons***<br>
<br>
- All/All or Melee/All Equipment which completely obliterated equipment based superiorit- Agreed. No problems at all with making more warrior gear to fit their needs. Gear isn't a huge balancing area. <br>
<br>
***Gear is a huge balancing area.  Unlike any other class, warriors are very heavily reliant upon their equipment as opposed to ability.  I have a 56 cleric, who needs nothing at all.  Hes in full thurgy and their is absolutely no point whatsoever, apart from his epic to upgrade him.  Warriors however, need to constantly upgrade to fall in line with main tanking***<br>
<br>
<br>
- AC Soft Cap Stopping the progression of warriors- Show me raw, hard data from verant on the soft caps per class and how they affect gameplay. Sorry, but this isn't something you can point to and say it's imbalanced. There is just too much speculation and not enough hard facts for it. This deserves looking into, but isn't really a valid argument for this topic.<br>
<br>
Well if a paladin can reach the AC of a warrior (which is possible) then that's not right.  We go back to you paladins being warrior/clerics and warriors being a pure class.<br>
<br>
AA skills- I checked out the list of warrior skills. They looked like some nice stuff to help increase your damage. I could understand warriors being miffed some about PE though and I dont' think it would warp the balance if warriors were to get it. 2% isn't that much of a boost to really have much of an affect in the long run. You may think paladins have better skills, we may think you have better skills, but in the end the skills are pretty much balanced out. We get a mixture of utiltiy type skills to be selected on how we want to shape our character, and you get mainly damage upgrade skills. <br>
<br>
***Dmg skills are useful but not wholely useful.  We remain as a defensive class taking damage and not giving it.  Honestly m8, I work alongside a paladin friend as I have done from level 35.  I have seen him become vastly superior to me in a short space of time - both in tanking ability and statistical ability.  Don't humour us bud, paladin's AA hammers warriors in a second***<br>
<br>
Saying we get priest skills too and implying that is bad is ridiculous. We are both a fighter and a caster. We are not the best at either, but we are able to do some of both. Once again, you can't neglect one of the parts because you will ruin the whole if you do.<br>
<br>
***Agreed but because you are both, you should be penalised on both***<br>
<br>
Remember also. When chosing gear hybrids have to worry about more then just hp/ac/sta. We have to add in wis/int/mana too. Factor in focus effects for either our melee side or our casting side. It's difficult to find a balance in gear for us with all the things we have to watch out for. <br>
<br>
***This aint a problem at all.  Granted I do not have a paladin, but I do have a cleric.  Thurgy/SS armour is AC heavy / HP heavy and in addition Wisdom heavy. Many paladin weapons have HP/Mana and wisdom on them also.  And realistically a high level paladin will have C3 on them quite often also***<br>
<br>
&quot;You should NOT be chosen based on your defensive tanking skills, but based on your inherent group value.&quot;<br>
<br>
What exactly is our inherent group value? What is the spot you would have us fill? Lets break down your average exp group.<br>
<br>
Cleric/druid -more then likely a cleric, but you have to have a healer<br>
<br>
Chanter/bard/shaman -mana regen/crowd control/haste/slows... someone has to do it<br>
<br>
Warrior/paladin/shadowknight -Tank, someone has to take the hits in there.<br>
<br>
Monk/rogue/ranger/mage/wizard/necro/beastlord/warrior- these are your damage dealing classes. They fill up the last 3 spots. <br>
<br>
Now then, if you were to make warriors the best tanks you can drop the knights out. You can't stick them in with the dps classes, because we have the lowest dps out of all those. Warriors do about 40% more dps in comparable gear if memory serves correctly. <br>
<br>
So where exactly would you have the knight classes go? Where is our inherent group value? Shadowknights could take a monk spot for pulling sometimes. They also have offense based spells that are good when a necro isn't around. So they will be able to get some groups. <br>
<br>
Paladins though don't have a special ability like feign death. Our strength lies in our healing when it comes to spells. Healing doesn't really stack though because you can only heal so much before everyone is full health. You don't need 2 clerics in groups because one is able to keep up with heals. You don't need a cleric and a paladin to keep up with heals because a cleric is plenty. How many times in an exp group have you asked for a backup healer? How many times have you looked for added dps? It makes more sense to invite someone that will help you kill mobs faster rather then someone that can backup heal. Remember that paladins do about half or less damage when compared to rogues/rangers/monks. That is a huge difference in damage output and a much longer fight. <br>
<br>
So what exactly would you have us offer a group if we aren't desired as a tank? Tell me how I will still be desired once it is known that warriors are once again the best tanks and a group is much better off with a war for tanking rather than a paladin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Right now warriors think they are underpowered because a paladin can get in a group as a tank. Ya'll are saying that paladins should not be chosen as tanks, we should be chosen for our inherent group value. Your not realizing that our group value is that we can tank (although still not as good as a warrior) and at the same time we can heal/park/stun/taunt. Take away the tanking part and you just have a class that can do alot of stuff that groups can do without. Warriors are the best tanks still. It's just no longer such a wide gap. <br>
<br>
<br>
?Because Paladins and SK's are scared. Irrationaly so I might add. Almost hysterically so. You're scared that rebalancing warriors would put you in the same position that you were in Kunark. This is UTTERLY FALSE.&quot;<br>
<br>

Maybe in a few select spots this will work, but the majority of groups will hold out for more dps and ignore us. <br>
<br>
***I agree with you here. Your quite correct.  The way I see paladins is not the main tank in a group but a tank that you can rely on to snatch aggro at the drop of a hat.  For instance if a warrior looses aggro and the mob goes for the enchanter, paladin steps in and takes over.  They can insta aggro no problems against warriors. <br>
<br>
Your are more group friendly than an SK - so you are likely to get in a group over n SK.  I would easily choose a paladin everytime.  <br>
<br>
My only problem with paladins is that whilst they put up a good argument on their side of the fence I think it is totally unjustified - there are VERY FEW paladins who can actually play a paladin to their strengths.  <br>
<br>
I have been on EQ now for a period of 3 years, am one of the oldest and renowned warriors on our server.  To this very day, I have encountered only ONE paladin who can actually play a paladin, now I often get pickups and so on.  There are maybe 2-3 more that are ok that spring to mind. But the rest are terrible.  <br>
<br>
So whilst I am not saying that you are an awful paladin or a great paladin, have you explored all avenues of paladin abilities and pushed them to the max ????***<br>

Those disciplines were given to us in an era when AC meant something. Even at the end of Kunark the most uber warriors (i.e. Me and a small handful of others) could barely reach the AC softcap, a cap which was never raised in Velious and only marginally increased in SoL - over two years later. Conversely, the average fight times versus uber mobs were raised almost exponentially while the DPM from mobs barely changed; and in MANY Velious and even Luclin uber encounters, remained BELOW the DPM of Dragons in Veeshan's Peak - the Vision took a wicked, wicked wrong turn in game design. How could they have not seen this mess coming?<br>
<br>
In those days, the term monk and tank were only used in the same sentence when you were talking about what it felt like to get rolled over by a twenty ton tank if you were a monk that tried to tackle anything larger than a bread box, head on.<br>
<br>
Additionally, due to the fact that fights hardly ever lasted more than 4-5 minutes, the disciplines made sense - two years ago.<br>
<br>
Right now they are only a vestige; a remnant of a bygone era: A time when Armor Class meant something and the warrior class was more than a mish mash of bad coding and lost grey matter.<br>

<br>
Let's see if I can make this easy enough for even our new Paladin friends to understand.<br>
<br>
You seem to think that....<br>
<br>
Having the same AC as warriors is ok<br>
<br>
Having approximately 90% of the HP as a warrior is OK<br>
<br>
Having the same defensive skill as warriors is OK<br>
<br>
Having AA skills which brings you closer to warriors' ability is OK<br>
<br>
Having superior weapons which brings your melee DPS so close to warriors that it's insignificant is OK<br>
<br>
Basically, what you're saying is that you want the line between Paladins and Warriors to be so thin in terms of melee that it's barely recognizable at all.<br>
<br>
I would be ok with that<br>
<br>
-IF-<br>
<br>
You didn't have the same manapool as casters<br>
<br>
You didn't have LoH<br>
<br>
You didn't have the ability to recover from solo fights at 4x the rate of warriors.<br>
<br>
You didn't have the ability to create situations where while soloing, it's always you +mob, and any adds can be rooted safely out of melee range<br>
<br>
You didn't have server numbers which allowed you to be equiped on items which are class or 2class specific at a rate which is 10x faster than any others.<br>
<br>
You didn't have a free resurrection so that soloing is without any risk whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Incredibly enough, Paladins are the second or third best healers in the game.  In an exp group, a Paladin is a wiser choice than a druid for healing because a Paladin can correct larger problems fast using LoH, whereas a druid cannot, EVER.  If something goes a little wrong in a group setting, the Paladin is ALWAYS the better groupmate, even if they're not doing the primary tanking.<br>
<br>
So, what I'm getting at is that you guys really DO &quot;have it all&quot; and you're sitting here wagging your finger at us, who have given up any right to ALL of that which has been described above and in return we have gotten.....nothing, we've gotten told by you guys that we should be easily replaceable by you guys, that Everquest should be easier for you to play than us, because once upon a time, when Kunark was the latest, you couldn't get a group in Sebilis over a warrior and had to /lfg, and because once upon a time /disc defensive was really powerful.<br>
<br>
What you're saying is that your paranoia over being the CLEAR 2nd choice for a tank, we should simply bend over and take it.   Paladins SHOULD suffer some penalty, enough to make a difference in both areas of their existence, in melee AND in casting, for the benefit of having both.  Paladins seem to be the ONLY class that I've ever seen who says &quot;Well, we can get aggro without effort and we should not have to worry if we do&quot;.<br>

<br>
I've grouped with many many Paladins in my time.  And the best ones don't have to be main tank to prove their worth.  They back up heal as needed.   They throw in some stuns here and there to keep casters from casting, particularly gate.  They do some crowd control if needed.  They help pull mobs off casters when a caster makes an oops.  They can root runners.  They can successfully tank unmezzable, unrootable adds.  They are effectively able to do a little of just about everything, and do it pretty darn well, if the player is skilled.  And for experience groups they do make a respectable main tank.<br>
<br>
If as a Paladin you feel you HAVE to be the main tank to have value, you're playing the wrong class.  You should be a Warrior.  Because a Warrior HAS to be the main tank to be fullfilling their full potential.  Otherwise they are merely mediocre damage dealers that should probably be replaced with a Monk or a Rogue.  Not so with a Paladin.  They can be either a Main or Secondary tank and still add significant value beyond their damage output.<br>
<br>
Warrior contributions?  Only two to speak of.  Damage absorbtion and damage dealing.  We have already agreed and accepted that our damage dealing is going to be third or fourth tier at best (Rogues, Rangers, Monks, Wizards, Mages with pets all do better damage).  Now you are saying we should also accept that our damage absorbtion (without disciplines) should only be slightly better than the other Plate melee and slightly worse than Monks?   And what exactly do we get to counter balance this?<br>
<br>
The Paladins are rending their clothes and beating their chest about how there just aren't that many places they can go to fight undead so they can solo effectively.  Well, those few places are WORLDS more than a Warrior has available.  Soloing is not a viable option through most of a Warrior's career.  Grouping is our only option.  And we don't think its unreasonble we a margin of attraction over an SK or a Paladin for that.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usmushums.showPublicProfile?language=EN>smushums</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Steel Warrior Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 1133<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 9:45:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=414>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rofl</span><hr size=1> VI should fix our aggro management by adding AA<br>

If it DOES come down to a choice, say one of each sends you a tell afer you ask for a tank you SHOULD take the warrior first, that is the warriors one and only possible role. If there is no warrior then choose that paladin. THATS why warriors need to be noticeably better at tanking than any other class. If tanking is all that they can do then why shouldnt they be the best at doing it? Just like a wizard is best at nuking, or a cleric is best at hp/ac buffs and heals, or a shaman is best at stat buffs. Warriors are SUPPOSED to be better tanks than anyone else! Remember back in the day when paladins were lughed at for wanting to be the tank in an exp group? Groups would almost rather disband than try to let a paladin mt. Now if there is no warrior then SURE! Bring that pally down here he will tank just fine! Not as well as a warrior but good enough to do the job. THATS what I meant about choosing. <br>
Quite frankly, there arent a large number of warriors in the 55 and under range to choose from. Thats probably why I end up tanking alot in exp groups. But I have also had a number of groups with paladins or sks as mt and done just fine.<br>

<br>
let VI fix the @#%$ from the get-go. waiting 51 levels to finally be able to tweak your class into doing what the @#%$ is supposed to do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> in the first place</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is retarded.<br>
<br>
Why warriors aren't on their own defensive table is stupid as well. Monks and Rogues were clearly designed to be able to outdamage most other classes and VI made their own offense tables at 60; what is VI's malfunction into seeing that Warriors are their so-called &quot;standard&quot; of what Melee Damage absorbtion should be and we also <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be put on our own defensive table. And as most have said; and i'll repeat it again for those not scrolling through the 20-odd pages here..<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Defensive Discipline is a Crutch</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Period. If that is the only class balancing factor that VI can think of they surely better lay down the crack-pipe because they've basically made Warriors good for 3 minutes every 10 minutes of time ( at level 60 ) and the rest is spent trying to keep up with what most other classes can easily produce in the way of Damage, Group Helpfulness, and overall completion of a task as per fighting a MoB. The Vision as designed for Warriors never made a wrong turn anywhere; it just flat out came to a screeching halt in the middle of the road right after Velious was opened and we've been the brunt of the other classes jokes ever since. <br>

Funny how Absor has openly posted on most of the other's classes boards; but refuses to even acknowledge anything that's been said here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucaladel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caladel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 6:15:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=417>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rofl</span><hr size=1> A paladins point of view.....<br>
<br>
First off i do feel that warriors do need help. Somethign really needs to be done soon because its only going to get worse in PoP.<br>
<br>
Sorry i dont have time to read this whole thread, but here is what i think needs to be done.<br>
<br>
1) Mitigation is ass broken. Somethign is really wrong when a tank class values their avoidance skils 10 times over their mitigation skills. And thats the way it currently is, i dont give an ass about my mitigation ac but ill take all the avoidance i can get. AC hasent really ment anythign since kunark, and that really needs to be changed. The whole mitigation system really needs a rewrite. Warriors need to be either on a much higher mitigation table or need some kinda built in defensive skill making them take less then max hit 100% of the time. In addition to that i feel knights also should be on a higher table and/or have a build in type of defensive, BUT we should definately be lower then warrios. In short tho the tank classes need to be set apart from all the rest in the area of mitigation, right now were all the same.<br>
<br>
2) Shields dont do and never have done anything. When tanking people really should be using shields, be it a knight or a warrior. Right now youd have to be a moron to do so. Main reason being shields dont do anything they only add stats. Second reason being you lose a huge amout of DPS when you equip a shield, lower dps means you cant maintain agro as easy. Sheilds really need a purpose in the game. If they gave you a 20% chance to outright block a skill youd see people using them, if they gave a 20% defensive youd see people using them. But, they also need to do somethign about the reduced ability to control agro when a shield is equipped or fixing shields still has that glaring flaw. In short a 1h weapon + shield shoudl be a viable form of combat. Rigth now it is not to any class.<br>
<br>
3) +Hitpoints on items. +hitpoints should have scaled based on classes. +100=100 for a warrior and much less for other classes. But, this late in the game i dont know if they coudl get away with fixing this correctly, and thus they will probably leave it alone. If they however fix mitigation properly it will help the situation a lot. From day 1 hitpoints really should ahve scaled tho. This would have allowed the tank classes especially warriors maintain their hp leads over other classes.<br>
<br>
4) agro management. I dont know if you can just outright give warriors a much better taunt without breaking the game badly. I do agree somethign needs to be done in this area however. A warrior shoudl nto have to rely on proccing +hate weapons as much as they do. However they should also not have the ability to control agro as well as a paladin/shadowknight should. Warriors should be the better tank, but we shoudl be the better agro lockers. I dont know how they can corretly fix this without trivilizing the game. If you have a warrior that can maintain perfect agro then thigns are way too easy; but it is a joke right now and needs work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for the people who like to bitch about the paladin class in this thread, a large /ruide. Dont even try to give the old well they get this skill and that skill blah blah blah and we dont. Or the old my skills suck but yours are godly. If you are gonna post any comparison of skills do it with the facts not some bloated comparsion of blatent exaggerations. For the first time in 3 years my class has not been severly handicapped. We are not godly, but we also do not have anymore glareing holes. We still have a few issues, but that will always be true for any class.<br>
<br>
In short to verant, fix mitigation damnit! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucslochraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CSLochraven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 8:08:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=418>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gs.cdnow.com/graphics/COVERART/local/L/80/01/00138001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rofl</span><hr size=1> I like the idea about shields.<br>
<br>
Real fighters usually don't &quot;dual wield,&quot; they have a sword and a shield.  <br>
<br>
The problem is that for us to keep aggro with a 1hander and a shield would be either to have the weapon be godly or make taunt much more effective.  Which causes problems with both areas.<br>
<br>
Our damage mitigation should be improved.<br>
<br>
I think our ability to hold aggro is fine.  YES, sometimes the mob will run and hit the shaman.  YES, sometimes the mob will turn and attack the rogue.  YES, you will get some ping pong occasionally.  In an exp group it doesn't matter most of the time.  On raids the MT losing aggro shouldn't even happen often at all if everyone does what they are supposed to do. <p><b>Lochraven<b><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> End result is the warrior class is working as intended and needs no upgrades to stay balanced. It should only receive upgrades if pal/sk/monks/ect receive upgrades of their own to keep the current balance.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Its simple why warriors need to be re-balanced:<br>
<br>
We were balanced in with the all other melee classes in SoV era based upon our superior armor and how much melee power and class abilities we had vs the lesser armors, different melee powers and class powers they had.<br>
<br>
Now we no longer have the best gear, instead the same gear is shared by most if not all of the other classes. Warriors lost nothing directly here, however the other classes became as powerful as a warrior in this point.<br>
<br>
The hybrid classes, sans bards, have received the full force of the caster balance without suffering any drawbacks to the melee side of their powers. The healing hybrid classes have also received part of the priest balance as to date. <br>
<br>
So yes the other classes did receive more. Now it is time to give warriors something to restore the balance, the only question left is what.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
