I decided to read through that long post, 33 pages last I checked and evaluate what everyone was saying. I have been playing a warrior before Kunark ever came out, so I have been at the low point to their high points ( Kunark and Velious ). Though now I question what roll do Warriors have any more in raids / xp'ing.<br>
<br>
 First lets start with raids. Back in Kunark and Velious, most mobs could be killed in less then the time it took defensive to wear out, AoW and Vulak being the main exeptions, thus making Defensive tanks the core of any guild. Thus every serious guild recruited and worked up their tanks in HP to do the task at hand. Warriors at this time were very happy, thus never took the time to question how good or bad their class was. <br>
<br>
Enter Shadows of Luclin, this is where Verant, using the Vulak styled AC, decided they could tone down melee and improve casters. While Melee soon learned to love the 1,12,1, 1, 12, 12, 1, 48, 1, 1 ,1 , 12, 1  type mobs the casters were able to hit the mobs for normal damage. Now the lower damage wasn't just a nerf to melee in general, but more of a nerf to tanks that use Defensive. Defensive is good for 3 minutes, with SoL mobs taking well over 3 minutes and in some cases 30  minutes to kill, defensive has no real impact other then to buy time for the CH chain to get going. Once a CH chain is going any high HP tank with good mitigation could tank any mob in the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now lets talk about agro. Agro is the only thing a warrior with tons of HP is worried about. Having 7700  hp means nothing if you cant keep the mob on ya. Taunt button works for @#%$, this is the cruel fact. I think Verant only made a taunt button to give us something to push, thinking that its doing some good, when in truth does next to nothing, might as well press Sense Heading. So, Verant decides that warrior need better agro, thus come up with weapon procs called Enraging Blow to help hold agro. Only problem on Enraging Blow that is 80%   of the warrior population will never see one of these weapons as uber guilds sweep them up or block others from having to prevent competition on other mobs. Now the only other thing that can grab agro is AE Taunt. Feking Useful Skill! Sad fact is it can only be used once every 15 minutes so, its a one shot &quot; Gimmick &quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry for the history lesson, now on to the meat of the matter. So we are all happy with warriors? They do so so damage, AC past 1200 means next to nothing, and our beloved HP are now only a few hundred HP from the next plate wearing class, and sadly the only thing that defines a warrior is the level 55 skill Defensive ( though I do like Evasive in many cases over Def ). Now how would you feel if you are no longer wanted? Yes, a class that could become extinct and replaced in guilds! I am sure many are LOL right now but let me go into some detail on this.<br>
<br>
Warrior in Top End Gear ( self buffed only ):<br>
<br>
HP: 6200ish<br>
AC: 1800ish<br>
<br>
DPS: Roughly 80 DPS<br>
<br>
Top Skills: Defensive, Evasive, Aggressive, Furious, AE Taunt<br>
<br>
<br>
This is pretty much what a warrior brings to a group / raid / solo.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Paladin in Top End Gear ( Self Buffed ):<br>
<br>
HP: 5711 ( 6711 )<br>
AC: 2095 ( 2127 )<br>
<br>
<br>
DPS 1H: Roughly 40 DPS<br>
<br>
<br>
Skills:<br>
<br>
CH Lay of Hands<br>
Shield of Words<br>
Resolution<br>
Greater Remove Curse<br>
Stuns<br>
Divine Stun<br>
90% Res<br>
Roots<br>
Divine Aura<br>
Group Heals<br>
Self Regen<br>
Self Haste<br>
Symbol of Naltron<br>
BMB<br>
Heals<br>
Slay Undead ( Damage that can hit 6k on a hit )<br>
Dispells<br>
Cures<br>
Anti Undead Spells<br>
Holy Forge<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the kicker though, Paladins can hold agro better then a warrior and in the case they lose agro can get it back better then any class other then a SK. When it comes to Combat Agility, Natural Durability, Combat Stability they get an extra class skill that takes them higher in all 3 abilities.<br>
<br>
As a puller they hands down beat a Warrior. Divine Aura for things that DT ( since DT is now 20k Damage based ), stuns on pulls or Root, LoH on the run if hp is low.<br>
<br>
Holding Agro is a breeze to with all the stuns and weapon procs they can add to a weapon. No need to wait for a proc, just cast it when needed or let the proc work it.<br>
<br>
Damage: 1H the Warrior easily wins with duel attack and duel wield, but goto 2H and the Paladin is toe to toe with the Warrior and surpasses the warrior vs undead mobs.<br>
<br>
Groups will more then likely take in Paladins, because they can hold the agro, they come with an arsenal of useful skills that benefits the party, can heal and stop runners. Also CH is very efficient on 7k  Paladin.<br>
<br>
Raids will now open up more to a Paladin to MT then ever before. As 400 to 500 hp separating the top MT hp from the top Paladin hp the difference is noticable but small. Paladins can easily make this up in agro department and in versatility when not in the MT line up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One last thing to note, there is a new shield rules being tested on test server. The shield allow for more damage mitigation. While it would a huge change for a warrior to go to a shield and lose a Enraging Blow Weapon ( loss of agro ), Paladins and SKs will feel right at home and now obtaining better mitigation then a warrior, while not suffering a loss of agro.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now my only hopes are that Verrant takes a real look at where they placed the Warrior and where he stands in the 3 environments ( Group, Raid, Solo ). Though hearing that thread from Rich Waters that warriors in PoP only need a few &quot; Gimmiks &quot; left me depressed to say the least. I will continue to play my warrior as its a class I worked hard at and still love to play. Just that it saddens me that Verrant has no foresight to see what their so called &quot; Balancing &quot; has done. At least they did a good job on the Wizard with their AA skills and spells, its good to see a pure class remain undisputed champion of their half-breed classes.<br>

<br>
Shield of Words &lt;--Importent to raids?<br>
Resolution  &lt;-- Not over written by clerics on raids?<br>
Greater Remove Curse &lt;-- This is a joke right?<br>
Stuns  &lt;-- Don't work on raid mobs and hardly ever works on other mobs.  It builds less aggro on mobs it doesn't work on.<br>
Divine Stun  &lt;-- See &quot;Stuns&quot;  It basicaly equals a manaless stun oh ya I already have more single target stuns then I need.<br>
90% Res &lt;-- a on raids this helps how?<br>
Roots &lt;-- Works on no boss mob and with summon would it make a difference?<br>
Self Regen &lt;-- oh my god this crap spell sucks all my mana for crap regen.  Why oh why would I want this on me ever?<br>
Self Haste &lt;-- Ya it does a lot of good on raids right?  or maybe in groups when everyone else can out haste me n over write it and then forget to rehaste me a again forceing me to mem/cast this again just so I can eat 1/4 of my totaly mana just to have a haster remember 3 minutes later and after numerous requests finaly haste me.  <br>
Symbol of Naltron &lt;&lt;-- cleric overwrites on raids<br>
BMB &lt;-- yes often time exp groups and raids are made by the huge factor of someone haveing a couple hundred hp.  Oh ya right.<br>
Heals  &lt;-- That are now crap heals like rangers because druids and shaman just got a HUGE upgrade.<br>
Slay Undead ( Damage that can hit 6k on a hit ) &lt;&lt;-- ya great cause it only costs a boat load of aa points and only allows me to grind more aa points by my self cause people stil choice warriors over paladins most of the time unless they need neither.<br>
Dispells  &lt;&lt;--roflmfao  yes often time the paladins line up to debuff the raid mobs and exp mobs.  Bull @#%$ this is just a spell we use to sometimes pull with cause of the low aggro range of it.<br>
Cures  &lt;&lt;&lt;-- when the last time you saw in party of raid of people pass black burrow ask a paly for a cure?  <br>
Anti Undead Spells &lt;-- yes it's often times useful to use undead spells that hit for less damage then my sword swings.  I mean after all what else would I use mana for?  pftt -incert flame-<br>
Holy Forge  &lt;-- wow so situational it's pathetic you mentioned it.<br>
<br>
Now that left LH on your envy list.  Yes it helps to have 1 paladin with improved LH on raids to start the CH cycle of MT on boss mob.  Oh wow finaly a reason to live.  Yet if a paladin isn't there just start the ch casting 7 seconds before the warrior engages and have that cleric then follow with DA itself.<br>
<br>
It left group heals on your list too.  Hmm a 200 hp-ish group heal is so valueable I see 30 some odd level clerics use it once in a while.  Or did you mean or group heal over time spell?  Ya that gave the paladins a job as AoE healers on raids becuase clerics similiar spell was  about the same so why stress on finding more clerics when their's always a out of work paladin floating around.  Oh wait vi just upgraded clerics group heals and instead of being limited to range and group members vi is allow the cleric to AoE group heal.  I.E they will be the preferd by large portion AoE healers now.<br>
<br>
Finaly you envy my divine Aura.  Yes apperantly so did shadow knights cause they just got the same spell I got at 55 at 51 and because of that my spell will now be reduced to 51.  The cleric had my DA at lvl 1.  The necro at 22.  So now the sk's will be required on raids to help the warriors retain Aggro and my seldom used nitch of DA pulling is now worth less when another class my equal and with the bonus of haveing FD can use my ability.  Please with PoP going up to 70 there be no reasons sk's couldn't have gotten this spell at lvl 65 instead of 51.<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
Looking at the rest of your trash<br>
<br>
Aggro.  With new changes on test I'm thinking warriors will be equal in paladins when aggroing and sk's now move ahead to the first slot by a far margin when claiming the role of tank aggroer.<br>
<br>
As for the AA abilites.  vi messed up useing math.  You guys are getting some AA's that you should have had from start.  Of corse the rogues and monks getting them is totaly bullchips.<br>
<br>
Then you went to envy that you already coverd above in your list and I've already torn your stupid arse list up in this post so nm about your repeating.<br>
<br>
Paladins retaining aggro is as much an art for us as it is for warriors.  If you think clicking a shield and offhand weapon in n out with your right hand is too hard for yourself then I assure you the paladins knowledge of which spells work in which way and what to do when they fail to wrok as paladins need them to do is like compareing a cleric hot key healing to a bard twisting 4 songs and fighting.<br>
<br>
When warriors use dual wield and paladins use 1handers and shields warriors win.  When warriors use two handers and their 800AA points invested in offensive traits and their offensive disc the warriors out damage paladins.  As for slay undead?  Please tell me what boss mob that's tagged undead are you jelous of me over?  There might be what 3 of them?<br>
<br>
As for exp?  It costs a boat load of AA to get SU3.  We then use it to solo undead to get the other AA we have.  And yes a paladin needs to get more AA points then warriors inorder to be equal in power to a warrior.  &lt;&lt;-- I said &quot;power&quot; not tanking before you missquote me here.<br>
<br>
Paladins have always, just like shadowknights and some monks, been able to kill boss mobs that their guilds have begun to farm.  Not the top boss mobs for a guild just the ones that are now beneith the guild and easy to do for the guild.  Wow when are you going to b-tch a 60 paladin can solo the king in lower guk?<br>
<br>
The new shield changes on test.  This is something every peerson should be worried about for the following reasons<br>
<br>
Will ghetto bashing allow a warrior to aggro as much as a spell casting paladin?<br>
<br>
Will paladins useing 1hs/bash/spells be greater taunter then warriors useing ghetto bashing and/or 1handers and bash?<br>
<br>
Will clerics and their new &quot;meleeing exp grinding soloing&quot; be one more slot in exp groups a cleric can fill?<br>
<br>
Will rangers become more viable as tanks?<br>
<br>
Will warriors have broken taunt with 1 handers and shield?<br>
<br>
And there's a few more concerns about this that currently slip my mind.<br>
<br>
As for the f-cking halfbreed comments.  -insert major flame of original poster here-.  I'm a paladin not part cleric and/or part warrior.  I'm a gosh darn f-cking paladin and nothing else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
As for you being the f-cking champion over me?  -insert sexual flame of the original poster here-<br>
<br>
I'm a damn paladin and my damn class should always be equal to any other class on eq.  If you disagree with this you're a f-cking idiot -incert continueing flame here-<br>
<br>
I expect everquest to make every class equal and for my class to be champion over no other class and for no other class to be champion over me.  Any other attitude is so frigged up it's disgusting.<br>
<br>
btw do a fricken test and bring a crap thread like this over to the paladins of norrath board and instead of being pro warrior anti paladin, make it pro paladin anti warrior and watch how fast all us paladins flame the poster for being a shiphead.  Failure of you old time warriors to do the same thing to threads like this is what earns you my contempt.  <br>

I see that Paladin Trolls like to hang in this forum and spew forth crap.<br>
<br>
<br>
****Soulflayer's list of class envy spells of paladins. ****<br>
<br>
Interesting terminology, envy. Useful yes, but then again since they, according to you are in sense worthless, then if Verant patched them to warriors you wouldn't complain. My post on those skills were more or less to show people the wide variety of &quot;CHOICES&quot; that a Paladin has in his arsenal.<br>
<br>
<br>

One of the most needed spells for SoL high end encounters and you call it a joke. What level are you again? Still playing in Seb I can see.<br>

***Stuns &lt;-- Don't work on raid mobs and hardly ever works on other mobs. It builds less aggro on mobs it doesn't work on.<br>
Divine Stun &lt;-- See &quot;Stuns&quot; It basicaly equals a manaless stun oh ya I already have more single target stuns then I need. ***<br>
<br>
LoL... Agro is the same if the mob is 100% immune or resists the spell or has a greater spell that a lower one can't overwrite. When using Willsapper I have np regaining agro from procs even well after a Shaman has slowed with Turgurs. Stuns are a great tool besides agro, watching a mob begin to cast CH and warriors can only try for a bash, Paladin breaks out a stun which is followed by a bash.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
***Roots &lt;-- Works on no boss mob and with summon would it make a difference? ***<br>
<br>
Root on its own is an artform of what it can be used for. Poor man mez. Root, back up and heal. Root, get summoned and back up and heal. Root Pulls to get one less mob, on a pull to buy the party precious time to kill the mobs that did come. Stop Runners.<br>
<br>
<br>
***BMB &lt;-- yes often time exp groups and raids are made by the huge factor of someone having a couple hundred hp. Oh ya right***<br>
<br>
Yes, a few hundred hit points, hell, just a few HP has bought me time for that CH to land when Mr. AoW was pounding the living crap out of me. Now your statement is interesting. Why? Because you just stated a few hundred hp isnt a huge factor. Yet, isn't that one of the only attributes that seperate a Warrior from a Hybrid Class? Ohh... yea .. its AC but fek, I see that Paladins can easily ride side by side on AC with warriors and surpass them. So...... where is the advantage to the warrior? Defensive? Evasive?<br>
<br>
<br>
***It left group heals on your list too. Hmm a 200 hp-ish group heal is so valuable I see 30 some odd level clerics use it once in a while ***<br>
<br>
You sure you play a Paladin? Healing Wave of Prexus does a 660 heal INSTANTLY with a 2 sec cast time. Lets go into this a little more since this seems to be spell you don't mem or if ya need come by TM and I will give you a copy. Healing Wave when combined with AA skills can be a killer in its own right. Our Paladins in guild with Healing Adept and Healing Gift can bust out 1300  Crit Heals. Usually in one cast of Healing Wave its not uncommon to see 2 Heal Crits in a party of 6. Now lets see..... 1300 x2 and 720 x4 = 5480 hp you just healed a banged up party for.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
***Finaly you envy my divine Aura. Yes apparently so did shadow knights cause they just got the same spell I got at 55 at 51 and because of that my spell will now be reduced to 51. The cleric had my DA at lvl 1. The necro at 22. ***<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh yes, every melee class does envy this spell. Warriors have one to a lesser degree but at the cost of roughly 60 minutes to refresh and only lasts 8 seconds to boot. Necro gains Harm Shield at level 20 btw.<br>
<br>
<br>
***Please with PoP going up to 70 there be no reasons sk's couldn't have gotten this spell at lvl 65 instead of 51.***<br>
<br>
Ahh are we getting jealous of another class? Are they infringing on your turf? Funny, I thought you were lecturing me on envy. Now ya have a minor feeling of how us warriors feel when other classes infringe on us.<br>
<br>
<br>
***Slay Undead ( Damage that can hit 6k on a hit ) &lt;&lt;-- ya great cause it only costs a boat load of aa points and only allows me to grind more aa points by my self***<br>
<br>
36 AA pts a boat load? Nah. Especially when everyone can AA ding once a day, can ding 4 times in 20 hours in CT also. Iustus ( Paladin ) on our server has past 200 AA pts a few months ago, lost track of what he is at now. The ability to even do 6k in a xp dungeon in a single hit, is just feking stupid. Hell, Wizards unless they use MB can't even hit that much even with Garrisons Sup Sundering. I would take a Paladin any day I do a Howling Stones XP grind over a rogue.<br>
<br>
<br>
***Aggro. With new changes on test I'm thinking warriors will be equal in paladins when aggroing and sk's now move ahead to the first slot by a far margin when claiming the role of tank aggroer.***<br>
<br>
lol I highly doubt a Warrior will ever equal a Paladin in Agro. Paladins can command agro in the form of a spell or a proc while warriors command agro through only a proc, taunt button = sense heading button.<br>
<br>
<br>
***I'm a damn paladin and my damn class should always be equal to any other class on eq. If you disagree with this you're a f-cking idiot -insert continueing flame here-***<br>
<br>
Ahh how do you equate equal? Your AC is the same as warriors, you can do the same damage as warriors, your HP is very close to warriors, better if self buffed comparison, you gain more Mitigation Skills in AA then Warriors. Now whats left that a warrior has to compare with? Oh yes we get Crits as a Warrior.....wait a feking moment....they gave that to all classes as a AA skill. Paladins keep going in advantages into spells. Funny how classes with spells always say they suck but when you ask a warrior they would give an arm and leg for simple spells like HP spells, Invis, Snare or Root. With all this we can now realize that a Paladin is better at solo'ing and brings more to a raid and group then a warrior.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
***Then you went to envy that you already covered above in your list and I've already torn your stupid arse list up in this post so nm about your repeating.***<br>
<br>
Only thing you have demonstrated through this post is you lack of knowledge of playing the class of Paladin. This why you now post over here? Paladins on the other boards laughed you off them? This can be seen in your knowledge of your spells, the word Versatility. In order to see a warrior from gaining help and/or Paladins taking a nerf you attacked this post in hopes to hide the Paladins Strengths and down play them. Oh don't get me wrong, this post isn't just Warriors vs Paladins, you can insert SK, Ranger, Rogue, and Monk. I just chose to take the time and magelo the Paladin in top gear and a Warrior in top gear and compare. As to flaming you, I don't really need to work on that, you do a fine job flaming yourself with a post like this.<br>
<br>
<br>
On a personal note, I think many Classes need to be balanced, not just Warriors. The key word is balanced, which means classes will gain and or lose abilities/stats/spells. <br>

I really dunno where your getting these numbers, a made up profile of a paladin that is completed whored up by their guild having 100% choice of anything they want?<br>
<br>
Self Buffed HP, that may be nice for soloing, but in groups/raids Both Warriors and Paladins will have aego, or POTC, or similar high level buff spell, Soloing? Its not hard to find a cleric and buy Aego, or even find a paladin to cast BMB:P<br>
<br>
Skills:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> CH Lay of Hands </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Nice Spell, Keep in mind it takes AA points and has long ass refresh.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Shield of Words </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Cleric Spell overwrites these, as does aego, and you just complained about AC cap :P (This only add's to AC)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Resolution  </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Cleric/Druid SPells overwrite, Decent Spell for soloing, avaibility of Aego/Potc sorta downplays this advantage<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Greater Remove Curse </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Highly Needed for lots of high end encounters, spell is pretty rare, and Paladins arnt usually the first one to get it, Generally (Yes some guilds may do it differently) Druid &gt; Shm &gt; Paladin &gt; Cleric for order.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Stuns </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Stuns are Nice, unfortunatly most are resisted/immune good for aggro however<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Divine Stun </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Lots of AA points, most things 55+ are just tagged stun immune anyways, and can shut down most CHer's without spell by nuking or moving them, bad refresh time, so if you find a target it works on, you stun it once, then it can cast again. Still a useful skill, But I didnt see you put rampage on warrior advantages: P<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 90% Res </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Self Haste</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

BMB Only Need one paladin for this for raids, groups/solo groups can probabily get if they asked a paladin.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Heals</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Superior Heal is too slow, and not enuff, its decent with fast cast, but its only moderatly useful on raids. CC is good for keeping up casters, unfortunatly its lowest on HoT, and is always overwrriten. There is a new Cleric spell on test that can overwrite this, potentially lessening the use of it, but hell thats not live, thats not a present advtanage/disadvantage (More on this later)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Slay Undead ( Damage that can hit 6k on a hit )</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
To get 6k a hit, you'd have to have 60 or 61 DMG weapon, Only ones I really know of is that UP one w/ bad ratio, and that axe inVT with the bane to make it an good ratio, and to my knowledge theres no Undead in VT. (Correct me If i'm wrong here)If we're talking bout that UP hammer, warriors can get 1300 Crippling blows with it on any monster ;P<br>
Slay is definatly nice, but as many has mentioned there are few places that its useful, VS, IV, Rhag 1,2,3. Few nice places for soloing, but not an abondance, and its not really too much of an increase over FG XP rate.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Dispells</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Nice, but lot of other class's have this, Not too useful<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Cures</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Anti Undead Spells</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The ratio on these is so outdated, the DPS Increase from using these is minimal due to lost melee DPS (And since your fighting undead, thats less time for IoN or Slay to proc)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Holy Forge</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Warriors have PE on test, but thats not Live yet, so point taken. Warriors with EB weapons arnt quite as easy to rip aggro off of, and can hold aggro pretty damn well unless someone on a raid is a tard and cant control their aggro, and Warriors STILL tank better due to high skill caps and HP. Before someone responds that not every warrior has access to EB weapons, Point taken, but not every paladin has enough gear to be withing a few hundred HP of a warrior either, this is espcailly true if you dont have access to EB weapons.<br>

Maybe talking about Luclin DT, I havnt fought Shei yet, so dunno exactly how it works, but thats a pretty small advantage area, and I dont know about any other Mob with Luclin DT, cept old emporer, and he was changed, I'm sure there are some more though, but barely any on the large scale.<br>

That 2h part is not true(Cept the undead part, but we're that totally makes sense from a RP/class perspective)<br>
Given Equal weapons, Lets say Emp 2hder, or palledus axe, warrior will outdamage due to superior skill caps, flurry (as long as we're talking bout Pallies with slay 3!) and tripple attack (May not raise DPS much, but it still does)<br>
I see where your coming from though, there is a lack of warrior 2hders between Creator, and Emp. If we go back to ToV, warriors got the advantage of weapons however, Palledus is both, and TSBS is better then any Pal 2hder for straight damage (and far easier to obtain)<br>
You have a point if we're talking bout tunare weapon, unfortunatly due to its proc, it will be bagged on a lot of raids.<br>
Another thing working againg warriors, which is more of a warrior/guild choice, is that pallies (and SK's) are just more likely to get a 2hder, because they wil be using it all the time, warrior has to use 1h combo, and 2h, making it less effecient for warriors to get one, so less likely to be awarded one, or use DKP.

<br>
So Trade one imbalanec against another?<br>
<br>
<br>
One thing about being a Hybrid, is we have to work a LOT harder to get all these advantage's, warrior will be done AXPing after CA3/CS3/ND3 AE taunt, and possile Abidex flurry, and Rampage. Hybrid needs about 150 or 200 AXP points get max out their  effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Oh Yah, Iustus is a pally, but guess what, he 3 box's, if a warrior 3 boxed they could have many points, and this is just one person, hardly having anything to do with Entire paladin/warrior balance as a whole.. and BTW Dunric has 250 or so now.<br>
<br>
Paladins can do a lot, but cant do it all at the same time.<br>
<br>
One problem with warriors, is that there is simply too many of them, LOT of people switched to warriors/made warriors on suggestion of friends in the kunark/early velious era, and all these are dinging/dinged 60. Number in guilds partially  reflect this, most big guilds will have 8 or so Warriors and maybe 3or 4 pallies.<br>
<br>
There is also the diffuculty curve. When breaking *new* ground, for the most part your gunna need warrior to tank it, however, after that, farmed it a little, farmed similar mobs for so long that its boosted the pal/sk HP/AC gear enuff so its possible for them to tank it, there almost no matter what HAS to be a point, (except at the very upper crux of melee damage) that through the aciqustion of gear, and AA points that a pal/sk can tank it, if not, because, a warrior of less gear, has to beable to tank it. The problem is, that due to mudflation, and the length of the time the game has gone on, is that the end of the curve is much easier to reach now.  If a pal/sk cannot ever tank a raid type mob except at the very upper crux of pure melee damage (AoW type DPS) there would be a trickledown that makes a worse tank, to such a degree, that it is not good to have them be the main tank to in XP group, and as much as some warriors may like that, our utility/dps is *rarely* enuff to warrant our presence in an xp group.<br>
<br>
However, maybe suprisingly I do agree that warriors need some upgrades, I got some ideas, probably wont like em cause they came from a paladin, and I'll admit I&quot;m not as in touch with the issues, as a warrior is, but sometimes a outside perspective is good (just as a non warrior/pal/sk would beable to look at war/Knight balance with less of a biased eye, I'll admit it, i'm somewhat biased;P) <br>
<br>
So Here some ideas I had which I think might improve the warrior class, w/o breaking the game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Taunt</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
On every taunt, the taunter gains Taunt skill/4 (Rough number) amount of hate, if they do not have agro of the mob. In addition, the way taunt currently works stacks with this, IE, on a sucessfull taunt, the taunter would get aggro + Skill/4. However, once they gain aggro, taunt works in the exact same way, IE, no taunt is added after agro is gained, with the exception of going from Non agro, to agro status.<br>
<br>
This would hopefully address being less reliant on procs, and beable to gain aggro more effectivly, however, to keep the game challenging, no taunt is gained, by the use of the taunt skill, after agro is established, so people still have to manage their aggro.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Taunt Weapons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
There is a lack of weapons between EB/SoD (If Sod is still aviable) besides the ever so hard to find Willsapper, besides the still rare, Skybreaker. These weapons would be added to the game<br>

These Two weapons would could give Warriors some more choice in weapons, and make the curve to EB Weapons more smooth.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HP</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Since I doubt verant will ever nerf a class, espcially their beloved monks.<br>
Just as Clerics gain an innate 5% to all heals, Warriors would gain an innate 5% to all HP items.<br>
<br>
PE Would Be War/Pal/SK, all current BRD/RNG with the ability would be given their 5 points back. (i'm dreamin)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> AA</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Ambidex in addition to its current properties, would give offhand damage bonus, Lvl 1: 3, Lvl2, 6, Lvl 3, 9. (These numbers are for what it would be at lvl 60).<br>
<br>
Add Class AA for warriors: Weapons Training Mastery, 9 Points, Increases your attack while wielding any weapon by 75 points.<br>
<br>
Add Class AA for warriors: Skill Mastery (Need better name) This would raise all skill defensive skill caps, not already maxxed by 10 points.<br>
<br>
This would hopefully try to keep the proper ratios of dmg more in line at the end game.<br>
<br>

Warriors are hearty individuals, however, they dont deal with magic too well, Instead of Innate bonus resitance MR, change it to the CR/FR/DR/PR, as warriors are good in suriving in the elements. Due to their stanima, and surivibility, warriors have an innate 5% chance to outright resist ANY FR/CR/DR/PR attack<br>
<br>
Due to their lack of casting spells, and their general lack of knowledge about Magic, warriors take an extra 10% dmg from any spell marked magic, if the spell isnt outright resisted. (If it is resited, they take 0 damage)<br>
^ This is to balance out some of the other change to warriors, as to try to give the class a little bit more indiviudaulity.<br>

It may in fact take more gear and/or more AAXP for a Paladin to reach a point where he is able to tank boss mobs.  However, the very fact that he can, means there is less need for a Warrior as a result.<br>
<br>
Paladins are already one of the tanks of choice for experience groups, for those of us who still form pick up groups.  A well equipped Paladin brings much more to the table than an equally well equipped Warrior.  Which is kind of sad.  There should be some kind of parity, but there just isn't.  800-1k and defensive are meaningless in an experience group unless that group is truly pushing the envelope on what one group can accomplish.<br>
<br>
And Paladins have a real incentive to gain AAXP.  The benefits they gain are enough to get them over the hump of boss mob tanking.  A Warrior gets there with the right gear, so its easier for him.  But he has less incentive to work AAXP.  And if Paladins feel their class AAXP options aren't ideal, check out a Warrior's.  Other than AE taunt, the rest are pretty much considered cotton candy kind of additions.  Nice to have, but not really all that helpful.  Certainly not game changing.<br>
<br>
I do like some of your suggestions Maldrone, and its good to see that other people are begining to see and understand the issues.<br>

<br>
 All I know is that I'm damned discouraged with EQ.  I started out as a druid a 1.5 years ago and after getting up in level discovered that they weren't invited to play in the end-game because they didn't offer much other than a ride. <br>
<br>
About Jan, this year started a warrior because I wanted to be viable in the endgame. I'm sure I read about some grumbling concerning taunt and I did look at all the melee sub-classes but decided I couldn't go wrong being a warrior. <br>
<br>
Hell, now VI starts fixing the druid class that I orginally started with and unbalances the entire melee sub class.  WTF!  I guess the answer is Ebay!   Go buy a damned Pally, since this class is working beautifully that way I can recover some of time I invested in my warrior.<br>
<br>
Who knows, maybe after EQ-3, they'll get around to fixing the warrior class in EQ-1.<br>

VI (in order to make encounters 'challenging') have once again exacerbated vast differences between optimized and representative raid forces through ignorant itemization.  Furthermore XP settings have to continually push the 'tanking envelope'.<br>
<br>
Right now there is a 'plate' problem.  It isn't warrior specific although warriors are the most disadvanated atm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Raids<br>
<br>
<br>
The 'useful' spells a paladin has on a raid are:<br>
<br>
Brells<br>
Healing Wave of Prexus<br>
Stuns (for positioning mobs and locking up adds)<br>
Superior Heal (cast time/hp healed on it make it from marginal to somewhat useful depending on target)<br>
<br>
There is a 52 point (~150 atk) difference between war and knights.  That coupled with warriors possessing triple attack, flurry, and ambi probably account for a 80/100 dps ratio between them.  (I am not counting SU3.  If I raid 30 mobs in a week and 2 are undead I am lucky.  If you want to average it in then say 81/100, but to use SU3 dps as representative is misleading.  I could put in 32k mob, who I fight more than I do undead ones, dps where warrior with their discipline do too much damage relative to paladins.)                      <br>
<br>
An FD monk with rez stick is much more useful than a paladin rez in most raid settings.  HP are lower, d/p/r are lower.  No damage reduction discipline.  But they do present huge taunt potential.                     <br>
<br>
In a raid setting I think the pal/war are actually fairly well balanced.  On non ae mobs warriors (via higher dps when non defensive and the ability to go aggressive) are better iteratively.  On 'reasonable' AE mobs paladins via their group heal and 80% ish damage are better iteratively.<br>
<br>
More than *anything else* dps need to be brought back to the roughly 0.8/1.0/1.2/1.4 numbers.<br>
<br>
Secondly, give a final damage reduction factor.  This reduces the minimum as well as avg or max hit.  Make it 0% for silk/leather, make it 5% for chain, make it 10% for bards, clerics, make it 20% for knights, and 30% for warriors.<br>
<br>
Leave defensive in.  Will that 'trivialize' things that are hard now?  Sure.  But if you take it out you then have to jack up the warrior reduction factor even higher to balance them against other classes.<br>
<br>
Thats what happens over time in EQ.  Everything becomes easier.  It leave you a choice, do you:<br>
<br>
a. Let a defensive warrior tank (with transistions).<br>
b. Let a sole warrior tank from beginning to end.<br>
c. Let a knight tank.<br>
d. Let others tank (should not be more than a very short speed bump, and never desirable).<br>
<br>
The reason why I would modify it as above is that each a-c has its advantages.  A is the least mana intensive (by *far*) but may result in a longer fight from reduced force DPS.  C is the most mana intensive of the three, but with the most room for sloppy aggro.  B is a solid middle choice between A and C.<br>
<br>
Warriors (and ONLY warriors) should have a gauranteed minimum hate added from use of taunt skill.  Maybe 5 points per mob level.  Play with the numbers.  That would be 350 points per press of taunt.  If successful the taunt places them +350 points hate or on top of list (whichever is greater).  If it doesn't succeed it places them 350 points higher than before.  This helps to moderate the taunting edge that knights currently have.  Knights will still be able to outaggro and frankly with weaker defensive abilities that is the only thing that even makes them viable.  Run the numbers, maybe that is too much presenting no aggro control problems at all, maybe its too little.  Put in some numbers, run tests, find a nice point where a force with a defensive warrior can manage aggro if they work together.<br>
<br>
Oh, given the above changes outright remove any and ALL direct hate modifying procs.  For example, take EB off BoCs and put on a 150pt no resist dd proc on them instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.  XP<br>
<br>
The damage reduction factor and taunt improvements will help while XPing too.  With increased XP for higher level mobs this will help warriors get more 'good xp'.  An additional 2-3 CT like zones will help as well.  If done right no one would want to 'solo' for XP.  With this the case it must not be overdone as sk only other role for group (pulling) is much better done by monks in most cases and paladins have no real group role outside of tank in places like CT.  In that setting the higher dps of a warrior, better mitigation, better avoidance, and ability to go defensive would very favorably match up with the better aggro and utility of the knight classes.<br>
