Of these about 50 are active players. <br>
We have 42 people flagged for PoV/S all being above 60 of these 21 are flagged for BoT and 6 for HoH.<br>
At any given time we will have about 22 to 30 people on. This is fairly well-balanced. We will have from 2 to 5 clerics, 1 to 3 enchies, 1 to 3 shammies, 4 to 6 tanks, a smattering of nukers and other classes on at any given time. <br>
Although our players aren't poor players, some need better equip and need better raiding skills. Our top two or three groups have decent equipment, and I'm the main tank on most raid mobs topping out at between 7500 and 7700 hps and about 1350 to 1400 ac. Our secondary tanks range from 5800 to 6500 hps and all are around the 1200 to 1300 ac range maybe some a little lower and some a little higher. I have good enough weps to not have terrible aggro problems and when I see a big problem I use AE taunt.<br>
<br>
Now here is my question. I need to find a raiding path to get our people more practice and to start getting into the raiding end of the game a little more. I don't want to raid 7 days a week, but would settle for 2 to 3 times a week. I also expect as we defeat certain mobs our numbers will grow some and quite frankly they are continuing to grow as it is.<br>
What is a good path of raiding for our guild to take? We are all on dragon faction. What mobs should we start out on and from there, where should we go to? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roshinbertson>roshinbertson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/19/03 12:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need some raid advice</span><hr size=1> ToV ToV ToV<br>

<br>
PoP isn't the place to do it. There aren't any really good raiding targets for 22 people there, due to the high dps/low hp targets.<br>
<br>
You can try the POI dragon to get people EB weaps and shims, but you might be a little light there too...<br>
<br>
You probably won't have the DPS to keep up with the longer luclin fights, in terms of mana.<br>
<br>
Sounds to me like you are going to need all 22 people to be level 65 with a ton of AA's and specifically farm upgrades from AoW(someday)/First Brood/RoS/Tmax/Yelinak/Dain...<br>
<br>
You need to be more specific. The only way people skip NToV for the most part is numbers, levels and AA points. You are missing at least one of those things... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumbleroot>Bumbleroot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/19/03 2:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need some raid advice</span><hr size=1> Thanks Kal, that is definitely something to consider. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimmlokk>Grimmlokk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 1077<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/19/03 3:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://grimmlokk.homestead.com/files/spinhead2.gif?flezbwidth=30&flezbheight=41?

The problem we have is clerics -- we have a single active cleric who enjoys raiding, which obviously is a problem for us. We have a few cleric bots we can log sometimes, and occasionally we'll get another cleric to show up, but I can't even think when we've had 3 clerics at the same event at the same time. Nevertheless, we're still killing minis in POS and have flagged pretty much the whole guild for pos/pov and most for BoT.<br>
<br>
How much muscle/clericage do you need for NToV? We could probably field 4 groups averaging 58-60, ToV gear and epics mostly, with 2 clerics, a druid and a shaman. Is that enough to get started in NToV? How much harder is NToV over ToV? <p><A href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=140750><img border="0" src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bdiebold5/tugedit.jpg"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leod>Leod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/03 3:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   NToV</span><hr size=1> 4 groups of 58-60 won't make it in NToV. 4 groups of 65s with some AAs and solid tight people, you can kill anything in NToV sides Yvemm (and RoVulak). <br>
<br>
With 4 groups of 58-60 you could kill SOME things in NToV. If your tight and got 4-5 clerics, 2 chanters, and the other necessary classes, you could kill some things. Flurries and named drakes, Lord Feshlak and Dagaarn, probably Lady Mirra and Lord Koi. That is if you have a 64/65 shaman...<br>
<br>
3 clerics isn't enough for NToV unless your already about done with it and you got 8k hp tanks. Honestly, on a 65 well equiped tank, the DPS on most NToV dragons is pretty small. 100-150 DPS range on most. <br>
<br>
Problem is Aary for ya'll with small forces. No way any group of 24 level 58-60s is gonna take out Aary that is just entering NToV (well, you COULD put together a group to do it, but it would be like hand picking classes, which no guild can do in your situation).<br>
<br>
<br>
To Bumble - I GOT to agree with the other comments here. NToV is the next step for you. In your situation, there is NO other place available to you to do massive quick upgrades.<br>
<br>
Think about your situation. You have a guild of 50ish people, with anywhere from 30-40 people online at a time. All those people need upgrades to move onto further content - it's how the game works. If you want to be effective in PoP, you need ALOT of upgrades as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
This is assuming the majority of your people are not equiped with NToV+ level gear already (never know these days with guild mergers, new content, etc).<br>
<br>
Three main places for this for those at your stage:<br>
1 - NToV<br>
2 - SSra<br>
3 - Raid every night<br>
<br>
<br>
NToV has 11 dragons in it, 1 wurm, 1 drake and 1 wyvern that drop superior gear.  Plus named drakes/flurries than drop shields that will be upgrades for 80% of yer mana users. When you go to NToV, on an average night with a guild your size, you can expect to kill Aary, flurries, and 2-3 other targets if you go in the evening, 5-8 targets if you can go raid for 8-10 hours on a Sat/Sun. This is assuming your server doesn't keep NToV clear and no one guild is in there farming is heavily. Dragons drops 2-3 loots each.<br>
<br>
SSra - think every server has people clearing this at all times, so you would be lucky IMO to get Rhag 1/2. And with skipping NToV, you got alot of work to do before you'll be taking out AL, HP, Cursed cycle or XTC with those numbers even if you were lucky enough to find them up. SSra is however the place most go after NToV for mass upgrading of their guild. <br>
<br>
Or, you can raid nightly. Pick a bunch of targets, hit a couple of them each night. PoS Lords, Vindi, Xana, lower end Luclin bosses (burrower, Va'Dyn, Servitor), etc. Assuming you could take out two raid targets per night, you can count on an average of 3 drops worthy of awarding plus misc stuff (ethereals and specs, your guild probably won't see many runes for awhile).<br>
<br>
If you really choose to skip NToV....well, that's sup to you. You don't have the force to take out First Broods I don't think, so ST isn't an option. Doesn't sound like you have the force for AoW or Tormax (Statue is probably doable if you have good solid high end shaman). Lords in PoS would be doable I think if you have 25-30 people on (depends on the ability and skill of your clerics, and your skills and abilities as a MT, and your leader - bad leadership and you cut your guilds available targets in half).<br>
<br>
Really, if you want to skip NToV, there are lots of targets available. None IMO that would serve upping your guilds overall power as a force to raid as quickly as NToV.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showPrevMessage?topicID=1867.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showNextMessage?topicID=1867.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.emailToFriend?topicID=1867.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.threadControl?topicID=1867.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1867.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1867.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield>The BattleField</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
