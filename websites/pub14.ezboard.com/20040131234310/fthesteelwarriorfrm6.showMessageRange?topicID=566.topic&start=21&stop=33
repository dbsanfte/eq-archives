It's funny though...I remember wizards always complaining in guilds that they need that staff off of VS...You know who had to tank his ass...Us Warriors.  Now look at them...They have their epic...They have their unreal nuke &amp; look how they repay us...They kill our epic mob &amp; make us have to save 80-150kpp just to get one.<br>

Sev is on a rotation. The biggest problem we have with sev right now is the ration. it is so very long. There are 44 guilds/alliances in the rotation. Sev spawns about 4 times a month. So that being said. it is 11 months between any warrior in your guild getitng there epic. And the clerics where bitching about having to stay up for 72 hours in a row.<br>
<br>
Now granted if our epic was a OMG weapon.  Then yes all of our time to get it would be worth it. But it is not that. the warrior epic is underpowered compared to the difficulty in retreaving it. And compared to the difficulty in others retrieving theres. And compared to longetivity of others epics. <br>
<br>
Rog epic's are easy to get, 2days and twelve poeple easy to get. But they also need to replace there epic about the same time we do. Palidans epics I thnk are a well balanced quest. right in the middle of everyone. Druid epic can be done with 2 groups too. but they are harder then the Rogue epic. And there epic can be used till the very end game stuff. Same goes for most casters. Cept the mages they have to go the the 7th? isle in PoA, which is pretty challenging. but not that hard. Time consuming. but usally you knocking out 4 poeples epics on one trip. Enchanter has a hard time gettniig the shissar in PoF. but still there epic can be used alot longer then the warriors can, and that is there only hard part. does Sev compare to shissar?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukinadafz60.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kinadafz60</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/30/02 6:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=566.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Green Scale</span><hr size=1> Quick question about the rotations.

The quest itself is one of the most well written plotted quests in the game.<br>
<br>
I am currently one step away from completing my swords.  I researched and read every line of text that goes along with this quest.  It is by far the most interesting quests in the game.  The creation of the swords, how they were used, how they were abused, how they were broken into pieces, and the story behind the Red Scabbard.<br>
<br>
Reading through most of the posts here all I see is a bunch of Warriors that just want their damn epic, and hell they don't even want to complete the entire quest.  Most of the posts here indicate that while you want the weapon you have'nt really put any effort into researching the quest.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now, common sense will tell you a red dragon scale makes a red sword, and a green dragon scale(in verants eyes) makes blue.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What quest are you doing?  The scales and their respective colors don't have anything to do with the blades, at all.  The scales are a test from the God of War Rallos Zek.<br>
<br>
Finding the parts to the swords is relatively eazy, but the Scabbard is where the true Quest lies.  All through the Quest for the Scabbard Rallos Zek is talking to the quester and sending him/her on different missions to &quot;test' their strengths as a warrior.  This is to prove to the god that you are worthy of the swords crafted by his sons.  The blades that in the end will serve a Warrior far better than most Warriors can hope to get pre NToV.<br>
<br>
As for people mocking the Warrior epic...  Either you have no sense or you've been there and done that and have better.  The Warrior epic is a mile stone through an expansion in Everquest.  Unless your lower teir guild is lucky enough to score a Warrior who's been through NToV and has a vew nice weapons plan on doing the Warrior epic.  The only Warriors I've actually seen mock the Epic are either to stupid to know better or have already destroyed it after it's usefullness was expired.<br>
<br>
My advise, Do the GD quest!  Enjoy playing your Warrior and enjoy the game.  It's a really well written quest despite the Sever bottle neck.<br>
<br>
The only way to fix Sever and not break one of the best quests in the game would be as follows;<br>
<br>
Add an additional NPC to Emerald Jungle.  One that also speaks to you as the God of War Rallos Zek.  After aquiring the F0ire Totem a hand in would be required to this new npc as proof of completing that part of the quest.  At which point the totem would be handed back to the questing Warrior and Sever would spawn as a weaker version of himself.  The dragon would have no loot table besides a No Drop, No Rent Green Dragon Scales.  This would also require Warriors to have the Red Dragon Scales before spawning Sever.<br>
<br>
After defeating Sever the questing Warrior would then return to EK and turn in both scales along with the totem.  At that point the normal quest would resume and Rallos would ask you as he has so many times before to seak out the undead bard in the plane of Hate.<br>
<br>
This thread has good intentions but the direction is all wrong.  Don't ruin one of the best parts about being a Warrior for all other Warriors in the game.  Don't even remotely harbor the idea of changing this quest to just get one sword.  The story behind this weapon is to powerfull to be watered down.<br>
<br>
STOP YOUR WHINNING AND JUST DO THE GD QUEST!  You might like it. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193604" target=new><font size=5 face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color=darkred>Keelz Neversleep</font></a><BR><font size=2 face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><I>

Three measly lousy drops.  Which my first guild would have been completely unable to aquire for me, since they couldn't have taken on the Spiroc Lord or the Queen in Chardok.  Let alone being able to respond to Sev's spawning faster than Team MB.<br>
<br>
My next guild wouldn't bother with the quest because they COULD get me things like Willsapper.  Why bother with a marginal weapon when you can get something as good or better with a lot less trouble?  At least that was their opinion anyway.<br>
<br>
And I've had all the rest of the items in the bank for close to a year and a half.  I got my red scale at level 49 in an open raid on Naggy.

You're a Warrior from christ sake.  The quest is not supposed to be eazy.  The blades are called &quot;Tactics&quot; and &quot;Stradegy&quot; for crying out loud.  Warriors are supposed to lead their armies into battle to win their prises.  Stop being lazy.

<br>
But you see, I don't desire it enough to want it changed or to go out and get it.  I'm no longer in a raiding guild.  My day to day weapons work just fine.  Other than as a status symbol, the epic would have no additional value for me.  And I couldn't possibly do the spiroc lord or queen in chardok with just a couple of groups of friends.<br>
<br>
So the quest pieces just continue to take up room in my inventory, I should probably delete them, but just don't have the heart. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhyardgune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hyardgune</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/2/02 7:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=566.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Green Scale</span><hr size=1> I'm eager to go out and get it, don't get me wrong, but I am not so eager to pay 75-150k for the scale, especially since 75k is more than twice the value of all of my gear combined.  I'm working on my Epic, slowly and half-heartedly because I know I am a long, long way from ever being able to afford it.<br>
<br>
As someone in a lower tier guild without the resources to assemble and kill Sev before the MB team arrives. I'm kinda screwed, as are a lot of us in pretty much the same situation.<br>
<br>
I like your idea for fitting an EJ turn-in into the quest, making it possible to go and kill a spawned, no loot table Sev.  That would solve a ton of problems, plus it would remove team MB from the quest.<br>
<br>
Like I said in another thread, with all these plane raids and fights against powerful creatures, there is a lot that's epic about getting your Epic, hoarding enough cash to buy that damn scale just isn't epic. <p>Hyardgune Varangian <BR> 58 Ogre Myrmidon of Gathered Might <BR> Solusek Ro</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugalaian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>galaian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/3/02 9:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=566.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Green Scale</span><hr size=1> You say go out and do the quest.  I've done the damn quest.  I've done everything up to getting the green scale.  I'm the only warrior in my guild that's gotten this far in the quest.  Yet with the bottleneck that is Severlious, I will never be able to finish the quest.  In 6 months, I've heard of ONE guild getting the dragon.  Every other spawn was burned before anyone could even call together a raid sized force.  I don't have 160k to buy a greenscale from the greedy lowlife wizards who steal an epic item they should have no reason even touching.<br>
<br>
I won't even ask my guild to go to PoA for 2 days to get the drop there, nor will I ask them for any other help.  Without this one item, it's all a waste of time.  I've helped with EVERY OTHER epic in the game.  I've been there to see many of my friends recieve their epics after the final turn in.  None will see me recieve mine unless VI/SOE does something to fix this.<br>
<br>
Making Sev a triggered spawn by handing in the totem is a good idea, even if it's only once every 24 hours.  But make the scale lore nodrop.  That way someone does it once and moves on.  <br>

<br>
He studied up on the epic and led pick-up raids for air and for Air and for Chardok.<br>
<br>
He had a 100% no BS policy on the raids and as a result, got only people that were dedicated and willing to see it through to the end.<br>
<br>
He admitted that the Scale was going to be impossible to get so he spent all his time in high pp drop camps xp'ing to get enough money to buy a scale.<br>
<br>
It IS possible. You just have to be willing to take the time and effort to do it. Being in a high-end raid guild where they can get you willsapper, etc, increases your chances 10x. Just getting 4 or 5 level 60 high AA friends who care enough about you to come on your pick-up raids can be enough to swing the outcome for you.<br>
