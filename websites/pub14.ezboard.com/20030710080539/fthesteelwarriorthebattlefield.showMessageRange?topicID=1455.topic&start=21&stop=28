It's called bad luck.  You know what I say to people who have an instance of bad luck?  BUMMER.  if your group is good enough an your cleric gets screwed like that, do it again!  There is no sense making an exploit for EVERYONE just to benefit that .01% chance that your cleric will unfortunately die in the last fight (btw how exactly is this going to happen?  druid unlikely to keep warrior alive in this fight, so cleric would have to die in final few minutes... and chances of that happening are like 0)... sounds like the same kinda luck that makes the MA get charmed and get group killed, or the cleric charmed and cannot cast heal; all of these are instances of bad luck and warrent a redo... if your group is good enough it shouldnt be a problem anyway.  I would gladly redo a trial so my cleric could get valor flag, especially since doing that would keep some loser chumps from gettin flags using the same bug and running all over the zone training people.  I dunno, maybe I'm the only one that thinks one more try would be worthwhile.<br>

I've also heard of a group whose cleric died ... In fact, there is a LOT possible with this trial. I've done it AE-style, I've done it with traditional crowd control, I've done it with a shammy AE-slowing, SK maintank and me as tankmezzer (crazy, but fun as hell =P).<br>
<br>
With the druid as mainhealer, I died just before the Executioner died - I think he missed a heal because pets were pushing it OOR. Although I generally consider this an exploit (nothing more than MQ-ing though) , I did not mind getting it this way. I was part of the team who did the trial, the mob I helped kill was there to be looted still. In my mind there is nothing wrong with getting it this way, even though I am aware the timers are not meant to be this way.<br>
<br>
This alone is not enough reason to NOT fix this bug, in my opinion. I wouldn't mind if they increased the timer so this wouldn't be possible. I was just lucky, but like what Grendon says, if it wasn't possible, it would be just bad luck and I would do it again no problem.<br>
<br>
I do not feel bitter towards people getting it the easy way, I just wouldn't want to get it like that myself - the trials are way too much fun for that.<br>
<br>
I do wish they somehow find a way to decrease the waiting line.<br>
<br>
Btw,there seems to be a bug with slow on the Executioner. I heard slow doesn't really do anything at all, even if it sticks (I certainly regard him the fastest slowed mob I ever fought =P). I did hear that the lvl 24 chanter slow (50 % one) DOES work, so maybe the bug is that slow goes too high. I'll check my logs to see what the differences are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pilerboy>pilerboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/11/02 10:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: CHEAT your way to PoV (cross post)</span><hr size=1> You are absolutely correct- all slows above 50% ARE bugged on the executioner... on my first attempt our enchanter died without slowing the executioner (lag spike + resist = death).  Thinking it was hopeless, I pulled out my truncheon of doom and stuck the slow.  The chanter was then field rezzed, burned a charge on his mod rod, medded up, casted C3, Medded some more, and reslowed the mob with his 70% slow.  The mob then acted as though entirely unslowed, at least tripled in amount of rampages, and kicked our ass.  We had figured the bug out though, ran through again, and totally demolished him.  And with further thinking to Kraz's statement... if you're REALLY that concerned about cleric not being able to be rezzed, bring a freakin pally.<br>
<br>
Grendon<br>
<br>
Oh, and btw: When I spoke of the likelihood of a druid finishing off as healer, I wasn't saying druids cant pull it off... I was just saying the chances of a druid and a cleric in the same group having the cleric die and druid expected to take over as main healer wouldn't have much chance of survival... would take a very strong player and a very fortunate spell repitoir to pull it off.  Wasn't saying it can't be done, just saying it's a lot tougher to do =) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pilerboy>pilerboy</A> at: 11/11/02 10:14:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=barshemgud>Barshem Gud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/13/02 10:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: CHEAT your way to PoV (cross post)</span><hr size=1> All they need to do is make the reset time on the trial 35 minutes instead of 30, insuring the  corpse poofs before anyone else can enter.  <br>

This *does* need to be fixed, a guild on TM had the same high DPS group completing the trial, and then a few lamers standing at the tribunal spamming to enter to loot the marks, without ever completing the trial.

I've done it 3 times and only once was there another healer in group.  A smart shaman can easily keep up with the healing on this whole trial.  Incidentally the one time I did do the trial with a cleric, our ENC died on last wave and the CLR died to the Executioner due to him being in the wrong place at the wrong time...  I managed to heal the MT just fine for the executioner once slow landed, and he's easy to slow 50%... <br>
<br>
Fortunately, due to this &quot;bug&quot; the unflagged ENC was able to zone in and loot her mark with about 3 seconds left on the corpse, so we were quite happy about that.  It'd be nice if VI were to fix it such that those people who started a trial could rezone in if they died, but then again that also leaves the possibility for caster zerg rushes since you get FM after death...  So then you'd have people complaining about the group with 2 wizards that kept getting killed then rushing back in to nuke till OOM and repeating all the way through....  You know some gimp group would do it too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
