<br>
The real issue is that VI once again skipped fixing warriors.<br>
<br>
Why? Why would VI nerf monks instead of boosting warrior ac/hp?<br>
<br>
Answer?<br>
<br>
Knights. <br>
<br>
Think about it, seriously. Someone high up at VI plays a knight. If they boosted ac/hp, warriors might gain some kind of advantage on those two classes in tanking ability(logical as it may seem). In other words, they couldn't &quot;fix&quot; things by mitigation or ac/hp fixes because they would have to give warriors more of a &quot;fix&quot; than knights to keep things kosher- they wouldn't have been able to give knights and warriors the same increases and get away with it.<br>
<br>
Solution? <br>
<br>
Nerf monks. Knights stay right on(or ahead of) warriors asses, and all three classes improve on tanking abilities relative to monks(which was what really did need to happen). Monks got nerfed so that knights wouldn't lose out on mitigation table/ac/hp fixes to warriors.<br>
<br>
If you think that sounds a little crazy look into knight improvements in the past year or so and what they're getting in PoP. Hell, if they hadn't added the new heals in for priests, paladins would have been ahead of shamans in healing ability come PoP. <br>
<br>
Who do you think will step up if it turns out monks are having problems? Hmmm..who has better post nerf ac than monks, good hp, and FD(with AA boosts)... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhaass.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haass</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 542<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/9/02 6:32:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An open letter to Warriors from a Monk...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Or maybe, we could all work on improving this game instead of leaving up to the nimrods at Verant.Up to you.<br>

Unfortunately, it's not up to me, and you and I can't do crap to improve this game.  Like it or not, those &quot;nimrods&quot; at VI are the ones hitting the keys here.  I don't read the boards and based upon how the monk community strikes me today, either nerf them or buff them when I go home at nite.<br>
<br>
You can talk all day until you're blue in the face, and VI is still gonna do what they're gonna do.  The real question is, what are you gonna do about it?

Bite me. Level 56 and still 2 fights short of my Celestial Fists. Fungi's cost 65k on my server. Not ALL monks have them. That's like me saying &quot;I didn't know all warriors didn't have EB weapons. So they shouldn't bitch about lack of taunt and aggro since EB weapons exist.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya, you know what, about a month ago warriors went over to monkly business because we felt like we were on the short end of the stick, and we wanted to open some lines of communication and possibly inform monks of the mechanics that were causing our problems and work towards a comprehensive fix,&quot;<br>
<br>
Aye, well, morons are morons are morons. Whether you're at MB, Steel Warrior or the freakin Ranger's Glade. You DID get some peoples' attention over there, like me. <br>
<br>
Which makes many of your comments now sort of aggravating Haas.<br>
<br>
&quot;and for some reason the majority of the monks opinions were &quot;Shut up you whiny warriors, you just wanna be the focus of attention.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd invite you to read MB more frequently, but it's not worth it. Point is, you encounter that sort of dreck with a LARGE majority of the posts there no matter what the subject. It's just overflowing right now.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, forgive me for returning the favor, but shut the hell up. &quot;<br>
<br>
That's just mean man. Mean.<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all, Monkly-Business is FULL of moron monks wearing agi/dex gear that have less HP than my Greaves. These people are not the issue.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not really. Most monks don't wear that crap anymore. And the lower AC, lower HP, not yet level 60 monks are in danger of getting hit pretty by hard by the nerf bat (depending on how it swings). Maybe. Definitely need to wait and see how the morons at VI code this. But I'm already bracing myself for the worst. And that makes those people the issue, since they far outnumber the people the thing is designed to affect.<br>
<br>
In other words, I FULLY expect VI to mess this one up from the get-go. Then go back and Patch the PATCH. Like always. Either way, it's gonna suck hard for me.<br>
<br>
&quot;The people that are the issue are the ones that are selecting the HP/AC gear and not being retarded. Monks with comparable AC to warrriors CAN AND DO tank just as well as we do. &quot;<br>
<br>
Where? In XP groups? If so, good gravy that's so pointless a reason to do this!<br>
<br>
But I'm not here to complain about this or even to debate it much. Point is, SOME MONKS did respond to the warriors visiting MB.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THOSE MONKS ALSO PLAY WARRIORS. And frequent THIS board too. One of those monks is me.<br>
<br>
And some monks (like me) are already kinda bummed reading 45 pages of bullshit threads and morons whining about something that hasn't happened yet over at MB, and are just getting tired of reading it here TOO.<br>
<br>
Let's talk about warrior STUFF! And lay off the monks man. The nerf bat stings when it swings.<br>

<br>
If verant did something silly like give warriors the inate ability to proc something like sunstrike 3-4 times each minute of fighting - wizards might take an issue with that.<br>
<br>
Now, warriors arent wizards and we know that. But if we were running around the server on a killing spree knocking over lvl 55 mobs with little downtime, warriors would also bitch to high heaven if we got readjusted.<br>
<br>
Monk know they had it coming. Its not mystery to them, and they understand that verant tends to fix things slowly so if Verant fucks up the nerf and make it so monks are in great peril every pull because they die like wizards - its going to be a bad day to be a monk.<br>
<br>
If monks are kind of like rogues and rangers - they reasonable players, monks and otherwise, will be satisfied. But just like nobody would say a nerf of their class is good, monks arent either.<br>
<br>
Important to remember, this isnt about monk vs warriors. This is about Verant screwing up and attempting to fix it. Maybe monk, like clerics did and warriors apparently will, should get a gimmick to compensate for them losing an ability (although one they shouldnt have had). Warriors arent the bad guys here, neither are monks. And verant already took ownership of the problem. Maybe Monkly Business should focus on getting a &quot;gimmick&quot; out of this.<br>

<br>
While I am ultimatly lack the knowledge and time to do parses, I still think that number is somewhat wrong mathematically, Overall I will accept that block... blocks 6% of all attacks, but that  6% is more then 6% due to other skills and miss's.... <br>
<br>
Let me explain my thinking.<br>
(These numbers I am using are somewhat pulled outa my ass, however they I think are somewhat accurate based on whats I have read.. Feel free to put in &quot;real&quot; numbers.. however I feel my basis of my theory stays through.<br>
<br>
Lets say Mob A Parse has<br>
100 Swings<br>
<br>
Out of those 100 Swings (Monk)<br>
33 are straight out miss's<br>
4 are riposte<br>
4 are dodge<br>
9 are are block<br>
and 50 are hits.<br>
<br>
For a warrior<br>
100 Swings<br>
33 are straight out miss's<br>
4 riposte<br>
4 dodge<br>
3 are parry.<br>
56 are hits.<br>
<br>
So if you look at the amount of damage that block... blocked... it is actually 12% (Which is the fairly close to Warrior HP advantage.<br>
<br>
How did i get 12%, when the total amount blocked was 6?<br>
<br>
Simple, 50 of the hits never connected, so the block skill in blocked 12% of what would have been hits..<br>
<br>
This is not factoring in Mend/FD etc.<br>

<br>
&quot;Monks are DPS and pullers, not tanks&quot;<br>
pulling is tanking with out any healing. <br>
<br>
monk most likely will remain good Rampage tanks, due to how rampage works(not avoidance or anything else).<br>
<br>
Also I'm guessing the soft cap is remaining the same from this action(if soft cap was removed for all classes warrios would mig better then monks again)<br>
