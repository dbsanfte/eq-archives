Manaburn needs to get nerfed in PvP. It is blatently unfair. I play on Tallon Zek in a so-so mid level guild. I'm L54 with pretty much crap for gear. I am a poster child of the casual player so uber-ness isn't in my future (pesky thing about having 3 kids and a job... cuts into my EQ time).<br>
<br>
I am walking across the bridge into Thurg to buy some food. I was buffless at this point. An invisible wizzy from THE uber guild on the server (Pandemonium) manaburns me. Boom..... 2400 HPs to dead in one click. Gee, real fair fight there. Hope it was worth the 20 or so plat it netted him. /bad Verant.<br>
<br>
I am also working slowly towards my epic... and team mana burn on our server seems to have a lock on killing the Kunark dragons... hmmm. Wonder how much I will have to pony up for the Green scale.<br>

<br>
That's assuming a max hit on MB.  MB can hit between 1.5:1 up to 3:1 damage to mana.  If any of the wizards do not hit for max, they are out of luck.  To guarantee a kill with 6 wizards for a 32k mob, each wizard will need twice that much mana.<br>

That kinda goes back to my original statement that jerks will be jerks.  If some uber players came in and started attacking and ended up killing it, the same thing would happen.  But I concede that it is easier to do so with a MB team.  I wish there was a way to prevent people from being jerks, but it's not.  To me, that's akin to a level 60 rogue assassinating a quest mob I was doing a quest with (happened the first time I did my concussion quest, in karnor, just after I hailed the human skeleton).<br>
<br>
I also agree with your point of killing sev and not allowing content.  But I also need to note that on Bristlebane recently, Gorenaire was up for about 3 days before she was finally killed.  BB does have a manaburn team that could have easily killed her.  They knew she was up, too.  But they were in Vex Thal and Akheva raiding.  It's just not a worthwhile challenge after you've done it a couple times from what I've seen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Despite what many proponents of Team MB have claimed, no set of non-MB wizards can effectively and easily knock of Kunark Dragon level encounters like they can. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I disagree.  I've personally seen 6 people kill Gorenaire.  You get people with similar gear that a wizard with 3500 mana has and 23+ AA together and they can do a lot.<br>
<br>
I do understand the argument against it, but also look at the the way the game evolved.  Things have changed in ways not imaginable when the game was around.  I remember when having full crafted, FBSS, and 2 yaks would allow you to tank anything in the game.  People killing vox and naggy wouldn't be caught dead in that gear.  A nicely equipped warrior can tank a mob that would kill practically any other player in the game in 1 round (with a healthy CH rotation of course - another spell which could be argued as broken), yet it's the way the game evolves.<br>

Oh, one more thing:  The buff icon idea, while it would eliminate the MB team, it would also eliminate the true use of the spell.  The real use (my assumption based on the horrible ratio of the spell, and the way it works) is a last ditch effort to kill the mob.  If your raid is about to lose a fight, but is close enough to kill the mob if only you could do a quick 15k of damage, but only 1 of your 3 MB wizards can land MB, you're going to wish that ability was available. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/umuzzleme.showPublicProfile?language=EN>muzzle me</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/02 12:34:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> Buff Icon??  <br>
No thanks.  Ya it sucks.  But those that earnt the skill should be able to use it without having to worry that all their work is gonna be nerfed cause others on the servers are killing off mobs on a FFA basis.<br>

Of course not.  Everquest is built with balanced groups as a design goal.<br>
<br>
Even if 6 average equipped classes in a balanced group can kill Gorenaire (which of course, they can not), 6 wizards being able to do the same thing is still wrong.  There's no way to justify it, just as there would be no way of justifing 6 rogues as the best possible group in any other situation, or the best raid being 60 warriors.  As soon as a group requires 6 of the same class, that class is unbalanced - regardless of the circumstances.<br>
<br>
Pretend for a moment you're a designer, developing content.  You would like to add some content that isn't like Luclin content.  In other words, you would like to add some content that's actually exciting and fun, something like fights were in the original game with Vox and Nagafen, or even fights in Kunark.  Fights where you don't need a book or a television to survive it.<br>
<br>
However, you find quickly that you can't make this fight.  Why?  Because manaburn makes it trivial.<br>
<br>
No matter how much damage that mob does, no matter how resistant it is, no matter what is done - manaburn will take it down in 6 seconds.  Sure the room may have a lot of other mobs in it, so you have to have other people there besides the wizards, and that's great - but the fight itself will be trivial.<br>
<br>
There are three solutions to these two problems:<br>
<br>
1) Continue making boring fights, and buy stock in television companies.  Ignore class balance, since it's, like, Hard and stuff.<br>
2) Create manaburn immune mobs, or even make the ability not work at all in PoP.  Sure existing content stays shot to hell, not to mention life on PvP servers sucking more than usual, but at least the future game has a chance.<br>
3) Nerf manaburn now.<br>
<br>
Only one option is good for the game as a whole.<br>
<br>
Oh, and team manaburn?  Ours has earned about half a million plat, each, solely through the use of this one ability.  Quite a deal for 5 AA points.<br>
<br>
I'm sure rogues can use their Poison Mastery skill to make money just as fast, and warriors can save that kind of money with their Bandage Wound skill.  Since these UBER money making skills cost 18 points instead of 5, I'm sure they make money 3.6x as fast...right?<br>

PFAGH! The REAL cash is made in RAPID FEIGN. Oh yeah. Popping and dropping nets so much coin per hour that many MB capable wizards are thinking about giving that up and starting Team Poptart, a roving band of Rapid Feign monks that goes from old world boss mob to old world boss mob ganking them in no time flat and immediately auctioning the spoils of their victory in auc channel 1 and 2.<br>

Unsurprisingly, a mob that would mimic such a thing would have more HP than manaburn could &quot;trivialize&quot;. A nice, small to medium sized raid could do what? 1000 DPS? 2000 DPS? A nice one minute long fight would require a mob to have at least 100k hp, something that is not trivialized by MB.  Well, I suppose 15 wizards could walk up and MB it... but then again, 15 wizards could sunstrike Gore to death in 2 volleys when Kunark came out, and nobody ever complained about their ability to do  that.  If you're still worried about MB trivializing your 100khp encounter... *gasp* make a 2 minute battle with a mob who has 200khp.<br>
<br>
Or is 2 minutes so long that you need a book to suffer through it?<br>
<br>
<br>
Or, what is even better, is to realize that a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  variety</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of solutions is necessary for an entertaining game; not having every encounter require the same &quot;balanced&quot; group using the same &quot;balanced&quot; tactics. That PoP fight where you use 4 wizards to MB off the final boss will not be trivialized because the crawl to get there was an entertaining challenge. Even if 6 wizards was the best group under a certain circumstance, that is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> unbalancing. It becomes unbalancing if the all-wizard group is usually the best group, or nearly so... and that is not the case. <br>
<br>
<br>
Incidentally, 1-grouping gore does not require 6 wizards. A naked ranger with WS and 5 wizards could take gore down more reliably. In fact, I would be astonished if the smallest group capable of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  reliably</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> offing gore was only wizards; my bet would be on ranger + 3 wizards or bard + cleric + 1-2 damage dealers (rogue? ranger? wizard? dunno which one)... or maybe substitute an enchanter with DC for the bard.<br>
<br>
<br>
But, *gasp*, 1 grouping gore doesn't make anyone overpowered. Efreeti Lord used to be a 2 group raid, but can now be soloed; does that make the soloing classes overpowered? No! Old content has been trivialized because the standard is now set so much higher.<br>
<br>
<br>
Incidentally, I wonder how much greedy meleess made off of their Kunark armor, not because of any ability they had, but simply because they were their class? If someone could cheat others simply by being a particular class, I don't find it an overwhelming concern that a greedy person who spends a significant portion of your time AAXPing for a particular skill can cheat others. This is a politics issue, not a class balance one.<br>

I would agree with you except you gloss over one significant point.  The major difference between 6 wizards and 6 of any other class combination is this: 1, 2, 3...BAM Dragon dead, loot up.  There is no combination of character classes that you can name that would take out Gore or any other MBable dragon almost instantaneously.  The minimal risk for MB wizards comes from their being able to land enough damage on the Mob to kill it before it has a chance to react.<br>

<br>
It is a very nice AA skill, and maybe it shows how weak some other class AA skills are, but by no means should it be nerf'd just so that Wizard class AA can suck as bad as ours, or any other class.<br>
<br>
Can only speak for my server ( TM ), but I see very little change with the introduction of MB.  Our local MB team has only got Sev 1 out of the last 5 or 6 kills ( don't know about the others, ) but if the MB team does not get them, they still won't be up that long.  Everything dies so quickly on our server, that most guilds will jump at the opportunity to kill anything.<br>
<br>
The only other 'issue' I see people griping about is Risk vs. Reward.  People have tried to explain that there is 'risk' for a MB team; you either agree or don't.<br>

Again, Glatius2, you seem to only be upset about the fact that the mob is dying fast.  You say specifically that is the problem.  You don't seem to mind that the mob is dying at the hands of 6 people, but that it's dying in a small amount of time.  I don't see the logic behind this.  What's the difference?  My 56 warrior can annihilate crushbone at a faster and more consistant rate than my 52 wizard.  That doesn't mean a thing.  It's still 1 person trivializing content that is designed for less powerful or a larger number of people.<br>
<br>
I'm going to keep coming back to this thread because the discussion intrigues me, but if this is the only opposing argument, there's really no point to further discussion.  We'll just have to agree to disagree (cliche, I know, but a fitting one).<br>

<br>
Bleh, I'm probably re-explaining something that has already been explained a couple of dozen times and still isn't accepted.  Well one more try I suppose.<br>
<br>
Okay, once upon a time Vox and Naggy were the top of the food chain.  They were the mobs every guild targetted themselves for.  It was a significant event the first time a guild successfully took down either of these two.  It was an accomplishment worth bragging about.  It was a source of pride.<br>
<br>
Then they increased the level limit.  50 was no longer as high as you could go, 60 was the new limit.  And suddenly these two mobs became extremely trivial.  It wasn't the intention mind you, merely a side effect.  The intention was NEVER that Vox and Naggy would go down like bags of wet cement.<br>
<br>
So Verant addressed it.  Those two dragons have been preserved within the game as stepping stones for guilds.  Its still a significant milestone in the life of a guild the first time they take down either of these two dragons.  As far as I am concerned, the integrity of the game is somewhat perserved.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to today.  And now we have additional mobs which are also stepping stones for guilds.  They also represent major milestones for the epic quests of several classes.  These encounters should still have some credibility left to them.  They should still be a source of pride for people.  Instead the mobs are getting used like a cheap drunk whore on a Saturday night.<br>
<br>
Instead of people feeling a sense of pride because their guild was finally able to help them get that much treasured epic piece, they're trying to scrape up the plat to buy it off one of the MB team.  Instead of a challange for up and coming guilds to rally for, they're capped shortly after spawn by roving bands of MB wizards.  Maybe not all of them and maybe not on all servers, but its happening.<br>
<br>
You can argue that a 1st or 2nd tier guild could easily do the same thing with almost as small a force, or even as small a force, but its not really happening.   The 1st and 2nd tier guilds are too busy rushing to take out the high end mobs.  They really can't waste the time being distracted by something like Gore when real mobs are up and available.   Not so Team MB.  Some of these guys live for nothing but this.  Others just see a chance for a quick plat, kind of hard to condemn them for it I suppose.  They're just doing what the game allows them to do.  But they can do it faster and with fewer risks than any other combination of characters.  Which is why they do it.  If it was hard, they would go off and do something else.<br>
<br>
And honestly, if some level 40 character showed up in Crushbone every time Crush spawned and killed him within moments, don't you think the players for whom Crush was actually a challenge might have a small reason for complaint?  Perma camping something that is so far beneath you just because you want the loot is kind of self centered, wouldn't you agree?  Other people deserve a shot at the content as well.<br>

Last time I checked, at least half, if not more of Team MB ( at least on my server, ) are in 1st and 2nd tier guilds.  In addition, 90% of the RoK dragon non-MB kills I've seen are by guilds who consider these dragons trivial.  I just don't see a difference for mid-lvl guilds -- they can race Team MB or bored upper level guilds who can't get to the upper end content of EQ quick enough.<br>

Guess what? The vast majority of MB wizards are in 1st and 2nd tier guilds. On TT all - as in every single wiz in the MB channel - is in a guild that RoK dragons are trivial to. You make it sound like MB wizards just sit around on level 1 rangers tracking RoK dragons waiting for them to pop. Please. Think about this for a minute. Most MB wizards are in Ssra, Vex Thal, and NToV with their guilds.<br>
<br>
What it comes down to is loot. Everyone is mad that wizards have organized and semi-regularly farming dragon loot. I say get off your ass and go farm some dragons yourself if you don't want Team MB to get the loot. The loot is going to go to who ever organizes and is ready for the spawns - MB team or not. A while back a group of 4 guys farmed Lodi like no other. They got EVERY Lodi spawn for nearly a month. Eventually people got pissed and put groups of their own together to stop them. If team MB is TRULY a problem on your server, the same thing will happen. People will get sick of them always getting the spawns so they will mobilize and stop them. Not like its hard to get a group of 6 60s to go kill a dragon.<br>
<br>
I don't know what server you are on, but on Terris Thule, RoK dragons have a life span measured in minutes. It's rare to see any dragon last the hour and the majority of the time its a top tier guild killing them to twink alts or because they are bored and nothing else has spawned since the last patch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/umanalow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Manalow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 3:34:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=116>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fast forward to today.

Understood.  And agreed.  But rewind to before manaburn.  Just before manaburn.  Gorenaire wasn't up for more than a few hours.  She still isn't.  Severlious?  Same deal.  These dragons (and other RoK MOBs such as VS) have been trivial for people with 23AA and good equipment.  They're even trivial to people without any AA and average (now) equipment.  The game has evolved to the point that these dragons aren't a stepping stone anymore.  People go directly from killing lower level stuff to Halls of Testing and other similar encounters.  These are what people practice on.<br>
<br>
I agree that it's unfortunate that these dragons are no longer the uberness that they used to be, but that's what happens.  You mention that Vox and Naggy weren't meant to be trivialized and that VI stepped in and fixed it.  But have you been on a naggy raid recently?  I have.  There were warriors in thurg armor and wielding better weapons that I currently have on my warrior.  And I use a Guard Captain's Mallet and a Frostbringer.  Nothing to scoff at, considering.  That encounter is trivial.  The only difference is that the dragons still con red to those that can kill it.<br>

as far as mb goes.... ya, i have it, and i use it, alot. in pvp i agree sorta, it needs nerfed. you just beat the wizards ass the entire 2 hours that his skill is reloading <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . if its a gimp wizard that burns, nexus gates and logs.... well, hes a gimp.<br>

as far as 6 wizards killing gore.... ive seen 1 war, 1 cleric and 4 rangers take out kunark dragons sevral times. thats not ok? please, get over your class envious small mental penises and move on already.

<br>
And this is going to stop wizards that have MB how? Of all the wizards I know with MB, all but 2 have their epics. If you can monopolize the broken golem and phinny, why not just take your lazy ass to EJ and monopolize Sev to get your scale? Or if you are whining because of the loot, you can monopolize Gore and Tale to sell the drops -- JUST LIKE the MB crew or any other group of level 60s with some AAs and decent gear can do.<br>
<br>
Besides, I don't know why people still insist on bitching about MB (outside of PvP, PvP MB is way overpowered) I bet on the majority of servers team MB has probably slowed down a lot even with the larger number of MB wizards around. Not only that, I think it's pretty obvious that VI is not interested in nerfing MB. They said it's working as intended a long time ago and they have moved on to other projects they deem more important. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwandork.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wandor K</A> at: 9/16/02 2:05:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 763<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/16/02 11:25:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> At the verry least we know wizards are never going to get a fix for any problems they may have from now because of it.
