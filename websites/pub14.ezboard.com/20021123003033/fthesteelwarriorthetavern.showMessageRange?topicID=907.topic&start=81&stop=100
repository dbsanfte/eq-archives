Our big problem seems to be damage mitigation across the board. As a warrior, we should have the best tanking abilities. It is sad to see that other classes even in the high end game can tank and keep aggro better than us.<br>
<br>
I also think the aggro weapons they have added are simply ridiculous as well. Why do we really need Enraging Blow? These 'prosthetics' are lame. Our taunt should be way improved. Our job is to take damage and keep aggro. The developers know this, and are just superficially treating the wound, rather than getting to the core of the issue. <p><p><center>

<br>
I play a 47 warrior, and I feel that we are headed down the same path as the wizard.<br>
<br>
In a normal exp group, there just isn't need for us. There are other classes that do what we do. .  and then some.<br>
<br>
When it comes to a raid? Our extra hp/ac does prove to be the best choice as the main tank. <br>
<br>
The same is true for the wizard. We are almost useless in a group. (I'll save you my wizard rant) We do massive amounts of damage in a short period of time. It's unfortunate, but we can not hold this massive DPS for a long period of time. Which makes us perfect for a raid encounter, and underpowered for a normal exp group.<br>
<br>
The difference I see? Wizards can quad kite, warrior's can NOT solo over a long period of time unless:<br>
<br>
A.) They have a fungi and some very nice weapons.<br>
B.) They have a 2nd box running another class.<br>
<br>
What does this mean in my opinion?<br>
<br>
Eventually, as other classes become more used in place of warriors, we won't be needed in normal exp groups. What does this mean? We're stuck with the same options as the wizard has for grouping: AE groups or your own group of friends. Soon, I forsee pick up groups not being a thing a warrior gets.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents on the issue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usasraaz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sasraaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/7/02 7:53:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The State of Warriors in EQ</span><hr size=1> I'll start by saying that I do think Warriors have some big complains, one if which is taunt and agro.  There were a lot of good points in this thread, a lot that I didn't even know about.  I play a 59 sk, who started playing the first day of Kunark, currently in a guild that is starting to move out of HoT.  However I do disagree or have a different view of some of the problems list.<br>
<br>
For the longest time, Warriors have been the only class that can fill the MT role, whether in exp groups or on raids.  I remember having to beg my cleric friend to get me into groups because it was so bad.  I often solo'd, not because I wanted to, but because I didn't want to wait hours for a group to settle for me, and then break up a few minutes after, so I very much understand where some people are coming from.  <br>
<br>
But I think its a good thing that other classes are now able to fill the MT roles in different instances.  Before Tank = Warrior; I remember joining my guild, and someone asking for a tank to join an exp group, I asked if I could join and they simply laughed at me.  Now though Tanks = warrior, sk, pally, monk, ranger, occasional pet, which is on par with the other roles in the game.<br>
<br>
Yet Warriors have not lost their role in the game.  I still can not come close to a warriors DPS, and I don't believe that most sk's/pally's can, at least not until the end game that the majority will not play.  In fact I don't believe Rangers start to until higher levels and until they get a ton of AA skills, though I don't know this for sure.  Warriors still have far more HP's than sk's/pally's do.  Warriors can tank mobs that hit harder than 400 pts, in which case I would be hesitant to tank other than to stop ping ponging.  Granted higher level SK's and Pally's with much better gear than mine and AA skills probably can tank those mobs, but sitting at 2450 hp unbuffed, I&quot;m sure not going to try it.<br>
<br>
As for desirability, in exp groups you may see a ton of warriors LFG compared to sk's/pally's, but that is probably because the shear difference in number of people playing warriors compared to sk/pally's.  Also, if you look at a lot of guild rosters, you will see easily 10 warriors per guild, but probably around 1-3 sk's.  I know 3 of the top guild on my server have one sk per guild, and deem that enough for the guild.  <br>
<br>
As for AA skills, I think a lot of people have complaints.  The monk rapid feign, which was mentioned before. is supposedly causing a lot of failed feigns.  Some of the Mage pet skills don't work at all I have also been told.  As for sk's, please don't think of the unholy steed as more than a toy.  Sure it is fast, but I'd gladly trade it for an actual offensive discipline or a skill that will allow me to cause a little bit of melee damage.  Not to mention that its not that practical when you can consider you can get run 3 at lv 51 or Jboots at anytime. Then we have a bunch of skills that focus on HT, argueable one of the most worthless skills on a raid, resisted by most higher level mobs.  For the Rangers and Pally's, they have to get lv 59 and get 30+ aa pts just to become sort of effective on a raid, in terms of melee/bow damage.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, you guys have some serious issues, but I don't believe the class is in as bad a shape as you think it is.  Warriors still have a role in the game, one that will never be taken away, whether by offensive upgrades or aa points.<br>

<br>
There is an AC soft cap (around 1200-1300 for warriors).  Warriors tend to hit this cap first of all the classes but all melee classes hit it eventually.<br>
<br>
There is a resist soft cap (around 150-180 for lvl 60s).  I imagine casters tend to hit this one first, but everyone does eventually.<br>
<br>
The biggy: there is an hp softcap (I'd estimate around 6k).  To see this, take the CH rotation your guild can produce, and check if you have the hp to tank the mob you want to.  If you can, more hp are superfluous.  I'm in a HoT guild, so can only guess at what this cap is at the true endgame, but my guess is above.  Knights can reach this, in fact, I think all melee classes can reach it.  Warriors certainly hit it first, but once others have achieved it, the order of achievement matters not at all.<br>
<br>
To look at it another way, the hp advantage warriors have over knights at 60 (with 255 sta) is around 400hp (I'm not going to check on Magelo).  This is less than a *third* of a bubble of health for Furor.  If Verant tries to make an encounter which needs a warrior (without worrying about defensive) *that* is the amount of leeway they have.  In other words, not enough.<br>
<br>
So, with the current EQ set up (straight hp adders give the same, no matter the class/level) the only advantage uber warriors have is defensive/evasive.  So to design an encounter that needs a warrior to tank you'd have to make a mob that can *single round kill anyone* without defensive up.  Say a mob that quads with a DB of 0, and a DI of 125 (so max hit of 2500, 1250 with defensive).  IE, warriors are screwed, and there is little Verant can do to change this without some serious overhauls.<br>
<br>
As a sudden thought, mobs that have a staight hp debuff effect of some kind on the order of several k hp would work too (the natural hp advantage warriors have is more important the fewer hp people have in general, which is why non-uber guilds don't see the problem).<br>

<br>
Since the release of Kunark and Defensive, I knew that our class would eventually turn into one of those &quot;one hit wonder&quot; classes where if we ever ask for something down the road we will get told &quot;But you have defensive&quot;. I agree with lots that defensive, while arguably still our greatest skill, might be the very skill that comes back to bite us in the ass.  I am too noticing it.<br>
<br>
Verant also never upgrades classes properly. Take Rangers for example. The Ranger community complained about the obvious problems for months and months. Verant threw them about 200 bones to shut them up. And by the time they finally did what they were supposed to do and correctly balanced them they become too powerful.  All these half assed balances followed by correct balances on top of it has caused a huge influx of mellee into the game (especially monks on Fennin).<br>
<br>
 80% of of 59+ rangers will tank over me in exp groups at 56 (they have nearly identical ac and hp, but better level, maybe my equip is really bad heh not 100% sure. around 1050ac, 2500hp). A pet can outtank me at this level (BST and Mage).  Now while I am sure 60 is great for warriors, 51-56 has been otherwise for me.  I have had  a very hard time finding groups. I cannot taunt any mobs even or higher than me, something your local  SK and Paladin or similar level can do with casting spells. And taunting off monks, rangers and rogues who all seem to have their epics when my epic is a long ways away is hard. <br>
<br>
The one benefit is the people who are willing to grind it out will be the ones left and deserving of the title &quot;Warlord&quot;. The downside is anyone who has the cash/equip or guild backing can make it easily anyways if they want to.<br>
<br>
I won't even mention the overpopulation of very well equiped twinked warriors on high population servers to contend with because their main is bored (again see infulx of mellees). I think everyone wants to be a warrior deep down, hence why it is such a populated class in Everquest.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have also noticed a few jabs coming at warriors in exp groups lately. Like Furor said they are snickering about it because they know just how good they have it now. Even Rangers pass comments these days to me about warriors in general (taunt and getting hit), I never thought I would see the day when that would happen. Lots of people of my lvl, but different class have better ac than me now.&quot;.  I wish I could buy a 35ac cloak for 10kpp or get one as easily.   Its all come down to the one hit wonder &quot;defensive&quot;.<br>
<br>
I too think about why I choose this class sometimes when Bob the paladin next to me can get Kunark and some other armor way easier than me, has an incredible healing spell at 59 and a 90% res. He can out-solo me, out-taunt me and I will have to do twice the work to get my equivalent armor to him. I am not going to be MTing for my guild anytime soon, nor do we do stuff where multiple lvl 60 defensive tanks are needed. I guess I will plod along until I reach the gold at the end of the rainbow that is &quot;lvl 60&quot; and see for myself.  Its gonna take a lot of work...<br>
<br>
But there is just something about the warrior class that keeps me coming back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  well that and I will never ever  level another character again past 50, xp is just too ridiculous. I guess you stay with what you got and like someone else said here &quot;suck it up&quot; or quit. Some changes are needed though IMO. I do love my class, and there are lots of good points to it, but this post is not really about that. And I agree a bit of roughing it has helped me and will help me in the long run (I played since release anyways so I know what its like), but it does get me down sometimes when I just seem to not be needed, I chose this class for that very reason.<br>
<br>
On the flip side, ironically I am kinda glad in some ways our AA is not that great. It means less timesinks on tedious xping for skills I really do not need. <br>
<br>
I like the defensive table idea myself.<br>
<br>
Lastly:- Necros and Mages can have a spot in my group any day, two of the most undervalued classes in all of EQ IMO, specially Necros. They rock. I will also take a cleric over a shaman any day in exp groups if their role is to heal, I have never seen the opposite. If a slower is needed, well thats a different story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
Just a point of view from a random drunken rambling 56 warrior in his experiences in EQ.<br>

<br>
2h Bash:  One of the benefits of being a warrior in terms of melee was the ability to kick.   Now, this isn't much in terms of melee damage output, but it adds up a little.   Warriors have historically been able to use bash, but who the hell is a warrior with a shield?  At level 55, a warrior's kick also turns into a &quot;stun&quot; which will interrupt casting.   For those of us non-large race warriors, this is a MAJOR upgrade, as pre-55 medium and small race warriors who don't have a shield (about 100%) have no chance to interrput spells.  Our choices are <br>
<br>
A. Wield a shield making us FAR less effective<br>
<br>
B. Don't interrupt casters, and simply use kick for damage.<br>
<br>
Now, Paladins and SK's generally will through the levels switch between 1h and shield or 2h, making the choice that they had to make, either Wield 1h and shield, or 2h with no bash.   This is no longer the case.  They now get the same &quot;extra attack&quot; as we do which is a stun/interrupt while wielding a 2h weapon.  Again, there is no sense of &quot;balance&quot; here, there's no &quot;give or take&quot; for Knights, yet there is for Warriors.<br>
<br>
Physical Enhancement:<br>
<br>
This REALLY irritates me, here's the description:<br>
<br>
&quot;This ability adds an additional 2% to the Natural Durability, Combat Agility and Combat Stability archetypes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Paraphrased:<br>
<br>
&quot;This ability makes you a better tank than before&quot;<br>
<br>
Warriors DO NOT GET THIS.  Why the hell do warriors not get this?  This is asinine, so with AA skills, Knights get a skill which makes them better tanks while warriors don't?<br>
<br>
Body and Mind Rejuvenation:<br>
<br>
&quot;This skill adds an additional level to both of these abilities increasing even further the mana and health regeneration of the Paladin/Shadowknight. &quot;<br>
<br>
So, a Paladin or Shadowknight can get Extra Regen AND Mana Regen beyond regen 3 and clarity 3, can have Durability/Agility/Stability increased while warriors get neither.  Never mind that if regen is too slow, they can heal themselves quite quickly and easily.<br>
<br>
Slay Undead:<br>
<br>
Yap all you want about how it only increases your melee vs. undead by about 20%.   It's a passive skill, it's ALWAYS on, you ALWAYS have it, there's no refresh time, nothing.  <br>
<br>
Fearless:<br>
<br>
&quot;This ability makes the Paladin immune to all types of fear forever. This includes Dragon Fear.&quot;<br>
<br>
Warriors get 15 seconds of group fear immunity at level 3.   What does this mean?   While warriors are feared, Pallies and SK's are doing the tanking, and why the hell give it up then?  I mean, hell, the time it'd take for the warriors to get aggro back they'll just be feared again.<br>
<br>
We'll have to see what PoP has in store for us with regards to Fearing before further comment.<br>
<br>
Super Harmtouch/Leech Touch<br>
<br>
Uhh, to damage a foe for massive amounts of damage and be healed for the same amount....mana free once ever 90 mins.   <br>
<br>
This isn't touching into SCF3 Giving crit taps that heal for the same as the crit lands for.<br>
<br>
Fact is, with AA skills, WTF is a warrior for any more?   Those skills alone are a HUGE upgrade from pre-AA levels, whereas warriors have NOTHING but AE taunt, which is rarely used to AE taunt, and nothign a little snarepoop can't replace.<br>
<br>
See the above comments re: monks and better mitigation/HP/AC and FAR more offensively powerful.<br>

Warriors are now broken<br>

<br>
1) Face it, people have too many hp in general.  So mess with hp buff stacking some (move Shaman buffs to the symbol slot, move the shielding line to its *own* slot and drastically increase its value, put all other hp buffs such as BMB in one slot).  Then put a multiplier on the total buff+gear hp according to class, along the lines of warrior=1, knight=.8, most everyone else .6 and int caster .4<br>
<br>
This would be a *drastic* nerf, but one that is probably needed to repair the class based hp differences that were initially intended (and to reduce the sky high hp totals a little).<br>
<br>
2)  Fix the mitigation AC softcap.  Putting a line the that does somthing like CS=CS+(AC-Attack)/25 or so should work (ie, you gain an effective 1 point of CS for every 25 points of AC past a certain threshhold dependant on the mob's attack rating).<br>
<br>
3) The above does not affect MTing, so, in the same manner that monks have a better attack table, let warriors decrease a mobs damage bonus (not damage interval) by 1%/lvl.  This has the advantage of being a guaranteed reduction in damage and hence modifies MTing.  Make sure warriors get the best AC gear, followed by knights, rangers/rogues etc...<br>
<br>
4) Drop the duration of Evasive/Defensive to 30 seconds, drop the attack penalty and slightly increase their effects.  They become good disciplines for starting hard fights (buy time to debuff/start a CH rotation) but they lose their actual damage reduction effects.  Defensive would stop being a one-shot wonder.<br>
<br>
5) The melee balancing worked fine for Velious, but the Luclin high AC mobs had the hopefully unforseen effect of drastically increasing the value of 2handers, and that combined with the introduction of innumberable knight 2handers ruined the balance.  I'd suggest allowing warriors to do a minimum damage on a hit (pre-damage bonus) of 10% of weapons damage/lvl above 60.  So a lvl 60 with a 15/20 weapon in off hand would do a minimum of 15 damage on a hit.  This would have little effect off Luclin and would fix Luclin's stupidity.  Other dual-wielding classes might as well take advantage of this, leaving knights as the defensive hybrids behind.<br>
<br>
6) If the above isn't sufficient, allow dual-wielders to dual-parry (get a second parry chance based on dual-wield skill if the first fails).  Tweak it so a dual wielder has a similar chance to parry as a monk has to block.<br>

<br>
For example warriors have 100 mitigation (hypothetical number)<br>

Paladins have 80 mitigation<br>
<br>
Additing 10 percent to warrior mitigation yields an additional 10 points<br>
<br>
Adding 10 percent to paladin mitigation adds 8 points.<br>

So to make up for the lower increase for same points, hybrids get to spend EXTRA AA points to get that extra 2% they were cheated out of. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ubeldukil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beldukil</A> at: 7/8/02 10:20:32 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucomparisonjones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Comparison Jones</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>YARG!

 This is becuase hybrids have lower original caps so basically we have to spend MORE points to get the EXACT same point increase.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
My point of this whole thread is that hybrids should NOT get the exact same point increase, period, it should be unreachable, a level which makes you say &quot;Gee, it's a damn good thing I have all this other stuff cause if it were just melee, he would be DRASTICALLY better than me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The whole point here is that warriors should be FAR above all others in the area of absorbing damage.   Not a little, a LOT.  This is the whole point.   Warriors, by virtue of the fact that they have NOTHING else except them and their equipment should ALWAYS be FAR superior to non specific melee in defense, and still somewhat superior in terms of offense with the exception of monks and rogues and perhaps rangers with arrows.  We should have BETTER weapons, which we do not, we should have BETTER armor which we do not.<br>
<br>
The sad fact is that even if the AC softcap were lifted, it wouldn't do any thing to help warriors, because out of the multiple armor slots available, almost every &quot;top&quot; AC item goes to other than warriors, again, this would give monks the biggest advantage, and I'd say warriors the weakest.  Most people probably don't pay attention to equipment, particularly AC since it doesn't really matter, but there is almost NOTHING beyond Velious quest armor where warriors have the AC edge on ANY piece of equipment.<br>

<br>
AA shouldn't CLOSE THE GAP between warriors and hybrids.  If they both max their tanking AA, Warriors should still be X% ahead of the hybrids, which should be exactly X% that they were before AA.  Any other reasoning is just spin doctor PR BS to cover the fact that they screwed up.<br>
<br>
2nd, we're not talking about paladin's offense.  We're talking about Defense here.  I group with a 59 monk, and granted he has been in one of the uberguilds on the server for a couple months, and I'm not, so he has a couple nice pieces of gear (25 ac neck, 40 ac tunic, dain crown, 25ac boots).  My warrior is wearing champs BP, and Fierce Heraldic in the other slots.  His AC is about 80 or 100 points behind mine, and he has about 1k less hp.<br>
<br>
He accidently pulled 2 mobs in CT last nite, both the same type, so we each ended up tanking one.  After both mobs were slowed, WHY IN THE HELL does the monk tank better than me? Why?  His red bar was moving slower than mine was.  He has no AA.  I have CA2 and CS 1, regen 3,  200 more HP per bubble of health, and 100 more ac, and yet he takes less damage than me.  You tell me in what fantasy world you're living in where that is balanced.  I can't even come close to his damage output, (which I give up to be able to tank better) and yet he tanks better than me, with 20 less AA and less AC/Hp.<br>
<br>
The classes should be balanced with give and take...there is a whole lot of taking going on for a lot of classes, but they ain't giving anything anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/8/02 2:28:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Blah!</span><hr size=1> ------------------------------------------------------<br>

<br>
It's not eye candy when you can go to the Grey and whip up a bunch of aa points with almost no downtime.  It's situational in that you actually have to go to where the undead are to solo with ease, but it's still highly powerful.  To minimize it's efictiveness by saying that it's &quot;eye candy&quot; is utter nonsense, there IS indeed a gameplay issue here.  Fine, it's not extreme against high end mobs, this doesn't make it irrelevant.<br>
<br>

_______________________________________________<br>
Paladins Offense and Melee skill caps is 225.<br>
Paladins have less hp than warriors.<br>
Paladins parry/dodge/riposte is way lower than warriors.<br>
Paladins have no disciplines.<br>
_______________________________________________<br>
<br>
You don't have dual wield either, or any other catch phrase that's 3 years old but what has been done to compensate for this?<br>
<br>
1. Paladins have 220HP more by adding Brell's.  In a regular exp group this cannot be overlooked if a Paladin is replacing a warrior, the only place where it balances out is on raids where both toons are buffed with it.<br>
<br>
2. You have HELLISHLY better weapons than warriors, which indeed compensate for any weapons skill cap difference, or dual wield difference.<br>
<br>
3. Your defense skill is identical to that of warriors, yet you are correct in saying that the avoidance skills are lower.  Can I enlighten you for a minute? <br>
<br>
I riposte in one day approximately 4.6%, Dodge 3.81% and Parry 5.63% of all blows.   Let's look at that closely shall we?<br>
<br>
If we took the SAME rolls, and compensated for the difference in skills, you would Riposte 4.2%, Dodge 3.6% and parry 5.2% of all blows.  In other words, it's absolutely meaningless UNLESS the parry occurred at a final blow which killed the toon, which, by nature of your laying of hands would very likely be prevented in the first place.   The notion that the difference in the avoidance skills, which is miniscule, is enough to compensate for all of your inherent advantages is nonsense.   Warriors should be a LOT better melee damage takers, not just a little.<br>

Yes, and rogues have just a bit better melee damage output than mages because of backstab.   Stun is an amazingly reliable taunt.  How do I know this?  Well, I did something funny one day....<br>
<br>
<br>
I said to myself &quot;Self, let's test a couple of things.   First, let's see about Luclin mobs and their inherent AC issues.  Second, let's see how well stun works as an aggro generator.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, I run down to Splitpaw, kill a few doggies, and wind up snaggin a couple of gnoll hide lariats.   My pet owning buddies tell me that they need em.   So.......wasnt' too long after that that I hear that good ol Rhag 1 is up, and needing some GRC copies, we're gonna go off him, but I couldn't get to Ssra in time for Rhag one, as it doesnt' take a whole lot to kill him.   Oh well, no biggie, I get there in time for Rhag 2 though.  <br>
<br>
Being the MT for my guild, I got to be in the position to tank good ol Modzeh, but today I decided to do something a tad different.   I wielded, instead of my standard weapons (11/17 and 13/20), I wielded my new uber Gnoll Hide Lariats (3/20).   Turns out, those things were a proc powerhouse, and I've never held aggro as easily.  So Easy, I didn't have to taunt to keep aggro.  Sadly, after parsing my damage, I learned that with gnoll hide lariats I came VERY close to the same damage as I did with my regular weapons set.<br>
<br>
THe lesson opened my eyes twofold:<br>
<br>
1. Stun is an INSANE aggro generator, to the point where I didn't even have to taunt to keep aggro<br>
<br>
2. n00b weapons that get put on pets are every bit as useful on Ssra mobs as non-enraging blow difficult to acquire weapons.<br>
<br>

Why would you quote VI to dismiss an argument that VI has screwed up on balancing melee?   They screwed up by giving that skill to Paladins and SK's and not warriors, as it thins the line between pure melee and Knights.<br>

 By this, I mean that the rate of VI limited Pal/SK only equipment, particularly in Luclin is fairly dramatic <br>

<br>
I don't know what are u talking about. All Luclin PAL/SK weapons are worse than Velious ones ( except goldenrod ) <br>
Warriors Luclin's 1handers are HUGE upgrades from velious and there are a lot of em !<br>
<br>
for other gear..hum the only pal/sk item i could think is emperor shield.<br>
______________________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
You must have missed where I specifically stated that the upgrades that I was referring to were armor upgrades, and not weapons, but I'll play along anyway.<br>
<br>
How much of an upgrade is there between a BoC and Hategiver?  HUGE?  Hell no, it's a dwongrade.  Bloodfrenzy?  HUGE?  Hell no, it's a little nicer, but not much.<br>
<br>
Although, if you can show me an equivalent warrior helm to the THO helm is on a mob as easy, I'm all ears.  If you can show me where a warrior can pick up a semi-exclusive (i.e. warrior + 1 other class) upgrade to their back slot that's 35AC with a single group I'd be interested in seeing it.   Show me the limited access post-Velious quest armor stuff for warriors, and get off the &quot;our overpowered weapons from Velious weren't upgraded in Luclin&quot; horse, cause it doesn't fly.<br>

<br>
but the infamous Brutul said &quot;Warriors are, and will remain, the best tanks in the game. They are, and always have been, one of the least versatile classes in the game. Get used to it if you want to play a warrior. &quot;<br>
<br>
let me point out the versatile section. yes we are the least versatile, it is because we should be far and away the best at melee tanking BECAUSE ITS ALL WE DO. (that was not shouting, that was emphasis).<br>
<br>
before all this AA mumbo jumbo, and this supposed &quot;class balancing&quot;. we fit this description. we stand there and get hit, and deliver hits, we hit taunt to give us that extra bit of aggro to keep the mob standing in front of us. we did not deliver as much damage as a monk or as a rogue because, while they are pure melee classes, but they are tweaked/pointed into more of an offensive melee rather then a defensive one, like us warriors.  Pallies/SK's were classes that traded some of that offensive power and tanking ability to develop the arcane/diving magics. This gave them some utility and versatility. They were no where near the equal of a Warrior in combat, they would have to use those spells to compensate for this. Warriors are defined from each other at this time ONLY by thier gear. this was reflected in the game by the Warr only gear having that extra 10-15% AC compared to the pally/sk items. here are the kunark BPs for example (12.5% better AC with kunark armors)<br>
<br>
War=Cobalt Breastplate  +45 AC +12 Str +12 Sta +12 Dex +50 HP +20.00 Wt  <br>
SK=Blood Ember Breastplate  +40 AC +12 Str +8 Sta +8 Agi +8 Dex +10.00 Wt   <br>
Pal=Deepwater Breastplate  +40 AC +10 Str +10 Agi +10 Wis +50 Mana +10.00 Wt  <br>
<br>
don't forget that this was when you were lucky to have a 1200 AC, much less talking about AC softcaps.<br>
<br>
now, assuming that you do have all your AA filled in, you once again find that the only thing that defines a tank is his gear.(no, i doubt such a mythic being exists at this time, but if wer'e talking balance let's take it to the extreme as that's where the differences will be best seen). the same 10 BP's show up under each under a search (using ACx10, hpx1) for pally, sk and warrior. so this means that pallies, SK's and Warriors can now all have the same AC. <br>
<br>
Great Shadow Platemail <br>
,Heavy Yttrium Chestplate<br>
Breastplate of the Void  <br>
Breastplate of Speed  <br>
Breastplate of Eradication  <br>
Chestplate of Fiery Might  <br>
True Mithril Breastplate  <br>
Breastplate of Superiority  <br>
Jenniy's Two-tone Cuirass  <br>
Warmaster's Ribcage <br>
<br>
so basically, in the armor category, pallies and SK's are now the same as warriors.<br>
<br>
now onto offense..no matter what  weapon your wielding, its what offensive category/bracket your in that defines just how much you can do offensivly. and from the oct 8 patch, we get the biggest of the &quot;balancing changes&quot;.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Paladins and Shadowknights, besides the benefits they gain from the two-handed weapons change mentioned above, have also been moved to the same combat tables as warriors. In the future we intend to examine the existing one-handed weapons useable by knights for possible upgrades. We are also increasing the Taunt skill cap for these two classes to 220.&quot;<br>
<br>
it was this patch that raised warriors taunt cap to 230. this was to make up for the extra damage that every other melee started doing. but basically, we went from &quot;kings of offense&quot; to being the same as the pallies and SK's..you know, those guys who GAVE UP some offensive power to cast spells.<br>
<br>
so in summary for ya'll that might not have followed this...<br>
<br>
1)warriors were the king of battle, we had a better melee bracket, we had better armor. pallies/sk's had lesser armor and lesser melee to compensate for thier use of spells.<br>
<br>
2) oct 8 patch rolls in, pallies and sk's are moved to the same melee bracket as warriors. all 3 have taunt increased, warriors get an extra 5% taunt over pallies and sk's because now all the other classes that swing a sword make more tuant. but basically TANKS LOOSE &quot;THE KING OF BATTLE&quot; title and now share offensive power with the pallies/SK's.<br>
<br>
3) with luclin, and velious armor went away from class specific's towards eveyrone having a chance at them. this took away the AC/HP advantage that warriors had over pallies/sk's. this is the straw that made pallies and SK's viable tanks.<br>
<br>
so, when we gave up the ability to cast spells, or backstab, or deal out damage to be the king of battle in the earliest of &quot;game concepts&quot;, pallies/sk's sacraficed this martial ability by learning spells, and ti made sense. now they get everything a tank does, AND get thier spells too.<br>
<br>
that's what this whole post started as. warriors have no job, we have been replaces by sk's and pallies in all but 1% of end mobs. this is what we are asking verant to take a look at if they ever read this board.<br>
<br>
or did i miss something? take care, and remember caps are for emphasis, not yelling.<br>
<br>
have a nice day.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) luclin comes out,<br>

<br>
 Fearless is something that gives shadowknights something to look forward to,  Being Main Tank on Cazic thull and other high end encounters that fear sissy warriors off is something i would love to do and plan on doing once I have the aa points to waste on that skill,(18 to get to fearless).<br>
<br>
 As far as warriors inability to taunt, that's something that needs to be fixed with Taunt Mastery.<br>
<br>
 As a shadowknight,I really enjoy doing things that people don't normally associate with your class, Creative solutions go a long way in Everquest and make the game fun. <p><p><center><embed src="http://www.mesmartyoudumb.com/eq/danderflash.swf" quality=high pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="350" height="209">
