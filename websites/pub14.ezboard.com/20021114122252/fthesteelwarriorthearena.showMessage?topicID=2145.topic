<br>
My name is Debra and I'm one of the authors assigned to write the upcoming strategy guide for Everquest Planes of Power for SoE and Prima.<br>
<br>
One of the things I want to cover in this guide is information for all players on the aspects of raiding by class. I think this would be something everyone, both new players and seasoned vets could benefit from.<br>
<br>
I'm posting this notice on each of the classes web sites to solicit raiding strategies and advice from everyone who would like to contribute. Each person who provides sound raiding strategy for his or her class will be acknowledged in the front of the guide.<br>
<br>
Please don't worry about format. All I care about is your strategy on playing as your chosen class while in a raid. What I need is a summary of your class and your role in a raid. Please give this some thought before posting on the message board. The more thought out your input, the more likely it will be chosen to use in the guide. Our deadline for this project is Tuesday, so I would like to have as much feedback as possible by Monday.<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance for helping with this tumultuous project.<br>

2) Turn off autoattack when enrage<br>
3) 3...4...5.. repeat.. at least its not as bad as bards <br>
4) Feel worthless if you are the 3rd warrior in the raid<br>
5) try for dps but realize almost every class can outdmg you<br>
6) complain how that paladin just critted for 700dmg.. then the SK Crits for 855, then you crit for 134.. and sigh<br>
7) Try to get aggro.. but then just let the SK/Pal do it. They should just make SK/Pal the warriors and make us useless, because we can barely hold aggro anymore. i had 7 taunts 5 disarms on a thing and SK casted one spell.. guess who the aggro went to =\ im even trying to see if beg will get me more aggro! i was using it for a day and i kept aggro from the SK! turns out he was oom<br>
<br>
This turned more into a complaining thing, but this is about what i feel on raids. we really need revamp ;p then you might have something to put in your book under Warriors <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usinormxev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SinormXev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/28/02 12:56:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2145.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Raiding Strategies</span><hr size=1> Warriors have very different purposes on raids.  Against large mobs, you will have one main tank, who is tanking the mob, with clerics doing a CH chain or whatever else is necessary to keep him alive.  <br>
<br>
When fighting through dungeons or doing other aspects, there will also be a main assist.  The main assist can be different from the MT, becuase the job is very different.  The main assist will choose which target the raid is going to attack, while enchanters mez the other mobs, or they are tank mezzed by other warriors.<br>
<br>
That leads us into the next job that warriors will serve, the tank mez.  In many high level zones, there are unmezzable mobs, so when you get muiltiples, you have warriors asigned to tank mez those mobs until the MA targets that mob and the raid kills it.<br>
<br>
Many raids will also have a secondary assist, incase the MA dies.<br>
<br>
One other roll that warriors have to fill, is against rampaging mobs.  Rampaging mobs can hit as many as 4 different people at a time, so you will have dedicated ramapage tanks that take the extra damage from the mob.  These tanks will sometimes need a CH rotation to keep them alive, other times, just a dedicated cleric.<br>
<br>
<br>
Outside of those roles, the job of a warrior on a raid is to simply deal damage, and dont take agro off the MT.<br>

<br>
Pre-Raid:<br>
<br>
1. Know where, what time, what zone you're meeting in, learn something about the zone, and what is expected to be encountered.<br>
<br>
2. Know who the raid leader is, and what role is expected of you.<br>
<br>
3. Arrange IN ADVANCE, transportation to the zone where you'll be meeting up in.<br>
<br>
4. Make certain that you're bound in a location which is close enough to a druid and wizard portal so that if you need a ride back at any time, it's convenient for them.<br>
<br>
5. Get supplies (food/drink/arrows) in advance.<br>
<br>
6. If there's a reagent cost (Hate or Airstones) and you've been asked to compensate for this, make sure you bring it and direct it to the right source.  If you're unsure of this, ask your raid leader.<br>
<br>
Raid Type 1:  Generic Zone Raid:<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
Plane of Hate, Plane of Fear, Chardok.<br>
<br>
You will generally buff before heading up, and invis if necessary.  While your group leader may be responsible for ensureing that their party is properly buffed, ultimately it is the individual's responsibility to ensure that they are buffed with the most reasonable buff set for your class.  <br>
<br>
For a warrior this is generally a &quot;raid type&quot; buffset.<br>
<br>
Armor Class Buffs (Generally cleric buffs)<br>
Hitpoint Buffs (Generally Symbols/Talismans, or any o the &quot;all purpose buffs&quot; like Harnessing of Spirit, Focus of Spirit, or Aegolism)<br>
Stamina Buffs<br>
Any necessary resist buffs<br>
And Haste<br>
<br>
In a &quot;zone raid&quot;, the goal is to kill monsters as efficiently as possible.  Generally (barring Kael for instance), most monsters can be mesmerized by an enchanter.   Because of this, two things are of dire importance.  First, to find out who the &quot;Main Assist&quot; is, second, to set up a hotkey which says &quot;/assist (Main Assist)&quot;.  What is going to happen is that in the event that multiple monsters come, everyone should attack the same target to keep the others under control and to quickly dispose of one and move on to the next.  The &quot;Main Assist&quot; is the person who's job it is to select those targets, an notify the raid that he's attacking.  Once you see him or her say &quot;Assist Me with (target)&quot; you will hit your /assist key and then attack.   It is generally considered important to wait until the Main Assist has made the call, no matter what before attacking, or you could be breaking mesmerizations and the monsters will have Enchanter for lunch.  <br>
<br>
On many raids a Secondary Assist will be called out in advance in he lik...err.. unlikely event the Main Assist dies.  What the Secondary Assist also does is what is called &quot;Tank-Mezzing&quot;.  In some instances, there are monsters that are immune to Mesmerization spells.   This requires someone to be actively beat upon in order to kep them busy while the rest of the raid is killing the primary target.  Each raid member should have an assist key made for at least the MA (Main Assist), the SA (Secondary Assist), and TA (Third assist).  This keeps things well organized and under control.<br>
<br>
Other things to be aware of... if you are going to go Away from keyboard, your responsibility is to let the raid know this and to target someone in your group to autofollow.   This way you don't get left behind if the raid moves while you're away.<br>
<br>
If you have been selected to be the Main Assist... you have your work cut out for you.  Before things start, have a discussion with the enchanter there, and determine in advance which monsters are harder or impossible to mesmerize.   This will aid you greatly in selecting the most appropriate monster to target and tell the raid to kill first.  Hard to Mez, or Impossible to mez monsters represent the greatest threat to your enchanters, and because of this, it's of crucial importance that you kill them without causing undue aggro to be put on your enchanters.  Once the greater threats are disposed of, you can move on to the lesser threats.<br>
<br>
Before you attack a mesmerized target, taunt it a couple of times...it may actually work, and keep the enchanter from being beaten upon.   Make a hotkey of your own where there is NO mistaking what your target is or whether it's you calling assist.  I'd recommend using Capitol Letters and try to make sure that all Assists have the same format in the raid.  People get confused with 3 conletely different appearing assist messages, try to make it uniform and it'll go better.<br>
<br>
Another word, if you are &quot;main assist&quot; whatever you do....never ever ever change targets.    Your Secondary and Third assists can generally deal with any threat while you finish what you've committed to.   If you are all over the place, confusion and disorganization occurs and people die FAST.  Finally, if multiple monsters have been mesmerized, and by the time you're done killing one, another beomes unmezzed, target the unmezzed one, don't make your enchanter go and mez it again while you break another mez.<br>
<br>
Also, keep in communication with your pullers.  They will generally tell you when to &quot;tag&quot;, when it's more or less &quot;safe&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raid Type 2:  Zone Raids with Unmezzable targets<br>
<br>
There are some raids where some different tactics are required.   The classic example of this is the Kael Arena.   Giants there cannot be mezzed, and everything must have a tank to keep it busy.  Generally speaking, aggro begins to become an issue here.  These guys hit hard, and the person best suited for taking those blows should be the Main Assist, Second assist the same, and so on.  THis is where positioning of forces begins to come into play as well.   <br>
<br>
The best positioning is this:   Main Tank in front of the monster, the rest behind him, or flanking him.  Each person has a responsibility to help the Main Tank maintain aggro so that he's the only one being beaten upon.  This is the beginning of what you'll need to be aware of throughout your whole EQ career.  When in front of a monster, he can riposte, and these guys, as I said earlier hit very hard.  You really don't want your healing to be spread out across the raid if it can be avoided by simple positioning, so if you're not tanking, you should be behind or flanking.<br>
<br>
Main Assist/tank's job is a little easier here, all he really needs to do is identify the greatest threat and target and attack.  A little &quot;pre-taunt&quot; is a good idea here, let the main tank dance alone with the monster for a while so that when the rest join, the monster's attention is solidly focused on the Main Tank.   Generally, healer monsters are the greatest threat, because they'll stop what their doing to heal other monsters who are hurt in the area, and this can drag out for some time.  Get rid of the healers, and you will shorten the fights, and increase the rate of killing.  Other examples where these tactics are used is in the Temple of Veeshan West and Halls of Testing.<br>
<br>
Raid type 3:  Single Large target monsters<br>
<br>
There comes a time when you must refine your tactics even further... this is in reference to a single target high damage output monster, such as Velketor the Sorcerer or Derakor the Vindicator.  There are what is called &quot;gateway mobs&quot; as once you begin to know how to defeat these monsters, you've opened up the rest of Everquest to your raiding party/guild, etc.<br>
<br>
Guys like this have very heavy melee capabilities, and if they bounce around to different people will destroy a raid before you can blink an eye.  What you need here is to TRULY focus the monster's attacks on one person, the Main Tank.  This tank will geneally be healed with what's called a &quot;Complete Heal Rotation&quot; where clerics will cast &quot;Complete Heal&quot; in timed intervals to ensure that the person being beaten upon remains alive.  The rest must try as hard as they can not to pull the attention of the monster away from the &quot;main tank&quot;.  This can be devastating.    Again, Main tank in front, takes the initial onslaught of attacks.   In some circles, it's deemed proper for the Main Tank to call the beginning of the Complete heal rotation.  If you do this, I'd recommend a hotkey which says &quot;BEGIN HEALING NOW&quot; or something to that effect.<br>
<br>
If it's your first few times doing this monster, then /disc defensive before engaging is a good idea.   After your clerics are used to it, it doesn't matter really, but for the first few times, it's probably quite crucial.<br>
<br>
In instances like this, you'll want to have an established &quot;tank order&quot; so that if/when the first tank dies, everyone backs off and allows the new one to generate aggro and gain the monster's attention, and to shift the rotation to him.  Tank switches are ugly and can prove to be the downfall of some raids.  It's usually best not to have them, but it's not a bad idea to know how to do it, because I guarantee when you face the Avatar of War for the first time, you'll be seeing tank switching and how fast 50 people can melt from full health to nothing.<br>
<br>
Generally most encounters are similar to this some with different features, things that make them unique, but they tend to follow this pattern through the rest of Velious/Luclin.<br>
<br>
It's only when you get to Deep Luclin that there's more insane encounters, and by the time you're able to do those, you should be able to figure out how to handle them.<br>
<br>
That's all I can think of for the moment, but I'm sure that I'll come up with more later.<br>

<br>
1) Make sure to hit every mob at least once, especially ones that don't appear to be attacking anyone.  This will make sure that all the mobs know you're there.  NPCs always attack the warrior first as long as you've made them aware of your presence.<br>
<br>
2) Always use aggressive on tough pulls, due to the amazing damage you do with this discipline you gain a psychological advantage over the mob you're tanking, hence reducing their damage output.<br>
<br>
3) Never assist anyone on raids.  You are a warrior, everyone should be assisting you, even the MA.  The sooner you can slip into this mentality the sooner your raids will start owning.<br>
<br>
4) Use your best taunting weaps at all times.  This will ensure that should the MT die, you will be guaranteed aggro.  In fact using this technique will usually get you aggro before anyone else, which is very important as a warrior.<br>
<br>
5) Always scout ahead.  As a warrior it's your job to know exactly what the pull team is doing, make sure you're right up there with them running ahead.  A good warrior won't even need the monk to tell them went to tag, as long as there is 10 mobs or less, go ahead and pull them.<br>
<br>
6) If the clerics are even a 1/2 second too slow healing you, be sure to tell them to goto hell because they are n00bs and don't know how to play their class.  Make sure you do this in all caps.  This will tell the clerics that they need to play better and after just a few uses you will notice a drastic change in cleric behavior.  In fact, make a hotkey for this.<br>
<br>
<br>
These 6 easy rules are the key to making successful raids.  Any warrior that follows these rules to the letter will notice amazing changes to both the raid and everyone's attitudes towards them.<br>
<br>
Note: If these do not work for you, be sure to visit the warrior boards at www.eqvault.com, these players really have their finger on the pulse of the warrior class and can give you vital information.<br>

All the key points are mentioned.<br>
<br>
However, i'd like to take the time to Define some of the terms used as he sorta assumes everyone knows what these terms mean (basically, dumbing it up even more...heh)<br>
<br>
Main Assist - This is the central player character that the healing is going to be focused on. Players not doing the Main Assist (or MA) role, are required to position themselves behind the mob to avoid unneeded damage. Every raider should have a hotkey made with /assist &lt;name of MA&gt;.<br>
<br>
Secondary Assist - Same role as MA, but is second in line for duties. Provided the untimely death of the MA, the SA will step up and act as MA until the original MA is back on his feet.<br>
<br>
Tank Mezzing - The process of using a melee (tank) class to engage a mob alone with healing back up that enchanters are unable to mesmerise using thier lines of spells. This pre-occupies the mob from the rest of the raid battle much like the enchanter/bard spell/song would do. This is usually done on creatures in a room where the primary target is. These creatures are usually referred to as guards or pets.<br>
<br>
Pre-Taunt - This is when the MA is given a &quot;head start&quot; of gaining initial aggro. The rest of the raiding crew stands out of harms way for a certain period of time, while the MA attacks the creature alone, generating hate. <br>
<br>
Tank Order/Switching - A technique used by designating certain melee types (mainly warriors) to form a chain of tanking. Using the /discipline defensive, the warriors will take turns being MA. once /disc defensive is almost over, the next tank in the line will take over as MA.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some important tid bits worth mentioning :<br>
1) make sure you have all your supplies. Frod said before, but i'll say again. Buy invis potions, gate potions, Damage shield potions, food, water, get a little cash outta the bank for ports, sows. be prepared. make sure you can get out of an area should you LD or get left behind (accidents happen).<br>
<br>
2) USE HOTKEYS!!!  make sure you have hotkeys for everything from /assist MA, call for attack if you're MA, hotkey if you loose aggro, discipline hotkeys, even item hotkeys for items with right click effects that you may use during battle<br>
<br>
3) Insta-click items - Some creatures have an Area of Effect spells (AoE's) with a dispell debuff. Make sure you have an insta-click item in your top slot (most of the time) to help perserve buffs. Most common item is Shrunken Goblin Earring and/or Jboots<br>
<br>
4)Keep more than 2 weapons. Warriors are very diverse group of people and we have a few different roles. Make sure you have weapons for different situations. Being MA will require you to wield weapons with combat effects (or procs) to gain the attention of creatures. When not being MA, have some nice damaging, non-taunting weapons for damage. We aren't the best at damage, but try to maximize it. I find weapons with non-aggroing procs (Direct Damage) with a nice ratio to be the best. Also, make sure to have a decent bow.<br>
<br>
That's all i can think of for now. <p>

Will give a little insight to what I do or pay attention to while raiding. Probably going to reiterate on a few things or go over similiar items.<br>
<br>
-To me a warrior is a person who needs to be very aware of everything going on, at all times. If assigned to main tank, communication is vital. Be in communication with your leader, pull team, heal channel, etc. Be sure to know whats going on when and how, down to a point. Be aware of where the monsters are relative to you and other monsters. Be aware of who and where other players are attacking from or positioned. If you see something incorrect, communicate it fast and get it fixed. Be aware of your buffs at all times, your discipline timers and such. Basically, just watch your ass and everyone elses ass at all times.<br>
<br>
-When not the main tank, but on the lineup, its important to still be listening in the channels, know whats going on. Always, be in the know.<br>
<br>
-Know your foe and the geography. If its the first time to be at a zone do some online research. Get to the various class boards and databases and look around. As the old saying goes, knowledge is power. Know the abilities and weaknesses of the mobs. Know damage intervals and bonuses. Know what you can do to be the most efficient at killing and tanking a foe.<br>
<br>
-Have a versatile lineup of equipment. Warriors by design are heavily dependant on other classes. That, well, sucks. Have items to facilitate raids. Have a selection of instant click items for battling dispellers. A cobalt bracer is a nice item for helping to shrink a raid faster. A fungal tunic is great when your not tanking for helping mitigate area effect damage. Access to invisibility items, see invis, levitate, spirit of the wolf, items all help in mobilizing to a raid and lowering your dependancy on others. Having a few items that you can use to buff yourself never hurts as well for the odd situation. Be a boyscout.<br>
<br>
-Have a versatile lineup of weaponry. A warrior has no spells, no abilities, weapons are your tools, and a carpenter doesnt go to work with just a hammer. Situational weaponry. Have your taunting weapons for main tanking and have a good dps setup for non tanking. A good mix of procs for different situations. Know when and how to use your tools to the best of ability.<br>
<br>
-Know game mechanics. A warrior is left without abilities or spells. To reiterate, knowledge is power. Always be on top of your game.<br>
<br>
-When simply support tanking use your dps setup. Do not crowd the main tank, your not supposed to be trying ti hold the attention of the mob in this situation. Fight behind or flank mobs to avoid its defensive capabilites and eating silly riposte damage. Always be ready to jump at a moments notice. For either having to step to the plate as main tank or add tanking.<br>
<br>
-Don't blow disciplines like a fool. You cannot afford wasting a timer. Always good to have evasive or defensive ready to go if the situation arises. If you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> know</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you will not be tanking, instructed to, use the best offensive discipline for the situation. On longer fights aggressive is very attractive due to its 3minute duration and is a decent increase in your dps. On some of the shorter fights, oh say Kunark level stuff, I fellstrike will do just fine.<br>
<br>
-Before the raid have your stuff together. If you need arrows summoned or such, get it done before any combat happens.<br>
<br>
-Back to the knowing your foe business, on some of the crawl style raids, know what is and is not mezzable so you don't tank mez something the robed chanter beside you is trying to mez. They get a bit pissy.<br>
<br>
-Before raids, get there fast. So if your unfamiliar with the area, print some maps off.<br>
<br>
-Always play well. Yah, sounds retarded but I personally get a bit upset by people who go lazy on raids and stop watching what their doing and make small screwups. A rogue gets lazy he may get pounded on a sec, you get lazy and some fanged behemoth wipes half your force. Don't F up.<br>
<br>
-Stand still. Listen to orders. Shut up. Goes for anyone. Paying attention and coordinating does wonders. Panicking, looking around, blabbing in chat just gets people dead.<br>
<br>
-Have some knowledge of what other classes should be doing. Knowing how everything melds together helps alot.<br>
<br>
-Know your buffs. And be sure to aquire them with what ever method your raid leader has instructed. <br>
<br>
-When main tanking, if you see people doing something incorrect, obstructing you, pushing the mob the wrong way, or pulling aggro, it is your right to bitch. Get their ass in place.<br>
<br>
-On many higher end encounters, the mobs are rooted. Make sure your raid leader gives you time to pre-establish some aggro the target. Plugging arrows into the mobs side works nicely. Also, some items with right click effects can work nice to. One example is a bioluminescent orb. Firing arrows is funner tho! And if your archery isn't capped, couple skill ups are fun to see scroll by.<br>
<br>
-Always be sure to let it be known if you need to go afk. Autofollow a group member. Pick one that won't make you wander off and get stuck behind a door and try to kill you. Assholes. Don't just tell one person. Make sure that everyone knows! Talk with your raid leader and let him know how long ya going to be away and such. It is his job to then appoint a new main tank or assist or what have ya.<br>
<br>
-Choose a wise alternate advancement path. For general skills, runspeed3 is essential imo. Whatever other 3 you wish is fine then. Archtype should max Natural Durability asap. Follow that with class skill area effect taunt. After that you will want physical enchancement and combat agility3. Those I consider the essentials. Tailor everything afterwards to your style of play and how you are employed on raids.<br>
<br>
-Be smart with add tanking. Communicate which mob you intend to tank mez. Don't fight with another warrior for aggro on a mob he already called. Thats silly. Also, if not the main tank or addtank, and merely support taning, I do not suggest breaking away from your MA's target to 'help' kill a mob another person has tank mezzed, unless specifically instructed. Splitting dps is retarded in most situations. When tank mezzing control where your mob is. During this time you have complete control of the mob. Put him where your leader wants him dead. I always will pull a mob away from the main target just to lessen confusion. <br>
<br>
-If you are mez tanking, once the MA clears his mob, it is best if you tank your mob to death. The Main tank should call which target he wants dead next, but in most cases it is just silly if he tries to outaggro you. Just causes healers confusion or wasted mana. You locked that add onto you, you finish it.<br>
<br>
-When not tanking, if not on a tank lineup, don't get aggro. Yah, shove those proccing taunt weapons in a bag and use that weapon for this situation we discussed earlier. Also, since warriors lack any kind of aggro evasive skills, you have the ability to turn off attack! So do that once in a while. Watch your damage spam and if your on a 'kick ass streak' take a second or three break from attacks. Also, make like the other melee and fight at max melee range and do not draw unneeded attention. So, do not hit your taunt button or disarm or call his mother names.<br>
<br>
-When not tanking, but lets say second in line, learn to manipulate your aggro. You want to be pretty close to the top of the mobs effective hate list. In this scenario, using a weapon with a taunt proc is alright to keep yourself up there. It takes some experience really. I personally sort of visualize the order of aggro and whats going on, what each action I perform does and such. Yah..<br>
<br>
Course, if your raiding some higher end content you will proba<br>
bly have area effect taunt, which makes this all much simpler. Area effect taunt, if it works, will always place you to the top of the hate list. While some situations, namely low life aggro, can override this, you are still top of the list, just you look tasty all bleeding and @#%$. Anyway, AE taunt lets you grab aggro instantly, so working hard to stay right below the main tank isn't really a big issue.<br>
<br>
-Use AE taunt effectively. It will always give you aggro, however, it gives but a slight edge as 'most hated person.' This means that another person, right below the warrior aggro wise, could take aggro if hes not careful. It is usually wise to let it be known when you are going to fire AE taunt, so people can prepare for the change of the mobs target, healing reasons, and the above stated aggro reason. This is a warriors best skill, learn how to use it well. Tank switches, aquiring an add target easily, pulling an incorrectly placed mob out of a wall, saving some asses, or what have you. 15 min refresh so use wisely.<br>
<br>
-Be properly nourished. Eat a good breakfast on a day you know your raiding an uber mob. Plenty of sleep the night before as well!<br>
<br>
-In the event of a large overpull where a campout is instructed, unless told otherwise, you don't. Get out there and fight to the death with some dignity! Part of a raiding warriors life, accept that your going to die, and die alot. You are the piece of meat that the wolves tear into shreads while the little girls run away.<br>
<br>
-Make note of things you see that are incorrect or could be done better. Communicate this to your leader afterwards. It is usually best not to swamp the leader in the middle of the raid. Hes busy with things. If you know something that is imperative to success, do let him know though. Just dont bitch and moan to him or in raid chat while its occuring. Create your own chat channel for bitching.<br>
<br>
-(Tidbits for MT)<br>
When main tanking, give instructions for what you need done. Have people wait to attack untill you are ready. Establish some aggro and when your comfortable call em in. Some people alot different lengths of time. The people I had played with were always pretty quick on the tirgger finger so I'd do 10sec or so and decrease depending on how many procs I would get during that time. /shrug<br>
<br>
 Make sure people aren't crowding you. If the mob is being pushed the wrong way do your part to adjust and also instruct people on what to do. <br>
<br>
Evaluate which discipline works best for the encounter. On some of the higher end mobs a riposte can be to damaging to risk with dual weildling. In times where your discipline is down many prefer switching to a nice two hander for cutting potential riposte damage. <br>
<br>
Keep a close proximity. Do what you can to piss it off as much as possible. The disarm skill refreshes fast and does add a minimal amount of aggro, every little bit can help for some people I guess. Also nice as a 'rangefinder' for some of the big mobs to tell if your close enough or whatnot.<br>
 <br>
I tend to use 'walk' instead of having 'run' toggled on once I engage a mob. Gives a little more control of movement and staying close while doing so. <br>
<br>
Use Area taunt if a situation arises to grab aggro back fast.If you lose aggro command people to stop attacking- they should use aggro evasive skills and not swing. Once you regain aggro and are comfortable call them back in. <br>
<br>
Watch heal spam. You know how much damage your taking, alert healers if they are at a to fast or to slow pace. Announce when discipline has run out so peopel can adjust. <br>
<br>
If your cornering and getting a good number of &quot;you cannot see target&quot; message, looking up and backwalking seems to help some people. <br>
<br>
If a mob gets pushed somewhere you don't want, you can call off attacks and try to move him, or even move him without calling off attack if you feel comfortable. If aggro is solid back up fast to the area you want. You will be summoned, just back up fast again and the mob will walk right over. Kinda fun little rubber band action. <br>
<br>
Communicate your intentions at all times. Let the raid know if your turning the mob, moving it, whatever. <br>
<br>
Be aware of special attacks and call for special needs as required. Diseases curses or whatever. Stop attacking when a mob enrages. <br>
<br>
Get shrunk or grown as a raid demands. From a halfling perspective, I find it easier to tank when grown up. Increases mobility and just find it more confortable. Some mobs you will need to be shrunk to get in a corner or whatever, just know the encounter. Levitate works wonders for short warriors in the zones its allowed. <br>
<br>
Pan your views as needed. The overhead view is very very helpful. Set camera angles prior to engagement so you can get a quick glance at surroundings mid fight. <br>
<br>
When mobs are being pulled to you, stand forward of the rest of the raid a bit to help establish a quick response to the enemy.<br>
<br>
Backing up and sitting can work as a quick way of moving a mob to you. Learning the timing so as to not get smacked for full damage is a plus.<br>
<br>
Have buffs organized. I aways keep at least one instant click buff in the top slots incase of dispellers. Habit now and its like this even when I know there will not be. Make sure to have the buffs required to get the job done. Fancy extra stuff you can toss away to make slots for heal over times, bard songs, more instant clickies if the situation needs, aggro manipulating spells, whatever. Always leave room. 15 buff limit. <br>
<br>
Be sure you are wearing the right gear before you tank. If switching around alot from main tank to secondary or whatever, have the right tools geared up. Assume your going to get your asskicked and go for the hitpoints. So switch off that fungi tunic and throw on your 100-125hp breastplate of tanking. Dont make a silly mistake and have the incorrect weapons out either.<br>
<br>
Uber mobs, that is your 65+ mobs, are immune to taunt. Quit mashing it!<br>
<br>
On a less than uber mob, don't mash taunt either. It does nothing. Save it for an instance where you lose aggro and hope it works. <br>
<br>
-Instant clickies. Great to have. A main tank should have at least a few at his disposal. These allow a warrior to throw up 1-4 junk buffs to suck up mob dispells. Also, its always nice to be able to arrange your top few buffs on the fly. Say a green drake is incoming and you hate that slow they always land on you. Yah, dont we all. So, drop your top few instant clickies and allow it to settle up there. Once hes disposed, simply have it dispelled, and toss back up your junkies. <br>
<br>
A quick list of a few would be your 8-10th coldain rings, shrunken goblin skill earring, journeyman's boots, amulet of necropotence. These all do not require targeting yourself to cast. If your feeling really dextrous with hotkeys and the tab button, there are a few more instant clicks that require yourself being targetted. This ofcourse means you may lose an attack round or two but if your quick.. <br>
<br>
-Hotkeys. Make a few banks and use them. Clumsily opening menus or clicking stuff wastes time. Typing out commands takes a second or two and draws your attention. So, prepare with hotkeys. Do pretty much everything with keyboard shortcuts.<br>
<br>
-Except movement. Mouselook movement is more precise and controllable than keyboard movement. I prefer the tight control granted with this. When tanking, holding right mouse and left clicking, taps, can make some minor adjustments. Also strafing helps to position yourelf the way you want. Walk mode instead of run mode for greater precision.<br>
<br>
In summary I guess it comes down to:<br>
1)Knowledge is power.<br>
2)Be prepared.<br>
3)Pay attention to everything. Be alert.<br>
4)Shush and listen to orders.<br>
5)Communication is everything.<br>
6)Always be organized in detail. Chaos is a wipe.<br>
<br>
All I have for now. I apologize for some of the randomness of it, lack of organization. Just plopped down thoughts while watching television. <br>
<br>
Hope you may find use for anything I may have said. If you need clarification or have questions, drop me an email at besrikarle@madbbs.com. Best of luck!<br>

they are probably asking the class boards because most of the people that work at VI don't understand how EQ works at the high end.  hell, they never even anticipated we would stay in one spot and pull the mobs to us, nor ae, nor FD being used for pulling..., kitting, quad kitting, the list goes on.  <br>
