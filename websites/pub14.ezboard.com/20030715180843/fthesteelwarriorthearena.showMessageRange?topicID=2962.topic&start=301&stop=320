I have no idea how other guilds progressed, but i had my silver bracelet of speed for almost a year now.<br>
<br>
Our first XtC, AoW kills date back less than 3 months due to being highly contested spawns.<br>
<br>
Maybe we were just having bad luck on PoI dragon, as we killed him a dozen times now and we still have to see a hammer drop and the 41 percent neck dropped only once.<br>
<br>
And for easy ntov/ssra weaponry, i think i can count the guilds capable of killing ntov named from aary onward and ssra beyond rhags with 2 hands still.<br>

I read about the arrows that would cause an increase in base agro somewhere and that idea had merit, but I'm not sure they would go through the effort to code something like that.<br>

I mentioned my position in the game as a reference point to detail my experience...  Most people who play this game know that experience is the largest factor in this game...  A level 65 character who has played since release and has seen almost every zone in the game is a more knowledgeable player than one that doesn't have the time commitment to even get to level 65.  Most specifically, someone who has played a specific class to 65 is a MUCH better knowledge base than someone who has &quot;seen&quot; said class play.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Yes, I agree, even a 15 mana spell like Cease costs mana. Does this mean that they are all mana drains? Nope, just that they cost mana. <br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
They cost mana, time to cast them, and opportunity cost of swings you missed while casting...<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
You RARELY run out of mana if you know what you're doing.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
As a hybrid, if you aren't running out of mana, then you haven't been half as worthwhile as a warrior. (who incedentaly doesn't need to use mana to be better than the knight at all times when they aren't using mana... ) Similar to a Warrior who doesn't use the KICK/SLAM or TAUNT.  Hybrids are oh so much more than 50% caster now.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Also, I notice in all of your thread you don't seem to differentiate between your diferent &quot;roles&quot; when discussing mana expenditures. In other words, you try to portray all of your roles as &quot;universal&quot; when they're not. For instance, if you're a tank, then you have a couple of responsibilities. You keep aggro, and take damage. Anything else is a bonus. &lt;snip innate insults&gt;<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Incorrect...  due to the fact I cannot take or deal damage like a warrior, I must do more than a warrior somewhere or the party was better off with a warrior.  This is a viewpoint issue.  Fluff ignored.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Again, this is true, the question is how much in order to perform your function in a group?<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
To lock aggro it takes almost all of my casting time, 4 of my spell slots and a large portion of my mana....  I have 3700mana, FT7, before buffs, and at least 15mana/tick at all times.....<br>
<br>
Festering Darkness<br>
Fear<br>
Terror of Thule<br>
Spear of Decay<br>
<br>
One Festering Darkness (clinging took a recent aggro nerf) and a Fear will guarantee me starting aggro, but do NOT guarantee that a mob will stay on me.  My TAUNT button remains in reserve when I need instant aggro, which will be followed by Spear and/or Terror to secure it again.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Here's where the BS begins to get deep. No one ever promised you an endless supply of mana to do with at your bidding.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
I never said anyone did...  wanna check out where the BS is coming from?  I said I must choose a role.. almost all of which I am lesser than an equally equipped warrior in the long run... I can exceed a warrior for a short period in many areas... but a few short bursts leaves me OOM and the warrior still riding high.  This is as it should be.  Its called balance.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
When you're tanking, your job is to get and hold aggro, that's ALL your job is. <br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Incorrect.. see above...  viewpoint issue.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
The fact that you may have to hold back on certain dots/taps/debuffs is of no real consequence, nor is it a great encroachment on your ability to play Everquest. No, no one was ever promised to be full time healer and tank at the same time. No one was promised to be full time DPS and tank at the same time. You have to choose your role and your spells accordingly. Otherwise you'd be evn MORE overpowered than you are now.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Nor did I ever say I should have infinite... I only said that my uber taunt COSTS something...  and indeed it cost me quite a bit in both skill caps, HP, equipment, and damage potential.  Then I must spend mana and lose much of my flexability (the one thing hybrids were supposed to be good at) in order to have that uber taunt for a short period.  Taunt is one of the few things that NEEDS to be &quot;bursty&quot; and which favors the Knights.<br>
<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
And? The point of this statement is? You're right, you're NOT going to have the same skillcaps as a warrior, the same disciplines, because you HAVE mana. The thing is if you foolishly deplete your mana trying to &quot;be it all&quot; then you have only yourself to look at.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Wierdly enough, I think we agree here.... I think you are a tad confused.  Hybrids should be better than warriors in short bursts, Warriors should be a consistent bar with which all other classes are measured.  Knights should be about shining moments... Warriors should be about consistency.  My arguement was based in the knowledge that my lower Hp and skillcaps were in trade for my spells... this much is true...  my point was that warriors frequently list everything a hybrids can do, but do not seem to understand that we cannot do them all at once.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
This is where your argument falls apart. This is the shadowknight's weakest argument. Keeping aggro is normally a non-issue. You guys spend WAY too much mana needlessly. You have a taunt button, learn how to use it.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
I wasn't the guy who said they had trouble with aggro... I am well familiar with my taunt button, and indeed have spent quite a bit of time experimenting with TAUNT and without my spells.  Hybrids use the TAUNT button for the same thing warriors do.... we just have 7 more taunt buttons. (Death Peace has a perma-slot)  I use mana for many things and I think I would be a better source for determining how much mana is &quot;needed&quot; for a shadowknight to taunt over you...<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
 Every warrior here can generally &quot;keep&quot; aggro without doing anything other than getting it in the first place. If you're spending too much mana &quot;keeping aggro&quot; then you are the one who doesn't understand how aggro works. <br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Question...  why are we talking about this if you can hold aggro fine enough? Knights are better at it true enough... but we are better at nearly EVERYTHING for the short time we have mana... and then fall off...  Knights are about BURSTS...  I told you if I burst in one area, then I cannot burst as much in another... and I start lower than warriors in almost all areas...<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Lay off the little spell gems, it's easy, mobs tend to stick with who they're aggroed on unless something dire happens. In THAT case, you have the tools at your disposal, but until that point, any mana spent is senseless.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Again... viewpoint.  If I do not exceed a warrior in some areas I am less useful than the warrior...  Hybrids are NOT specialists... we contribute in many places or we aren't worth our slot in the party.  Hybrid versatility makes up for our bursty natures.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
That's fine, so learn how to trust your cleric, and your DPS people. <br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Again, since you do everything automatically, sure you can say that...  I have to micromange everything or I am not worth my salt....  I do less damage than a warrior, take more mana to heal, and have no way to become invulnerable while still tanking. (without a chance to be interrupted) Hybrids must work harder in every case to come out equal to a warrior...  That means I have to use mana.  Sure, I can dedicate my mana to doing something (like taunting) but then I am less of a tank, less damage, and have no get-out-of-jail-free like a warrior either.  Its called balance.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
You know, I have *never* in PoP seen a shadowknight stop a group to med. Just doesn't happen. All the straw men in the world about 1 mana per tick mana regen (as though KEI isn't available in every other zone), and whatnot isn't real impressive if you're wasting your mana.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
We don't stop groups... we just keep going at reduced benefit... better to limp along LOM than make a party stop.  Those are the times we lose aggro just like warriors....  and we deal less damage.. and we are lesser tanks...  Again... I am a better judge than you are of what is wasting mana and what isn't as a Shadowknight.  I actually play one.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Nonsense, this is where the deception bgins... it'll continue, to be sure, but this is th beginning. You have a BIG reserve of mana,<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
I have 3700mana unbuffed.  No, its not large when you are using it...  Yes, It does help...  Note the fact that its limited... and not infinite.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
 and if you learned just a little bit about aggro, and about how to play your class, you'd know that you don't have to blow it to be superior to a warrior in the aggro department, you can do it WITHOUT downtime. <br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Hmm.. teach us oh master of the Shadowknight ways...<br>
Sorry... I am a better judge than you are here.  I play one.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
I see it all the time. A nice aggro spell to start off with... you got aggro, then you dont' have to cast till you LOSE aggro, you are guaranteed to get it back, no volatility, no RNG issues, no nothing. It just works.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
I once saw a guy pull a rabbit out of a hat... I must be an expert at slight of hand then!  From your example I only need to SEE it to become a master!<br>
Sorry, experience is the only teacher in both cases.  I have it when it comes to shadowknights... you don't (obviously).<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
We have 2 things &quot;over&quot; you..... more hitpoints per stamina point, and better skillcaps. <br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Better skillcaps that result in:<br>
-More damage output from your weapons<br>
-Less damage done to your higher HP caps. (agreed that knights are quite close here)<br>
<br>
1000 more HP in the endgame<br>
<br>
You forgot all about disciplines that actually DO something.<br>
<br>
All of which I have to use SPELLS to compensate for.<br>
(agreed that for the most part this is how it should be... I have issues with disciplines all around (including warrior ones).  Knight and warrior disciplines should be like the setup I mentioned before...  Warrior disciplines should be consistent (and perhaps PERSISTENT) and Hybrid ones should be spectacular but bursty.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
&lt;snip innane attempt at wit&gt;<br>
&quot;easier to obtain better equipment&quot;. That is simply put a pile of crahp. <br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Take a look at all of the Class-only armor sets in every expansion.  Crafted/Darkforge, Cobalt/BE, Plane of Growth, Dorf/Giant/Dragon quest armors, Twilight armors, Ornate armors, Elemental Armors.....  the warrior versions have more Hp and AC in nearly every case.  Unless you are on the &quot;uber&quot; side of the scale and wearing VT gear, the warriors will have more AC/HP (and now ATK and regen as well) from their equipment than Knights do.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
What you're conveniently leaving out is this: Dead Shamans and Enchanters are oom a hell of a lot more than SK's who know how to play their class. You're not the only one in a group with mana, and as a matter of fact, your wise use of yours makes others use theirs a LOT less when grouped with you than when grouped with me.<br>
END QUOTE<br>

Thats a large exaggeration.  Shadowknights' wise use of mana makes their job easier... but when a Shadowknight is OUT of mana, they are harder to maintain than warriors are.  Sure, I can maintain aggro better than a warrior, but when I do, I am not dealing the damage of a warrior, not tanking as well as a warrior, and thus the fight is longer and more costly in mana than a warrior tanking who does know how to taunt.  My taunt is more absolute, and the Knight retains the ability to taunt at distance to make pong less likely...  its a fair trade.  You have been convieniently leaving out your strengths and only posting your weaknesses to support your case...<br>

 As you know (well, probably not) Supernal Remedy, the spell most often used by clerics to heal ancillary party members who are injured due to a loss of aggro, costs EXACTLY the same as Complete heal, barring focus items. Supernal Elixir, the SAME mana as complete heal. If we lose aggro, let me give you a little mana lesson... We cost MORE per minute than you do. We DO lose aggro and we DO cost more than you do on a cleric's mana bar.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Not when you know when and how to taunt...  Like you said before.. you CAN taunt, just not as well as a Knight.<br>
Knight = better at taunt<br>
Warrior = better at tanking<br>
Knight = better at versatility in bursts<br>
Warrior = better at consistency<br>
<br>
My overall point was that warriors like you were overexaggerating.  You have very well made my point thank you.<br>
<br>
Overall, warriors could use a boost here and there.. (like just about every other class) and indeed the overall combat system could use one.  We already talked about some way to let warriors add numerical hate...<br>
<br>
Likely the weapon schemes need to re-evaluated as well.  Dual wield needs a looksee...  very specifically in PoP.  1H+Shield needs a boost as well. (warriors should have this as a viable choice)<br>
<br>
I would like to see the following:<br>
-ALL PoP 2H AAXP's made to work with whatever is in the PRIMARY hand.<br>
-offhand damage bonus increases post 60.<br>
-WAR/SHD/PAL only, PRIMARY only, higher ratio 1H weapons.<br>
-Shields DOING something worthy of the DPS loss.... (Shield block? Making x% of Ripostes MISS?)<br>
-Other classes besides RNG not being so worthless with ranged weapons... Rangers ar FAR better tanks than warriors are archers!<br>
-Damage bonuses being scaled correctly for ALL weapons.. this includes high delay 1H weapons, and low delay 2H....<br>
-More itemization variations overall...  why is it always everyone gets &quot;X&quot; sword for 2H and &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; for dual wield because everything else is so bad in comparison?<br>
<br>
Wouldn't it be fun if warrior_01 chose to 1H/Shield an be viable and Warrior_02 chose to dual wield and be viable but in a different way with different advantages?  Wouldn it be more fun to have a couple 2H choices that actually competed against each other for advantages instead of the current 2H situation?<br>
(In the high end, there are two weapons for WAR/Knights:Blade of War and SEWS... everything else is not worthy of mention as it doesn't compete with even 60th level Ssra weaponry)<br>
<br>
ah dreaming...<br>

All very well in 'theory'. But what you appear to be purposefully ignoring is that in an exp situation that initial burst is all that is neccessary to tank a mob well, my 'consistancy' doesn't have time to show itself in an appreciable sense.<br>

<br>
Firstly please give me figures on a genuine example of the  amount of time/number of heals saved by having a warrior tank an EXP mob - given they generally die in 2mins tops. <br>
<br>
Secondly even when I use my taunt well there are occasions when nothing helps. I've gone at least 5 attempts in a fight with taunt failing to turn a mob, can the same be said of spell casting? The trade is not fair since generally people go for  'not getting hit much', over 'a fairly good chance of getting hit each fight'. Wether it's balanced game mechanic wise is less important than how it plays out in a group of real people who (not being uber like yourself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) aren't looking for percent damage over time...<br>

Glatius, we both know you really only want to disagree with me and don't really have an arguement. You are unnecessarily jealous and hurt that I might be right about being more knowledgeable in this case. You don't &quot;respect&quot; anything that anyone else says that is outside your &quot;accepted knowledge&quot;, as it has to be wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question Glatius,<br>
<br>
If someone had been doing ANY other activity for many years and had advanced to the highest accomplishments in that activity...  you might be willing to take advice from them wouldn't you?<br>
<br>
For instance, If someone had been playing hockey for 20+ years, been on a championship professional hockey team, and won a medal in ice hockey in the Olympics, most people would consider that person to be a good source of advice when it comes to ice hockey.<br>
<br>
Why is it you find it so hard to believe that someone who has played EQ since beta (4+ years), seen and done almost everything the game has to offer, and has &quot;been carried&quot; by writing his portion of the &quot;how to&quot; threads that 3+ years of EQ newbies have been reading would know something about the game?<br>
<br>
Getting to 65 is not really that hard...  it just takes time.  However, a 65 character who is where I am is due to his peers recognizing something in that player...  especially in a Shadowknight where we aren't in particular demand due to having to battle tooth and nail to educate the ignorant masses to even be considered better than not having our class along at all!<br>
<br>
In hockey, there is always talent and skill along with experience and knowledge that make up your overall competence.<br>
IN EQ, &quot;talent&quot; and &quot;skill&quot; are not much of a factor.  Experience is nearly everything in EQ, and feeds directly to knowledge.<br>
<br>
I listed not only my level, but my state of advancement to emphasize the fact I could not have been &quot;carried&quot;... and in fact the point that I have been carrying others for most of my EQ experience.  Carrying misinformed individuals like yourself.<br>
<br>
Those who haven't even bothered to invest the time required to get one character to 65 will not have as much experience as a player overall, and at the very least will not have seen much of the game and many of the zones.<br>
<br>
I know you have no way of finding this out currently, but you don't run into many boneheads in Elemental Planes...  there is a reason for that.<br>
<br>
This isn't to say that everyone not there is a bonehead...  just that you don't have the time investment, and thus the experience... same thing with level 65 and everything else in EQ.<br>
<br>
I don't care whether you are impressed or not.<br>
I don't care for your blatant jealousy... as you will eventually get here... it just takes time.<br>
<br>
I care only for logically defending my points, and dispelling the lies and exagegrations that this &quot;grass is greener&quot; thread and just about every other one like it has in abundance.<br>
<br>
Now, do try to tell me how your experience in EQ, and specifically YOUR experience with Shadowknights is greater than mine...  I will be entertained, that much is for sure.<br>

I hope you do not mind if I add my perspective. I think some good points have been made on both sides of the issue. Some things in particular came to my attention reading through this thread.<br>
<br>
There was some talk about how the 'gap' between warriors and knights has been dwindled. I think this is clearly true. However, I would argue that it was clearly needed. You can argue that they went to far, but to say that the gap did not need to be closed is to forget how bad it truely was for knights back in the days of kunark. I truely believe that the balance between knights and warriors overall in EQ is better now than it ever has been in EQ, although you could make a good arguement that there was a good balance just after they added the crafted armor quest and crits for warriors (this was a month or so before the plane of fear was released if I recall correctly).<br>
<br>
What is one measure of balance? Well, ideally, I think the following should both be true:<br>
(1) Most groups would prefer a good warrior over a bad knight to tank<br>
(2) Most groups would prefer a good knight over a bad warrior to tank<br>
<br>
Today, I think warriors are a bit more dependant on the players skill in order to be effective in tanking for a group. This is not to say there is not a lot to know to tank as a knight, because I believe there is, but even a bad knight can do 'ok' as long as they know to use stuns for agro. The real question it seems to me is whether this disparity is too extreme. Perhaps it requires too much skill (so there are too few warriors with such skill) for a warrior to tank as well as the average knight? Or perhaps it requires too little skill for a knight to gain and control agro?<br>
<br>
Whatever the solution, I hope it is one that moves closer to the ideal above, where good players are choosen over bad players, regardless of the class. I think it will be difficult to do that, because I think we are pretty close to balanced now, so I hope the change is subtle enough to achieve that goal, without going too far.<br>
<br>
That aside, I would like to make some more specific comments about some issues raised above.<br>
<br>
Timing with the taunt key is incredibly important.  I may be a knight, but I use the taunt key all the time, and as many have stated above, using it at the right time makes a huge difference. As a paladin, the most effective means I have to regain agro when I lose it? The taunt key. Stuns and such are preemptive agro, you use those early to keep your hate value high. Once you lose it, (for example if you are a poor player), then stuns are much less effective for getting agro back. Most of the time, it is the taunt key which flips the mob back to you. Then you throw on the stuns to ensure the mob stays on you. Sometimes, the best thing about a stun is it stops the mob from hitting the enchanter long enough for you to get in a second taunt try.<br>
<br>
There are solutions today for the inital agro problem. Just one is to use root: puller pulls mob, caster roots it when it gets to warrior, warrior taunts right after tash lands, taunts again after slow lands, warrior taunts again when it cycles, root breaks but one of those taunts worked and the mobs is safely on the warrior. This is just about as effective as a paladin casting stuns as a mob is coming in, the only difference is it requires two people (warrior and rooter) to coordinate, rather than one person.<br>
<br>
When you come down to it, the main thing that hybrids bring to an exp group is they can agro better than a warrior. That is the advantage they have for tanking to make up for their disadvangages tanking. I do not think you can take this away. Can you reduce the gap some? Sure, probably. But too far and you end up on the other end of the spectrum, which in my opinion (biased) is worse. <br>
<br>
If you cannot get to perfect balance, then to have one class be a bit more desirable in exp groups, while the other class is a bit more desireable on raids seems like a better compromise than to have the same class be better both on raids and in exp groups. <br>
<br>
There are some warriors who will argue that no other class should be tanking, and that knights should have other things they can do. I am just going to have to disagree with this viewpoint. I think knights should be viable tanks, at least in exp groups. <br>
<br>
Ok, next point, mana issues. At my point in the game, I no longer have any mana issues with agro generation. None. If the only thing I am doing is generating agro, I will never run out of mana. I can generate plenty of agro and still be gaining mana while I am standing, assuming some mana regen buffs (which I always have). There was a time when I would run out of mana a lot when stunning, but at the top end of the game, this is no longer the case.<br>
<br>
And last point, not that it really matters, but a paladin can tank the lower powater mobs, it just takes more than one healer (which I think a warrior might need as well?) The smallest group I have ever done lower powater with is the following:<br>
Paladin<br>
-cleric bot<br>
-enchanter bot<br>
Ranger<br>
-cleric bot<br>
Ranger<br>
We hunted for 5 hours or so, with only a few deaths, and never a total wipeout. (All of the deaths were either from a cleric bot fizzle that was not caught or pulls of more than one mob with bad resists on mez)<br>
<br>
That said, powater (and kedge for that matter), are some places where some of the agro advantage a knight has is negated, because you cannot cast if you are moving at all, and when mobs hit you, they push you. <br>

I and most warriors have no issue with Knights being a good interchangeable choice as Tank for a group SO LONG AS the warrior is not made an noticeably 'inferior' choice.<br>

<br>
Lets be honest here, there isn't really all that much skill involved in use of the taunt key. At the most basic level, you don't blow it unneccessarily so that you're waiting for refresh, you keep an eye on how and when the casters tash/slow whatever and are ready to hit it at the correct moment. The warriors problem is that his ONLY means to control aggro is random - totally beyond his control - he can push the odds to favour success but if the roll isn't right he ain't in business full stop. <br>
<br>
Stuns and etc add specific amounts of hate - not an immediate route to top of the aggro (thats taunt) but nevertheless a far more 'reliable' source of hate generation. Given the spottiness of the RNG that reliability (reliability at range also) is often now being considered much more useful than a small advantage in mitigation. Taunt, weapon procs and DPS all require the mob to be in your face, if there is any problem, poor roll, then you have a mob hitting someone other than the tank, taunting off the puller if a slow will be landing shortly thereafter (before taunt refreshes) and indeed the initial intercept required to get into weapons range and generate aggro are good examples of problems that knights can totally avoid via ranged spells. Furthermore taunt is a reactive skill, you can only attempt to regain aggro, you cannot actively maintain aggro where knights can dictate it much better.<br>

The other difference is that yet again the warrior player is forced to rely on someone else to be able to accomplish his task, this is a major negative from a psychological standpoint, one likes to exact some degree of control over the job or why bother? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
This is my one VERY serious disagreement with you (and most other knights). Raids and exp groups are two seperate, entirely unrelated activities. <br>
<br>
Desirability in an exp group determines if you will get to do anything with your time online, when did anyone get turned away from a guild raid because they were 'not the most desirable class'?  Indeed as your own examples show there are many mobs now that don't require a warrior to tank in a raid setting anyway. I find this supposed warrior advantage to be totally unacceptable as a legitimate balancing arguement.<br>

<br>
Again most of us have never seriously argued that this should be the case, I don't mind knights tanking, I do mind being marginalised in the one and only role that i can perform. Getting the balance right (if thats possible) is the problem. <br>
<br>
As I've said before i feel more work should be done to allow ALL plate tanks (not just knights) to provide a useful function to the group outside of the traditional MT role...<br>

<br>
Yes, but when you have a situation where a good knight is preferred over a good warrior, that's a problem.  It should be a toss up.  There shouldn't be a clear reason to take one over the other.  This is exactly the arguement that knights have used since Kunark to get their 'needed' upgrades.  If the arguement was valid for them, it's valid for us.<br>
<br>
And whether we care to bring it up or not, EQ is a game.  It's for entertainment.  You shouldn't have to deal with one character type being easier and more fun to play while another character type that performs the same function is harder and more frustrating.  As it stands for many people, myself included, playing a Warrior can be quite frustrating because of the lack of control.  Previously this lack of control was less destructive in it's results, so it was more tolerable.<br>
<br>
As it stands today, when I lose aggro at the start of a fight, all I can do is hit taunt and throw out a shield on the new target.  That's it.  If taunt works, weee, I win!  If taunt fails, I try again.  And maybe again, and maybe again.  I'm basically standing there throwing a pair of dice hoping they come up 7.  Meanwhile the person with aggro isn't just getting popped a bit, they're taking a serious ass whooping.  Maybe they die.  Maybe they just suck up a lot of mana.  But they sure aren't pleased by it.  The healer sure isn't pleased by it.  And I'm sure not pleased by it.  This is not fun or entertainment when it's done on basically an every mob or every other mob basis.<br>
<br>
Yes we know, it can be worked around if the people involved are willing to go to a bit more trouble.  Yet if these people are a pick up group of strangers, why would they want to go to more trouble if you're not the only tank standing around?  Does the Warrior bring something to the table that would justify this additional overhead?  It seems that many classes feel he doesn't.  And frankly, as a Warrior, I don't think we do either.  The Warrior advantages for most Warriors have been seriously diluted.  Our disadvantages have had additional emphasis placed on them so they come to the forefront more frequently.  This really does need to be addressed.  But in a careful and controlled fashion.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how up to it SOE really is.  I'm just hopeful they'll give it a try.<br>

If you cannot get to perfect balance, then to have one class be a bit more desirable in exp groups, while the other class is a bit more desireable on raids seems like a better compromise than to have the same class be better both on raids and in exp groups. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This is my one VERY serious disagreement with you (and most other knights). Raids and exp groups are two seperate, entirely unrelated activities. <br>
<br>
Desirability in an exp group determines if you will get to do anything with your time online, when did anyone get turned away from a guild raid because they were 'not the most desirable class'? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Plenty of people have been turned away from joining a guild because they are not a needed class for that guild. The most often used example is the fact Afterlife listed on their guildpage for a year they were not recruiting any paladins (because they were useless on raids).<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is the exception, but most of the people in my guild spend most of their online time raiding, not doing exp groups. When your guild raids 10 hours a day or more, there is not a lot of time left over for exp grouping.<br>
<br>
For what I do, desirablity for a raid is much more important than how desirable you are in an exp group. <br>
<br>
So, back to my original point. I am not saying that the goal should be one class should be better on raids and the other better in exp groups. What I said was if you assume that you cannot be perfect, and get them 100% balanced, then it makes sense to make one better at raids and the other better in exp groups, rather than one class better at both. Do you really disagree with this? (I am not saying this as an excuse, I would feel the same way if paladins were needed on raids more and less useful in exp groups than warriors).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Indeed as your own examples show there are many mobs now that don't require a warrior to tank in a raid setting anyway. I find this supposed warrior advantage to be totally unacceptable as a legitimate balancing arguement.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I can not think of a single boss mob that we do which I could tank on a raid. Can I off tank adds and such? Yes, I can. But the main bosses? No, I cannot. Could I tank some things we finished with 6 months or more ago, sure, probably, but those encounters are beneath us in the challenge involved, we have moved on. I think you will find in most guilds that only warriors are able to tank the hard bosses they are fighting, whatever they are. <br>
<br>
Let me put it to you this way. If warriors were given a 1.5 second 'cast time' ability that generated hate, like a stun, which they could use between swings, but knights were given defensive and evasive would you be happy? As a knight, if this was done, I would feel like I was getting the better end of the deal, but perhaps this is a case of the grass being greener?<br>
<br>
One thing I would like to be clear about is knights consider themselves tanks. In in ideal world, I think knights and warriors should all be equally good tanks, in exp groups <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on raids. Different, but equally good.<br>
<br>
I am willing to settle for not being able to tank any ubermob, for the consolation that I am a bit better in exp groups.<br>

I do not see that as the problem. A good knight being chosen over a good warrior is ok, they are both good players. The problem is when a bad knight is chosen over a good warrior. Or if a group doesnt want to take a chance on a warrior, because the good ones are too rare. <br>
<br>
I am not saying that is is not an issue today. I am saying that it is not nearly as bad as some would have you believe. Good warriors are getting chosen for groups all the time. Just read this thread for many examples. <br>
<br>
As many others have pointed out, it may be impossible to get to a point where the choice between a good warrior and a good knight is a toss-up. There will be some min/max players who will say either one or the other is best, given equal skill. This is why I said the test should be a comparison between a bad person of one and a good one of the other. As long as those two conditions are not true, then the two classes are pretty close to balanced. Small tweaks are possible, but care must be taken to not push to the other extreme.<br>

I would very much like to see a comparison of the dps between a warrior tanking and a knight tanking the same exp mob. It is my suspicion that a warrior significantly more dps than at least a paladin tanking. I know I give up dps in order to tank. Yes, we can cast stuns between swings, but with the fast weapons of today, that is hard to time, and with a lot going on, usually low on my priority list. If my suspicions are correct, simply making the difference more widely known might be a big boost in getting that good warrior chosen over the good knight, at least some of the time.<br>

Cool, I'd like to see some parses of the DPS of the rest of the group minus both the Paladin and the Warrior when the Paladin is tanking versus when the Warrior is tanking.  If the overall group DPS isn't significantly higher with the Paladin, I'd be highly surprised.  I know the entire group gives up DPS in order to allow me to tank. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>
