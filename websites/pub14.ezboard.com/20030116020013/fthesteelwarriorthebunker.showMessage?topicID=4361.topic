<br>
I've avoided posting this for a long time because I've always been more of a lurker than someone who asks specific questions pertaining to themselves, but I've gotten to a point where I just can't seem to figure out how I should move forward.<br>
<br>
Here's the profile: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...?num=23971">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...?num=23971</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
If you look at Goal 1, you can get some idea of what I'm attempting to upgrade to, but I really can't tell if I can obtain a majority of this stuff with the resources I have available.<br>
<br>
The general problem is related to a couple of things:<br>
<br>
1) I am presently unguilded. This limits my options as far as getting equipment that comes from raids. Now, I know, the answer is to join a guild, right? Unfortunately, on Firiona Vie, this is not so easy. There are 2 moderately high end guilds on the server (one being more advanced than the other by a fair bit from what I know). Neither of these guilds need any more warriors, and have extremely high-level requirements for new warriors to join. I have only recently made 60 and I don't think I will be catching up to the requirements any time soon.<br>
<br>
The other guilds on the server are generally either so small that they don't raid (or can't raid anything that is worth raiding), don't raid just because they don't want to, or are evil-only, which prevents me from joining because my girlfriend's cleric is a High Elf.<br>
<br>
2) There is next to no high end gear for sale on Firiona Vie, because of the low population. When high-end things do go up for sale, they are usually so overpriced that it's ridiculous. I have never seen a Fleshgrinder for sale, nor any one-handed weapon more potent than a Flaming Dirk. For 2-handed weapons, I've seen one Stonebladed Axe of Dismay for sale in the last 2 months or so, and it was going for 40k. So generally, buying gear (weapons or armor) is not an option. Champion's armor is about the highest level armor you can find in the Bazaar, which I have little enough need of (except for the BP which usually goes for 100k, in the 3 times I've seen one available).<br>
<br>
So, it seems likely that I will have to get whatever gear upgrades I want by fighting the stuff, which is fine. The question is, what can I obtain with either a single 60+ group of non-uber, non-primal-level people (fairly balanced group: 60 War, 60 Clr, 60 Enc, 60 Dru, 60 Wiz would be a typical example). If this is not an option, I can probably round up 12-18 people occasionally for some sort of small raid, but it's hard to get all my friends around for that kind of thing (just logistics, you know).<br>
<br>
A vague option is trying to put together Open Raids, which the server has fairly frequently. The only real problem with this is that Open Raids almost always end up with 10-15 level 51 warriors, and then very few other, more needed, classes.<br>
<br>
Well, that's the longwinded situation. If anyone has any suggestions about where to go (been thinking CT, but don't know if my group can handle the places I would need to go) or what can be raided with 12 people, please let me know.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=haass>Haass</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 639<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/8/02 10:10:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4361.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Upgrades available with a small group (~12) of 60+ playe</span><hr size=1> Okay, first off, your magelo link is broke due to the truncating, here's one that works -- <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23971">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...?num=23971</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Your first goal profile looks pretty good..however with a group of 6, you're gonna have a hard time getting stuff out of 4c (fleshgrinder, Lizard earrings)  It requires a really DPS heavy group to break into there.  With 12, you should have no problem as long as people can follow instructions.  You can however get into TR and camp a stoneblade axe and do the sewers for skeeter earrings fairly easily.  I'd say that profile is fairly reasonable.  It'll take a bit of work, but it's definitely doable with 6.<br>
<br>
I'm basically in the same situation...i'm unguilded (well, was until I made my own last week just to have green chat between the friends I do hunt with) and everything I have was obtained by 1 group and my smith.  You can do CT...make no mistake, it's hardcore, you're gonna die a lot till you figure out how to deal with certain things and situations, but the xp is phenomanal and the loot is better.  By the time you've got the stuff you want from CT, you should be ready to take a crack at 6 man HoT.<br>
<br>
I'd say you're being overall pretty reasonable about what you can get...unless everyone you know sucks or something <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Marshall Haass Wolvesbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

Chardok Ring/Cord<br>
Strength of the Elements<br>

All doable with a single group of 60s, just require you to have some serious patience <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
CT should also be doable by your group although you might find the harder camps are too rough with your hps atm.<br>
<br>
Weapon-wise, farm UP mini-bosses and hope for some good drops I guess, or just wait and see what comes out of PoP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maolas@thesteelwarrior>Maolas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/8/02 10:22:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4361.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Upgrades available with a small group (~12) of 60+ playe</span><hr size=1> Whoops, sorry about the magelo link, had to cut and paste a bunch of times because my browser wasn't caching the fields when I'd preview and go back.<br>
<br>
I figured that 4c would be out of reach with a single group, for the most part.  I have been thinking about doing TR or the sewers, but have recerntly been sucked in by the awesome experience that is PoP.  I was actually talking with some friends tonight about going to CT or Sssra just to see what we could do now though.  I've hunted the courtyard/maze area of CT for a while, so I have some idea what to expect with the casters and such, but I'm sure I'll die plenty.  That's ok, it's part of the learning process...<br>
<br>
As for the reasonableness, it's the only choice I have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I could fill my goals with ToV/VT/etc loot until my fingers bled, but it wouldn't get me any closer to being able to tank better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'd like to think that my closer friends are pretty competant players.  We've ventured a bit into Sssra with only 4 when we were all 57 and did ok with no deaths, and have done CT successfully in the outer areas several times.  The enchanter friend is one of the best enchanters I've ever grouped with though, and I've been playing with him for 3+ years over several servers, so we work extremely well together.  While I'd really like the Stonebladed Axe, I will probably go for sewers first, as there is at least a few things for different people there... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maolas@thesteelwarrior>Maolas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/8/02 10:28:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4361.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   RE: </span><hr size=1> I have started work on the Chardok Ring/Cord quests.  Still doing faction work at the moment, which is slow going, but it is in the future.<br>
<br>
I didn't realize that the Strength of the Elements was doable by a single group, but I will look at it again, as it's been a while.<br>
<br>
Eyepatch is probably out of the question for now.  Because of the Trivial Loot Code on Firiona Vie, Stormfeather will no longer drop the map piece for me at level 60, so I'd have to either buy it (running between 30-50k usually) or pay someone to camp it.  Also, about 99% of the time I'm either grouped with an enchanter or my shaman, so the haste wouldn't find much use, and the stats alone don't really justify the time/money I'd have to spend on it.<br>
<br>
Patience I have, though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What would you suggest weapon-wise from UP?  Something for the offhand such as the LSoF, or something else?<br>
<br>
I have the Frostbringer merely for it's taunt of course, but I don't think it's horribly needed in xp groups at present. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sandrakspiritwalker>Sandrak Spiritwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/8/02 3:04:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4361.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.attrition.org/eq/sigs/granthor.jpg HEIGHT=160 WIDTH=140 ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: RE: </span><hr size=1> 5 of the items I wear come from CT and it was 6 until I gave the belt away for my Belt of the Destroyer that I don't need anymore so it will be 6 again soon.<br>
<br>
Anyway, every CT item on my body is obtainable with one group or less of level 60s except for my bracer, which we used 14 to get.  A monk is nice, but in no way required if you have a competent enchanter.  This is even more true now with the new PoP enchanter spells, there are no more unmezzable mobs in 4C.<br>
<br>
Items I wear from 4c:<br>
<br>
2 Lizard Tooth Earings - Ritualist, NE corner of Archon Temple (4c)<br>
Amygdalan Chain Mask - Enraged Amy, East side, Top level of Archon Temple.<br>
Barbed Rubicite Coif - Spiritcaller, Bottom level of the temple proper, west side.<br>
Crystalized Acid Bracer - Ring of Slime, Old SG area.<br>
<br>
Other items from 4c that are good:  Fleshgrinder (Adept), Lizard Bone Earing (Adept), Amy war staff thing (forget name, Enraged Amy).<br>
<br>
Other items from CT that are good:  Barbed Rubicite Pants (Hunter, SW corner of maze), the warrior belt I used to wear and cant think of the name of from the sewars.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you want obtainable upgrades that are 1-2 groupable then CT is the place to go.  DPS is important for 4c but not as important as working well together.  I posted the safest spot to setup in 4c in the &quot;shoulder&quot; thread a couple below this.  If anyone has any questions, feel free to send me a tell online.<br>
