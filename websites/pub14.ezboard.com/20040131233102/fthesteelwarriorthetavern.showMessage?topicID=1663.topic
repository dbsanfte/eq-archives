A little advise to anyone that is new to the whole guild process. Make sure you apply to one guild at a time. See I made the HUGE mistake of applying to two guilds in my search for family and low and behold that's a big NO NO. And here I thought it was like looking for a job where you get a few apps and see which one you like the most. It looks like im too ignorant for my own good. You'd think that if this was such a big deal that it would be mentioned somewhere in the guild rules or application process. Looks like that was left out. I play on the Rathe server and if anyone needs a warr let me know. For the time being im going to stay away from guilds. If this is the trouble ill be looking forward too than forget it For some insight in to how these people handle this situation check out this link<br>

Basically you're saying, I don't really care whether or not I get into your guild, I'm just looking to get into any guild.  It comes across as kind of self serving, to be honest.<br>
<br>
And given the greed, envy, childish behavor, and aggravation a bad choice can bring to a guild, its kind of hard to blame them for wanting to be as careful as they can.<br>
<br>

This is the tavern after all or is it not a place to discuss such things? If you made a mistake that cost you membership into two great guilds im sure you'd be pretty pissed off as well. Im not here talking smack about either of the guilds. Im just here venting my frustration. Not everyone has the experience and knowledge that you do when it comes to getting a guild. I posted here to warn people that, like myself, are new to this so they wont make the same mistake I did. One of the greatest gifts EQ can provide is the satifaction of helping and guiding others. Some of us tend to forget that and get so caught up with ourselves the we step on those that may not be of the same experiance lvl. Honest mistakes do happen. As far as me being overdramatic is concerned, I chose a tone and demeanor to show that I repect them and I respect any decision they make. If I were to be dramatic and childish, which is what they dont want, I would have pitced a fit, cursed, and had myself banned. But where exactly would that get me? Aboslutely nowhere. <br>

Maybe I'm mistaken.  Didn't you add a link to the bottom of your initial thread leading to a guild board?  Don't you thereby indicate at a minimum which guild in all probability showed you the door when they found out you were applying to more than one guild?<br>
<br>
I would conclude from this that not only are you telling people that its a bad idea to apply to two guilds at the same time, which is very good advice, but you're going out of your way to identify the guild that shut you out.  Why?<br>
<br>
Why does anyone who might need your advice on not applying to two guilds need the link?  It leads me to conclude that somehow you wanted to bring attention to this guild for some reason.  Certainly it wouldn't be to commend them on their fine application process, would it?<br>

Maybe not.  Its hard to read people's true intentions based solely on the written word.  But frequently when someone relates an experience that happened to them and attaches a link to a guild's board in the process, its often times not for benevolent reasons.  Singling out a particular guild, unless you are clearly praising them, always brings your motives into question.<br>
<br>
If I miscontrued the intentions, my humble apologies. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

If anything at least my dilemma will provide you all with some entertainment. <br>
At the very least I want to clear up my name with that guild. I care about how people consider my char in game and I truely dont want people to think Im some kind of A$$ that just wants to use a guild for selfish reasons. I wouldnt be putting up such a fuss if I didnt care. Clan Bashemded is a great guild and I have nothing negative to say about them period. To tell you the truth, now that I think about it, this whole scenario im involved in proves that they do care very much about who is excepted. You have a point when you pointed out that the link just gives evidence that they have very high recruitment standards. <br>
    Now we are back to where I stand which is in the dog house. I'm going to have to do some serious explaining to get myself out of this mess. I just hope they believe me and dont think im some kind of guild whore or worse...a Leacher. <br>

It would also be a courtesy to the guild you (if you are leaving one) are leaving that you remove yourself before shopping around for a new one.
