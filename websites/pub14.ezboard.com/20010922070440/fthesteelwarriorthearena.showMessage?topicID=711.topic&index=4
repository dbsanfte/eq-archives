Just like everyone relies on you to use assist and stay on the mob you should rely on the chanter for mezzing and the cleric for healing. <p>May the wolves guide your path<BR>

You got lucky, and didnt die, but no cleric shoulda been nuking.... WHen I play my 51 cleric, I will root park, but when not stunning or rooting, I will be medding just in case it is needed... ESPECIALLY in your case, where you had 10 mobs.... THose clerics can help watch out for the chanter, and root mobs that are on the chanter... then chanter can mez them at his/her leisure...<br>
<br>
I know the room you speak of, I hunt Tower quite a bit, and have pulled a train quite similar to what you speak of... my normal group for tower is a 38 ogre warrior(me), 34 bard, 32 Chanter, 34 monk, 34 druid, and on the side, not in group we have a 51 cleric hotkey healing (me again)...  We had about the same issue, except I pulled two skellies, and got lost and ran past the cooks room(which pulled all 3) and the armor thingy next door, and then the butlers popped on me... dont think we picked up the servant, but we might have.. regardless, it was a nasty mess..  I picked the nastiest mob, and started my attack... monk and bard assisted me, and we started bashing... I then tried to swap to next mob and get some damage done, and get 2 taunts off..then I would switch to next mob, Damage/two taunts, next mob, etc..  didnt take long before I needed a heal, so cleric nails me with heal, 2 mobs on cleric...  so Chanter starts mezzing mobs on cleric...  anything still on me that hasnt had taunt treatment, or anything moving to chanter, and I would start melee and taunting.  ANything mezzed I dont touch... and my bard and monk stay on first mob til its dead....  I see that mob fall, my monk and bard switch to my target...  NOW, if mezzed mob comes alive, and I cant get to it quick enough, then druid or cleric should be root parking and medding... in our situation, druid realized she was backup healer.. so she was medding her arse off... <br>
<br>
only things cleric was doing, was healing. AND, if cleric wasnt me hotkey healing, then I woulda had cleric as secondary root parker.<br>
<br>
only thing druid was doing, was damage shields, root parking,  and medding for heals. No snares needed til 2nd to last mob aggrod falls on tower floor 3.<br>
<br>
Only thing Chanter doing, okay chanter was busy.. but when ARENT they busy... hehehe  chanter was mezzing anything on Cleric or Druid or chanters' self. Also Chanter should be hasting, and if all else resolved, slowing the heavy hitters(that armor thingy has a ton of hp's and hits hard)<br>
<br>
Only thing bard is doing, is assisting me, and twisting out buff songs, NOT AE songs, just  buff songs. Those buffs included damage shield for an additional 8 points of damage(on top of druid damage shield) and other buff songs, PLUS he was meleeing along side monk.. If this was a controlled situation, 2-3 mobs, I like my bard to do AE songs... at level 34, a bard can do around 50 AE damage in songs every tick(6 seconds) more if bard twists in their 30 song...  <br>
<br>
Monk was assisting me, just like bard.. one target for all their attentions, and then they assist me again til next mob is dead...<br>
<br>
Now, I would generally have monk pulling, but he is just getting used to FD pulling, and at that time we were just trying to kick out the exp, so I was pulling...<br>
<br>
the whole thing in a nutshell is training... Your people have to know what they need to do... You might want to spend 5 mins and explain to people what to do before you get into this situation, but everyone needs to know what to do..<br>
<br>
I aint saying what we did is the gospel, hell my groupies teach me new things daily.. hehehe but we work hard at our strategies, and communication is the key... I generally do not like to have my tanks switching to other targets to gain aggro, not cause I want to be the savior, but because when you got too many people switching to gain aggro, the cleric has to heal multiple people, and there is much more chaos... ALSO, if two tanks are trying to gain aggro and both break a chanters mez accidently, the chanter then has 2 mobs to worry about, whereas if one tank accidently breaks a mez, then chanter can remez and yell at said tank..<br>
<br>
good hunting... tower is a great dungeon...<br>
<br>
PS - IMHO best spot to pull to on floor 3 is that hall leading to mirror for floor 4... nothing goes back there... you can pull back there to your hearts content.. and if shiot goes haywire, you can always run past the maids and butlers and zone out..<br>
