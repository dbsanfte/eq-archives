We buff and start pulling hub to just keep ourselfs occupied, decide to let them have there tries at em. Around 7 they have 25 people in zone and kill Iki and decide to go on to Eashan.

<br>
<br>
Well first of all we had 30 on Lenny ... and saw you all moving in zone ... but after Lenny you hadnt moved into NToV yet, so we did.<br>
<br>
It was our first time in NToV, so we had to go over the ground rules, do and donts Etc. We had an app that agro'd Iky early wasnt a complete wipe, but most of the raid died. We Rezzed in the hatchling room. Again after buffing we again trained ourselves, due to inexperience in that area of the zone. So rezzed and buffed again. Then pulled Iky's guards, then him Np. Do the loot, med up. Yes this took some time. it was at this point we were down to about 25 folks or so. But felt rather confident we could take Eashen though it would prolly be a close fight.<br>
Move to Iky's room pull a crap load of hatchlings. Move in toward Eashen, changed plans moved back to Iky's room. Pulled Hatchlings again, Pulled Eashen and got an add, due to again inexperience in that area. well we got Eashen to 50% before we wiped with the add. Could we have done it? Sure np, we would have own'd him on a single pull. <br>
<br>
At about that time we are rezzing, some are KoS by this time. Rezzing is going a little slow. Hatchlings are repoping Etc. The OTHER guild starts pulling over the top of us, and ended up training our rezzed. Yup so much for giving us our space eh? It was soon after that my GL said to me that &quot;We have been blacklisted now, LOL, oooo. Anyway I made a comment in /ooc that they could shove their blacklist up their asses. Well that was a bit bad form on my behalf. Yup. I was getting tired, so the usual banter goes back and forth. It ends, my GL then Petitioned, cause he is getting harrassed by the GL of the other guild. We get trained again by their monk, couple folks die, rez them still trying to prep for 2nd attempt on Eashen. Gm shows up, the 2 GLs and GM are talking. <br>
<br>
Well we are standing around waiting to see the outcome, well its late, as we have a lot of Euro players, so folks start leaving. We are then down to 19 and I called the raid off. Truth is we never took our 2nd try. GM didnt say anything of the like that Broo claims, and since he wasn't there with the GM he has no idea what was said. We TL'd out and gave the mob to them. There were no insults in ooc at that point, I can not vouch for the tells.<br>
<br>
Your question of being as you put it nice .... has to also do with numerous tells from your GL and other assorted guildmates, Harrassing us. Also threats of pull now or we are Etc. The fact being we moved in ahead of you and that pissed you off. We moved in because you had not. Had you moved in while we were doing Lenny, we would have left the zone. Not sent tells harassing you and trying to pull over the top of you while you rezzed. But I can only assume that you didnt move into NToV because you wanted to wait to see if we wiped on Lenny to grab him for yourself. Which is fine. But then dont bitch cause we then moved into NToV when you clearly had the chance and didnt take advantage of it. <br>
<br>
So its kind funny had you moved your raid to another part of the game, since EQ being as vast as it is now, NONE of the problems would have evolved. But instead come here and try to make us look like assholes for trying to learn a new area to the zone, cause oh god forbid we were infront of you. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52921"> Veteran Brutuz Maxximuz</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer-Ancient Saga <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->MRIKINNATAUNTADARNEDTHING<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->65 Overlord<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bah!!

we had made it Quite clear to their GL that we didnt have the force to take Aary, no way we could have. We were leaving after Eashen anyhow. Its just funny how there are soooo many zones, and we had to fight over this particular one. Because its a game, and NO mob is worth the stress and BS, I called it to prevent any further banter/redicule. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52921"> Veteran Brutuz Maxximuz</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer-Ancient Saga <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->MRIKINNATAUNTADARNEDTHING<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->65 Overlord<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bah!!

I am sorry i offended you AS with my view, i should of asked you guys exactly what happened and then posted that since i clearly had none of the real facts! I took no low blows at you guys and i'm sorry you felt the need to take one at me. Shadora, talk to me in game if you wish. Thats the story. <br>
<br>
PS As for Chongli, thats low and you know it, for all those out of the loop, read the date on that post.
