<br>
Figured I'd post a as-I-understand-it on how mob aggro works, with an eye toward helping mitigate the challenges that warriors face with aggro before/during fights.<br>
<br>
What is &quot;aggro&quot;:  The mob attacks or TRIES TO ATTACK exactly ONE player at any instant in time, the one it &quot;hates&quot; the most AND meets all the other criteria (detailed in a bit).  The mob also has an &quot;aggro list&quot;, which included everybody it &quot;knows of&quot; that it would kill if it could.<br>
<br>
What generates the aggro list:  <br>
-Attacking a mob OR having a mob spontaneously frenzy and attack will add a player to the mob's aggro list (obviously).  <br>
-Moving close enough to a mob that it &quot;notices&quot; you but doesn't attack, or in some cases simply /con-ing a mob will usually add a player to the mob's hate list.  <br>
-Doing ANYTHING beneficial to a player on the mobs hate list will add the benefactor to the list as well, at apparently any distance from the mob (in same zone of course), and this is *recursive*.  i.e. hate lists can grow geometrically as players buff/heal/etc. each other, even at long distances from the mob in question.  This is probably why bards always got zone wide DTed/HTed in PoF... never let a pull get away. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
-Having something beneficial done to you by a player on a hate list will *NOT* add you to the hate list however- bards do not transfer aggro to people their songs benefit, for instance.<br>
-Mobs transfer aggro lists to other mobs they are &quot;allied&quot; with AND are in close proximity, can happen when pathing or at static spawn points.<br>
-Mob's aggro lists are typically cleared when they return to their spawn location IF they are static spawns; roamer mobs (non-static spawns) aggro lists appear to decay over time (this was changed at some point to prevent the zone-wide trains that occured in FV, WW, etc. I think).  Seems to be about 5 minutes, but may vary by zone/mob/etc?<br>
-note: the mob aggro list is NOT (necessarily) the same as it's rampage list!<br>
<br>
What is &quot;hate&quot;:  There's kind of two &quot;types&quot; of hate: the instantaneous type that causes a mob to be attacking a particular player at a given time, and a more general &quot;hate list&quot; number, which appears to be a numerical value assigned to each and every player (and pet and NPC) on the mobs aggro list.  Just to make things complicated, there also appear to be modifiers to the numerical values on the hate list as well.<br>
<br>
What generates instantaneous hate:  Some actions/events generate &quot;special&quot; aggro that cause the mob to ignore it's regular hate list.  The two most common examples of this are low health aggro and one I like to call &quot;screw u trying to log out at less than 10 seconds to camp&quot;.  Both of these will cause mobs that are able to attack the target to ignore all else to do so.  Low health aggro appears to overcome the screw-u variety, so if your buddies are dying you might still get camped out in time...<br>
<br>
What generates numerical hate:  Pretty straightforward; anything that damages, debuffs, or inconviences a mob generates a specific amount of &quot;hate&quot;, as do direct hate generation procs/effects (enraging blow).  Also, doing beneficial things like buffing, healing, or helping to players/pets the npc would like to kill (are on it's aggro list) generates a set amount of hate as well.  Combinations of effects (DD + dot + debuff for instance) will typically generate more hate than simple DD effects.  Effects that are resisted, or even that the mob is totally immune to, still generate hate.  Don't know if fizzled or out-of-range beneficial spells cast on hated players add to the hate list or not (suspect they don't).  Some spells and abilities (ench/sk horrifying/glamourous vision, AA skills spell casting sublety, etc.) modify the amount of hate generated that is actually applied.<br>
<br>
What affects numerical hate:  Numerical hate once generated can be modified by only a few methods;  blur/atone, jolt, concussion, evade, taunt, FD/dying/zoning, and (probably) time.  Blur/atone clears a mob's hate list entirely.  Concussion and jolt add a negative number to that players total hate on the TARGET mob's list.  Evade: If the rogue is first or second on the hate list, his amount of hate is reduced to the point where he is third on the list. If the rogue is third on the list or lower, hate is reduced by a set numerical amount<br>
(edited, thx posters below).  FD/dying/zoning clears that player from the mobs hate list.  Finally, a SUCCESSFUL taunt places the taunter a very small amount above the highest previous player on the mobs hate list; a failed taunt doesn't nothing.  Let me repeat- a successful taunt can take a player from zero hate to the highest location on the list numerically.  Use your imagination.<br>
<br>
How does a mob decide to attack:  A mob has a chance, probably checked once per tick OR once per event (like the player /con'ing) to  attack when a player is in it's &quot;aggro radius&quot; and the mob &quot;knows the player is there&quot;.  A mob will (obviously) also attack when an offensive spell/attack is directed at it IN ITS AGGRO RADIUS; rangers with certain very long range bows and arrows can risk banning by sitting beyond mob aggro range and killing said mobs without the mob attacking back... don't do that.<br>
<br>
What determines the mob's aggro radius:  Bunch of things, but it seems to be a function of zone, mob-specific value, and mob level vs. player level, line of sight, mob facing, and elevation differences.  Some abilities/spells (sneak, lull/harmony, etc) affect this distance, either on a player or the mob itself.<br>
<br>
How does the mob decide who to (try to) attack:  The target of the mob's attention is the player/pet/npc with the highest &quot;instantaneous&quot; hate.  This number is based on the numerical hate value, plus exceptions and modifiers.<br>
<br>
Exceptions:<br>
-IF it can reach them, a player with &quot;low health&quot; will be attacked first.<br>
-Players within ~5-10 seconds of camping and within what seems to be either spell or detection range.<br>
-If the mob is PLAYER rooted (or blind?) it will typically attack the nearest player; this does NOT happen with zero movement or permarooted mobs...<br>
-If the mob becomes uncharmed, it appears it's aggro list is cleared with the exception of the charm-er, who has a significant amount of aggro applied.<br>
-Mobs will not typically not try to attack players who are invunerable to damage (DA/DB, etc) no matter what their hate, health, etc. is.<br>
<br>
Modifiers:<br>
-sitting in the &quot;presence&quot; (probably detection or melee range)  of an aggro mob appears to multiply the numerical value of hate that mob has for the sit-er significantly.<br>
-distance has a very strong multiplier to numerical mob hate.  Some mobs have what is known as &quot;undead aggro&quot;, which is nearly entirely dominated by distance from (apparently) player center to mob center.  This is why attacking from max melee distance helps MTs control aggro so well.  Some mobs (dain) are apparently NOT as sensitive to distance, which makes MTing them a pain.<br>
-some mobs may have an additional modifier to hate generated by healing; i.e. numerical aggro caused by healing is increased by some fraction vs. it's baseline value.<br>
-there is some suggestion that mobs might pick &quot;weaker&quot; targets preferentially, all other things being equal, never figured out a good way to test this tho.<br>
<br>
I think most of the above is accurate, at least it seems consistent with what I've seen/experienced so far.  Using the above information and observations, you can do some really elegant finessing with pulls, aggro management, etc... IF everybody knows what they are doing and pays attention. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Actually. I believe in VI's code, the &quot;highest&quot; aggro values are actually negative e.g. the mob attacks the person with the most negative hate value.  This can been seen by the spdat listings that show EB as -700 hate.<br>
<br>
Also, rogue evade doesn't work exactly as you described.  It has been forever since I read the description by Kendrick, but iirc it works like this:  +300(?) hate (reduce aggro), if after that the rogue is still tops on hate list and there are other PCs on the hate list, then +XXX hate where XXX is enough to put the rogue in second place on the hate list.  I am not sure about the exact numbers because it has been so long. However, I am quite confident that it was a two step comparison like the one I described.  I bet it is still in the archives somewhere at The Safehouse. <p><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5309"target="_blank"alt = "Korak's Megalo Profile"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR = 10,10,900><b>Korak Sarathai - Barbarian Warlord - The Hand</b></FONT><BR></a><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12530"target="_blank"alt = "Dumesh's Megalo Profile"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR = 900,10,10><b>Dumesh Uhl'Belk - Retired Troll Reaver - The Hand</b></FONT><BR></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udoonbackfighter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doon Backfighter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/11/02 9:46:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2048.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How mob aggro works...</span><hr size=1> Rogue evade works as follows:<br>

<br>
A few more inputs/observations from some caster buddies:<br>
<br>
Aggro generated with resisted/immune-to spells:  Some spells appear to generate more hate when resisted/immune than when they hit for full.  Some possible explainations include:<br>
-failed DD spells generate as much aggro as they possibly could (i.e. max hit equivalent) even though they do no damage.<br>
-some spells may have aggro reduction as part of the effect, in which case a full damage hit would generate less aggro than a fully resisted one (if failed spells generate the &quot;maximum&quot; possible taunt for that spell).<br>
<br>
It was also suggested that there may be a &quot;damage threshold&quot; value; this would be the amount of damage generated in a single event that triggers a taunt-skill like modification to the numerical hate list.  I.e. hit mob for more than X amount of damage in one shot (like a sunstrike perhaps), and it places player at the top of the numerical hate list like a successful taunt would.  Also possible that adjustment handled like a regular taunt, with some percentage chance of occuring.  Might be coded directly into some spells as well, server side (didn't see anything like that in Lucy spell db).<br>
<br>
Anyway, the above is second hand but seems reasonable; I'm not able to confirm/deny, since the biggest nuke I get to use is typically from a holgresh mojo stick. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
as for the 5-10 sec camp thing, i think it's just murphy's law heh.<br>

one thing i still wonder is whether a 500 dmg backstab taunts more than a 120 damage one. some say it's all about possible max damage. <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21797">Marauder Prodigious Prodigy</a><br>

<br>
Syntax thing, sorry it wasn't clear- meant of course that OTHER melee toons attacking from max melee range helped the MT control aggro, not the MT attacking from max range.  <br>
<br>
Also, the dain seems to skip around a lot more (i.e. not like undead aggro mobs) than most other velious ubers like the AoW- might be smaller melee box related tho?  He doesn't seem to be as range sensitive, but it's harder to tell since everybody has to cluster around him anyway...<br>

Verant agrees that distance DOES NOT matter from the mob. Being in the max melee range has nothing to do with aggro, as stated on Castersrealm. A rog/ranger/monk should not feel they are safe from aggro if they are as far as possible away while still hitting. <p><table width="32%" border="1" align="center" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" background="http://www.guild-legerdemain.com/texture2.gif">

I have never seen /con give any form of aggro whatsoever. Simple experiment: con a non-kos mob repeatedly, it will not attack you. Con a kos mob while nearby &amp; invis. It will not attack you. Con a green kos mob (that doesn't normally attack) while nearby. It will not attack you.<br>

Mobs can be attuned to dislike characters based on their religion, race, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> or class</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. I've had some annoying experiences with my enchanter trying to talk to quest NPCs or buying from merchants.<br>

It would make sense that once you walk into a mob's awareness range that your initial hate setting is based upon your faction standing with the mob.<br>
<br>
<br>
Awareness:<br>
<br>
PCs only seem to generate &quot;awareness aggro&quot; when the mob doesn't have much hate on someone. The common proof of awareness aggro is when a faction'd mob is pulled by a bunch of sitting people, and dies, every kos person that was sitting gets a faction hit! However, it can be shown that awareness aggro <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> doesn't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> happen if the mob is sufficiently angry. The most common example is CRing nagafen. If a lvl 52 person angers nagafen, people can CR with impunity, including lvl 53+ people who would normally be sneezed out of the zone instantly upon making the aggro list. Other proof comes when a pet is tanking a mob. If a single pet is tanking a mob and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anyone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the mob is angry at comes within melee range, the mob will start attacking the PC. However, if the pet has built up aggro and a new PC enters range, they won't get hit since they didn't generate awareness aggro.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hate modifiers:<br>
<br>
There are several effects that don't generate hate, but instead modify the hate list. This may cause the mob to attack someone not on the hate list, or possibly to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not attack</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> someone who is on the hate list.<br>
<br>
Sitting is a hate modifier, not a hate generator. This can be tested as follows (I have not done it):<br>
<br>
Rune an enchanter and tash a low level mob. Have a warrior come along and do nothing but taunt. On a successful taunt, the mob should still attack the enchanter because while the warrior is still at the top of the hate list, sitting creates a hate modifier that causes the mob to continue to attack the enchanter.<br>
<br>
Proximity (aka lazy) aggro:<br>
<br>
Distance is a hate modifier. Some fun examples are that a rooted mob will always attack the closest person on the aggro list, no matter what the hate level is. Some mobs, particularly undead, also have a tendancy to attack people close to them. Being far enough away from a mob can actually cause you to drop below the attack threshhold, and the mob will return home. You are still on the hate list, though, because if you come back within range it will come back after you (and bring friends, if it's social!).<br>
<br>
Low Health aggro.<br>

Regarding /con; it's very likely that /con does NOT generate any numerical hate/aggro; it does however appear to place the /con-er on the target mobs hate list, and force an aggro check.  Very easy to test this, covered ad-nausem elsewhere tho.  If you don't believe me, try it on Vindi sometime, he's got a BIG aggro radius... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Regarding camping aggro; very hard to quantify, but has happened too many times to be purely coincidental.  May just be a function of the sit aggro multiplier, but I've tested a few times in ToV (in non-wipeout situations) and had yard trash mobs ignore MTs they were locked on for an entire fight break off, fly over and swat me once (to break camp), then return to the MT.  Always between 10 sec and camp.  Plus, if I were a spiteful verant programmer, I'd do something like that too... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Regarding races/classes/dieties; could be, some mobs really seem to have an affinity for some classes... PoG mobs seem to really hate shaman for example.  Hard to quantify, since some npcs respond differently to illusions/dieties, but don't know if that affects aggro/combat...<br>
<br>
Awareness aggro; this one is quirky, probably because it isn't necessarily checked at a short interval.  I've helped twinkies during vox CRs, and been able to run all over the lair for several ticks w/o getting evicted- if vox is facing the right way and fighting.  As soon as I /con or attack tho, bang- out to everfrost.  Other times I get sent packing as soon as I poke thru the sliding rock door...<br>
