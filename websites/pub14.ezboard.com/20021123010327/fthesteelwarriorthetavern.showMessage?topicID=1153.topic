<br>
I'm part of a fairly powerfull guild on my Server, and I am a 60 warrior. I also maintain close ties to a few guilds that are much lower in power, and often chat with them. I've been spending a lot of time on my other characters recently, and was asked why by these lower tier friends of mine, and they were blown away with the idea that a pally/sk actually does my job better then me, and didn't understand when I explained it.<br>
<br>
Got to thinking, and when, really, did SK/Pallies and even Monks start to tank better then a warrior? It happens, IMO, when you start getting into ToV gear, but at that time, people didn't do it, and now people do. Did people do it then, and I didn't notice? Maybe.<br>
<br>
But, with Luclin came a new spell called Rod of Mystical Transvergence, AKA Modrod2. Now, with this spell, a 56plus mage and a shaman who knows how to use canni can produce an immense amount of mana. So much so, in fact, that I beleive afterlife posted a article showing adding this mage to a cheal chain was something on the order of adding 8 clerics with manasong and c3, assuming no time was spent stockpiling rods before the fight.<br>
<br>
Basically, what this (if properly used) translates to is virtually unlimited clerical mana.<br>
<br>
Now, perhaps the pally/sk does need a cheal slighly more often, but they hold aggro MUCH better, possibly barring Enraging Blow Weapons, if/when you get a proc. Not perhaps, really- Cheals on warriors of similiar gear ARE more efficent. As much more as they should be? Maybe. That's debatable.<br>
<br>
So, in Velious, yes, you could use the Pally/SK to tank, but your clerics would run OOM quicker, and the Wizards being able to nuke more didn't shorten the fight long enough for that to be effective, as well as everyone KNOWING that in a raid, you need a warrior to tank.<br>
<br>
Now, the clerics don't have to worry as much, if at all, about mana, the cheal chain tends to spread out aggro enough that they don't get aggro. Think about the last time you used a cheal chain and modrod2. Even on 30plus miniute fights in Ssra, clerics end up between 70 and FM. In fact, in many of these style fights, Defensive is a simple and complete WASTE OF TIME. It actually HURTS. Defensive, as the warriors know, lowers your taunt value, and that means in these fights, you have to have wizards et al watch there aggro a bit more, which lowers DPS, and you spend even more time on an already long fight to get 2-3 peices of loot.<br>
<br>
I suspect that what many Warriors are doing is looking at these Style Fights- On common zone mentioned is Vex Thal. I'll admit, I haven't been there. NO guild on my server is there in force. And maybe Pallies and SK's are remembering raiding ToV or maybe even Kael w/o using a pile of Modrod2's. Yeah, back then, using a pally or sk to tank whatever was challanging for your guild was a Bad Idea (TM). Yeah, right now, if you don't have Modrod2 and a decent healer for your mage, it may still be. However, once you pass that point, it makes less and less sense to use a warrior to tank. And a warrior is a specialist class- A warrior who can't tank doesn't have much else to do. Can we do damage, even significant damage? Yes. Can we do damage on par with a monk? Erm... No. Can we still grab that add, pop defensive, and hold his attention for a good while, without distracting from the Cheal/ModRod2 line? Yeah, especially if we have a Cleric or even some backup healers watching out for us. Of course, that means we aren't using Aggressive or whatnot on any of the main fights, the refresh on which is very high and pretty much assures us that we won't have defensive availible.<br>
<br>
So where do we excel? On fights where healer mana is limited, especially if it lasts less then 3 miniutes. Off tanking. Small or younger raids where people don't have access to or the knowledge/ability to use Modrod2. Younger raids first breaking into the Planes or Kael. Fights where it is easy to let the MA with an enraging blow and Avatar (Cast or Proc) solo the mob for 30 seconds to a miniute prior to engaging- Which is the only time on a big raid I usaully see Defensive being used, barring when I mess up and grab aggro by mistake or off tank. Again, lower aggro on Defensive means the whole raids DPS is lowered, kills take longer, more chance of respawn or adds, etc.<br>
<br>
Which is OK, kinda. Not really, a warrior should be the best at JUST TANKING at all points in his life, just like a wizard should be the best at JUST NUKING at all points in his. The wizard isn't, and I can live with being 2nd at certain stages. I don't think anyone can really say it's easy to get aggro off an MA whose using EB weapons after a few procs. It just means there is a point where Warriors are fairly useless- After your get the Modrod2 thing down, and your pallies/sk get the gear that puts them very close to a warriors tanking ability, and untill you can get EB weapons, and Primal Weapons or Primal Avatar, etc. Basically, untill you can taunt better then an SK/Pally.<br>
<br>
What concerns us (or me) about shields, is, are Cheals STILL going to be more efficent on a warrior? If so, when? When we are defensive? Kills the usefullness of every pre 55 warrior out there. Also, we've seen that the usefullness of a warrior after you get the Modrod2 thing down is questionable at best, at least untill you have EB weapons.  Which leaves 2 windows where Warriors are usefull, and, in fact, the second window is being threatened by a seperete upgrade- Giving a more realible Enraging Blow to SK's, specifically, Terror of Terris, which adds 500 hate vrs 700 hate from Enraging Blow, (according to lucy.fnord.net), has a recast of 6 seconds, and a mana cost of 50.<br>
<br>
About the only thing you can agrue with me about is whether or not the SK and Pally can hold aggro better then a warrior with similiar gear, pre Enraging Blow, and quite frankly, since that has been one of things Hybrids, especially SK's, have been priding themselves on for years, it's going to be a very hard case to make. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17853>Cyrz Bloodscale</a>

<br>
This is the exact problem necros have on raids.<br>
<br>
We do more damage per mana at the cost of time and stackablilty(aka we cant cast splurt 10 times on the same mob)<br>
<br>
As things stand after the DOT stacking on a raid we will be able to have nice dps and on long fight do more damage that a wizard..... untill you look at a wizard useing mod rods.<br>
<br>
mod rods are the breaking point.<br>
<br>
they break the game the same way that CH breaks the game.<br>
<br>
wizards can do huge amounts of damage if they have a stack of mod rods.<br>
<br>
clerics can do huge amounts of healing if they have a stack of mod rods.<br>
<br>
warriors and necromancers are designed to be efficient.. warrior = more efficient CH, necro = more efficient damage<br>
<br>
mod rods = all the mana you need, so who cares about what is efficien.<br>
<br>
I love my warrior and my necro. I dont have any problems At my stage in the game I'm a great damage dealer and my warrior is a great MT...=) <br>

<br>
they can do more damage with thier 60 nukes over time, then what the MB does. the MB is just an &quot;instant&quot; cast. and yes, the longer a fight goes, the mor the DPS favors the necro. combine that with the new stacking, and necro's will be wanted on those 30 minute battles<br>

I gotta agree with ya Cyrz.  I'm one of those lower tier guilds that Cyrz is talking about... and well, I am seriously useless.  Why should I even bother to try and tank something when I'm surrounded by hybrids that can steal agro in 1 to 2 casts.  Seriously... I know my class very well and I know my faults.  But I know that with one or two casts, some fockin hybrid is gonna take agro from me.<br>
<br>
And why shouldn't they tank.  They've got the spells to keep agro on them at all times.  Especially if these new SK spells go in.  Bah...ranting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
