<br>
The defensive core, what every warrior should nail down, is ND3, CA3, CS3, Area Taunt, and Physical Enhancement. Ambidex increases DPS a bit if you dual wield; Flurry increases DPS a bit as well, but it's pricey. Everything else is situational.<br>
<br>
PoP AAs -<br>
<br>
Tactical Mastery and Stalwart Endurance are great. TM3 basically lets you attack straight through Enrage (increasing DPS and tankability at the same time), while SE3 resists something like 80% of all melee stuns. Lightning Reflexes, Innate Defense, and Planar Durability are decent upgrades to Luclin AA skills. Again, the offensive AAs add a bit more DPS, but I don't believe anything is as dramatic as TM3. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tashi6>Tashi6</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/02 11:43:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2604.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   --</span><hr size=1> Right now I have about 100 aa,  level 63,. working just on AA now.<br>

No hard data, but I seem to be doing multiple attacks with 2hander quite a bit more.. and flurrying more as well.  Maybe just perception, or that flurry triggers off a double/tripple attack, which happens more often with the POP AA..  If thats the case, maxed out Flurry/Punish/Ferocity could get scary..  I just remember flurry like never goign off, but now its working much more often, and still only level 1.  Only change is the ferocity + Punishing Blade..<br>
<br>
<br>
Stalwart kinda uselss since I'm an ogre..<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Double ripost would be like one of the last skills I mess with -- seems pretty worthless for the cost.  Sure it woudl be cool to double ripost 80% of the time but at 18+9 points? Just how often do you ripost anyways.<br>

You can attack through rage but youre still going to take more dmg in that 8 seconds than you did the rest of the fight, although I do attack through rage while using 2hers now usually depending how hard the mob hits. I thought this would be the skill that would really separate us as warriors but it didnt. The ripostes should be negated if the roll is succesful allowing us to tank a little better. PoP is leaning towards using 2hers as it is since mobs hit so hard even in xp groups, avoid more 500+ dmg ripostes from using 2hers, do more dmg with 2hers etc.. Negating the ripostes with a succesful TM roll would balance 1hers with this. I like dual wielding, I like to use 2hers occasionally but I sure the hell dont want to be forced to use one to avoid more incoming damage while doing the same or more outgoing damage, thats not balanced.<br>
<br>
Old Ambi is 7% dps increase iirc.<br>
<br>
Combat agility and lightning reflexes just simply own, you can literally see the difference in how well you tank without parsings.<br>
<br>
Combat stability and Innate defense are the skills you think you should get since youre a warrior but seems to do very little if anything at all, every little bit helps though.<br>
<br>
Stalwart endurance is very nice, avoid 80% of stuns average I'd say, and from all directions.<br>
<br>
I still need last level of PoP flurry, but I flurry about once every 20sec average I'd say, sometimes 3 in a row sometimes not for a minute same as procs and seem to generate agro, whether or not its just extra agro from the 2 extra attempted hits or theres some hate modifier on it I couldnt tell ya.<br>
<br>
No idea if double riposte is worth it really, but I got it for /disc furious with 2hers. Dont have new one yet.<br>
<br>
Never parsed ferocity but it works with 1hers and 2hers and possibly increases flurries if you need a succesful double attack roll to get a triple attack roll, I dunno if theyre 2 independent rolls though.<br>
<br>
Dont have punishing blade yet, gonna do that next after I finish flurry probably.<br>
<br>
Never got fear resistance or warcry since they were pretty much a waste of points since nothing feared in Luclin, I may do them soon though. IMO warcry should grant the group or even AE range a 100 attk bonus 100 regen a tic plus fear immunity or something like that. Right now its ass compared to other classes AA's. A 65 Overlord shouting a warcry should definitely grant large bonuses for the short period its activated. I always think of William Wallace leading peasants into battle and making them win when I think warcry, I dunno why.<br>
<br>
As for how badass a warrior with all AA's maxed would be.. Theres good players and theres bad players same as any other class and I'd take a warrior with 10 aa and 1000hp's less over a warrior with 500aa that afk's constantly, switches mobs, or is a general @#%$ up any time.<br>
<br>
An AA that should be added: Is the idea many people have suggested of allowing us to either stay evasive/defensive constantly (40% dmg reduction not many people would use this except for boss mobs, and with AE taunt its not like its hard to swap out warriors using disc if its needed so its not going to unbalance anything) And allowing us to stay precise/aggresive at will (take more dmg do more dmg not unbalancing at all and would allow us to stack on raids and in groups). I like the stance bar idea the best though, where you could change your stance at any time from 40% defensive/evasive to 40% aggresive/precise in 10% increments. Even if it was only 30% evasive/defensive to 30% aggresive/precise and they took the relative discs from you if you bought it I would definitely buy it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=paeneq>Paen EQ</A> at: 12/11/02 5:38:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varaho1>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 1172<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/11/02 5:17:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2604.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Tactical mastery doesnt keep you from getting riposted, you still get riposted as much as you did before, your hit just connects also.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

A successful TM check completely ignores mob special defenses.  Note that you can still miss a mob even if you bypassed its special defenses, and if you try to attack through enrage, you'll still take a lot of damage.  I'll try to verify sometime but a simple verification would be any string of two 'you hit X for Y damage' during enrage, because typically riposte always go:<br>
<br>
X hits you for Y (or not)<br>
You try to hit X but X ripostes<br>
<br>
Which means there's no way to have two consecutive &quot;you hit X for Y damage&quot; if the mob was riposting you back.  Actually any attacks where there was no &quot;X hits you (or not)&quot; followed by &quot;You hit X for Y&quot; during enrage would prove that TM ignores Riposte when it works. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90049">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tashi6>Tashi6</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/11/02 8:34:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2604.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   `</span><hr size=1> I think he means that mob still ripost as always..
