If so were they a Necro or mage ? I am getting so mad with the unbalanced warrior these days. After talking to( .....no beating my head against the wall )  SOE design staff I found that they know about the imbalance and are trying to get to it, but with LDoN they were overwelmed and had to put it on the back burner. They said their will be changes , but of course they would not say what changes or when. The only thing they would say is its real hard to do class balancing.  It seems simple enough to me. Take each class make it able to at least solo a mob close to its level and then it balanced.  Why is it Warriors can only solo liught blues when almost all other class's can solo dark blues. Keep in mind I am refering to a warrior with moderate gear not gear from plane of time and such. I am not asking for much just let me solo a blue and get 1% aa exp and i'll be happy to go sit some where for 10 minutes untill I am full health.  Of course twinked gear would cut that time down but you shouldn't need uber gear to do it. Wizards , druids, bards all kite gaining massive exp. Necro's and mages can solo with their pets. Paladins can............. never mind it gets me to riled to talk about Pally's ......  grumbles (critical hit for 5665)  @#%! slay undead. What would be so wrong to give a simple class like the warrior enough  endurance to withstand a fight with a mob 5 levels lower than him that can't even cast.  It ain't right!!!!    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=branamanstarbinder>Branaman Starbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/15/03 1:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3222.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://httpd.chello.nl/j.wensveen1/images/ofo2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Balancing</span><hr size=1> well, beside the fact that not each class can solo each type of mob, they are limited to certain types after all, they have to pay in time for their solo skills to. Luckily spells as KEI are available for casters to drop their downtime from 11 minutes after a fight to 6 minutes and then gear kicks in. Of course there are level ranges where the rules change a little.<br>
<br>
I would think that the Warrior would be best to solo Caster mobs, since caster mobs have less HP, a lower melee dmg output and they tend to spent time casting instead of hitting. All the warrior needs then is some good resists gear and a good stun proc / Bash to make sure the caster gets interrupted (an interrupted caster still has its mana so will cast again instead of melee) or resists the spells. <br>
<br>
Of course you have to find the right mobs to kill, you can't go up to just any caster mob and hope to live. After all, the same holds for wizards, they do not snare every mob and start kiting because 1 summon and their 700 AC / 3500 Hp buffed body is getting a serious pounding. (Those PoS frogs wizards kite sometimes put out 1600 dmg in an attack round, wizards that make the mistake of not watching out for those adds die fast.)<br>
<br>
Would a Regen buff, with the duration of KEI, that shortens down time like as with KEI and adds HP equal to mana as with KEI help the soloing melee?<br>

<br>
Or go to the bazaar and invest in magic resistance gear and a stun proc weapon. Again, same effect. Just that caster mobs seem to hit just about as hard as the melee mobs do. And the hit difference between the two isn;t as great as you think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=branamanstarbinder>Branaman Starbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/16/03 6:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3222.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://httpd.chello.nl/j.wensveen1/images/ofo2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Balancing</span><hr size=1> I made the mistake of aggroing some Mage epic quest mob in FV with my wizard.

<br>
Classes are becoming very balanced. The gear (buyable) that is available for the average player these days is substantially better then the gear that could be bought 1 year ago. The weapons have improved 200% and wielding a 12/19 can be done for under 4k. With a small raid force (20 toons) you can can get a 44/34. This however is not what makes classes &quot;balanced&quot;. Having 4k More HP and 800 more AC then the average caster is a good start. Plate classes where meant to keep x-mob off Jimmy the wizard, joe the necromancer, boby the ranger, and mike the rogue. <br>
<br>
With out a Plate class, many of these classes would be a fraction as effective. Plate classes are for the most part &quot;the backbone&quot; many groups, and although not substantially increasing DPS themselves, they dramatically increase the DPS of the group, by allowing other classes to go all out DPS.<br>
<br>
If you want the DPS of a rogue or ranger, then what would be the point of these classes? If you want the DPS of a caster, then give my necromancer 4k more HP, and 800 more AC.<br>
<br>
All classes have a purpose, and warriors unfortunately is not DPS, it’s to take the hits so that others may live. This is exactly why I started a warrior, I want to get hit, I like it.<br>
<br>
From a casters perspective, it is nice going all out, and watch 6 dots, do over 1200 damage a tick, and even nicer when you see the 3.2k Crit scroll down with all your DoT damage, but we would never be able to do that with out the warrior.<br>
<br>
In an average group, most casters don’t have the DPS that you are leading on to believe. As a necro in LDON, I get (dps wise) three spells. Horror: 430 damage a tick for 30 seconds. Blood of Thule: 340 damage a tick, and Neuro 1300 damage nuke that crits 15% of the time for UPTO 2600 damage. On single pulls with a chanter or bard I can cast assuming I have PoT9, and bst crack) two Neuros: 2600 damage + pet damage: 600-800ish (depends on pet). That is only 3600-3800 damage to X-mob. With no CC, Necros shine. We can root and rot the add, casting both Horror, and Blood of Thule, while nuking the other target (which is mana intensive), or agro kite add and use Horror, and Blood of Thule all the while Life tapping to compensate for any hits I may take (in a close Quarter fight).<br>
<br>
If you don’t think you do even half that damage, then you may want to go and parse your fight. This also takes mana, when casters are OOM, then how good are we? Melee have sustained DPS, that requires nothing more then haste, and two half decent weapons. <br>
<br>
As far as soloing goes... Yahh its a definite plus, a plus that requires at times multiple deaths. A plus that can be so incredibly boring, at times it is not even worth it. A plus that has been so nerfed, that the average half decent group gets 30 percent more EXP then us. A plus that has so few good spots, that you often find yourself talking in the auction channel, waiting on ricky the wizzie to leave, because they're is simply nothing else to do, and no other camps to go to. I guess its one of those cases that is &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot;. <br>
<br>
I am sure you are also going to play the &quot;you can farm card&quot;. Yahh so what. I need to pay for gear just like you. The big difference is, you don’t have to buy spells. Let me give you a rundown of what my necromancer has spent on spells: Funeral Pyre: 50k, Seduction of saryn: 13K, Touch of death: 10k, Undead mez: 5K, Blood of Thule: 60K, Saryns Companion: 12K, Children of Bertox 30k. 168k for 7 spells.<br>
<br>
But this isn’t what I came to the board for... I have a good idea for snap aggro, and how to make warriors more beneficial, with out throwing out the balance of the game woot woot.<br>
