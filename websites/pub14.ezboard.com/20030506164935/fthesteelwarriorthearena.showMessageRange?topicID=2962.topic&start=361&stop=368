<br>
Many Warriors with EB weapons have indicated that it doesn't get them instant aggro.  They have to beat on the mob a while and get a lucky proc or two.  The only real difference between this and something like Willsapper is the amount of hate generated on a lucky proc and perhaps the proc rate.  Nothing more.<br>
<br>
It does not in any way shape or form close the instant aggro gap between Knights and Warriors.  It does not do what is being claimed it does.  Does it work better than other proc weapons?  I can but assume that it does.  Does it make relying on procs reliable and predictable?  No it does not.<br>
<br>
Now, if an EB weapon gave you a hot button you could press whenever you felt the need and it proced on command, I'd agree that it closed the instant aggro gap nicely and recommend that they make EB weapons more available.  It doesn't work that way though.<br>
<br>
And consider, how many 100HP pieces of gear are spread around in a typical high end guild compared to the number of EB weapons?  Ya think maybe there are a few more pieces of armor available than EB weapons?  Good bet.   So even if we accepted that EB weapons closed the instant aggro gap, as it is clear they do not, they still would not be as available and as numerous as those items that close the HP gap between Knights and Warriors.<br>
<br>
And it would still beg the question why a level 55 Paladin in crap gear should out instant aggro control a level 65 Warrior in the best gear the game offers and with over 100 AAXP, when a level 55 Warrior in crap gear will in no way shape or form out tank a level 65 Paladin in the best gear the game offers with over 100 AAXP.<br>
<br>
There is a basic inequity involved.  Knights can gain on or surpass a Warrior in all the significant ways a Warrior as a class is supposed to have advantages if the Knight has gear and AAXP the Warrior doesn't.  While there is no way the Warrior can gain on or surpass the Knight in all the significant ways a Knight as a class is supposed to have advantages, regardless of the Warrior's gear or AAXP.<br>

So, let me get this straight. Whenever other people make inferences about knights' superiority to warriors from personal experience, they are wrong. But, you own theories about how knights are equal to or inferior to warriors, based on your own experiences is correct. Please, for the love of Jesus tell me you actually see how stupid what you are saying is. What exactly makes your personal experiences more valid and factual than anyone else's?

<br>
Right. But when a 64 knight gets a group over a 65 warrior with PoP gear and 100+ AA, thats perfectly ok right? You can amass the best warrior gear in EQ right now onto one character and the warrior still can't even come close to matching the instant agro generation ability of knights. Please, try and prove me and the others who have been saying this over and over wrong, it just makes pointing out your idiocy so much easier.<br>

Right. Because throughout basically all your posts, you have proven your uncanny ability to argue strictly based on facts and making no redundant generalizations yourself. (hint, if you didn't catch on, that was sarcasm).<br>

Tell me you did not actually just say that. @#%$ hell, don't you get it, NO amount of gear, NO amount of AA's will EVER allow warriors to even come close to matching a knights agro generation ability. BoW has the same problem every other weapon does, it makes warriors too reliant on procs. If you haven't noticed, waiting for a possible proc to occur isn't exactly a viable solution for instant agro generation when it is necessary.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Was I better at hate generation? Yes, but not noticeably... similar to the mitigation difference between knights and Warriors.<br>

Show me where I can purchase buffs that will narrow or exceed the HP gap, depending on which classes are in the group. Then show me where I can buy a lvl 30 spell that makes for infinetely easier agro generation than the Blade of War warriors spend all their DKP/RPP on. <br>

Who are you lying to now, us or yourself? Let me sum this up very briefly. You are exactly the same as the people you argued so vigorously against two years ago when the tables were turned. You bring in off-the-wall arguments and constantly beat around the bush in some happless effort to sustain knight dominance over warriors. <br>
<br>
If you don't understand yet that warriors have agro issues from this board, read some others. Read other class boards, and you will find clerics, rangers, monks, shamans enchanters and the like stating their own preferences for knight tanks because of the warrior inability to generate agro when necessary. <br>
<br>
Swing by your thread of power grasshopper before the rope starts to get slick and you fall off. Enjoy your advantages over warriros in XP groups while it lasts, because everything changes eventually. And when it does, you will be right back in our shoes and completing your conversion back to the hypocritical moron who claims &quot;Warriors are over-powered, waah waah.&quot; Or better yet, take a hint and head back over to your own boards, because if you haven't realized it yet, your ridiculous arguments and hypocritical posts earn you nothing but flames here. <br>

In fact, the more DPS your group has, the less effective EB becomes because not only are you working against more aggro (and EB weapons have relatively poor aggro based on ratio) you also have less time to proc your EB, and further an EB isn't going to stop a nuke-happy wizard from getting summoned anyway.  <br>
<br>
For example it's not unusual to see something like<br>
<br>
proc EB<br>
Wizard cast SoS<br>
Wizard gets summoned<br>
<br>
Actually, even if the wizard didn't get summoned, usually a heavy nuker just decides to nuke even harder until he's summoned anyway.  At any rate, in this case Taunt is your most reliable friend (or maybe root).<br>
<br>
One EB weapon, in particular, is very ineffective against slow aggro, the most common kind of aggro management problem encountered.  You only have about 10 seconds between the time a Shaman lands Malo(s) and then Turgur.  It's even worse against Tash + Slow when dealing with an enchanter, to the point that I usually just rely on Taunt instead and bank the EB weapon for something that does more damage. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=apothesdrudoll>Apothes Drudoll</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/03 1:54:58 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Knights and SK's getting chosen over warriors in exp gro</span><hr size=1> Btw Knights do not have INSTANT aggro as you claim. it does tak 2 to 5 seconds to cast stuns deopending on wich you use and it take at least 2 stuns to overcome tash and slow. Mind you it is a LOT faster aggro then a EB weapon but it is not instant as you say. The taunt button when it works is instant aggro unlike spell aggro wich is delayed aggro fromt eh time you cast it to the time it lands. Also granted you can land 2 stuns if you are paying attention in inv. I just dont think the term instant aggro is appropriate here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
That's not to say i am in agreement with him and if you filter out the overly aggressive tone of the above posters they still raise valid points.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
BoW i assume via superior DPS and proc rate helps to ensure the warrior keeps aggro well - perhaps the aggro generation from the DPS is even high enough that the 'danger period' at the beginning of the fight when slow can outaggro is reduced making for less bouncing? Difficult to believe but theoretically possible I guess. <br>
<br>
Wether one believes that BoW removes the problems warriors face or not is actually irrelevant however. It is not possible to point to such an exclusive weapon (the best in the game at this time for a warrior) and say 'with this you're fixed'. It is no more reasonable to expect every warrior to have this weapon than it is to expect a 61 warrior to outtank a 65 SK with 100+ AA's. Fixes with itemisation <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>do not work</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> because the 'average' member of any class cannot be expected to have such an exclusive item. Even with level 65 making AoW encounters relatively less hard, BoC's and such cannot be considered as 'normal useage' weaponry for 80 - 90% of the warrior population -  and this was SoE's 'fix' of three years ago.<br>
<br>
Brik more or less admits that without EB or similar weaponry a warrior faces great problems with aggro-maintenance (a quality vital to the job of tank), yet knights for minor cost have not only snap aggro but almost assured aggro retention capabilities at the push of a button. Brik asserts that this is balanced by the mitigation and avoidance bonuses that a warrior brings to a group making for less risk of your main tank dying. This is to an extent perhaps true, but I must say that, based on my own observation of knight guildmates when grouped (with their equipment and AA's not being exceptionally better than my own) i am not seeing a very visible, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>noticable</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> difference. <br>
<br>
As an example Brik cites a situation where one or two dodges due to increased warrior avoidance saves a warrior where a knight dies. I wonder how often (with skill caps being where they are) the warriors dodge/parry/whatever skill succeeds where the knights fails? 1 time in 5?, 1 time in 10? <br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
We can perhaps increase our chance of survival via defensive/evasive or furious discipline but the knights also have special abilities they can call on to help them out. Lay on hands, Stunning the mob so he doesn't hit for the fraction of time needed for the heal to land, Discipline leechcurse, and various taps which help mitigate damage taken etc. <br>
<br>
With a good healer the above scenario should not even occur with any frequency in the first place.<br>
<br>
The assertion that warriors are favoured for tanking elemental exp mobs is beyond my in game experience but is somewhat weakened by the posts of another experienced knight (Iustus) in which he asserts that knights are perfectly acceptable tanks in the elementals. One would think the ability to slow early (with negligable risk of pingpong) would be particularly favoured given the damage output of said mobs. <br>
<br>
In any case SoE has basically stated that there will be no access quests to tier 3-4 zones making them the exclusive property of hard core raid guilds - and thus removing them from the equation when balancing the 'average' warrior against the 'average' knight.<br>
<br>
At the current time knights have an extremely obvious advantage in aggro generation, whilst warriors have (when facing high DPS PoP mobs) what appears to me to be only a very marginal mitigation/avoidance advantage. <br>
<br>
The other thing we have working in our favour is that it is a habit with people to let the warrior tank. It does appear though, that more and more people (assuming one believes the various posts on other class boards) are now coming to the conclusion that the knights better aggro control actually makes for a safer, more hassle free, more healer-mana efficient, group experience. <br>
<br>
If that view becomes prevalent then warriors will become nearly as badly off as knights were in the Kunark era (with the exception that they will still be dragged out of semi-retirement to tank some boss mobs on raids). This is a possibility that I am not keen to see happen.<br>
<br>
Increasing our mitigation advantage is not a viable route to take. The speed with which PoP mobs strip the hitpoints from a tank means that it would require a ludicrous amount of additional hp's to really show a visibly superior mitigation rate. Giving warriors such hp totals would break a massive amount of content/encounters.<br>
<br>
Brik asserts that giving warriors some form of burst aggro similar to a knight (to offset the initial aggro generation problem) would ensure knights were banished back to their kunark era ignominy. I have to question that assumption.<br>
<br>
Knights are in nowhere near the same position relative to a warrior as they were in kunark times. Knights are perfectly able to tank a mob in an exp group without serious disadvantage or requiring noticeably more healing.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I would argue that the various extra abilities they have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>do</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> bring other advantages to a group (cily above goes so far as to state that they will still be preferred for groups because of this - still not sure wether he's actually a knight or not though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     ). In one afternoon i heard a guildmate monk state that shadowknights were in his opinion a better choice to split pull in PoP and a shaman friend was telling me she felt paladins provided more to the group than her as (secondary? i'm not totally clear on what she meant) healers.<br>
<br>
These abilities might not be massive in their impact and perhaps they wouldn't garantee a spot in a group determined to absolutely maximise it's potential but they would still be an incentive over and above what a warrior would bring to a group. Particularly if that group was looking for more and already had a tank of some description.<br>
 <br>
Given knights much improved viability, would reducing (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> eliminating) the difference between knight and warrior aggro truely be as disasterous as Brik proposes? <br>
<br>
Hmm,<br>

I grant it's not completely instantaneous.  But it is very fast and can be done at range, so it is effectively next to instantaneous.  And I've heard very knowledgeable Paladins indicate that 1 stun &gt; 1 slow in aggro.  Perhaps that varies from mob to mob or situation to situation.  But I think we all know that Paladins can have a very healthy amount of aggro established before the mob even gets to camp and rarely has a slower pull aggro off them if they make a point of not letting them. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

*shrug*  Maybe not.  But Brik's extremely arrogant attitude through out the entire course of this thread has earned him KOS faction with Glatius. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>
