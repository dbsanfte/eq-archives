<br>
However, what is the latest Conventional Wisdom on getting flagged in PoP?  I am thinking mroe in a sense for PoS/PoV, but I was also thinking about the Factory in PoI and the hedge in PoN (nice exp in there and open 99% of the time).  <br>
<br>
I tried a couple times to get flagged in PoJ, once with an AoE group and once with a regular group.  The regular group sucked cause we had some peeps under level 60 so our dps just was not there.  <br>
<br>
On the Aoe group we did much better, only to get to the Executioner once to find out that our casters were oom, and the cleric had to CH twice while they were medding then I died.  <br>
<br>
How high does a Warrior have to be in relation to AC, HPs, ATK to get flagged?  What is the standard procedure outside of gettin &quot;pushed&quot; through by friends.  <br>
<br>
I currently am level 60, have mostly Thurg armor, Dual Wield FG and Frostbringer, have run3, regen3, and now ND1 for aa's.  Personally I think I am too weak and am working on ND3 at the minimum before I try again.  <br>
<br>
What do I need to work on to get flagged?  How do other warriors get flagged?  Should I try to get flagged for the Hedge in PoN for now to get much better exp 'till I get decent aa's? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gallerus>Gallerus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/24/03 12:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Latest CW On Flagging</span><hr size=1> hedge flag is irrelevant really - its only purpose is to get you into ponb which is only good if you are in a guild that is capable of killing terris thule (prolly 24-30 people with decent levels + gear could do it).<br>

I don't think AA's matter that much. Get every buff you possibly can, and with the right group set up and intelligent people, you can do it.<br>
<br>
When I was flagged my group was this: Me (warrior), cleric, enchanter, druid, mage, mage. Obviously we had high DPS and were actually able to recover from a few ping pongs by the cleric and mages. However, I've also completed the trials as Me (warrior), cleric, shaman, ranger, paladin, wizard. I've done the trials several times to help people get flagged, very different groups but everyone knew how to play.<br>
<br>
I don't think the point of the trials is so that those with the best gear, weapons, and 500+ AA's can progress. I think they were set in place so that the experienced players (experienced as in jaded) can progress. It might just mean you need to fool around in tier1 zones or keep at the trials until you learn the system.<br>
<br>
Imho.. POV, POS, and BOT are very different than tier1 zones and completely different than any exp zone pre-POP. I think it requires less time exp grinding or raiding then some people think, just more talking to your group and understanding the encounter. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=607776">Veteran Farlander</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - 65 <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior">Overlord</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/bprexus81531">Prexus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=farlanderb>FarlanderB</A> at: 3/24/03 12:34:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=proteg@thesteelwarrior>proteg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/24/03 12:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Latest CW On Flagging</span><hr size=1> I noticed you have a lot of SS armor, but not like mass amounts of Sleepers gear.

When the exe comes up, were your casters pretty much oom?  One of our mages said that he heard that the MT needs to kite the exe a bit while the casters med up.  Is this true?  <br>
<br>
Considering most AoE casters are probably flagged already, how is a good way to get a group of AoE'ers?  Get lucky and catch a group of nukers trying to get flagged (meaning stay LFG in PoJ for a while)?

65 warrior 65 cleric 65 mage 65 mage can easily get any 2 other people through exe trial.<br>

If you try to kite the exe, need to ditch pets - he casts an ae that will cause pets to attack him &amp; after he takes a certain amount of damage he will summon = no more kiting.<br>
<br>
Its also best to not have the mt kite, since you invariably get hit a few times while kiting, which makes it difficult for the mt to get initial agro without the cleric getting heal agro - usually best to have a druid/ranger or someone else with kiting experience do it - the one time I saw a warrior try to do it was one of hte most pathetic displays i've seen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.cox.net/mherlihy/img/gallerus.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

A lvl 60 warrior in Thurg armor and 6aa's isnt going to be able to tank much in PoS/PoV without HUGE downtimes or alot of deaths.<br>
<br>
I do agree with some of your statements though, but for exp groups,, hes going to get owned in PoS and PoV at 60 in Thurg armor with 6aa's.  Maybe he can do flowers, bears and trees in PoS forest but he might as well stay in PoN and do Consorts or butterflys.<br>

<br>
Well, if there using crappy weapons or have small mana pools they just won't have the DPS to do it, wether there super inteligent people or retards.<br>
<br>
PoP is designed to be a progression, moving into Tier 2 as lvl 60 in Thurg with 6aa's ain't progression :/<br>
<br>
This is just my 2cp; stay in PoN (do consorts and butterflys and hobgoblin cave) and PoD (do the rat caves).  Get some AA's and lvl 61 atleast and then move to PoS/PoV will be &quot;easy&quot;.  you shouldn't need to &quot;work&quot; to get through trials, they should be &quot;easy&quot; or your going to have a heck of a time in PoV/PoS and get really flustrated and quit.<br>
<br>
This is just my opinion, I feel as though my toon was in the same &quot;boat&quot; as Proteg is in.  I lvled , I got more AA's and I went to other zones that used to kick my butt, and all of a sudden my regualr group &quot;felt ready&quot;.  We passed the trial on the second attempt. <p><center><IMG SRC="http://home.cfl.rr.com/bastionamici/Sigs/Faederya_Faedilenew.gif" WIDTH=490 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=0 USEMAP="#Faederya_Faedilenew.gif">

K, so Thrug armor not gonna hold up...do ToV then?  I am guildless, so does that mean I'll need to get into a guild that does ToV?  I have heard that doing a three group pickup in ToV is usually deadly.  <br>
<br>
I was thinking of getting ND3 and AoE Taunt then getting level 61 before doing Trials again/  I don't want to get level 61 'till trials cause ppl tell me the exp is 20% slower at 61 in Tier 1.  <br>

<br>
Well I always have an enchanter with me, so im a little biased in my camps.  But consorts needs a mezzer or harmony.  There all lvl 60 so exp is much better than LCY or LCR which &quot;suck&quot; for exp anyways.  I just don't think youve seen 1/4 of PoN and PoD if your doing LCY/LCR and thinking that's good exp.  <br>
<br>
I'm in Thurg armor also, but ND3 and CA3 make a world of difference.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>exp is 20% slower at 61 in Tier 1<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, you need ALOT more exp in 61 than 60 so that statement doesnt really make sense... but, don't sit in LCY/LCR those have to be the worst camps in PoD.  Take a group in the rat caves for 2 hours and walk out with 1.5-2 aa's and alot of excitement (I just love harm touches that make me jump in my seat)<br>
<br>
Ive just seen too many people with &quot;similar&quot; armor/lvls/AA's move into PoS/PoV and try for the easy camps and get burnt out or flustrated waiitng hours for an opening in one or two &quot;camps&quot;  :/<br>

<br>
I did Trials with about 6k HP and 1250ish AC and Did it several times for friends with similar stats. <br>
<br>
The Key is aggro control, DPS and Mana Pool. Clerics over 62 are great to have, their mana pool is usually around 3.5 - 4k. Your Cleric has to have enough mana for you to tank Exe while Casters can med if they need too. Defensive is your friend, if I remember correctly, it dropped his damage from 700+ to 400+ Max and his AE was that nasty AC Debuff.<br>
<br>
Horses for Casters! Cant Stress that enough.<br>
<br>
I have passed Trials as My Warrior and My Wizard. So I know just a wee bit about both aspects. <br>
<br>
I have passed using AE and Single Target. Both work depending on the group structure. <br>
<br>
My Warrior took me over 80 Tries, learning what classes fit best, what tactics got us closest, how best to preserve mana, and timing! <br>
<br>
My Wizard I did in about 5 tries, cause I learned it all on my Warrior. <br>
<br>
Just stick at it and note the elements you use to get you closer and you will make it. I was playing my Wiz with a 59 War Tank in PoV the other night, smart cleric kept him alive, and we all made sure he held aggro. So you will be fine there.<br>

I can Imagine a couple nukers and a Rogue.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumbleroot>Bumbleroot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/03 12:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: friends</span><hr size=1> I've done these trials easily over 100 times. The first 50 times I failed, after that I have passed about 85% of the time.<br>
Have a minimum of 6100 HPs and 1200 AC. Level up to 62 if you want to tank this. If you don't get to 62 then have a 65 warrior, SK or Pally to do the tanking. The higher level you are, the better damage you do and less you take, thus you will also keep aggro better. As of right now, unless you have super uber weapons, you won't do enough damage and your equipment isn't anything to help you tank it well enough. Try to take an enchie instead of a shammy, shammies can get way too much aggro in here, and many shammies just dont have a lot of HPs.<br>
If I were you, I would get a mage around 62, a warrior at 65 a rogue 63 or above and you will be the 4th damage dealer. I have seen a group that was stacked with all 65s including a 65 mage and a 65 monk, fail on this because the tank had 5800 hps and was only level 60. When they changed to a 65 tank and had the 60 tank as additional damage, they passed easily.<br>
Our guild flagging group has me as a 65 warrior, a 61 or 62 mage, a 63-65 rogue, 62-65 cleric, 61-65 enchie and any other class. Our success ratio with this group is about 90-95% or even higher. And yes, that other class has been a cleric at times, so our DPS is already there when we do this. Our mage never casts banish on the rocks when we do it like this.<br>
Have mod rods and use them after the first round always, then use them as soon as they become available again. Tell each caster to stay near you, it actually is possible to have a cleric and the enchie beating on mobs this way, and believe it or not, this can keep them from getting aggro. When you get to boss mob, you should only need 40% mana on the cleric to tank it. If you have considerably less, kite the mob for a little. And like someone else said, kill the pets until mob is engaged. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=proteg@thesteelwarrior>proteg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/03 12:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   cool</span><hr size=1> Last try I had two level 57 peeps in the group so that did not work.  Sounds like EVERYONE needs to be 60+, preferrably 61+.  <br>
<br>
Last time, I also had 5966 hps, but I judt got ND1 couple days ago.  Sounds like it will help greatly if I get ND3 (couple days in PoN doing docks (I like them 'cause gettin reps there is easy as hell so the group is fighting 100% of the time pretty much).  <br>
<br>
I may also get 61 'cause it's easy enough.  Lots of ppl at 61 say their aa goes 20% slower, So I wanted to aa up at level 60 first.  I think ND3 should do before I go for 61 and do trials then.  I figure along the way, I can keep trying to put together a good Trials group using LFG's and friends.  <br>
<br>
With your groups, do you tend to AoE or pick mob, kill mob?  When I have done Pick mob kill mob the dps simply was not there.  I am curious of the tactics used for a non-AoE group.  <br>
<br>
(O, on the comment on horses: the only time I got to exe, we failed because casters were oom and I took too many CHes...NONE of the casters had horses.  If they had horses then we would have easily taken him I believe)<br>

Thanks again for your info.  <br>

<br>
The Key to this is fast Targeting. As MA, you need to switch with about 10% life to next target. I would also suggest having someone shout time. When I flagged a rogue friend we had a Wizard doing this. <br>
<br>
At the start of a round and after each kill he would start a Hotkey. Would say 28 Seconds Left to Kill Target. then 20 Sec, then 15, Then 10, then at about 6 or so he would say... NUKE hard and Kill it we are running out of time. It kept us all focused.<br>
<br>
This helped alot. And we passed it 1st shot. That group was a 61 War, 62 Cleric, 65 Wiz, 65 Ench, 60 Rogue, and a 61 Wiz.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I cant stress enough how much horses help. First hand experience. My Wizard did it 4 times with no horse, never got to Exe and was LOM after 3rd wave. I went and bought a horse, did it the next time... had 20% Mana on Exe... Harvest, and Mana Robe while Tank did his thing till I was at 80% Mana and then just nuked the snot outta him. <br>
<br>
I have passed some sub-60's but not many and it is definately more difficult. Some classes are easier than others. Like Enchanters and Melee Damage Dealers. Never passed with anyone under 58. <br>
<br>
You dont Need ND3. I had No ND levels when I did it. I just got ND3 last Sunday, and you will get there quicker in PoV/PoS. <br>
<br>
I would suggest you make sure you have Virtue, Focus, Brells. Hell any HP buff that will Stack. Also, Make sure All Melee have a Slow Hotkey and Spam it if you get slowed until it is removed. Several Times, either me or monk/rogue being slowed has caused failure's.<br>

<br>
I agree that you need to target mobs very well and switch targets fast.  This I did not do well on.  Definately takes practice.  (And caffeine, wuz 2AM lat time and wasn't frosty)<br>
<br>
Which view did you use?  I think starting in first person is good cause I am used to positioning that way much better.  Then when the mob is well aggroed, going to wide view to scout the landscape of the mobs, and picking out the next target.  Then switching back to First person and rinse and repeat.  <br>
<br>
I think this will be key, and since I have NOT been doing that OR hitting the Slow hotkey fast enough, I have to admit as to date, I simply do not deserve to be flagged.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to your guys' help I think I have a MUCH better idea what to work on as far as my personal skills (like targeting and scouting, not ND3).  Good to know its passable with my stats.  Best to know cause I don't want to get pushed through only to find out I am not a good enough player and get my group wiped.  That would be definate suckage.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=farlanderb>FarlanderB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/03 2:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Slow hotkey</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As MA, you need to switch with about 10% life to next target.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That only slows you down. For the last 10% of their life (the most crucial part) they don't have warrior beating against them. Just use your nearest target key (the default is F-eight (damn EZ smiley faces))    and switch fast (unless you need the rocks down first, then use a 3rd person view to get them). <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=607776">Veteran Farlander</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - 65 <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior">Overlord</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/bprexus81531">Prexus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=farlanderb>FarlanderB</A> at: 3/25/03 2:03:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=binnamar>Binnamar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 317<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/03 2:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: cool</span><hr size=1> I did the trials just now with 65 mag 65 mag 61 wiz 65 clr 61 war&lt;-me and a 62? necro.<br>

target fast too, and make a hotkey stating that you are slowed.

We did very well on our runs, I tanked with windblade, and equipement was fairly similar.  I had about 6200hps, with over 1250AC, I used F-Eight to quick target.  Bard took a beating from AE slow, but he survivied.<br>
<br>
My best advice is to make sure you have people who know what they are doing in you group.  Luck also plays a big role as well.  One time, we got 4 rocks to spawn on us, before the exe fight, and I got completely dispelled, had to fight exe with minimum buffs, and it was not pretty to say the least.  Total, I think I ran 12 trials.  My roommate ran 8 on her mage /shrug.<br>
<br>
Luck plays a good role, just make sure you have some high DPS folks in your party, at least two.<br>
<br>
As far as PoV/PoS tanking - get in line.  There are a ton of folks who are LFG in PoV constantly, and PoS is tricky to build your own group.  I like my PoI - Factory flag a lot personally =)  At level 60 with 6AA's and once piece of SS gear, I tanked just fine, with a druid to heal as well.  Sure, agro control was wacky, but I did it.<br>
<br>
Personally, if I could go back and do it over, I'd stay 60, xp in factory like a mofo, amass a ton of AAs in 60, then save up my 20-30, and go &quot;enjoy&quot; PoV/PoS.  IMO:  PoV sucks.  It's like DL 2.0 <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=31658">Raun Stonecutter</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.swordoffate.com">&lt;Sword of Fate&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

My guild was all in the elementals so I had to level and aa with pickup groups in PoV and PoS.  I cannot stress this strongly enough, actively running around LFG, sending tells, etc for 2 hours and xping in a good xp spot (pov caves, bot, etc) for 2 hours will net you a LOT more (like double) the xp of just xping for 4 hours in a tier 1 plane even a tier 1 plane part b like factory in poi.  There is no question, IMO, that getting flagged as deep as you can get flagged (pov, bot, cod, hoh are 4 easy to get flags that have great xp) and levelling to 65 as fast as you can regardless of aa's is much much more efficient than aa'ing at 60 and then levelling.<br>
