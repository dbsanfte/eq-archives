<br>
In teh chat, they let it slip that all warriors, regardless of level will mitigate an additional percentage or incoming melee damage.<br>
now of course we need to watch the stacking issues with ID5 etc, but if its true that an additional warrior only mitigation will be added to the combat system, we are getting one of the things we really really need.<br>
<br>
i am doubtful that this new combat system will work when tanking fennin Ro or General Reparm or avatars in PoA with all the damn video lag in the EP zones, so i am not holding my breath on the meat of the changes.<br>
<br>
oh. i also like the idea of seperate timers on discs. if defensive is separated (and maybe re-use in increased) from furious or aggressive, etc it will be a huge help to high end tanking.<br>
wouldnt it kick ass to engage teh mob with furious while the debuff team goes to work, then kick in defensive or evasive once the mobs are slowed and crippled? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~rookk/zarch1.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
It looks as if EQ is forcing the elders in each class to venture there now. These &quot;Warrior parchments&quot; will most likely be no drop, just as the ethereal and spectral parchments for casters. (If they are not no drop, expect to pay upwards of 20k each for them in the bazaar.)<br>
<br>
There are places outside of PoP to get exp and there is a very large group of people who just don't want to go to PoP zones. <br>
<br>
I am all for change, especially if it will make warriors a viable class again.<br>

<br>
As for the rest of is.....<br>
<br>
I couldnt beleive that SoE's wayto fix warriors was to make them more pally like, not make use better warriors.  <br>
<br>
I mean don't endurance pool sound like mana, trainig stuff sound like parchments.  But it gets worse<br>
<br>
Where pally's get kei to keep their mana pool refreshed, what we gonna get nada.  And with the itemization the way it is, all stuff pally's gonna have gonna have mana, do you really think they are going to add &quot;endurance points&quot; or whatever they are called to all those items in the game created that where for all plate classes(meaning boht melee, and brain stats)<br>
<br>
Our new stuff will be abilites, which will have a chance to fail, pally stun gains agro even if resisted, so it can't fail.  <br>
They gonna add &quot;focus effects&quot; to already existing items, meaning that if you, like me, dont have elemental/time access probably gonna have to sacrafice hp/ac in order to get these focus effects.  <br>
<br>
With them dumping /disc onto this &quot;endurance pool&quot; every time you use any skill that takes points out of this pool, wont you effectivly be losing defensive time?(not sure about this , wasnt too clear).  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~sunbur/watsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I view this an an opportunity.  <br>
<br>
I never had problem finding a group.  I have a network of friends that I have developed over my EQ time.   This doesn't sound like its going to weaken me but give me choices.  Most of what people experienced in terms of problems I have never experienced.  Personality, being a professional, and acting with Honor can get you as many if not more groups than any abilities.  People like you they will group with you plain and simple.   I think a percentage of people will still have problems with groups as they are just lack social skills.<br>
<br>
I also don't care if I am second fiddle to a pally with aggro as I always got groups.   I know that I can easily out damage most pallies so settle into a DPS roll.   I really don't care if my class is the best one like most here.    That being said we need a hand in several areas.   I don't want anyone nerfed but this sounds better than fixing taunt alone.  <br>
<br>
For me this is going to enhance my game not weaken it.  Sounds like you could play the same way as always without using these new abilities.  But I will use them effectively as I use everything we have now like /shield.  <br>
<br>
Everything has a use even if its only to be an ashtray! <p>Goradin<br>

Is long overdue. This list of bestest warrior skills we could have. <br>
<br>
<br>
Here be skills Hrogdor think warriors needing. <br>
<br>
<br>
1. Death scene: A very cool and impressive death involving a great deal of violence, bloodspray, and dramatic music. The warrior immediately dies, but the enemy mob takes 10,000 damage from overacting. <br>
<br>
2. Remezzing: When a warrior screws up and breaks a chanter's mez, said warrior can immediately re-engage mez by apologizing profusely to the now-battered chanter and promising to be a good boy/girl from now on. <br>
<br>
3. Cowardice: A warrior should be able to instantly FD when he/she falls below ten percent health while the cleric is discussing strategy with the druid and the shaman is teaching his/her dog how to roll over and shake hands. <br>
<br>
4. HOLY @#%$: A warrior can succor (casting time 1.5) when pulling and turning a corner to find twenty-four red mobs looking at him/her like a finely marinated and barbequed ribeye. <br>
<br>
5. KAG: Kiss Ass Goodbye: A warrior can close his/her eyes and perform a feat of impressive contortionism when being told that he/she is going to pull and tank a mob fully capable of killing GMs. <br>
<br>
6. Sharing the Love: The warrior forms a link between him/herself and the entire group. When the warrior dies, so does the entire group. <br>
<br>
7. MINE DAMMIT! The warrior will automatically beat the /ran 100 rolls of any caster on any melee-only item. <br>
<br>
8. Wile E Coyote: Automatically activated skill that will allow a warrior to survive a fall of up to 10,000 paces with 10 health left by releasing a large cloud of smoke at the site of impact and creating a warrior-shaped hole in the ground. <br>
<br>
9. Mounted Bonus: Warriors on horseback/lizardback receive +100 to ATTK, AC, and a 50 damage bonus just so we have a reason to buy one of the damn things. <br>
<br>
10. Mine's Bigger than Yours Is: Warriors can instantly enlarge breast and/or penis size up to 200 percent so they feel less inadequate, and no longer have to rely upon 2-handed slashers to compensate. <br>
<br>
11. Pet: Warriors can summon a rabid pit bull of their own level without any names like 'Jarer' 'Kabober' or 'Jibn'. They would have names like &quot;Terminator&quot;, &quot;Slayer&quot;, &quot;Eviscerator&quot; or &quot;One Mean Bastard&quot;. <br>
<br>
12. Psyche Out: This skill allows a warrior to essentially cast a fear spell on a mob by trash talking, flexing, and puffing his/her chest out. <br>
<br>
13. Emergency Invisibility: The warrior immediately falls down, curls into the fetal position, and covers his/her own eyes. Success is not guaranteed each time this skill is used. Chanting 'find the happy place, find the happy place' can improve the odds of success. <br>
<br>
14. Bitch Slap: When a green mob aggros the warrior, he/she can give the mob a disgusted look, slap it across the face (or similar appendage), and cause the mob to instantly lose aggro and flee. This will also work for PvP. <br>
<br>
15. Sphincter Reinforcement: The warrior appears calm, collected, and infinitely composed when faced with certain and total annihilation, even laughing and singing in the face of gory, painful death while the rest of the group loses control of bodily functions. <br>
<br>
16. Ask Nicely: The warrior can drag his/her corpse past high aggro mobs without being attacked. For use on CR's. <br>
<br>
17. Flashback: The warrior suffers an immediate attack of post-traumatic-stress syndrome and goes berserk, regardless of health level. Warriors already berserk become &quot;Nucking Futs&quot;, and every successful hit is treated as a critical, with critical hits being treated as crippling blows. <br>
<br>
18. I'm Not Quite Dead: Warriors reduced to zero health can cling to the edge of life for up to ten minutes, allowing the group healer to complete his/her masturbation and actually cast a healing spell on them. <br>
<br>
19. Buff Bod Factor: Warriors can instantly tell the true gender of every player, and will strongly attract (RL)hawt members of the opposite sex by flexing and striking various seductive poses. <br>
<br>
20. Punt: Warriors that have become annoyed with gnomes or halflings can kick them into other zones. <br>
<br>
<br>
Methinks these be most useful added abilites for warriors. <br>

Now l one every 5-10 minutes of fighting, when it does go up sometimes the bar flickers for a second and no buttons pop sometimes it's 3 seconds but no abilities I actually need to use.  for example &quot;guard&quot; popped once and I could have hit it, I assume it's like /sheild but there was no reason to guard anyone, and once I had all the buttons for literally 1/4 of a second, I couldn't make my fingers move fast enough to click, it was like a drunk driving exam.<br>
<br>
My first impressions were not good at all, hopefully this will be patched soon, because if this is it, I wouldn't even bother<br>
opening the window. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=feriin>Feriin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/03 7:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3240.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Chania/fullsize/avatar.jpg height=157 width=146></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   How I feel..</span><hr size=1> As a Shadow Knight/Cleric/Enchanter I promise to not sell any warrior/monk/rogue parchments for any amount of money..

My 2hs is Anathema an enraging blow 2hs that you can find in my magelo.  Anyways, its 25 pounds.  It really affects my energy bar, as I'm pretty much under 10% always when I'm tanking.  <br>
<br>
Anyone know if this will be directly affected in any way, since its already killing my energy bar?  Think maybe i won't be able to use as many of the new skills with this bringing my energy down so much? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/nc3/eatnoodlez/used.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=296342" target="top"><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->G'd Up From The Feet Up</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=suttonspiritrider>Sutton Spiritrider</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/03 1:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3240.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Heeheehee</span><hr size=1> 6.

<br>
I suguest instead of being such a butthead about it you start grouping with a better class of players.  I have passed on every rune/parchment isnce pop release, except on rare occasions when casters atcually admitted they had all the spells of that lvl and open roll was ok.  I am no model of purity, most any warrior/rogue/monk i have ever grouped with do the same.  Of course there is a handfull of people that think different but they are a minority.  <br>
<br>
I cant begin to tell you how many times i have passed on parchments when nothing else even droped all night an i will refuse to group with any caster who will not return that faovor now.<br>

<br>
I HAVE been in several groups where casters who only needed 1 or 2 more spells rolled on any parchment that dropped.  I grouped with some repeatedly.  Do you think after winning a couple spells when they only needed 1 more that they maybe sold those spells and bought the one they needed so we could maybe open lotto a parch?  Of course not.  They sold dupes for plats, banked the plat, and kept rolling on parchments.
