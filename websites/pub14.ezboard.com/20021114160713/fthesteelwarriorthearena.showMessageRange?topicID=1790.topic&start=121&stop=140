Um... the only wizzies who are helpless after a manaburn are the people who bought the characters on ebay.<br>
<br>
you see, when arguing this point, most of the wizzies will conveniently forget about the epic/manarobe trick...<br>
<br>
If they dont have an epic.... running at jboot or run3 speed oughta get away from the greenie long enough to zone/gather/manastone/manarobe...<br>
<br>
manaburn is broken in only two aspects:<br>
1) PvP<br>
2) certain outdoor higher-end encounters<br>
<br>
for PvP:<br>
instead of nerfing it, enhance other classes so that they have a defense for it.  Change the &quot;rune&quot;, &quot;skin&quot;, and &quot;spellshield&quot; line of spells so that they absorb ALL of the blows as long as they have 1 HP left....  thus if &quot;awarrior_01&quot; has a spellshield on and only has 1HP of it left and gets manaburned, the warrior takes ZERO damage...(the spellshield is breached however)  Now, for the melee, place &quot;minor spellshield scarabs&quot; (5 charge minor-spellshield 2second cast rclick items) on the magic items vendor.  Note, certain powerful mobs might know how to cast such a spell as well!  Such a change might actually make PvP between two MB wizzies fun!<br>
<br>
for MB-farming:<br>
just lower the maximum range for manaburn to within most mobs' aggro range... the team-MB will have to work on a tad more planning....<br>
<br>
The idea is not to uber-nerf MB, as it is a cool idea... its just a tad broken due to certain dorks and how MB was implemented.<br>

Do we have to go over this again? The range on MB is short - much less than most nukes. You CAN NOT cast MB on a Kunark dragon from outside agro range. The cast time on MB is also long. Long enough that every single Kunark dragon can be within melee range BEFORE you can cast MB.<br>
<br>
Is MBing a Kunark dragon easy? Yes.<br>
Is MBing a Kunark dragon a sure thing? Not by a long shot.<br>
<br>
Team MB will fail on a Kunark dragon as often as a group with 60 war, 60 cleric, 4x 60 rangers with similar AAs and equipment as the wizard group. This of course is assuming that the mixed group is not a bunch or n00b small bus riding EQ tards.<br>

manaburn range is 200feet.. same as most wizard spells<br>
only a select few wiz spells are 300feet... like the bolt series.. that makes for all of 3 or 4 spells with a higher range...<br>
Elnericks and Garrisons, and all the lure series as well as the Draught series are 200feet... how is 200feet &quot;MUCH LESS than most nukes?&quot;  <br>
<br>
We both know you think you are talking to just melee who have never cast a spell in their life... wake up... some of us have played quite a few classes.  Deliberately lying doesnt do much for your case.<br>
<br>
for the warriors/melee of the group...  use a 150 range bow and 50 range arrows and you have the idea...<br>
<br>
Melee range is 50feet...<br>
<br>
reduce Manaburn range to 100feet... no more cheese insta-kills<br>
<br>
On top of it all, even mobs that require &quot;melee range&quot; to be hit with spells are hit with ranged NO RESIST spells just fine... add another &quot;whoops we forgot to mention it&quot; to the table.<br>

As anyone who has pulled Kunark Dragons can tell you... you can too get them at 200range without aggro... Manaburn casts in 6 seconds... we both know that can be significantly reduced...<br>

Ranger with uber items and AAXP can produce very incredible numbers (my RL bro's ranger has over 100AAXP) but 4 rangers a warrior and a cleric?<br>
if the uber mob has 17K hp... thats three wizzies pressing &quot;insta-kill&quot; no other peeps needed...  heck they might even throw a warrior at it with a cleric... thats 5 peeps... insta-ded mob... roughly 4-6 seconds worth of fight...<br>
<br>
An uber with 17k HP vs 4 rangers with the same cleric and warrior will need to pump out 700dam/sec+ each to match the efficiency... now rangers can reach nice numbers... but we both know they cant do 700dam/sec... so its gonna take longer... provided the tank or cleric doesnt get feared (not as much of a surety anymore due to the screwy resist tables) its gonna be a good 30seconds or more until the rangers can shoot 17k down if everything goes perfectly.. (ranger damage is spotty... and if ONE pixel of said mob is in an obstruction, they do ZERO damage that way!) and this is if none of em get eaten in that time.<br>
<br>
If the mob has 32K HP, thats 5 wizzies.... and 5 rangers have to pump out 1066dam/sec... its not gonna happen... gonna be a good 45-60 seconds of perfect stars and moons aligned.... and no rangers dying....<br>
of course 5 rangers cant port instantly to where they need to go either...<br>
<br>
So you are telling me three wizzies with 23AAXP pressing the insta-kill button before they are aggroed is just as close as 4 rangers who need X,Y, Z and all the stars and moons aligned??<br>

I was about to post a long explaination as to why your reasoning is flawed but then I realized you have no idea what you are talking about and arguing with you would be pointless. The fact that you seem to doubt that 4 decently equiped rangers can't pump out 32k damage in under 1 minute speaks volumes of your supposed knowledge of &quot;many classes&quot;.<br>
<br>
I also love how you acuse me of lying then come back with a boldface lie in return. I would LOVE to see you try to get within casting range of any Kunark dragon and NOT get agro while being max KOS.<br>

-Brik is a troll SK and MAX KOS to Kunark Dragons<br>
Heck he's max KOS to all dragons,(Kunark especially due to Veeshan's peak) and for that matter dang near anything, I am pretty dang good at knowing when I have aggroed something as unlike some race/class combinations I spent that whole character's existance ducking goody-two-shoe guards and pulling for groups, raids, etc...<br>
<br>
I would get within range and cast one of my many 200 range spells and run... unless something huge has changed since I have even been able to SEE a Kunark dragon (due to MB teams) pretty sure 200 range is plenty to play with.<br>
<br>
I never got the aggro message while able to see the dragon in spell range... we both know that any spellcaster worth their salt knows what range is what and can usually eyeball it.<br>
(I have to for Pulling, PvP, and numerous other issues, most wizards do for quad kiting purposes... not too hard to imagine MOST casters do) <br>
<br>
Last time was prolly back in March, when Gor was for some reason near karnor's (unaggroed and undamaged)and I took pity on a newbie friend and ran Gor away... ran up behind it invis... threw a Shadow Vortex (200range spell) and ran like hell... Gor eventually caught me somehow (warped I think, couldnt tell due to a very inopportune lag spike) and I bit it... but not until bringing Gor halfway across the zone...  Now the moral of the story is I was able to cast on Gor BEFORE it aggroed... it did not aggro during my cast but AFTER.  I was well within eyeball of 200 range when I did. (stupid hill)<br>
<br>
If you are willing to explain that, and how you could be right... then go ahead...<br>
<br>
I'd go out and test it now, but my likelyhood of finding a Kunark dragon up is like finding a needle in a haystack. (due to MB teams)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, If i can get Brik's fat bottom to spell range without getting detected... that either means you need some work on your stealth, or you are blowing smoke (In this case I dont really think you are lying... I think you are just less experienced.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I still want to hear how a 200range spell is &quot;much less than most spells&quot; (you were blowing smoke, admit it)<br>
<br>
I DO want to hear how you think rangers damage is so rediculously uber...  come on... 32k damage for 5 rangers is certainly more time than the &lt; 6 seconds to MB it down... how fast have YOU seen rangers do damage? thats 6400damage apiece... we both know they arent doing 1000+ damage/second...<br>
<br>
so lets say they were doing 200dam/sec thats 32 seconds... gee thats awfully close to my 45-60 second theory isnt it... and if we consider MISSES and &quot;one-pixel-in-the-geometry&quot; problems... I am probably not too far off...  even then... 30 seconds is quite easily fast enough to eat at least one ranger...<br>
<br>
would you say rangers do more than 200damage/sec in non-laboratory situations? (you are over-estimating ranger damage and assuming their MAX damage is their average.... Archery has many variables.. it isnt &quot;click here for 7k damage!&quot;<br>
<br>
come now...  I would LOVE to hear you refute the other points...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, just for sake of arguement,<br>
lets say aggro range on Dragons has been changed recently and it IS 200feet now....<br>
we both know they dont run all that fast don't we...<br>
(so the meat of the point is still there... MB is stll rediculously easy.. get any patsy to distract the dragon for awhile -like run- or even Parry/Dodge/Riposte tank it)<br>
<br>
sadly, I dont even really wish to see MB changed that much... just range reduced and a defense set up for PvP... (which nerfs Brik's HT, and all other one-hit whoopses in PvP as well... this type of change actually nerfs just about every class I play regularly)<br>
<br>
If what you say is true... then why is it you are ignoring all the other points and since the extra range isnt helping you... why do you oppose it?<br>
<br>
we both know why...<br>

Are you that clueless? Kunark dragons usually have a lifespan measured in minutes since long before manaburn. This is just a convenient way to place the blame on player that have a skill you are jealous of.<br>

And what agro message is that? Last time I killed Gore, oh last week or so, Gore's doesn't always emote when she agros but rather she emotes when she kills someone. And while we are on the topic of range, I would love to see you justify the statement that you made in your earlier post that melee range is 50 feet. I suppose you never noticed that the melee range on a mob varies, usually dependent on its size. Feel free to stand 50 feet away from the flurry drakes, I am sure it does wonders for your DPS.<br>

Gor eventually caught me somehow (warped I think, couldnt tell due to a very inopportune lag spike) and I bit it... but not until bringing Gor halfway across the zone... Now the moral of the story is I was able to cast on Gor BEFORE it aggroed... it did not aggro during my cast but AFTER. I was well within eyeball of 200 range when I did. (stupid hill)<br>

You immediately lose credibility here because anyone that has every had to run through DL knows that Gore sees invis. Not only that, you just admited that you got killed by Gore just trying to run away. How do you suppose you would kill Gore with the magic instant kill button if you can't even run away without dying. Oh yeah, I forgot, wizards and their pullers are not subject to the same lag/warp/buggy pathing that troll SKs are.<br>

Or maybe because of every guild that's been around for more than 2 months can and does kill the Kunark dragons as soon as they pop. I would be willing to bet any amount of plats that warriors and bards have a way better idea of when Gore and Sev pop. The people that need scales are the ones that park low level rangers in the zone so they can get the jump on the competition. The last 2 times I have been on a Gore kill it was AFTER waiting for everyones MB to refresh because we did not have enough wizards around that hadn't used MB somewhere else. Again you make the same assinine arguement that assumes that every wizard with MB is sitting around on an alt checking tracking for a dragon to MB. I have news for you -- the majority of wizards with MB that have gear good enough to get 8k burns or better are in raid guilds. I seriously doubt that any wizard would be able to take a break from NToV, Ssra, or VT to go burn a 2 expansion old gimp dragon.<br>

In case you have never noticed that mobs don't immediately agro even if you are in range? I suppose you have NEVER not even once had to actually whack a mob to get its attention even though you are max kos and in melee range. You expect me to take this as a valid arguement that you got within range and cast a 1.5 second cast time spell? This is no where near a fair comparison. Had you said you walked up and cast any 6 second or lets be genereous and go with 4.8 second casting spell (best you could do if you happen to get max spell haste) and Gore didn't turn on you until the spell landed and you thought to /assist Gore to make sure she was not agro then I might take this as a valid point.<br>

I will admit that this is a seat of my pants judgement from casting MB a few hundred times in the last 6 months. I could be wrong but I would guess MB to have a 150 range. I don't believe everything I read on casters realm, I tend to go with what actually happens in game.<br>

This is where your arguement completely takes a @#%$. Never did I say that rangers do 1k+ DPS. I did say that they could kill Gore in about 30 seconds. In case your &quot;brother with 100+aa&quot; hasn't told you, rangers get these nifty AA skills called endless quiver, archery mastery, and combat fury. These AAs, coupled with the level 60 discipline Trueshot make for quite the damage output.<br>

Ok, I'll even say that our rangers ONLY do 200 DPS. Even then your &quot;one-pixel-in-the-geometry&quot; theory is pretty easy to avoid by using the super secret uber guild strategy called &quot;pull the mob into an open area so the rangers can use their bows&quot;. Don't tell anyone about this, its a secret, that's why your brother with the ranger with 100aa+ has never told you. He would lose his ranger license if he did. Also, I will fill you in on another little secret ... when rangers use archery they go to max range, which is typically over 300 (200 for primal bow, 125 for 10 damage acrylia arrows). Guess what else? When you lob arrows at a mob from 325 feet away, it generates ALMOST NO AGRO. As in you can spam your bow and shoot as fast as you can with max haste and never have to worry about getting agro. Again, I have personally played a ranger for the DPS on kills including Gore, Talendor, Klandicar, Sontalak, and Velketor. In every single fight, there were a few common factors -- 1. over 200dps parsed 2. never got agro 3. easily got around geometry bugs to enable constant damage.<br>

I have personally parsed over 220 DPS from a ranger with the above skills using 10 damage arrows and a primal bow. Go take a look at the Ranger's Glade and see what some of the truly uber rangers are doing with archery these days. I suppose you could consider shooting arrows from max range at a dragon in the middle of a big field laboratory conditions, but I prefer to call it common sense.<br>

Maybe that's because (assuming that there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> an aggro text) you were outside /say range?<br>

Also, various AA skills have a bug their range (well, they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> had</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I don't know if the bug still exists any longer). For instance, enchanters were having a problem with dire charm (which has range 200!) where unless they were fairly close to the mob, they would get &quot;the mob is out of range&quot; when they tried to hit dire charm... sometimes they'd even get the message when standing on top of the mob they wanted to charm!<br>

When you give a class something that can give 100k or more loot with 0 risk in the 30 seconds with extremely mobile and organized players (ie channel MB, AE, whatnot), you just screw RvR for no good reason.<br>

<br>
Personally I think Team Manaburn is ridiculous, but there have been idiots and item farmers in this game since day 1. You have to learn to deal with it. I haven't seen a true manifestation of this on Veeshan, but there have groups of wizzies who get together to try Gore, etc on their own. Usually the wizzies in question are in top end guilds and only do it in &quot;downtime&quot;. The reason they are the ones in thew top end guilds, is because they are the ones that possess the cohesion to do something like this (every TRIED to get 5 wizzies to agree on much?).<br>
<br>
Manaburn as skill, contrary to what is being touted by our wizard visitor is NOT that hard to get: a year after SOL, how many people who were 60 at SoL's release don't have 25-40 AA pts? I have 32 without trying, just from raids and inconsistent hunting with my friends in FG/Akheva/etc. Wizards and Enchanters tend to be more serious on &quot;power exping&quot; for their AA's to attain their Creme-de-la-Creme abilities: manaburn and Dire charm. They also are focal points for those AE groups in the Deep, etc. so they can get them in a hurry (not knocking AE but it works a LOT better with a wizard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
I can see the PvP people having concerns abot Manaburn, but other than that (make it a mob only skill), leave it alone. I would much rather see them devote resources to fixing existing bugs, maybe coming up with a bone to throw our way, and giving back some GM support to some place beside Stormhammer (3 1/2 for a guide to answer a petition is getting just a little ridiculous). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ubesrikarle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Besrikarle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 9:41:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=133>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I dream of dancing eggplants.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I could be wrong but I would guess MB to have a 150 range.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
As for the whole ranger conversation with a warrior and cleric, totally possible. His point however, is it wont take 6 seconds. Nothing can touch the Manaburn team with this. No other class or group of classes can walk up to something and do a mob in 2 clicks, the burn button, and the loot button. <br>
<br>
In all this fluff and uh, stuff, there are valid points. That being, that manaburn is the easiest and fastest way to drop these mobs. You can talk ranger  team, or hell clerics with ubah hammers, but nothing will touch the efficiency, simplicity, and ease of manaburn.<br>
<br>
 Personally, I think its cool as hell, and I am fine with the way it is, even in PvP. I got manaburned for 6442 last night. I didn't bitch, I laughed my ass off and kicked his finger wiggling ass for the next 2 hours. <br>

You can go back and look at my posts from way back when this thread started and my position has always been the same. Yes there are idiots that are trying to get every single dragon spawn then rape people the loot, but this is not exclusive to manaburn and it certainly does not warrant nerfing MB. I am sure that you will find that many MB wizards like to kill dragons for kicks. I do it because the hard to find Kunark spells are most likely to drop off of these dragons. I have hooked up guildies with Pox of Bert, Mask of the Hunter, Sunstrike x2, Xuzl, the cleric group cheal, <br>
Legacy of thorn, and probably some others I am forgetting. I will probably continue to burn dragons if I get lucky enough to be around for one until all of my guildies have all of their kunark spells and I get a ##$@%&amp; white dragon hide to make a ID3 cloak. Last time I was around for a Gore kill some lucky pali also got his epic book for free since he happened to be there.<br>
<br>
The example I have used before was of a 4 man Lodi team that used to plague our server. They tracked the spawn time and had a monk FD at the spawn spot. As soon as Lodi spawned, out of the blue the monks rogue, warrior, and cleric friend would magically log in, kill lodi -- yes even KSing mid level guilds some times -- loot and log out. They got every single lodi spawn for a month. Not most of them, all of them. People eventually got fed up and organized. Once they got organized they where able to fend off the lodi crew and restore the spawn back to its normal f**ked up self.<br>
<br>
If team manaburn is SERIOUSLY a problem on your server, then do something about it. Its a lot harder to get 5 manaburn wizards together (rival guilds and all) than it is to get 2 groups that are easily capable of killing a dragon. All it takes is 2 porters to make 12 people just as mobilized as a group of wizards, IF and this is the big if, people organize and have a plan of action.<br>
<br>
And I don't remember saying MB is hard to get. It's not it just takes time, ask Eduin, he PL'd a wizard to MB in 350 hours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ubrikbludgaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brik Bludgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 8:27:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=135>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   MB</span><hr size=1> QUOTE:<br>

Actually, the kunark dragons ran in cycles... when they were a challenge, they were common... when they were the rage to beat, they were less common... then they became common again as less people wanted the loot... now with manaburn, they are so easy as to be near impossible to find.

And while we are on the topic of range, I would love to see you justify the statement that you made in your earlier post that melee range is 50 feet.

Hmm &quot;melee&quot; range for spells silly... how often does a manaburning wizard melee?  Harmtouch is a &quot;melee range&quot; spell.... it has 50 range... we were comparing spells and spell ranges... not melee.  Where did you get melee from?? I looked through the whole thread and cant find anything about swinging a weapon... SPELL MELEE range is 50feet...  As there are quite a few higher level raid mobs who are immune to spells except those with no resist check, and those within &quot;melee&quot; range, I thought you would have an idea what I was talking about.  I may have over-estimated you.<br>
<br>
In case you didnt know... most non-warrior melee stand at the very edge of melee range for the whole fight due to aggro... every melee who doesnt like dying two seconds into the fight knows the limits of each size of mob...<br>

Not only that, you just admited that you got killed by Gore just trying to run away. How do you suppose you would kill Gore with the magic instant kill button if you can't even run away without dying. Oh yeah, I forgot, wizards and their pullers are not subject to the same lag/warp/buggy pathing that troll SKs are.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Um, anyone else find this troll telling a &quot;smart&quot; wizzie with all this &quot;experience&quot; that a dead dragon doesnt chase you to be entertaining?  Seriously... 5 wizards bother to figure out how to pull and sneak up on the dragon... 1-2-3 now! all 5 start casting... boom! insta-ded dragon.... even if the dragon DOES figure it out that its getting cast at... 200 range is plenty for the spell to go off before gore gets there.  Its done on every server and rather often... why is it you find it so hard to believe?<br>

Or maybe because of every guild that's been around for more than 2 months can and does kill the Kunark dragons as soon as they pop.<br>

Most guilds of that stature dont need those items anymore and would never bother to farm it for cash as they can kill better things with their time...  5 greedy people who only need to click a button seem to find it very lucrative.<br>

I would be willing to bet any amount of plats that warriors and bards have a way better idea of when Gore and Sev pop. The people that need scales are the ones that park low level rangers in the zone so they can get the jump on the competition.<br>

<br>
I know quite a few of them who do... the thing is, they get jumped by 5 wizards who can all port and only need to hit the instakill button.  I know a few warriors and bards who have just plain quit trying due to all the camping and having MB teams steal it so easily.  They refuse to pay the wizards for the right to enjoy content.<br>

QUOTE<br>
The last 2 times I have been on a Gore kill it was AFTER waiting for everyones MB to refresh because we did not have enough wizards around that hadn't used MB somewhere else. Again you make the same assinine arguement that assumes that every wizard with MB is sitting around on an alt checking tracking for a dragon to MB.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Hmm... searching my posts... looking for a quote of mine that says &quot;every wizard with MB sits around with an alt checking for dragons&quot;  wait... I never said that... YOU did... are you trying to put words in my mouth? <br>
Not every wizard waits around... but then again they dont have to... <br>
/tell Wiz_02 Dragon is up teamMB time.. <br>
Wiz_02 tells you sorry MB down... <br>
/tell Wiz_04 MBtime <br>
okay <br>
/tell Wiz_07 MB time, <br>
okay comin.... <br>
my point is, that more and more wizards are getting MB, and more and more twinks are making the climb...  it only takes one dork to collect 4 more dorks... usually in less time than gathering a bunch of varied classes for a mini-raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
I have news for you -- the majority of wizards with MB that have gear good enough to get 8k burns or better are in raid guilds. I seriously doubt that any wizard would be able to take a break from NToV, Ssra, or VT to go burn a 2 expansion old gimp dragon.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
No, but since MB isnt hard to get, and doesnt require much non-nodrop loot to get into the 7k range, it really didnt take the dorks long to get it. (most wizzies, and indeed most of all the players are quite fine peeps... its the dorks that screw it up for everyone)<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
In case you have never noticed that mobs don't immediately agro even if you are in range? I suppose you have NEVER not even once had to actually whack a mob to get its attention even though you are max kos and in melee range. <br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Um, how does this disprove my theory that any dork can just walk up and hit the &quot;instakill button&quot;...  didnt you just admit that it is not only possible but likely??<br>
<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
You expect me to take this as a valid arguement that you got within range and cast a 1.5 second cast time spell? This is no where near a fair comparison. Had you said you walked up and cast any 6 second or lets be genereous and go with 4.8 second casting spell (best you could do if you happen to get max spell haste) and Gore didn't turn on you until the spell landed and you thought to /assist Gore to make sure she was not agro then I might take this as a valid point.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
The point is, Gore didnt turn on me until AFTER the spell landed... dead dragons dont give chase remember?  and just last night I threw a 6.2 second spell (after hybrid haste) at a mob that I aggroed at 200 range, ran, and then cast on... 200 range is plenty for the skilled to get out even a 6 second spell... 4.8 seconds is cake.<br>
<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>

Lets say I believe you... now lets examine how you got them... how many are bought and paid for?  How many are on a separate account and the same server?  How many are &quot;bots&quot;?  How many were leveled by the first couple of 60s while using multiple boxes or a certain program?<br>
Lets say your answers to all that are NONE, NONE, NONE, and NONE... <br>
Even then, is it not possible someone knows something more than you? is it not possible that someone has a longer history and broader experience? Perhaps even on specific issues?<br>
<br>
I'll point out one specific issue... I note not one of the classes usually used for pulling... is it not possible a player who has played since beta and who has multiple 55+ characters on many different servers who has been pulling and perfecting his technique might know something above your notice about pulling?<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
I will admit that this is a seat of my pants judgement from casting MB a few hundred times in the last 6 months. I could be wrong but I would guess MB to have a 150 range. I don't believe everything I read on casters realm, I tend to go with what actually happens in game.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
<br>
200 range is from spdat... and from lucy...<br>
all of the spells' range listed in spdat have been up to date... especially when they have changed something in there (like when made HT &quot;melee range&quot;...)<br>
<br>
You not only exaggerated the point but tried to make a point against my solution with it.  Do tell me how 150 range is &quot;much shorter range&quot; from 200 range...  you were blowing smoke in order to try to make your point that &quot;MB shouldn't be nerfed&quot;.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is, you are nitpicking because you dont want Verant to touch Manaburn... it is broken and you know it, the solutions I suggested wouldnt hurt it one little bit then for people who  &quot;dont have time to waste your time from raiding&quot; and you &quot;think that Manaburn's range is only 150feet&quot;.  Right?<br>
<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
This is where your arguement completely takes a @#%$. Never did I say that rangers do 1k+ DPS. I did say that they could kill Gore in about 30 seconds. In case your &quot;brother with 100+aa&quot; hasn't told you, rangers get these nifty AA skills called endless quiver, archery mastery, and combat fury. These AAs, coupled with the level 60 discipline Trueshot make for quite the damage output.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
<br>
oh yes, he has told me... and shown me... but it isnt anywhere NEAR the damage output and ease of use as &quot;insta-kill button&quot; nor is it broken due to the fact that in order to DO that uber damage you see:<br>
1) the mob must be stationary and not rooted<br>
2) the mob must be standing in a perfect place (for the whole time) where not one pixel of its body is in any obstructions... FOR that whole 30 seconds! (this is why its gonna take longer or require more than just the rangers doing it!<br>
3) 5 rangers have to have 35+AAXP, a grandmaster fletcher, and a primal bow compared to just any 5 wizards with buyable gear and 23AAXP.  On top of this they need 30 seconds to kill something that 5 said wizards need only &lt; 6 seconds to kill (most of which will be while said mob hasnt even noticed them yet)<br>
<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Ok, I'll even say that our rangers ONLY do 200 DPS. Even then your &quot;one-pixel-in-the-geometry&quot; theory is pretty easy to avoid by using the super secret uber guild strategy called &quot;pull the mob into an open area so the rangers can use their bows&quot;.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
If you pull it, then its moving... if its being tanked, then you either have a tank (and one less ranger) or the ranger is using weaponshield and hence not shooting and therefore not able to use /disc trueshot.. keep in mind this has to be done for 30seconds PLUS... dead rangers dont do any damage!  if both the wizzies AND the rangers get a cleric and tank... you STILL think its easier to keep a tank up for 30 seconds or 6seconds?  If the mob is being tanked, then it very well might end up with a pixel in the geometry... you see any time melee is going on, its difficult to keep mobs standing still.. if the mob isnt being tanked (kited) then its not standing still AND its possible it will end up in the geometry...<br>
<br>
All this is pointing to the fact that you were exaggerating when you said rangers could just as easily do such a thing... the difference between click-dead (most of that 6 seconds while the mobs hasnt even noticed you), and toink, toink, toink, toink....... 30-60 seconds later dead is QUITE a bit more difficult.<br>
<br>
&lt;SNIP-useless &quot;Wizzie having brain fart about secrets&quot; drivel removed&gt;<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Also, I will fill you in on another little secret ... when rangers use archery they go to max range, which is typically over 300 (200 for primal bow, 125 for 10 damage acrylia arrows). Guess what else? When you lob arrows at a mob from 325 feet away, it generates ALMOST NO AGRO.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
The key word is ALMOST.... due to the dragon not being dead near instantly, the rangers still have to deal with that &quot;almost&quot; no aggro.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
As in you can spam your bow and shoot as fast as you can with max haste and never have to worry about getting agro. Again, I have personally played a ranger for the DPS on kills including Gore, Talendor, Klandicar, Sontalak, and Velketor. In every single fight, there were a few common factors -- 1. over 200dps parsed 2. never got agro 3. easily got around geometry bugs to enable constant damage.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Nice... and on said raid was the:<br>
1) mob tanked for you by tanks much closer than you?<br>
2) mob positioned for damage dealers by the numerous people in front of you?<br>
3)did it take longer than 6 seconds?<br>
<br>
I have no problem with ranger damage as it requires a team effort and quite a bit more skill tha 1-2-3-click.  I have no problem with the damage Manaburn does either... I just want to get rid of the abuses...  we ALL know that 5 rangers dont port into and kill a Kunark dragon in order to sell the loot as they simply have to be very wel equipped and very well AAXPd to do such a thing and they just plain wouldnt... Manaburn doesnt require everything AM/EQ does... and its faster, easier, and requires less support.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
I have personally parsed over 220 DPS from a ranger with the above skills using 10 damage arrows and a primal bow. Go take a look at the Ranger's Glade and see what some of the truly uber rangers are doing with archery these days. I suppose you could consider shooting arrows from max range at a dragon in the middle of a big field laboratory conditions, but I prefer to call it common sense.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Manaburn is still easier and faster.. and much easier to abuse simply due to the fact that AM/EQ doesnt instakill anything PvE.  No matter what, the creature will get to defend itself against the rangers.<br>

You got your wish, but I am sure you will fall back on your arguement that I am a liar.<br>

QUOTE<br>
Apparently you have already forgotten that the last time you encountered Gore you DIED trying to run away. I guess you don't have the skill to do such a &quot;rediculously&quot; easy task as distract a dragon for a while.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Hmm, well most of the oldbies I know do not account lag as a factor of skill or lack of skill...  It speaks volumes that you would...  I account it to your frustration of not being able to make a point. (and basically making mine for me)<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
I already stated that MB in PvP is overpowered. Most people would agree. As for all your other points, I think I have addressed those so that you can understand the mechanics of MB and even rangers. I am not sure what extra range you are talking about or what why I oppose it, the only thing I oppose is the spread of fallacies fueled by class envy.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
<br>
However, you support fallacies as long as they maintain your advantage?<br>
Lets list a summary...<br>
&quot;manaburn is short range&quot; - false its 200 range<br>
&quot;cannot just cast on a mob at max range&quot; - false you can as at least one other can support my findings... and indeed I was able to cast a 6.2 second spell without getting hit even WITH aggro last night.<br>
&quot;ranger AM/EQ is just as easy&quot; - false on many points including ease of attaining, ease of organization (1-2-3-click), ease of and even just plain TIME (6 seconds).<br>
<br>

<br>
It occured to me that you have probably never MB'd a mob. This would explain a lot of the differences in out arguements, so let me fill you in on some basic rules we use to insure success. Dispute these all you want, but we came up with this after figuring out what went wrong on failed MB attempts.<br>
<br>
1. No one is allowed to use extended range or spell haste. These are an advantage so why not use them? Simple, unless everyone has both items, these will cause a wipe out. You see, what ends up happening is the person with both casts sooner and faster so the first MB will land over 2 seconds before the first MB. This is bad because it pulls agro off of the puller and causes the dragon to stop. As soon as the dragon stops, you get an AE - if the AE interupts even 1 MB, it's a failed attempt and there will more than likely be a TPW, or at least a few deaths.<br>
<br>
2. Always pull the dragon to the wizards (except Sont who is totally blind). We have tried to do as you have suggested and inched up to the dragon and cast without getting agro. In every single case we have tried this, the dragon has agro'd and killed people before MB goes off and we end up with a pissed off dragon in camp and a bunch of dead wizards.<br>
<br>
3. The puller can't be one of the wizards MBing. We always use a 5th to pull. Contrary to anything spdat says, a dragon will close what ever range MB is in actuality in less than the time it takes to cast it. You can get a mile ahead of the dragon, stop, spam the MB key until it casts, and the dragon will always get to you before MB gets to it.<br>
<br>
4. Always use an experienced MB puller. The reason the puller has to be experienced is that the dragon has to have the perfect approach or the attempt will fail. The puller can't get too far ahead -- as you found out -- or the dragon will warp on to you and wipe out the attempt. The puller has to pull very near perpendicular to the line of wizards or the attempt will fail. If the puller comes from an angle, some MBs will go off too soon and you end up with the same problem as using spell range/haste items, again failure and wipe out. Also, as someone else already mentioned, MB is a bit buggy when it comes casting it so z-axis and terrain tend to cause weird problems with MB being out of range even though the dragon is on top of you.<br>
<br>
5. Always pull the dragon passed the wizards. This is another one of the found out the hard way rules. The first few tries the puller would run right up to the wizards. This resulted in a pretty dismal success ratio. Why? Like I mentioned before, the dragon closes casting range faster than you can cast MB. As soon as the dragon gets in melee range of the puller, it stops and casts an AE. Again, 1 fear landing, or one interupted MB means the dragon wins.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that this is what we have learned from actual in game kills. Being a long time player, you know as well as I do that what seems logical when looking at the spdat and what theoretically should happen and what actually takes place in game are 2 different things. Maybe now you can see where I am basing my agruement and the points I am trying to make. I am speaking from experience, not from what should happen according to theory.<br>
<br>
What it all comes down to is that 32k dragons are obsolete content. They are trivial to small groups of high powered players be it a group of MB wizards, or some VT equipped melees. I think that the easiest change VI could make is to move the epic drops to triggered mobs like the Ragefire encounter. I would bet this would alleviate 95% of the problems caused by MB kills. <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial"><img src="http://www.bfdesigns.net/eq/wandor_sig.jpg"><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6102" target="_blank"><b>Moordian</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=353608" target="_blank"><b>Wandorfu</b></a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.exarch.net/"><b>Fusion of Flame</b></a></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uarlinastarbright.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arlina Starbright</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/18/02 12:16:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=138>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Alrighty... so any 60 would know... we agree then, and thus I would know if I had agroed... and did not while in range for a spell... you do realize this only proves my point right?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Another comment on this one. How do you know gore <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> wasn't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> aggroed on someone? You do know that the more distant a mob, the fewer updates you get on its position and activities.<br>
<br>
But suppose that you are right and it wasn't aggroed on anyone. Gorenaire is a cleric mob, which means he likes to cast spells. You could run up, cast a spell and run away all before her spell finishes casting.<br>

Gah, I have for the most part stayed out of this round of the MB arguement.  But I feel the need to comment here.<br>
<br>
In essence what I see you trying to say is, if you have 4 or 5 groups formed up with a druid as a member 24/7, you can beat out a single group of 6 wizards who all port in from anywhere in the world to respond to Gore spawning.<br>
<br>
Slight advantage, hog wash.  Coordinating 6 people who can port themselves to wherever they desire on a moment's notice is inherently faster than 24-30 people responding to the same event.<br>
<br>
Saying otherwise is ludicrous.  A completely specious arguement.

<br>
I guess that might work if all your friends are hardcore gamers as well as amazing friends who are ready and willing to drop everything the moment they hear Gore or Sev has popped and then come running.  All those friends would also have to be grouped with each other, all the time.<br>
<br>
If you have friends like that, who can move instanteously, are always together, are always in balanced groups, and are ready to port and fight at any time, that's great, chances are, you already have your scale because of this.<br>
<br>
It's not really fair that group of highly mobile casters can move and kill a dragon within just a few minutes and then make a killing by holding the epic pieces for another class hostage.  The basic fact of the matter is, MB wizards can do this with ease and near impunity.  Yeah, Rangers can do some amazing damage too, but they can't port themselves and there are a bunch of restrictions on ranged weapons.<br>
<br>
There are a bunch of epics that need fundamental changes in how they are set up.  Quillmane for Mages, Severilious for Warriors, to a lesser extent Gorenaire for Pallys and Bards (although Vox is a good alternate source for them), there's one or two for the Enchanter epic as well.  Long waits for spawns that may or may not drop your piece and that are likely to be ks'd.<br>
