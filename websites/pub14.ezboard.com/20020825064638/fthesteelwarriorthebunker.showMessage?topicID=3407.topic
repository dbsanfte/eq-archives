Our guild raids occasionally, but we often grab 1 or 2 groups and hit higher level zones for a few hours of fun.  Most of the time I split MT duties with a 60 Pali who's stacked with equipment.  Our groups also often consist of more than one monk who is 55+ (including one who is 58 and Epic equipped, with a T-Staff).  We're pretty stacked with Necros and Mages for extra damage support, and our clerics are top notch.  Seem to have a little problem at the moment with Wizzies, Chanters, Shamen, and Bards, though... <br><br>So, at the current rate, what do you guys suggest I start equipping for?  I consider myself a pretty damn good tank, and I think most of my guildies would agree with me.  But being a lower level (hehe, 53 is a lower level) often leads me to problems when fighting higher level mobs, especially when they aggro the poor cleric.  So leveling up is a must.  <br><br>But if I had to save up for one item to improve my tanking ability, what would you suggest?<br><br>Heugel Sabre'ur<br>53rd Level Half-Elven Champion<br>Tribunal of Norrath, Saryrn <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/upromethisironpetal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Promethis Ironpetal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 3:38:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3407.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmm...

Now what?</span><hr size=1> <br>You seem to have alot of pp out there. If I were you I'd look for Vah Shir Earring if you dont want to spend alot of pp. If you have more lying around, get 2 Spidefang Earrings (7ac 7agi 7dex 35hp). I dont really agree with having a Fierce Heraldic bp since there are velious quest bps out there, I just think you could probably sell it and get a MQ of thurg at the very least. You need a new belt and someone above stated about the RBG, a very good choice there. That frees up your hand slot and you can get cobalt to go there, or even start working towards Champions via MQ or Kael raids. If you still have more pp, get a fierce heraldic visor. I picked up one of those the other day and I really like it. Same with shoulders, if you only want to spend like 100pp, get a Tattered Mantle. 12 ac and some hp on it with some slight resists. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39617">Magilum's Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uheugel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heugel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/02 8:25:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3407.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Just a brief summary... </span><hr size=1> Thanks for the replies Prom and Mag... <br><br>To be honest, I'm actually just like pretty much every other low-50 warrior out there in that I'm not rich at all.  Before I started gathering the Blue Diamonds needed for this armor, I literally had to spend a week selling off all of my extra equipment just to raise the 20K needed for what I thought would be enough BD's just for the BP and the Leggings.  I borrowed about another 10K from a friend for supplies and tools to build my tradeskills up to where they needed to be, and I did all of the grunt work myself (including making the Infused HQ Rings).  The only alts that I have are a level 13 rogue who now patrols the bazaar for me, and a level 2 human warrior who is my blacksmithing character (skill 181, Whoot!).  Heugel, who is my main, did all of the pottery and brewing necessary, as well as the item hunting.  <br><br>Since I'm not in one of the &quot;Big 4&quot; guilds on my server who are wiping out NToV and the higher level Luclin zones, I had to face the reality that I either needed to do something quick about my equipment situation, or fall into another stagnant funk like I have so many times in the past.  After weighing the options and prices between MQ'ing for Velious armor or buying Cobalt, I decided that the only way that I would be able to put my armor situation behind me for a while and concentrate on playing the game would be to go with the Fierce Heraldic (first time picking a deity ever helped me, since I'm on Coldain/CoV faction).  It was a risky situation, because I was leaving myself without anything to fall back on if I couldn't succeed in getting it, but it was something that I just had to try.  <br><br>When it finally came down to the moment of truth, I contacted a number of higher-skilled Human Blacksmiths on the server for the final combine.  Things started to look grim, however, when they all started telling me that they simply didn't want to take the chance at failing, considering all the work I'd put into making and collecting the final components.  When all else seemed lost, one kind smithy pointed me to Sinaw, who is by far the best Human Blacksmith on the server.  <br><br>I won't go too much into detail about the final deal that Sinaw and I made, but I will say that my gratitude for his hard work and my appreciation for the time and effort he's spent perfecting his craft restrict me from making any deals with this fine armor that he's created for me.  I've already had several offers, but I won't break my word to him.  <br><br>So, with that being said, I'd still like to hear any input as to my initial question... what to upgrade???  I'm gonna throw a price cap of 40K on for now, just for reality sake.  <br><br>Heugel Sabre'ur<br>53rd Level Half-Elven Champion<br>Tribunal of Norrath, Saryrn <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uconqueringgrr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>conquering GRR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/02 5:17:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3407.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqfaces.com/photos/conqpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just a brief summary... </span><hr size=1> The vah shir claw is the most overpriced earing ever (5k on druzzil ro).

I do use one my self for the dex though, but I didnt pay 5k for it heh, I looted it.<br><br>Your shoulder slot could be nicely upgraded with some Imbued Granite Spauldors 20ac 10sv all. Those sell for about 8-10k on druzzil ro.   Or some more cultural shoulders.   Haste is always nice, but anything that would be a upgrade...RBG or RBB is gonna use all your 40k or at least half of that for the RBG.   <br><br>I'd look to upgrading your gorganga club as well.  Its a shame to use the frosty in offhand at your level, as your duel wield isnt super effective yet.  Maybe one of those fungasbeast hammers to go in offhand 10/21 with 2 dis dmg.  They sell pretty cheap around 800-1k on Druzzil ro.  Anyway thats my advice.
