I was just a few days ago even that we went into the depths of that sarnak infested hellhole. Some folks were in need of the treasures that lie within to help them along their quests. With a lizard to lead the way and myself in charge of the attack, we took this group of younger adventurers down. We tore through those abominations pretty fast.<br><br>Well that prince might as well have been a princess with the way he hit *snerk*. His father, the Overking wasn't much more of a challenge as he fell to our blades.<br><br>I see some of you know what's next.<br><br>While the queen isn't as formidable an opponent as she once was, a good portion of these adventurers was still wet bind the ears. Hah! Two of them even fell into the pit in front of the king! We work our way to the Queen's chambers. She and three of her servants are all that's standing between us and that epic blade for the other Warlord with us. The lizard calls out the signal to strike and I lead the way in.<br><br>This is where all hell breaks loose! The flames of the queen and the her three servants tear our ranks apart! The cleric with my party even had to burn both of his divine shields. When the queen herself finally falls, it's me, him and the three servants left!<br><br>*Wych asides, &quot;Well, and a druid, but we won't count him.&quot;*<br><br>Well, now time comes to save this from becoming a total disaster! I get my trusted old blades back out after tossing aside my big axe and set to work! After managing to rescue the cleric and he rescuing me we set to work on those scaled beasts. In the end we were standing and they weren't in a fight that seemed to go on forever!<br><br>It's the fights like this that make me certain I earned that title of Warlord!<br><br>*Wych slams her empty mug on the table*<br><br>Who's next!<br> <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=91801">Wychway Darkmink</a><BR>Inky Warlord, Bristlebane<BR><br>Facts:<br>1.

And the guild said I could. In about March 2002 aprox the 15th I was running through dl and when i got to a tunnel and wham major lag spike. Knowing gore was up I knew there was a raid and I did a who 60 surpirsingly 24 60's from Clan of Shadows where here.So I asked them whos the leader of this and then asked the leader if I can help and he said sure theres a non CoS group ask &lt;forgot his name&gt; So I joined the group got buffed but only hp and ac buffs. The first time the ma took charge he called attack and wham feared (forgot to use my disciplines) next thing I know I'm in Arena w/ out armor. So I get rezz round 2 time we had her down to 5% the last surviver said. SO I got a rezz we got rdy and this time i decided to wait to 50% so I did and w00t we easily killed gore w/ 2 deaths. We mana drained her that time so it was easier. Of course I didn't get to loot anything cuz I was just helping but thats the first time I helped kill a dragon and have been sucessful. And it was gore. Of course she got back and corpse camped me and I had 3 death BWC. Gore dropped white scale the pally and bard book but no rbb. <p><b><center><font face="bookman old style" SIZE = 2><font color="blue"></br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=92644>Dobbo Slaysalot</a></br> 51 Halfling Champion</br> <a href=http://www.avidgamers.com/KindredSpirits>Kindred Spirits</a></br> <a href=http://www.tmlog.com>Tarew Marr League of Guilds</a></br> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utalicmoore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talic Moore</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/images/icons/Yin_Yang.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hero of the Realms</BR>Guardian of the Keep</BR>STEEL WARRIOR Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1027<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 3:37:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=970.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   *sighs*</span><hr size=1> The most memorable moment in my Everquest career...<br><br>Everyone here, at least some of the older people, can probably guess.

We were helping a pretty wood elf friend of mine with getting the kromiff military leggings. We were passing time waiting for the broodmother to pop by clearing the crystaline wurms when I got tired of hearing all his comments about how great a tank he was. I challenged him to a contest, him main tanking one, then I would. He agreed and attacked the next wurm. He did just fine with only a druid healing and ended up at half life since he was healing himself after fights to save our healers mana. <br>Then it was my turn! I stepped up to the face of this gigantic beast and landed a crushing blow to get its attantion. I activated my stonestance disc immeadiatly and went to work! I was dodging left and right, blocking the fearsome claws of this fell beast, all the while crushing its shining scales with my magical staff and knuckleduster! My stone stance disc dropped and then the war was truly on! I took a few nasty slices from the fell creatures sharp claws and a blast of its freezing breath but I perservered and used my personal ability to mend my wounds, healing myself back to full life. This enraged the dire creature and it started to swing in a wild frenzy, many of its hits missing, but some connecting for nasty wounds in my leather clad frame. I heard the words of the beautiful elf calling out in a plea to Tunare to heal my wounds and I knew that if I wished to be victorious over the paladin I would have to finish this! <br>I attacked with new energy and according to onlookers my weapons were only seen as blurs as they struck again and again, snapping the creatures head from side to side with the power of the blows! The creature knew true fear then and started to run, sealing its fate, for the lovely elven druid had called upon the ensnaring weeds to slow its movements and its exposed back was a perfect target for my staff. I leaped up onto its back, nimbly running along its tail and spine until I reached its neck. Then I took one single tremendous swing and smashed the creatures spine. It gave out a horrible cry andtook one last feeble swing before falling to the ground with a thunderous crash!<br>The honorable paladin walked up to me and bowed his head. He had taken 3 of the druids healing spells and ended up at half his life. I had only take a single heal from the druid and had ended the fight at 3/4ths life remaining. Now this 57 paladin has learned the TRUE power of the monk. Even one who is 6 levels below him.<br><br>Traab &quot;Love Machine&quot; Fellhammer<br>Human Mob Compactor of the 51st Cycle<br>And Almost Too Sexy To Live!<br><br>&quot;Not bad for someone with nearly 1khp less than the paladin huh?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wychway>Wychway</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 10:40:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=970.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *sighs*</span><hr size=1> *psst - I'm not a him* <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=91801">Wychway Darkmink</a><BR>Inky Warlord, Bristlebane<BR><br>Facts:<br>1.

Cynical as I was, Schawkta convinced me to head towards Felwithe, the place we thought most likely to catch a glimpse of the elven princess.<br><br>When we arrived, she was there, but surrounded by a group of adventurers. Schawkta and I scoffed at the swarm, and stayed a ways off. At last, Firiona revealed her intentions, saying that she needed to speak with Equestrielle in Lesser Faydark. Schawkta and I, as well as a good portion of the crowd, departed for Lesser Faydark.<br><br>In Lesser Faydark, we met with the sparkling unicorn. Schawkta believes that it is here that Firiona came to notice me, as I volunteered my services, discreetly, to both Firiona and Equestrielle, giving advice when I felt it was needed, and remaining quiet when it was not. After a while, Firiona deemed it time to return to her father's palace.<br><br>The large group accompanied her to the palace, where we met with General Veredith, and King Tearis Thex. The princess spoke with her father of her capture, and return, and her meeting with Equestrielle. It was then that King Thex spoke, to Veredith, and said that his failure was too much to forgive. He removed Veredith from service. Seeing the king's foolery, I stood, and spoke in Veredith's defense. I had been at Bloody Kithicor, some here have heard that story, and had helped Veredith on several occasions. The king was stubborn, however, and remained on his chosen eye. Nevertheless, Firiona and Veredith were grateful for my assistance, kind words, and sound advice, and when the King deemed it time to reward those who had helped Firiona, I was called forth, and named a member of the Realm of Heroes. It was then, that I was given my ring.<br><br>That is the story of how I came to own my ring, and how I came to have the title you all see now.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udumeshuhlbelk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dumesh UhlBelk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 2:31:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=970.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/w/i/wilsonua/DumStare.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shining moments</span><hr size=1> *raises glass in salute and nods at Wych*<br><br>Ahh brothers and sisters, not yet a week has gone by since I encountered such a horror to chill the bones of many an adventurer.  I had just awoken from camp in the great city of Kael Drakkel when I heard the distant rallying call of my clan.  &quot;To Battle!&quot; they called from on high.  A foul robed fiend had been located on the moon and we took it upon ourselves to lay him low.  My brothers and sisters were already assembling and nearly ready to press home the attack.  Nevertheless, I journeyed through the magical portal and ran to deliver justice upon this foul creature.<br><br>Still I heard the distant cries of my clan.  My brothers were falling.  Mighty Spaggs had been slain.  Brother Aegypti too.  Tribunal give me speed.  I arrived on the battlefield perhaps too late.  Only a handful of my clan still resisted the beast.  Bodies littered the field.  I flew at the beast with wicked swipes of my mighty axe, but I could not draw it away from my brothers.  It was so consumed with bloodlust that it continued slaying the injured and dying while I was raining blows upon its back.  <br><br>Doomshade it called itself as it turned its anger on me.  Finally, I had aroused its attention.  My hefty axe taking its already considerable wounds and opening them further.  Guvil, the monk and I carried the fight on to the bitter end.  I was protected only by the shield of the eighth, but that was enough.  Doomshades continuous flurries of blows were taking their toll.  I was near death, but still I swung on, my face twisted into a furious rage.  The souls of my clan cheered me on, bidding me to endure.  With barely enough will remaining, I took one last blow from its robed arm.
