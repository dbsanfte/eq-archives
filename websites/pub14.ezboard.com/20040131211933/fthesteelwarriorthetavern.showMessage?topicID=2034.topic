<br>
Quote: <br>
I tried to take notes at the EQ panel discussions, here's what was covered: <br>
<br>
The upcoming patch: <br>
<br>
Tuesday's patch will include an entirely new aggro system. In theory it's exactly the same as the old system, but without the 60-person cap on the aggro list. No one will ever be bumped off the aggro list no matter how many people are in the raid. This is not the archery fix, that won't come for a few more weeks. <br>
The mitigation change for monks will finally be rolled back a bit on Tuesday... someone finally realized it was too much. <br>
Some new debugging information on test has allowed them to find and fix some crash-to-desktop bugs, and several of those fixes will be in the patch, but they're still finding more all the time. They seemed surprised that so many of us were crashing to desktop, they didn't know how big a problem it had become. <br>
Charming will be more dangerous after Tuesday's patch. They especially don't like charmed mobs being used as tanks on raids, but they don't like some of the high-end soloing that's happening either. <br>
<br>
Things that won't change: <br>
<br>
EQIM being buggy: nobody on the live team works on that software, it's not their problem. <br>
A question about upgrading the warrior epic was treated as a general item degradation question. They're aware that older items and quests are less worthwhile, but it's impractical to go back and change all that old content. There was no hint whatsoever that they'd treat epic weapons as a special case, so don't expect any upgrades. <br>
Brilliance of Ro does reduce fizzles, but you're usually at the fizzle-rate cap anyway with most spells, so that's why you usualy don't notice a difference. <br>
The druid bear pet was never meant to be anything more than a toy. <br>
They won't adjust spawn times so west-coast guilds have an equal shot at mobs. The 'persistent spawn' system will help some, since patches won't reset the spawns, but people on the east coast will always log in before people on the west coast, and there's nothing they can do about that. <br>
Tracking for beastlords: they never really thought about it, and don't think they need it. <br>
Dire charm for bards: no. <br>
Level 64 bard charm: they think it's good enough as is. <br>
Cockblocking: they're well aware of it, don't like it, will avoid designing those types of encounters in the future. But they showed no interest at all in doing anything about it in existing PoP zones. <br>
Con system: they realize that a 'blue' mob might be trivial for some characters, and very difficult for others. Also there's the issue that an even con at level 10 much easier than an even con at level 40. In principle they'd like a more informative con system, but don't think it's feasible. <br>
More character info on the web page: no plans for anything like that. <br>
Monk pulling ability: they think it's fine, even in the elemental planes. It's fine that other classes are better pullers in certain situations, monks still do ok. <br>
Melee AAs: They believe they're balanced vs. caster AAs, not going to make any changes. <br>
Arrows: They can't make arrows give a message when they hit terrain. Arrows are not spells, and can't be made to work like spells. <br>
/consent group or /consent raid: Good idea but it's too hard to change the way consent works now. They'll eventually be able to, but for now it will stay the same and the 8-person consent cap will remain. <br>
Ducking on horses: Inability to interrupt spells and difficulty targeting are both intentional. Won't change. <br>
Monk throwing item range: there are already enough long-range throwing items for monks. (but see note below about summonable throwing items) <br>
Wizard's Al'Kabor spells being underpowered: They've seen this issue quite a bit on message boards, but never looked into it. They know, but just don't care. <br>
Stacking issues with Beastlord buffs: it's intentional, they won't change. <br>
Pointy hats for wizards: it's too hard. It might take as many as 33 new hat models added to the global file to do it. <br>
Line-of-sight: It's a very simple system, measuring center-of-sphere to center-of-sphere. They realize it's not a perfect system, but there is no disadvantage for short races as compared to tall races. <br>
PoP flags: PoP was specifically designed so that only high-end guilds could get into the higher tiers. There will be no alternate means of entry to elemental planes, such as through quests. There's a second reason too. The loot in elemental planes is so good it's considered the reward for getting there. ie instead of putting good loot on Rallos Zek as a reward for killing him, they put good loot in the elemental planes as a reward for killing Rallos Zek. They'd have to tune it down if there were other means of getting into those planes. <br>
<br>
Things that will change: <br>
<br>
There will be more information about procs and potion effects in the inspect window. But it'll probably just say 'raises strength and dex', not specific numbers like '+10 str +5 dex'. <br>
They know that warriors need better taunt. They're thinking up ways to improve it. I couldn't tell whether they were going to improve the function of the taunt button or add new skills/AAs/whatever to help. Adding more weapons with high-aggro procs might be part of the solution, but they're going to fix warrior abilities too. <br>
Archery in PvP: it will get the 66% damage adjustment, just like spell damage. Also no ability will be able to do more than 75% of a player's hp in damage in a single hit. Also archers will be more likely to miss if they fire while moving instead of standing still. And maybe more minor nerfs to it as well. <br>
Plane of Earth B: they're retuning it. <br>
Level 65 necro pet: yes they're going to tune it. <br>
Firiona Vie server: they'll probably add a way for good races to summon corpses. <br>
Necro/SK spells: They already doubled the drop rate of some spell quest items, after realizing that necros and SKs both need them. <br>
There will be more ways for monks to summon throwing weapons. <br>
<br>
Things that might change: <br>
<br>
They're considering the possibility of characters changing deities. They decided against a one-time opportunity to change deity because some groups (such as frogloks and iksars and evil erudites) have only one deity choice, and those players might whine about everyone else getting something while they don't. Really. I didn't make this up. <br>
They realize that bards are tied to their epic, and will consider adding more useful high-end bard instruments. <br>
They realize that the bazaar search function needs upgrading, since there are new item types and new item effects in the game that didn't exist a year ago. <br>
MGB shrink was mentioned, or at least the ability to shrink someone not in your group. They'll think about it, but it's difficult to add a confirmation box to shrink (or any other spell that doesn't add an icon to your buff list). <br>
Gaps and overlaps in cultural armors, especially BD armors: they know all about it, it's being looked at. <br>
Making more targeted summons for mages (so the item appears in the target's hand instead of the mage's hand): They like the idea, as long as there's a toggle to turn it off, since some people don't like to receive items. <br>
PoP xp modifier: They consider PoP zones quite a bit more difficult than other zones and the big xp modifier was intentional. They'll look at it, since they may have overbalanced it a bit, but it probably won't change much. <br>
Showing total mana numbers: They'll consider this again, and no longer object on principle. But it's still unlikely, since players might notice more bugs if they had this info. <br>
They'll consider adding a concussion spell (or similar aggro-reducer) for mages, but they're not sure it's needed. <br>
Cap on +mana buffs: The cap is intentional. They might raise it a little, but not much. They do think that we should have some way of knowing what the cap is so we can choose what buffs to use. <br>
Trolls take back grobb: They wouldn't discuss it, apparently because they have plans for something along these lines. Verrry interesting. <br>
5% failure rate on very trivial combines: they will look into changing it, but no specific promises. <br>
Bard's 'fleet of foot' AA: They agree it may be a little underpowered. They don't seem to care, but by the same token they don't care if it's improved. So maybe it'll get changed. <br>
Level 65 hybrid buffs: they agree the stacking order isn't right, they'll try to fix these again so they don't overwrite better buffs. <br>
Stats on clockwork talisman and Secret of the Planes: they'll review, see if the stats need to be improved. <br>
Beastlords getting Mass Group Buff: maybe. <br>
<br>
Things they learned: <br>
<br>
1H vs 2H: The discrepancy between dual-wielding and two-handed damage is something they're somewhat aware of, but they only vaguely understand it. They're willing to admit they may have raised two-hander damage more than intended, but don't sound convinced. BTW raw data comparisons, such as parses of in-game battles showing DPS, is something they really like to see and is very useful to them. <br>
CTD: They didn't realize that crash-to-desktop was such a big problem. The first time the question was asked they actually thought it was about going linkdead, or about server problems. The second time the question came up they asked for a show of hands of who was having problems with the client crashing recently... then they got it. <br>
Packs of level 9s ganking level 10-13 characters for items on Rallos Zek: Now that they know about it they'd like to fix this issue. Won't just raise or lower the level when corpses appear though, as that wouldn't change anything but the level of the characters doing it. <br>
+mana on food items not working: they'll check if it's a bug. <br>
Dwarven smithing: they didn't realize that two types of armor had the same name. Should fix it. <br>
Affliction Efficiency 4 doesn't work for cleric undead dots: it should. <br>
Reagent Conservation 4 items not available: they should be, they'll check into it. <br>
<br>
Additional notes: <br>
Now that PoP is keeping the big guilds busy with guild-size boss mobs, they're concentrating on developing more content for one or two groups, and dungeon crawls where a small group can fight through from beginning to end.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168211" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.imahosting.com/sigs/baadsignew.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:medium;">{54 Champion} <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168211" target="top">Baadan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> (Half Elf) &lt;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/bdragonmawguild" target="top">Dragon Maw</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&gt;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->{45 Necromancer} <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=115139" target="top">Azumaan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> (Erudite) &lt;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/bdragonmawguild" target="top">Dragon Maw</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&gt; </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slagfestbloodsoul>Slagfest Bloodsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/31/03 9:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2034.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Good FanFaire Info</span><hr size=1> FV server cant summon corpses??...dang!<br>
