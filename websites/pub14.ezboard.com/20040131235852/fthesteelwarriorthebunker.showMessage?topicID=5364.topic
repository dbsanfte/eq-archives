               I did a lot of research on weapons and am currently useing a Wurrmy in primary and a Lammy secondary. Is this a good combo and how long will it be good for?<br>
              I have seen alot of posts saying to keep all your weapons skills up. How the heck can you do that? I have my 1 hd slashing up and have been trying to keep my two hand slash up but I hardly ever hit with two hand and feel like I am not contributing to the group. And although I feel like i do a good amount of damge with Dual wield I still miss alot(why is that) How could I possibly keep others up (IE pierce and two hand)<br>
             I also wanted to ask about aggro. it seems in our group in Paludal that our cleric is always getting aggro and dieing. I use taunt and it does not seem to work well. I just got the Lamentation does that help you hold aggro and what else can I do to keep the cleric alive.<br>
            As you can see I am struggling with my Warrior and any help is appreciated. I hear people say Warrior is an easy char to play. It may be, but it is a hard char. to play effectively.<br>

First to address the skilling up issue:  XP's are too good in paludal.  You level so damned fast that your skills tend to lag behind.  Also, in the low to mid levels it's tough to max more than a couple of skills anyway.  Don't sweat it much.  When you hit 40 you stop skilling up and have ten levels or so to switch your weapon combos around to work on the weapon skills you havent been using.<br>
I'll try to address aggro and DPS together.  We are not a DPS class (although some may argue that once we get all the offensive AA's we hold our own DPS wise). If you're not doing massive damage dont worry about it, just get and keep aggro.  Until you get to the level to get gear with nasty aggro procs, use the fastest weapons possible, and get some with procs that will actually activate at your level if you can.  (I remember vividly dual wielding dmg 3 dly 20 gnoll hide lariats at level 32 in crypt of dalnir.  The stun proc ruled at keeping aggro and interrupting all the @#!*@! casters in there).  Also, save taunt for when you need it, dont just mash the button every time it recycles.  Proximity is important, stand as close as you can to the mob you're fighting. Also, if you're fighting multiple mobs at once, have either the cleric or another class that can cast root root/park the extras off to the side (or if you're just fighting one, rooting it will guarantee that as long as the healers dont get close to it you'll keep aggro.)  Bottom line, managing aggro isnt just your job, it's your groups job.   I was dual wielding langseaxes and the best 2h weapon I had was a bronze 2h axe when I was lvl 20 (started in dec 1999), so I'd say you're ok gearwise, you just need to learn all the little tricks and nuances of aggro control.<br>

<br>
The Wurmslayer is not a great weapon for keeping agro because of the high delay of 40. Beornegar gave lots of good tricks to help you overcome that, but sometimes the slowness of the Wurmmy will be too  much to overcome. If you're in a full group you could bag the Wurmmy and go with a faster weapon, and use the Wurmmy when you're duoing or in a smaller group where your damage will be the main source of damage for the group. Lots of the folks at your level may not know about things like proximity agro, and that they can help you maintain agro. While you're standing on the Mob's feet and swinging at it, they should try and position themselves at the max distance from the mob and still be able to hit it. The Lammy is a good fast weapon to use for taunt at your level, but it has to be in your main hand to be effective I think, which it isn't now because the Wurmmy is primary only.<br>
<br>
As far as how long will those last you...The Wurmmy, for all it's agro issues is the most damaging one hand weapon you can wield until your low 40s. At that time, the damage bonus added to all hits with your main-hand weapon will start to make the damage output of a fast primary weapon superior to the slower Wurmmy<br>
<br>
There could be all kinds of reasons the Cleric is dying. Are they healing you as you come back into camp after pulling? Are you fighting more than one mob at once? If so, you may have agro on the one you're hitting, but the others you really don't have signifigant agro on their hate list, so then the Cleric heals you, he jumps to the top of the hate list of the second and third mobs hitting you. He could be sitting as soon as he heals you within agro range, drawing the mob to them with sit agro. If the Cleric is running around once the mob is hitting him, then that's making it extremey difficult for you to be in range to taunt it off them. Don't mash the taunt button non-stop. Once you have agro, hitting taunt is wasted, it adds no more hate to the mob's hate list, and then if someone else does get agro, you have to wait for the button to recycle again before taunting<br>
<br>
Also, as Beornegar said, you level way to fast to keep all skills up. I was lucky and leveled from 24-45ish with basically the same group. One hand slash, dual wield and double attack were the easiest to keep maxed once they caught up to my level. I think that was around 25, 2 levels after leaving Paludal for Highkeep Goblins. Then once I had them maxed for level, depending on if the group had enough damage output, I'd switch out to a two hander if we were having no trouble at all, or at least put a blunt weapon in my off-hand. At lvl 40 your skills will cap at 200, and not rise again until you ding 51. In that time I took one hand blunt from 78 to 200, two hand slash from 57 to 200, two hand blunt from 0 to 133 and piercing from 0 to 116, and even managed to get bash to 199 by ghetto-bashing and kick maxed at 175. Most people can max all their skills during that time, but I spent a lot of it duoing with a Cleric, so I picked which I would concentrate on and keep decent damage-dealing ability<br>
<br>
About missing....With my skills maxed I still seem to miss about 30-40 percent of the time. That will get better with levels and weapon skills, and also I think, but could be wrong, with buffs that will directly raise attack that become available at higher levels.<br>
<br>
Wish I could tell you there is a magic level when all the issues of agro are resolved, but it is a lifelong battle for Warriors as the game stands now. Even with that though, there is an incredible feeling of satisfaction when you do put all the pieces together and stand as the solid bulwark between pissed_off_MOB_01 and the soft underbelly of your group's casters and the game flows smoothly. Good luck on your journey <p><img name="Sig5" src="http://users.conwaycorp.net/vanessa/Sig5.jpg" width="400" height="188" border="0" usemap="#m_Sig5">
