Mobs continue to die on a daily basis so I don't think this &quot;problem&quot; is as bad as warriors want us all to believe.  Some warriors think just because they are warriors that they should be able to fart in the wind and have all the agro they want regardless of whether or not they spent the proper amount of time getting the needed gear and AA's.  <br>
<br>
You expect us to believe that one of the 10 or 12 lvl 63+ sk's on your entire server is taking all your spots in exp groups?  There are so few of us that the other day I was totally shocked to see a lvl 65 sk that I had never seen before until I was told he was a cross server app to Afterlife.  The point is, if every single lvl 63+ sk on the entire server was in an exp group in PoP at the same time, there would still be groups without one.  God forbid if they finally gave us a small niche that we are able to use to get into exp groups and gain some levels.  <br>
<br>
The bottom line is, warriors have always been, are now, and always will be more needed than hybrids.  When you hear your guild leader tell the guild that you can't raid tonight because you don't have enough sk's online to raid, then you can start to bitch.  Until then just STFU. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51387" target="top">Sir Cragnor Soulcutter - Ogre - Dread Lord &lt;  &gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neolithicangel>NeolithicAngel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~molzdavis/vanskull2_ani.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/15/03 11:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1882.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~molzdavis/vanskull2_ani.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /yawn</span><hr size=1> /cheer Cragnor<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://loomis.urx.com/loomis/aphyonsig.jpg  " style="height:200;width:425;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->  </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soluis>Soluis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/15/03 11:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1882.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /yawn</span><hr size=1> knights = sk's PLUS paladins<br>

<br>
1-knights meant both pally and sk, I just didn't say hybrids, because that would have meant also rangers, beastlords, and bards (sorry to have been too lazy to say pally/sk).<br>
<br>
2- The only class in my entire EQ career that has made or broke a raid, was cleric. I've raided a lot, and never saw a raid call it quit because we didn't have any other class but cleric. <br>
<br>
3- I've been quoted on &quot;they don't out tank us, they don't out damage us, they out aggro us a lot&quot; or something to that effect.<br>
<br>
As far as I've seen, paly/sk have extremely close dmg to warriors, their tanking ability is to my estimate nearly equal, enuff to be indistinguishable from a warriors (unless you are defensive, which doesn't apply as far as I am concerned since defensive is not a exp orriented disc).<br>
<br>
4- the whole damn point of my post wasn't about what to do if your grouped with a paly/sk, because if you are, just let them tank, and keep aggro since you will never be able to hold it as good as they can.<br>
<br>
For those morons who think they are so great because they had a knight in their group, and he died. well you brainless excuse of a uni-cellular life-form, wake up, and realise the healer was a moron, or simply had you targeted expecting you to take aggro any minute (and we know that would never happen, unless the knight dies).<br>
<br>
<br>
5- the gap between a 65 level warrior, and a level 65 knight is around 550hp thats with equal aa, and sta.<br>
<br>
One of the greatest flaw in everquest is the fact item are being made available to the knights that enables them to come extremely close to our hp, without any advantage going to the warrior<br>
<br>
Naked you have 384hp more then a knight as a warrior. thats 2878 base for me naked, and 2494 base naked for you (I made a fake level 65 ogre warrior with the same hp AA).<br>
<br>
Right off the bat, the sk is at 86.6% of my hp. from this point on, with equal equipment the gap can only go lower. a top end paladin with the same gear as me, say me at 6500hp unbuffed, and him at 6100hp unbuffed is at 93.8% of my hp.<br>
Even looking at planar class only armor, the ratio is still hugely in favor of knights, our bracer has 145hp, yours has 135, plus 130 mana. So 93% of our hp, and 130 mana. If your 25% caster, does that means theres bracer out there for caster with 400+ mana?<br>
<br>
I can't blame knights for the bad items... I can't blame them for having amazing aggro, and the utility to even further make them wanted. <br>
<br>
All I am saying in a nuttshell, is that as a warrior I am sad to <br>
see how the game makes us look bad compared to knights.<br>
<br>
To put it in other words, you should be destroyers, and we should be Battleship. Unfortunately, you are now aircraft carriers, and we all know what happened to battleships when aircraft carriers entered the war... <p>Overlord of the brell server<br>

Kur,<br>
<br>
I have 2616HP nakid as a level 65 troll SK with no starter points into STA, no AAXP points into STA,(114STA) and ND3, PE. (no Planar Dur)  Either your source is faulty or you haven't done any work at all...<br>
<br>
Please compare real characters against real characters...  (and if you are going to try understanding spells, use LUCY and not castersrealm please) most warriors with comparable gear and AAXP in the high end have 1000 to 1500 more HP than comparable Knights.<br>
<br>
Drop the whole 75% 25% thing....  if that was true a 65th level would be a 48th level warrior and a 17th level necro....  and be 100% worthless fighting 65th level mobs.<br>
<br>
Most of the warriors on this thread have made it very clear that they know about as much about Shadowknight lore as they do the mob hate lists...<br>
<br>
The sheer amount of exaggeration makes the valid points that do exist look like they are ALL lies...<br>
Those of you who know something are being overrun by noobies who are obviously showing everyone who isnt a noobie that they don't know a friggin thing about class balance or any other class.... especially the knights.<br>
<br>
Do some reading please before you make yourself look any more undereducated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warriors DO absorb damage better period...  1000more HP, higher AC and defensive skill caps, and more reliable consistent damage.<br>
<br>
Knights TAUNT better period...  our spells and melee taunt skills actually congealed into something we are superior than warriors at and WE SHOULD BE.  Knights represent radical alignments and ideals!  Add on top of the fact that if we didn't have some advantage over a warrior, there would be no point to a knight. (like it has been since they gave warriors spells in kunark)<br>
<br>
If you don't care about how the past has been, then you are not only a noobie, but a clueless one at that.<br>
<br>
That being said, warriors and knights should be interchangeable, and they aren't right now due to some inherent issues.<br>
<br>
Warriors have no method to add numeric hate that they can control... as masters of technique and skill, they should have some skill that generates aggro on demand. (but not be as powerful as knights' spells in degree)<br>
Warriors could use an innate boost in the Hate generation department... (maybe add {lvl} in hate to each kick)<br>
<br>
At the same time Knights could use a short term discipline that allows them to prevent spike damage.  Being a plate class meant to stand mobs up, Knights should be able to have a shining moment every so often!<br>
(add auto-parry or riposte to the first 10 seconds of their 60th disciplines)<br>
<br>
<br>
I also fully support melee having perma-disciplines that are turned off and on....  the example of the aggression &quot;slider&quot; sound cool to me and many other classes.<br>
<br>
<br>
End the exaggeration and the endless whining and lies please.<br>

I could have compared a dark elf warrior to a sk ogre, or a sk dark elf to a warrior ogre, but for the sake of being fair I compare two close as possible things.<br>

To be honest, your hp are off by a small margin totally due to stamina, and we both know how stamina is easy to max at the high end.<br>

BTW, I do play a 61 sk, I am perfectly aquainted with paladin as I've also played a 65 one.<br>

you forget the only disc I ever use in groups, /disc Furious when I am at like 5% health and thats when the cleric realise its time to heal me, and he then starts his cheal.<br>
<br>
Aggressive used to be my favorite disc, 3 minutes of dealing 33% more dmg or so per hit, taking around 50% more dmg. Have you any idea how useless that is in pop?<br>
<br>
/shield is cute all of 12 seconds every 3 minutes because I can't hold aggro as good as a knight, the enchanter likes to see my /shield message.<br>

light of nife, healing wave of prexus, loh, feign death, the terris line, lifetap procs, slay undead, 2 hand bash, super ht (up to 9k crit), invis/itu and even naff little perks like holy/unholy steed ARE NOT useless abilities or some dinky little piece of crap trinket thrown at knights to stop them bitching.<br>
<br>
these abilities are AWESOME. they provide an immense amount of power if used correctly.<br>
<br>
a problem is knights tank 90% as well as tanks. they have 90% of our HP. AND they get these awesome abilities. our power in relation to knights is severely reduced.<br>
<br>
many of us do not think this is right. we want an increase in  our tanking ability and aggro seeing as this is our sole purpose. that is all we do. we don't want knights nerfed, we don't want any super abilities, we want our core function to be upgraded so we are on a similar scale of power to what we perceive the knights having.<br>
<br>
other tanks want some utility and toys to play with. this is also cool and a discussion for our class to have. but the main point is many of us are not happy where we are and want some fixes. the dual EB wielding 9k tanks in uber raiding guilds may be less annoyed than the rest but there is still a lot of resentment out there as to our role.<br>
<br>
why we have @#%$ knights coming here and begruding us trying to better our class and crying that they had it tough for so long now we should suffer because we are not gods anymore and refusing to concede that maybe there is a problem we would like addressed is totally beyond me.<br>

<br>
However, many of the warriors (IMO, I'll admit i'm biased, I'm not a warrior, but same can be said for anyone) are overzealous, or grossly exegerate Knight powers, or undervalue their own. So I usually post how they are overexererating this or that, or when they say something that is just plain wrong, that is regarding a Knight (Usually Paladins, but also SK's if I see it, really any class, but I am just more familar with knight issues)<br>
<br>
For example<br>
<br>
light of nife, healing wave of prexus, loh, feign death, the terris line, lifetap procs, slay undead, 2 hand bash, super ht (up to 9k crit), invis/itu and even naff little perks like holy/unholy steed ARE NOT useless abilities or some dinky little piece of crap trinket thrown at knights to stop them bitching.<br>
<br>
Combining two Class's for what advantages really beefs up your case.... In addition, many of them take AA, but whenever I point to warrior AA, I get &quot;Thats not an innate ability of the class, therefor it should not lend itself to the balance of the class&quot; Or someone pointing out how good Pal or SK lvl 65 spell is, (quite rare now) but EB weapons are not a viable counter example....<br>

<br>
Actually Maldrone my post was not targetted at you, since you don't appear to be one of the knights who just come here to taunt Warriors and be dicks.  You have something of value to add.  Even if we disagree.<br>
<br>
And all I have to say is this.  Given the HP advantage we are given, somewhere between 600-1200 depending on starting stats and other variables, all a Paladin need do is cast healing wave of perxus twice to negate it, or any number of other heals.  No they can't do it forever.  No it many times doesn't work in situations where they are taking a serious beating.  But it is something done in experience groups all the time.  For an experience group, in the short term, a Paladin has far more HP hidden in his mana bar than just what appears on his health bar.<br>
<br>
So while Paladins repeatedly point to defensive as this great game making ability, it's frankly almost useless for an experience group.  Certainly far far less useful then being able to pop off a group heal now and again.  Unless you have a team of clerics standing behind you firing off a CH cycle, usually by time you use defensive in an experience group, you're already in over your head or your cleric is being inattentive.<br>
<br>
And other than evasive all the other disciplines really are novelty toys.  You just don't use them much.  They don't last long, they have a long refresh time, and typically mean you take even more damage.  You may find a use for them from time to time, but even less frequenlty than a Paladin would use slay undead. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
Wonderful things likes taunting styles and whatnot would be great but the combat system of EQ won't support it.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, Eq has more and better content than any other mmropg. More carrots to chase and more goals to attain. Daoc had a vastly superior combat system. Never did my melees have to rely on procs or whatnot to hold aggro.<br>
<br>
Some suggested aa's i'd like to see are:<br>
<br>
Enraging blow type aa ability: could use say once every 50 sec to 2 mins. A one time hit that adds the same ammount of hate that a single proc of an eb weapon would give. This would still leave those weapons highly desired as it would give you more hate overall but this AA would give a warrior the chance to grab a significant amount of hate right off the bat at the beginning of a pull.<br>
<br>
AA ability to give us effects on our hits at random, such as for example similar to crits and crips:<br>
<br>
Hits that cause a bleeding effect like a dot ( call it Critical Strike)<br>
<br>
Hits that cripple a mob as in breaking bones etc.... ( Bonecrusher)<br>
<br>
Hits that stun a mob at random while generating an appropriate amount of hate.(Dazing Strike)<br>
<br>
Pre 60 in non pop zones these things are not needed.<br>
<br>
My suggestion is to either add these as post 60 aa abilities or make them skills gained from 61 to 65. These would be innate passive skills that would go off like berserk, crits, crips do now.<br>
<br>
An increase of 10% in dmg mitigation is called for too imho.<br>
<br>
I really do not care what a knight class can do, i don't care if they get nerfed or not. I want my class fixed. My suggestions would do alot for warriors without relying on items or making taunt a game breaking skill.<br>
