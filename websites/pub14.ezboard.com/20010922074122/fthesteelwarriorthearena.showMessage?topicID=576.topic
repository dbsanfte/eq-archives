As some of the mobs were yellow to me at the time, I decided that it would be a great oppertunity to test the value of attack vs yellow con mobs.  We even had a shaman in the group so I could also test to see if a str buff would help in hitting or hurting yellow con mobs.<br>
<br>
I have put the summary at the top of my work to prevent you from having to read all of the numbers in my case study.  I am sure this case study is not perfectly by the book, but as I only took 3 semesters of college, I will have to ask if you can bear with me.<br>
<br>
# =============================================================<br>
# Summary :<br>
This study was done to focus and address a number of questions.  After each of the questions I addressed during the study, I will present the results afterwords.<br>
<br>
This study was performed by having a control case study, were no stat buffs were on Hatrid, allowing for his base attack bonus to be logged.<br>
The second case study was where both the goblin skull and a strength spell (lvl 49 shaman spell) were applied to Hatrid.  <br>
The third case study was where the strength spell was not applied and just the goblin skull earring was used.<br>
<br>
1. Is there a difference to hit a yellow con mob when the attack value is increased? <br>
When facing yellow con mobs, there is no noticeable difference in an attack of a 918 and 998.<br>
The chances to hit the mob will vary up to 3% in between the tests, but this is easily attributed to just lucky (or unlucky) dice rolls in the case.  <br>
The chances to hit the mobs ranged from 52.1% up to 55.1%.  The reason why the variation on these numbers is due to chance is because the 55.1 percent hit rate was in the third case study where only the goblin skull earring was used.<br>
<br>
2. Is there a difference to hit a blue con mob when the attack value is increased? <br>
When facing blue con mobs, there was no noticeable difference in percentage chance to hit over the yellow con mobs.  There is no noticeable difference in the chances to hit a blue con mob given.  The chances vary in a 2.5% margin, and is not enough to be noticeable.<br>
<br>
3. Is there a noticeable difference in average damage (per swing) when fighting yellow vs blue con mobs?<br>
In each study case the amount of average damage varied no more than .8 amount of damage per hit.  This shows that there is no visiable difference in damage done to a yellow con or a blue con mob.<br>
<br>
4. Is there a noticeable difference in average damage (per swing) when having a str buff?<br>
When average damage is calculated, there is a slight increase in damage from the non strength buffed values.  This has also been described in many other research papers, and is expected.  This is because the max damage of a weapon has a direct corrolation on the strength of a user.  [((Weapon Skill + Strength)/100) * (DMG)) + (Level Damage Bonus)]<br>
In the largest variation, there is a 2.3 point difference in damage delt.  This is a 12.2% increase in damage from case one, and a 7.6% increase over case three.<br>
This is worth considering when applied to the 2248 swings done in the second case study, giving an average of 5170.4 more points of damage during that time.<br>
<br>
5. Is there a noticeable difference in average damage (per swing) when the goblin skull earring?<br>
There is an slight increase in damage output during that time, for a total of .6 more for each swing.  I am willing to attribue this to a random chance, but it does deserve future study.  <br>
<br>
6. Is there a noticeable value in the goblin skull earring?<br>
Currently there is no value shown in the grim aura that the goblin skull earring provides.  The extra buff looks good on your screen, and it can act as a buffer to your important buffs when you are having annul magic cast upon you.  (ie, standing in the middle of lake rathe in a duel and someone is attempting to remove your levitate buff)<br>
<br>
7. Is there a noticeable value in the lvl 49 shaman str buff?<br>
Yes.<br>
There definately appears to be a strong corrolation between an increased strength and a higher damage output per minute.<br>
<br>
# =============================================================<br>
# Problems with the case study :<br>
The main concern I have with this case study is the sample rate.  Any sample rate of less than 1000 I do not consider strong enough to be included in a case study.  I have included the percentages of the bash attempts as more of eye candy than a real value.<br>
<br>
The first case study I did only had 1573 attempts.  Given that there are only 3 values returned from an attack roll (his, miss, counter), you should be able to gather a fairly solid percentage from this sample rate.<br>
Nevertheless, I would perfer to have a case study that included a sample rate of over 5000.<br>
<br>

<br>
Tis confusin' ta many new Warriors when they see their ATK ratin' go up each time their STR goes up. Makes 'em think that sumhow their ability ta hit a foe successfully has increased, which simply ain't the case.<br>
<br>
ATK doesn't mean nuthin'. Not in any practical way. Tis simply a buncha numbers added together ta give ye an over-all idea o' yer combat prowess.<br>
<br>
From whut I've gathered, ye can only really depend on three things ta help ye hit yer foe:<br>
<br>
1) Yer level (versus yer foe's level)<br>
2) Offense ability<br>
3) Weapon Skill<br>
<br>
And ta decide the amount o' damage ye do, ye can only really depend on two things:<br>
<br>
1) Yer level (versus yer foe's level) -- ye'll hit fer max damage more often against a foe weaker than ye<br>
2) Yer STR<br>
<br>
Oh...one other thing. The higher yer CHARISMA, the better off ye are. <p><CENTER>

For parsing the logs, I use a perl script that I wrote.  I send the data to one of my UNIX boxes at work and then play with it all.<br>
<br>

<br>
This is a review of the the logs from Tuesday evening.  I was curious too see just how much more damage that specific classes could do more than others.  In this case, I knew that the monk would do the most damage, but the total amounts were rather unexpected.<br>
<br>
I was also a bit surprised to see that the rogue damage does not follow the same tables as the warrior and monk damage tables.  I was also surprised to see how the average kick damage table looks.<br>
<br>
Did anyone else notice that the none of the backstabs were countered?  I am sure this was done because your not supposed to be aware of backstabs, but that’s a cool advantage.  Furthermore, the rogue has very few pierces countered.<br>

<br>
The shadowknight i play has a lot of  unique spells, many of the shadowknights spells are self only debuff/buff spells.<br>
<br>
We get grim aura, wich adds roughly 13 to your ATK at laters lvs, useing one of our other spells 'shroud of hate' we can TAP ATK from our target, stacked with Grim Aura we end up with a nice instant ATK booste.<br>
(note: this is ATK, not STR realtaed ATK booste)<br>
<br>
If i use some STR taping spells, i can go through a small arsonal.<br>
Siphon STR (-10 from enemy, +10 to caster)<br>
Streal STR (proc from some shadowknight wepons -30 from enemy +30 to you)<br>
Or i can grab some of those coldain/giant beards that has 5 charges of Storm STR. When i do that my ATK is rather high, though i am raising it by two different means, one STR and one ATK. I think the shadowknights is a perfect testbed because they can do all this without bufferes there to test it.<br>
<br>
Useing my Mace and shield, i do a good average damage, average swing is from 50-60, (damage 19 mace) and my two hander averages on 60-80 average (damnge 33 sword)<br>
Mace max hits at around 74, when i cast Grim Aura and Shroud of Hate my average damage goes up noticable.. ie i get less 'low damage' swings, and by a lot i might add.. you isntantly notice it with stacking those two spells wich is why i always keep Grim Aura memorised.<br>
<br>
Now on the other side we have +STR that rasises the ATK value, i have a series of STR taps as well, that -STR from the target and gives it to myself, useing STR buff spells and my own STR stackable spells i can raise MY ATK rather high, but i notice something different...<br>
My max damage is increased, so i notice that my average swing is now increased by the same factor as my max hit... unbuffed i hit with my mace for 74 (19 damage) with a small STR buff i can goto 80+ and have seen hits as high break 90 though i was heavily buffed for ATK/STR and not Defence/HP/AC.<br>
<br>
I will say this, as a shadowkight and capped Offence skills, i do NOT use my two handed wepon UNLESS i have a self STR, ATK buff on my oponent, my sword  his for 149 unbuffed wich is nice when you get a dobule swing, but the 5 or 6 50-80 hits in a row and misses kills me, wich is why my mace overall does superior damage in unbuffed situations. (problem is mace/shield taunts nice so sometimes, though rarely i swap out my two handed sword for the high hits and slow delay.. also alows me to cast between swings to a certain extent)<br>
<br>
So there you go.. goblin skull earing.. use it, Grim Aura is a spell i would never let run out, if i can help it.. worth its weight in gold in my opinion.<br>

I wanted to say that you have brought some good presentations to this disucssion.  Please let me offer my advice and suggestions.  <br>
You have some good ideas and have done some good work, but there are still a few points that might help you.<br>

SK's are a great class.  They have great spells that allow them to taunt.  They can feign death.  They can turn invisible (which is something I wish I could do).  SKs can taunt mobs better than any other class, IMHO.<br>

SKs get great innate buffs to increase thier attack rating, through either strenght or a raw attack rating increase.<br>

Here, let me help you here.<br>
This applies for all 1 handed weapons.<br>
In any damage dealing table for a SK, Warrior, Paladin, or Monk, there is a foruma that you need to be aware of<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> [(2 * DMG) + (Level Damage Bonus)]</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This is the average damage that you will do.  If you look at the chart above for quantos you will see very clearly that &quot;magic number&quot; that will be by far the most common amount that was hit for.<br>
Your second higest peak will be at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> (1 + (Level Damage Bonus)]</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Your level damage bouns is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> [((Current Level) - 25)/3]</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This is proven above in the graphs that I show you.<br>
Now, if you are wondering why Hatrids distubution is different, it is because damage bonus does not apply for your off hand, so the min damage for his off hand weapon is 1, and for his primary hand is 8. <br>
<br>
Let us say you are level 50, so you have a damage bonus of [(50 - 25) / 3] = 8 (it rounds down)<br>
<br>
Your average hit with your mace will be [(19 * 2) + 8] = 46.<br>
<br>
Now for two handed weapons, you have a different formula to figure out damage bonus.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/copelandeq/twohanderbonus.html">www.geocities.com/copelan...bonus.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Is a page that shows the current two handed damage bonus values.<br>
Now, I am not sure, but Im going to guess that your using a Throneblade of the Ykesha ( 33 DMG 51 DLY 10 WT, +6 INT, +6 STR, EFF: YKESHA).  This is a common weapon for SK's, and is a good one to use.<br>
Now, we look on the chart I gave you for a 51 delay or compute it out the old fashoned way.<br>
{[(level - 25) / 3] + (level - 27)/4} + [(delay - 34)/3]<br>
<br>
or in your case<br>
<br>
{[(50 - 25) / 3] + [(50 - 27)/4]} + [(51 - 34)/3] = 18<br>
<br>
Now, that we have your damage bonus, we can see that your average damage for your 2 handed sword will be (2 * 33) + 18 or 74 points of damage!<br>
<br>

I hate to be the one to break this to you, good sir shadowknight, but thats all in your head.  I just showed you the numbers that prove to you that increasing your attack value does not increase your average damage, nor your ability to hit.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now on the other side we have +STR that rasises the ATK value, i have a series of STR taps as well, that -STR from the target and gives it to myself, useing STR buff spells and my own STR stackable spells i can raise MY ATK rather high, but i notice something different...<br>

<br>
You are very correct here.  An increase in strength does increase overall damage output.  It does not effect your magic number at all, but instead will change your max damage hit.<br>
Your max damage you will ever hit with a weapon (not counting crits) is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  [((Weapon Skill + Strength)/100) * (DMG)) + (Level Damage Bonus)] </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As you will see, strength plays a very important role in this formula, and will change your total damage output by changing the entire spectrum of your damage.<br>
<br>
I proved this to you again in this thread.  Look above at the top and I show you in numbers that a strength buff can increase damage output of 10%.  Now, this may seem to be small, but it is actually quite a significant difference.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I will say this, as a shadowkight and capped Offence skills, i do NOT use my two handed wepon UNLESS i have a self STR, ATK buff on my oponent, my sword his for 149 unbuffed wich is nice when you get a dobule swing, but the 5 or 6 50-80 hits in a row and misses kills me, wich is why my mace overall does superior damage in unbuffed situations.

You are correct in this fashon.  Most people will see the high damage hits from thier low deay weapon and think that its better.  Its the allure of having those sexy critical hits scroll across your screen. <br>
When I was using my wurmslayer, I would cripple hit for in the 300's, which was very sexy and made everyone in the party look at me in shock, but is really more of eye candy than increase in effectiveness.<br>
Your smart enough to realise this.<br>
<br>
Now, the ability to cast in between your swings is a HUGE advantage.  I have a lvl 30 sk which I like to play every now and then, and since that patch came out, I can lifetap in between my swings.  <br>
This gives me that ability to heal myself, slow the mob, dot the mob, or steal the mobs strength without taking away from my damage output at all!<br>
<br>
That is why jade mace is not neccessarly the best thing for a SK.  They want something that will let them take advantage of that ability to cast in between swings.<br>
<br>

Please revaluate your thinking here.  I have just shown you proof that the goblin skull earring does not effect your abilities as a melee.<br>
If you still insist that you really think thier awesome, pelase find me on tallon zek, and I will be happy to sell you one. <br>
I like my goblin skull earring because in PvP thats an extra strippable buff that stays at the top of my stack.  That with jboots keeps people from being able to annul magic me (I just reapply jboots and earring after i get hit with an annul using hotkeys) <p>Hatrid Spite
