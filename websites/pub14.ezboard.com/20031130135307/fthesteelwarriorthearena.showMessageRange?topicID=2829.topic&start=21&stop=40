This is completely false, and any warrior higher than lvl 60 should be able to afford a fleshgrinder, or be able to kill radir for a shadow heart.  Its actually incredibly easy to get a great weapon, you just need a little self confidence... a weapon with enraging blow isnt required for keeping agro.  In fact, the very idea of relying on a proc to gain agro is quite unsettling to me, I would rather rely on myself, not the luck of the draw.  I consider procs a bonus to a weapon, not a necessity. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193009"> Grendon's Stuff </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
The problem is not really holding/keeping Aggro so much as it is getting aggro before the mob takes a few pieces out of 2 or 3 other group members until taunt actually works. Players in PoP are sick of getting raped at the begining of each fight when they can see that It's no longer neccesary. The freakin MOB's hit too damn hard in PoP and can take out a lesser class in a hurry, so before the warrior _gains_ aggro everyone else in the group has a nice chunk taken out of them. This used to be somewhat acceptable but now if the chanter is a 1/4 health the shaman is at 1/2 health and the cleric is at 3/4 health before you get taunt to work it kinda fecks things up. <br>
<br>
Now with a knight the group can debuff snare slow and do whatever they want and the Knight can peel a mob on a dead run to a caster AT RANGE mind you, directly to him/her.<br>
<br>

Perhaps we should learn to cast spells... yeah thats it, or perhaps we should make bows produce more agro, oh wait that just ruins rangers.  Face it, we'll never be able to get agro off casters as well as pallies can, but fortunately we get a nice 1k hp buffer over the average paladin (at least 1k hp), and can just ask the group to stay closer to you so you dont get ping-pong.  And about getting agro early, you should remind your group that you have extra hp instead of great agro spells, and kindly ask them to give you an extra 3 seconds to gain agro... in the long run you're going to find out that even against mobs that hit for 550 damage, 3 seconds of them holding off isn't going to slow your kill speed, and it's going to keep them alive.  If they aren't interested in dealing with it, they should get a pally and live with healing early even when the mob is slow.  And about what you're talking about, clearly you are in favor of mashing taunt, and while I find myself mashing sometimes, I try to remind myself that if I time taunt correctly, I can pull agro right back off a chanter, or shaman, or even cleric for that matter because that's exactly what taunt is designed to do.  /rant off. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193009"> Grendon's Stuff </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Oh yes, you're certainly the more intelligent player, because you hold back on that overpowering urge to punch the taunt button and only use it when you lose aggro.  Wow, a real genius.  When did you come up with that one? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
No one is asking for spells.  People are asking to be given a viable way to play the game that puts us on an equal footing with the Knights.  Your claims that we're there already are not convincing nor compelling.  The majority of Warriors don't agree.  The majority of priests don't agree.  The majority of casters don't agree.  The majority of DPS melee don't agree.  Hell even some of the Knights grudgingly disagree with you.  You're right while all these other people who play the game are wrong?  I don't think so.  You're smarter than the majority of people who play the game and figured out something they don't know?  I don't think so.<br>
<br>
I should be able to punch a button and have enough of a lead on the hate list that the rest of my support team can do their jobs within reason without worrying about an ass whooping.  Unreasonable you say?  Trivializing you claim?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Knights can already do this by punching a button and expending an insignificant amount of mana and it hasn't trivialized the game.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> That arguement has no merit.  It's baseless.  It makes NO sense.<br>
<br>
Saying Warriors shouldn't be allowed to have an early lock on aggro dooms the Warrior to being an eternal third choice.  I'm not asking for anything that hasn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>already</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> been given to two other classes.  And I don't even want it to the same degree they have it, just enough of an improvement that it's not a constant concern.  <br>

This is from direct personal experience. <br>
<br>
As cleric I don't care which tank class our group takes.  ANY of them played competently works.  What differs is how you have to adjust.  A knight tanking allows for faster debuffing but means you have to be sharper with the MT heals.  A warrior tanking means you have to be more cautious with early debuffs and heals, but you can ride out the CHs longer.<br>
<br>
Yes, 61st level warriors with few AAs and RoK weapons are going to suck.  But I am going to inform you: 61st knights with few AAs and RoK armor SUCK as well.<br>
<br>
A good portion of the 'problem' is honestly shear laziness of group members.  Yes, Enchanter_01 it is NOT a good idea to tash before the warrior even hits the mob.  There is no reason to.  IF you tank is that bad that it needs the mob slowed in under 10s then the tank SHOULDN'T be tanking that mob.  Honestly, my preferred pickup tank is a blue (warlords I am guessing) armored warrior with a Windblade.  I don't recall his name, but he know how to play and work with the group.<br>
<br>
I think a *mild* correction to warrior aggro is in order.  Something that gives them a tad bit of +Hate at the engage with a relatively short reuse.  Nothing to rival EB aggro, just something to help during those first 10s of a fight.  To give them knight or better aggro would ruin the game.  It would give the best defensive tank class the best aggro.  No one takes a second tank for 'damage' if other options are available, and almost no one considers other non-stacking attributes such as paladin healing.<br>
<br>
As is warrior pure melee dps is greater than knights (yes, assuming equivalent gear/AAs).  Right now a additive warrior (even if not desired) brings more DPS than a paladin.  If tank aggro is made nearly identical then you run across the prospect of needing to adjust knight melee abilities upwards so they can fill an additive roll better.<br>
<br>
My ideal would be:<br>
<br>
Warrior: workable aggro, best tanking skills, more HP, baseline 1.0 melee DPS, useful disciplines<br>
Paladin: best aggro, good tanking skills, less HP, 0.8 melee DPS, emergency healing<br>
<br>
Basically, if you pump up warrior aggro to &quot;its not a problem anymore&quot; levels then I forsee a raising of knight skill caps so that their offense is more akin to 0.9.  This is somewhat problematic though since SK spells being offensive in nature generally 'stack' well with a group.  Perhaps simply giving paladins some cleric DDs would help since then they could use their mana to do something iteratively helpful as well.  A fast-casting version of the level 44 clr nuke would probably work.  One of the above honestly may be what they have in mind already though.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ketherami>Kether Am I</A> at: 1/29/03 12:23:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frodlin7th>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 285<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/29/03 12:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2829.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Under Review Maybe they are listening</span><hr size=1> Grendon, <br>
<br>
I did a &quot;taunt test&quot; last night vs. an Imperial guard in Ssra, since we were screwing around waiting for Blood to pop.    Many warriors on the serveride channel saw this because I was becoming increasingly frustrated as time went on.<br>
<br>
When taunt works, the mob turns to you period.   This was verified by the mob turning and beating on me when it did work.<br>
<br>
So, here's the deal.... I stood next to a mob who was being killed.   I sat there and hit the taunt button.  Did nothing else to generate aggro, no attack on no ranged attacks, no nothing, just press taunt.<br>
<br>
After doing it 77 times in a row, with no attention from the mob, I was wondering exactly what was the problem.   I wondered if those mobs wee simply taunt immune, or if the way we all thought about taunt was wrong.... on the 78th time, it worked.   On the 81st time, it worked.... on the 92nd time, it worked.    This meant that.... the mobs WERENT immune, and that it DID work the way we all thought it did (auto to top of hate list) but that the rate of it working was stupidly low.<br>
<br>
Before you say &quot;gee, there had to be a string of bad luck... let's say for the sake of argument that taunt is 50% reliable.... Go flip a quarter, you have a 50% chance of heads or tails... flip it 77 times in a row, and tell me if you get heads each time.     The odds of this happenning are so low that a number cannot be made to represent this possibility.   You have a higher chance of being struck by lightning on a clear day while indoors.<br>
<br>
Is taunt itself still broken?  Yep.   Could it be the specific mobs I was fighting?  Yep, no question.   Could taunt success vary from mob to mob?  Yep, no question.   is there any way to know this?  Nope.   Does Cease cause aggro each time regardless of whether a mob is immune or the spell is resisted?  Yep. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solinarinnoruuk>Solinar Innoruuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 301<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/29/03 12:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2829.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Under Review Maybe they are listening</span><hr size=1> I find taunt to work about 50% vs blues and about 25-35% vs reds now.<br>

There is certainly a good case presented by your evidence, should it not be some anomolie, for it goes against Steel Warrior's beliefs of how taunt works.  Other than wanting to test it myself, I'm not real sure how to respond other than to say that yesterday was an incredibly buggy day.  I know I have felt at times like taunt wasn't working right, but I don't think I've ever had it not work 77 times in a row.  And about people saying that pallies being considered better on all levels by all other classes (btw thanks for the defense in this regard, I'm not trying to preach my argument as much as get a bit of intelligent discussion going instead of a rant that should be in the tavern forum), you are off your rocker.  Warriors always have been and always will be in equal (or greater) demand than pallies and SKs have, and I see no reason for that to change.  All I see in this thread is people announcing all the quite obvious strengths of a paladin, and not mentioning the quite obvious strengths of warriors.  I'm here to participate in intelligent discussion, not to watch a thread dissolve into single-sided statements and hollow insults. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193009"> Grendon's Stuff </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
SoL in general is more forgiving in both xp groups and pretty every single boss fight, tank dies, loose's aggro, its sucks, but you can recover fairly easily.<br>
<br>
In PoP a lot (not all) if tank dies at wrong time, or loose's aggro, you can find half your clerics and raid force dead... and then your  $#%ed... The same goes on the micro level...<br>
<br>
Loose aggro for too long in xp groups and the shm enc or cleric is dead....<br>
<br>
Coincidentally, Taunt works *much* better in PoP zones.... (where it is needed)...<br>
<br>
I dont have any parse's of this, but I've seen it mentioned numberous times on this board, and i've just plain old noticed the difference when I use the taunt button... <br>

The only thing that makes me go &quot;hmm&quot; is that it *did* work a few times.   I dont  know what the meaning is, other than that there *is* a couple of things to glean from this:<br>
<br>
1. A warrior has no real control over aggro other than to engage a random number generator and accept the results.<br>
<br>
2. Every other class DOES have a way to control (or at least to some degree) aggro generation.<br>
<br>
Now, having said that, I still disagree with your conclusion that the mitigation difference between Knights and Warriors compensates in terms of mana/effort spent for at will aggro generation.   The reson I say this is because of the cost of ancillary heals.  They are exactly the same as Complete heals, barring mana conservation focus items, which do work on shorter cast time heals and not CH, but this number isn't large.<br>
<br>
In reality the ratio of CH's needed between a knight and a warrior (this is considering no heals or taps are cast by the knight) is approximately 11 to 10.   In other words, a warrior needs 10 CH's to equal 11 CH's roughly for a Knight.    <br>
<br>
The question is, in 10 CH's to a warrior, if another party member gets hit more than once, the mana savings is in favor of the Knight, the more lost aggro on the part of the warrior, the more favorable the Knight becomes.<br>
<br>
I'd say that it's roughly 2:1 in my experience as a warrior with high aggro weapons, and 8300hp group buffed.  In other words, for every 2 CH's performed on me, at least one party member needs a small heal.   <br>
<br>
So, for every 10 CH's preformed on me, it's really 15  CH's worth of mana.    For a Knight, it would be 11 CH's worth of mana, meaning that the Knight represents a rather large mana cost savings to a group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frodlin7th>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/29/03 2:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2829.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Under Review Maybe they are listening</span><hr size=1> Madrone,<br>
<br>
I agree, and it was done in High Ssra (at emp portal) which has many coding issues which differ from PoP (no charm, Mez, yadda yadda).    I'm not trying to state that this is definitive results of taunt working, but I would use it to point to the fact that taunt is indeed unreliable, (i.e. cannot be trusted as a primary method of aggro generation) and is still really out of the control of the warrior.   Worse, outside of a few intelligent mobs, who give a taunt success message, we have know way of gauging it's effectiveness.   Every other class who casts spells knows when they have been fully or partially resisted, and even a precise number of how much damage they do.   The warrior (and any other class who uses the Taunt button) has no way to gauge the success of their attempts, particulrly if they're on or near the top of their aggro list.<br>
<br>
Finally, since taunt is, under most peoples' experience (and Abashi's admission) a technique of transferring aggro, and not one of generating it, they have no way of quantifying or controlling the quantity of aggro that they generate, other than melee damage, which we can mostly agree is rather on the low side comparatively, whereas every other class (outside of monks and rogues) can say to themselves &quot;If I repeat this behaviour, it will generate X number of aggro higher than the guy who has done pervious behaviours.&quot;<br>

<br>
Completely on target. In a raid situation, warriors are giving some quality time with the mob to themselves to get un-friendly. In an experience group where the mobs life expectancy is 100 seconds, spending 10-20 seconds building aggro every fight means you're gimping the groups experience. Take a look at the cleric boards, there's a thread about knights vs warriors as exp tanks, pallys are hands down favorites.<br>
<br>
One thing that I've found to help some (when playing my cleric) is to cast Tarnations (8 sec stun-knockback) on incomming. What this does is either a) stun the mob and give the warrior 2 taunt key pressings to gain a decent lead over the slower or b) resists stun and comes over to smack the cleric <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In either of those cases I (as a cleric) can either DA/DB, run around in circles screaming &quot;GET IT OFF&quot;, root the mob, or if the war has AE taunt he uses it at this point. At level 64 my cleric has about a 10% resist rate on stun, and even then, if the war is on his toes, he'll usually be able to taunt fast enough to grab aggro back before the mob reaches me.<br>
<br>
Why go through this hastle? Because it's faster than letting the war solo for a CH worth of damage. Also it's mana efficient for the cleric, within the 8 seconds of the stun the slower usually does his thing. I've found that once the mob's slowed, I can get away with 1 CH per fight on the war in PoV, 2 in BoT/HoH.<br>
<br>
Looking at the mana efficiency-<br>
Ch=400 mana<br>
Stun= 325 mana<br>
Supernal Remedy= 400 mana<br>
<br>
So, it's much better to stun once, CH once per fight than CH tank, SR enchanter, SR self, CH tank again, SR tank before next mob.<br>
<br>
The key is to give warriors some kind of aggro to taunt with.. hitting taunt at the begining of the fight otherwise is just a waste.<br>

I don't think you can guarantee that you will see the mob turn to you on each successful taunt when others are beating on the mob and you aren't.  You will have aggro for at best a fraction of a second, and the client may or may not update fast enough for you to see the mob turn to you.  A much better test would be to use mobs that &quot;talk&quot; (I'll teach you to interfere with me Frodlin!) in Seru, or on non-kos mobs where you can just taunt until the mob aggros on you (successful taunt) for a much better test.  Unless the patch broke something, I find it highly doubtful that taunt would fail 77 times in a row. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=325267">Brutul Vilesilencer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

After doing it 77 times in a row, with no attention from the mob, I was wondering exactly what was the problem. I wondered if those mobs wee simply taunt immune, or if the way we all thought about taunt was wrong.... on the 78th time, it worked. On the 81st time, it worked.... on the 92nd time, it worked. This meant that.... the mobs WERENT immune, and that it DID work the way we all thought it did (auto to top of hate list) but that the rate of it working was stupidly low.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
So for &quot;X&quot; amount of time you hit taunt at the wrong timing and you are telling us that WARRIOR taunt sucks because you are getting your taunt stolen due to no other numerical hate adding in.  On the 78th time, you actually got lucky in your timing...  likely someone took a bathroom break...  I am sorry, but you are blowing this out of proportion because you do not understand what you are doing.  You are failing due to your lack of knowledge...<br>
<br>
Taunt puts you on top of the list... with a lower skillcap than you have and without casting a single spell or swinging ONCE I can taunt off mobs from elemental planes. (did it last night)  Taunt is a powerful tool, but alone it is currently not what it needs to be for warriors.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Before you say &quot;gee, there had to be a string of bad luck... let's say for the sake of argument that taunt is 50% reliable.... Go flip a quarter, you have a 50% chance of heads or tails... flip it 77 times in a row, and tell me if you get heads each time. The odds of this happenning are so low that a number cannot be made to represent this possibility. You have a higher chance of being struck by lightning on a clear day while indoors.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
If someone doctors said coin, and cheats when they &quot;flip&quot; it by timing the flip with skill and timing, they most certainly COULD make it come up heads 77 times in a row....<br>
(You know that experienced hybrids actually TIME their sword swings and their taunt spells so as to land to give them maximum Taunt AFTER a taunt skill press, right?<br>
Example: Cast Terror, wait until right before it lands, press taunt.... terror lands, SK is 600points ahead of the highest person period.  SK with the highest experience will time sword swings for 300+ to land just after the Taunt and Terror, making for 1100-1200pt hatred buffers...)<br>
<br>
<br>
TAUNT itself seems fine...  what warriors actually need is a method to control some numerical taunt value. (TAUNT skill places you on top and is POSITIONAL hate)<br>
A warrior who is able to press a button to add some numerical hate on TOP of their 1st place positional advantage would have a LOT easier time holding aggro.<br>
<br>
I suggest adding a simple option....<br>
<br>
Warriors gain a new skill at 30th,<br>
LOW BLOW<br>
-Greys KICK, SLAM, and BASH and is on the same timer.<br>
-Does KICK damage, (no stun, doesn't push)<br>
-Adds +100 in hate (in addition to the hate caused by the damage) the result would be (between damage-hate and direct-hate) a numerical hate addition on the level of 1/6 - 1/4 of Enraging blow.<br>
-The LOW BLOW can MISS, but it still does its numerical hate addition (the damage-hate of course doesn't make it)<br>
<br>
The Warrior is effectively trying to kick their opponenet in the jimmy....  the opponent is gonna notice said attack and take exception to the warrior.<br>
<br>
Warriors would remain lower than Knights in hatred production,  yet the CONTROL of hatred and the fact that the +100 hate is both unresistable, and unlimited (except by refresh), means the warrior should be able to hold aggro better than now.<br>
This of course means that some warriors will have to study up a tad...<br>
TIME your swings and your TAUNT button so that it happens in the following order,<br>
TAUNT, (immediately after) SWING, LOW BLOW.<br>
The warrior (if Taunt is successful) would be their weapon swings AND at least 100 hate over the next highest hated player.<br>
<br>
Now, let me restate... I agree that warriors could use a little more hatred generation control...<br>
but it is PRECISION and TIMING that will make that happen.... not brute &quot;generate 8MILLION, work EVERY TIME, skills that would trivialize hybrids and make warriors the only tank again.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Warriors should NEVER taunt at distance like a Hybrid.<br>
SPELLS are what allow us to taunt at distance...  when warriors sling spells at will, what is the point of being a hybrid?  When Warriors exceed Hybrid Taunt, what use is there for Knights?<br>
<br>
Hybrids should be better at hatred... they represent varying radical alignments...  especially Paladins and Shadowknights.<br>

What I find mildly amusing is that I could sit here and argue that &quot;stun&quot; spells should do what they're advertised to do, which is &quot;stun&quot; mobs and not be used as free little hate generators, even on resisted or immune mobs.   <br>
<br>
I don't, because I see the need for a ranged aggro generation, but let's get realistic here for a minute.   You are claiming that aggro generation is a &quot;knight's area&quot;, this is total BS, it's a break in the coding that allows this.    It certainly IS a shadowknight's area, but not really a Paladin's.<br>

<br>
Actually, YOU are the one who's shown that you neither read entire threads (where I made it pretty clear that I didn't consider this to be definitive), nor have an understanding how taunt works.    <br>
<br>
let me explain something to you.   The 3 times that it worked, I was beaten on for almost 30 seconds.    <br>
<br>
What can we infer with this?  It's likely that we can infer that someone at a range had a fairly high position on the aggro list, yet the mob didn't bother chasing them and was still beating on someone within proximity, because NO ONE changed behaviours ecept the mob.  No one stopped attacking, no one did anything different out of the 40ish people who were there, yet with a single taunt I had the mob's attention for approximately 30 seconds, doing *zilch* to generate additional aggro.    <br>
<br>
You, Mr. &quot;I'll educate people&quot; are doing a piss poor job at it.   While I agree that if I took over the top melee person's position and he then contributed additional hate which removed me fom the top of the list prior to the next round of attacks, I'd have not been hit.   This happens from time to time even in places like Sanctus Seru, where there's a definitive message and yet even post taunt, you dont' have aggro.   I knw full well how this works, but there's a crucial difference.   In almost every instance, the mob will physically turn and look at you for a small amount of time, then turn back.   This did *not* happen.<br>

After doing it 77 times in a row, with no attention from the mob, I was wondering exactly what was the problem. I wondered if those mobs wee simply taunt immune, or if the way we all thought about taunt was wrong.... on the 78th time, it worked. On the 81st time, it worked.... on the 92nd time, it worked. This meant that.... the mobs WERENT immune, and that it DID work the way we all thought it did (auto to top of hate list) but that the rate of it working was stupidly low.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
So for &quot;X&quot; amount of time you hit taunt at the wrong timing and you are telling us that WARRIOR taunt sucks because you are getting your taunt stolen due to no other numerical hate adding in. On the 78th time, you actually got lucky in your timing... likely someone took a bathroom break... I am sorry, but you are blowing this out of proportion because you do not understand what you are doing. You are failing due to your lack of knowledge...<br>
<br>
Taunt puts you on top of the list... with a lower skillcap than you have and without casting a single spell or swinging ONCE I can taunt off mobs from elemental planes. (did it last night) Taunt is a powerful tool, but alone it is currently not what it needs to be for warriors.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

As can anyone, but... this is crucial... *if it works*.     You have no clue as to my lack of knowledge, you make several assumptions that I did or didn't do &quot;x, y, or z&quot;, when in fact you have no clue whether I did or not.<br>

Before you say &quot;gee, there had to be a string of bad luck... let's say for the sake of argument that taunt is 50% reliable.... Go flip a quarter, you have a 50% chance of heads or tails... flip it 77 times in a row, and tell me if you get heads each time. The odds of this happenning are so low that a number cannot be made to represent this possibility. You have a higher chance of being struck by lightning on a clear day while indoors.<br>

<br>
If someone doctors said coin, and cheats when they &quot;flip&quot; it by timing the flip with skill and timing, they most certainly COULD make it come up heads 77 times in a row....<br>
(You know that experienced hybrids actually TIME their sword swings and their taunt spells so as to land to give them maximum Taunt AFTER a taunt skill press, right?<br>
Example: Cast Terror, wait until right before it lands, press taunt.... terror lands, SK is 600points ahead of the highest person period. SK with the highest experience will time sword swings for 300+ to land just after the Taunt and Terror, making for 1100-1200pt hatred buffers...)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Timing spells casts between slow, known delay factor swings is uhh....entirely irrelevant to this, and.... a warrior who was NOT pressing taunt was the recipient of the aggro in my example.    Try again.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>TAUNT itself seems fine... what warriors actually need is a method to control some numerical taunt value. (TAUNT skill places you on top and is POSITIONAL hate)<br>
A warrior who is able to press a button to add some numerical hate on TOP of their 1st place positional advantage would have a LOT easier time holding aggro.<br>
<br>
I suggest adding a simple option....<br>
<br>
Warriors gain a new skill at 30th,<br>
LOW BLOW<br>
-Greys KICK, SLAM, and BASH and is on the same timer.<br>
-Does KICK damage, (no stun, doesn't push)<br>
-Adds +100 in hate (in addition to the hate caused by the damage) the result would be (between damage-hate and direct-hate) a numerical hate addition on the level of 1/6 - 1/4 of Enraging blow.<br>
-The LOW BLOW can MISS, but it still does its numerical hate addition (the damage-hate of course doesn't make it)<br>
<br>
The Warrior is effectively trying to kick their opponenet in the jimmy.... the opponent is gonna notice said attack and take exception to the warrior.<br>
<br>
Warriors would remain lower than Knights in hatred production, yet the CONTROL of hatred and the fact that the +100 hate is both unresistable, and unlimited (except by refresh), means the warrior should be able to hold aggro better than now.<br>
This of course means that some warriors will have to study up a tad...<br>
TIME your swings and your TAUNT button so that it happens in the following order,<br>
TAUNT, (immediately after) SWING, LOW BLOW.<br>
The warrior (if Taunt is successful) would be their weapon swings AND at least 100 hate over the next highest hated player.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I don't disagree with your assessment of needs.   <br>

Now, let me restate... I agree that warriors could use a little more hatred generation control...<br>
but it is PRECISION and TIMING that will make that happen.... not brute &quot;generate 8MILLION, work EVERY TIME, skills that would trivialize hybrids and make warriors the only tank again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Warriors should NEVER taunt at distance like a Hybrid.<br>
SPELLS are what allow us to taunt at distance... when warriors sling spells at will, what is the point of being a hybrid? When Warriors exceed Hybrid Taunt, what use is there for Knights?<br>
<br>
Hybrids should be better at hatred... they represent varying radical alignments... especially Paladins and Shadowknights.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I would agree with Shadowknights, but not Paladins.   Paladins generate aggro through spells which are designed for a specific purpose, and aggro generation was NOT that purpose.  I *also* dont' see the problem with specific fletched arrows which are designed to generate hate.   This is *not* using spells, and it makes perfect RP sense (i.e. ridiculing an opponenet through the use of nasty messages like &quot;kick me&quot; on an arrow) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frodlin7th>Frodlin7th</A> at: 1/29/03 4:27:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dinianscalebane>Dinian Scalebane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/29/03 5:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2829.topic&index=39>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.endorean.com/sigs/face60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /sigh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This is *not* using spells, and it makes perfect RP sense (i.e. ridiculing an opponenet through the use of nasty messages like &quot;kick me&quot; on an arrow)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ranged attacks for decreasing morale via anger and frustration have been around for millennia, in a *real world* sense, and not even in a &quot;fantasy world&quot; sense.    Taunting one's opponent by ridiculing his or her abilities from afar is not uncommon at all.<br>
