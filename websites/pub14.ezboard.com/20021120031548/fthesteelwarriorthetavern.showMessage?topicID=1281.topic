<br>
Just hoping to get some opinions from everyone/someone.<br>
<br>
Im not much of a raiding person.  I have about 4 hrs or so a night and I have a &quot;holy trinity&quot; group that I group with every night.  Me, cleric, enchanter, rogue, magician, druid.<br>
<br>
Presently we have been doing just about everything we can think of with one group and having a BLAST !! <br>
<br>
All 6 of us are in the same guild and recently, maybe past 2 months, others are starting to get &quot;jelaous&quot; of our group.  They want to hang with us, experince with us, go places with us.<br>
<br>
Sometimes we let others in and kick a memebr out... let cleric sit out.. whatever... but lately its been getting quiet stressful for us.  Getting /t and message board posts and /gu comments about &quot;our perfect group&quot;.<br>
<br>
Just hoping soem folks had some opinions/suggestions for me.<br>
<br>
- Should we leave the guild?<br>
- Should we tell them to F off?<br>
- Should we just let them all &quot;hang&quot; with us and not get exp<br>
<br>

<br>
My response to this was to tell them to take matters into their own hands to make their own groups.  I explained we all played the same times and we all knew when and where we would be the next day when we logged on.  Not only that but months of playing with the same people allowed us to know and anticipate each others moves.  <br>

Tell the people who are giving you a hard time how awesome it is and they would be well off to arrange the same type of function for themselves.

Its part of the game though.  One which each person has to work through on their own.  Either get very good at pick up groups or find a group of like minded regulars.<br>

The good thing about being in a guild is having people to play with. I havn't been lfg for the last couple of weeks and I havn't had to because I have been grouping with guildies.<br>
<br>
Just tell them to put a group together, or put it in an afk message<br>
<br>
/afk NO we will not let you tag with us message some of your friends and make your own group! <p>Binnamar- 51 dwarven warrior<BR>

<br>
We have had this problem in my guild once, until our leader (and one of the members of the group) rightfully put his foot down and suttely told them to shut up and move on.<br>
<br>
My guild leader is an enchanter, his wife is a cleric, and they play with their friends who are also married, a warrior and bard. Now, they group usually with their online druid friend... but it's that last spot that always bugged people. They would ARGUE over the spot, and complain that it was the leaders job to provide them with experience groups and make sure they got the kills on a raid.<br>
<br>
I don't blame the guy for explaining to them they need to find their own fun in the game. I did that, and now I get /tells from people bitching that they want to come with my and the guys tonight. A cleric, chanter, mage, druid, and myself are usually grouped together when we are all on. I've been asked by people to let them in our Sebilis Juggs group because it's tough getting through level 44. As if I am going to risk my life so a level 44 can suck my experience? Yah...<br>
<br>
I choose option #2. Tell 'em to find their own friends and stop mooching off yours. <p><table width="32%" border="1" align="center" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" background="http://www.guild-legerdemain.com/texture2.gif">

It wasnt one of the &quot;perfect&quot; groups, it was ranger, ranger, ranger, druid,(me), cleric, wizard. With another friend who would join us less fequently that played a warrior. We didt do anything spectacul;ar, just tofs crawls,(we were all in our mid 40s) EW rapings at the orc fort,stuff like that. We got accused of forming a clique too and we basically said is, &quot;So what you are saying is you would rather we DONT find a group of people we like to group with and do fun stuff with and we should instead all go our seperate ways so YOU guys dont feel bad about not having a group? Get bent.&quot;<br>
 I personally think its NORMAL for people in non high end raid guilds to form cliques when they go out hunting for exp or working on quests. Sure most of the groups were duos and trios and ours was the only full group but I still dont see what was stopping them from doing the same thing themselves. Next time you get a complaint tell them if they want to be in a full group so bad make friends with some guildies and make your own damn group!<br>

It depends on a few things:<br>
<br>
1.  Are you the guild leader?<br>
2.  Are any of the people that are in your &quot;perfect&quot; group the guild leader?<br>
3.  Are these just exp nights or is this what you do every single night and the guild tag is basically for chatting?<br>
4.  Are the things you are doing strictly for exp, or are you trying things that involve loot?<br>
<br>
I mean, if I was in a guild where only 6 people are actively &quot;raiding.&quot;  And they are &quot;raiding&quot; camps that only &quot;require&quot; 6 people, then I'd be pretty upset.  Also, if there were 6 people in my guild that constantly grouped with each other and we were a small guild, meaning that we can't &quot;raid&quot; without them or do anything, then I'd be pretty upset.  Since you only have 4 hours to play, and your friends seem to as well, I don't see why you would be in a guild in the first place.  I guess it depends on too many variables...  I really have no opinion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/dakkan2001/xsigtest1.gif">

It's almost funny that other people have had the same problem.  I had a group of friends, Clr, Rog, Rng, Dru, Brd and myself (War) and we grouped together all the time.  For about 8 months actually and the guild we were in, the Guild leader actually tried to tell us we had to break up our group because others in the guild were feeling left out of it and we weren't sharing the oppurtunity for others to get exp like we got.  It actually got the point that we were kind of pushed to the side of the guild because we told the guild leader that was too bad.  We are now in a guild that understands this and let's us do our own thing.  We show up for raids and helping the guild out all the time, but when it comes to grindage, we almost always drop back to our standard group and the guild understands this.

2. Are any of the people that are in your &quot;perfect&quot; group the guild leader?<br>
3. Are these just exp nights or is this what you do every single night and the guild tag is basically for chatting?<br>
4. Are the things you are doing strictly for exp, or are you trying things that involve loot?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

- 1) no<br>
- 2) yes<br>
- 3) I like to crawl thru dungeons.  I raid with the guild two nights a week.  I find raiding boring and un satisfying.  Yes, the guild tag is for chatting unless someone needs something then I jump.<br>
- 4) both, neither.. I like to dungeon crawl, that is &quot;fun&quot; to me in EQ.  Wether its Chardok or HS or SG or Griegs.. I get more satisfaction out of doing something with one group then I do trying to drag 12-18 people with me.<br>
<br>
I don't know... Maybe its just that yellow text .. You have gained party experience    .. I like to see it, wether it gave me exp or not, it makes me feel like ive done something.<br>
<br>
Im just whining, and thats not proper of a warrior... i apologize.. Ive been reading these boards for so long I assumed I could ask yall a question that was personal to me.<br>
<br>
I guess I just need to ask myself if I want to stay in this guild and why.  i assume if i moved to another guild or de guilded then one of us is going to get flack from someones guild... its inevitable it sounds like... is it jealousy? maybe thats a harsh word... but lots of people want to do things that other people &quot;brag&quot; about.  Jealousy and brag are top of the line terms but maybe that defines the problem in a nutshell... My group does things without contention were other people sit LFG all night or die 10 times trying to cross ME. <br>
<br>
Is it fair to me to not have a fun night in EQ at the expense of others?  Is it fair to them to watch me &quot;gloat&quot; over a successful EQ night?  I think its just human nature... yes EQ is a game, its pixels on a screen but the person behind the pixels is a PERSON with real human emotions... Im sure theyd feel the same way if they saw me and my friends making money in the stock market or building fast food franchises... <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101135>Faederya's Litter Box</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uantiuber.showPublicProfile?language=EN>antiuber</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/18/02 2:10:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1281.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Opinions wanted - Guild / exp / groups</span><hr size=1> I have been lucky that twice this has happened with me. Our &quot;super group&quot; times are some of the best times I have had in game. Enjoy that while you can, sure others want to have what you have right now. People want to be part of something good like that but dont let that screw you up. It wont always be there, people will leave the game or just end up with differant interest. Enjoy your &quot;super group&quot; while you can dont worry bout the politics. <p><BR>

<br>
My guild never demanded to break up my expgroup to have other people go with us and i think if they did i would have left it for that reason (left it because of other reasons).<br>
<br>
If your guild demands that you let other people come with you even when you are a full group, find another one. If its just some members, tell them the group is full (if it is).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=1281.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showNextMessage?topicID=1281.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1281.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.emailToFriend?topicID=1281.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.threadControl?topicID=1281.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1281.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1281.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.91<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
