It seemed to be alive and had people talking so I stayed in the channel. About 5 minutes later, a cleric just says in the channel for no real aparent reason &quot;Man our DPS sucks, it should be better then a warriors.&quot; As a warrior i laughed at this, honestly your a cleric and your job is to heal. Im a warrior and my job is to tank. We started arging, but what i thought would be just a fun 30 minute argument turned out to be a 3+ hour headache, talking to one of the thickess headed clerics in the world. I thought that i was jsut talking to a box of ceral and that i was losing it!<br><br>The argument started off just really basic, touching on mostly battle clerics. &quot;We are clerics, what are we supposed to do when we are full mana? We never actually asked for any of these upgrades (no joke someone said that). We should be able to meele just as good as any other class. Druids can dot/dd and heal. Shammins can meele, have a pet and can torpor.&quot; Out of no where a cleric just says &quot;I wish i had torpor.&quot; Guess he/she never heard of Celestal Elixar? After those questions where debated upon, someone said that the real issue was this - clerics had the ability to meele already but do have the best healing ability (CH, Efficient/Fast/Good Heals). Our upgrade was just to balance out the classes. Warriors have Velious BP's (only if your guild farms ToV or Kael Arena) and Bandages. That is good enough, a warrior getting anything better then 90hp for 10 seconds is unbalanced&quot; And of course i jsut had to ask if giving clerics better ability to meele when warriors get almost no ability to heal ourselves was fair - the answer was almost unanumious &quot;Yes, exactly&quot;<br><br>I am a level 60 warrior. I dont have the best of gear but I think i have pretty good gear. I have full warlord except for my Vindi BP, some NToV, Primal 1hand, Wilsapper and some SoL loot. I am very surprised that i can really solo anything at all instead of maybe a couple velks spiders and two to three shrooms in FG.<br>Later on the patch day, I played my friends cleric. I bought him the spells, memed them and headed off to FG to see the new soloing abilites. I was able to kill about 2 patches and was still at 70 mana...<br>How honestly can you say that everything is balanced? In my opinion, everything was fine.. everything was balacned. Warriors tanked, clerics healed. Now there are a lot of clerics meeleing but no warriors healing at all (i would laugh at the idea as i do laugh at clerics soloing but they do). As hundreds of posters have complained, this patch sucks ass. With the new information that our tuant only works 8 percent of the time, it really is depressing to be a warrior. I cant imagine having clerics fizzle 92 times out of 100 to cast a CH, but imagine if that happened - that would make killing almost anything trivial wouldnt it?<br><br>Clerics can meele, but giving them this upgrade is more of a balance issue imo. Clerics can heal, warriors can tank. Cleric meeling &gt;&gt; warriors healing. That makes no sense at all, none of it!<br><br>&quot;i made a cleric for one reason only... to HEAL ... i didnt make one to meele or nuke or anything else. that is the price that clerics pay for almost always NEEDED. no other classes are ever truely needed&quot; - Quote from cleric channel<br>I made a warrior to tank, I didnt make it to heal, bandage or nuke. That's the price i pay to be needed.<br><br>Over 3 hours of arguments, mainly by Zeist (/wave Zeist) has been rather memorable.<br>Highlight - Zeist complaining that soloing now sucks but that he cant get into any good exp groups.<br>Zeist tells serverwide.cleric,1: &quot;not soloing, just shttiy grouping&quot; (exp)<br>You tell serverwide.cleric,1 &quot;next time someoen ask you to join a shitty group say no&quot; <br>Zeist tells serverwide.cleric,1 &quot;that makes no sense at all&quot; <p><center><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~anax/DhamSig.gif"></center><br><center>Half Elf Warlord - Ded Seksay</center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udhameon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dhameon</A> at: 9/9/02 3:37:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utarkassolro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tarkas SolRo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/9/02 6:24:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2027.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Holy Crap, Cleric Channel Madness</span><hr size=1> Last time i checked clerics also got decent nukes, lol. <p>Warlord of the Undermountain<BR>Blood of Ro<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153428">Tarkas's Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/9/02 10:07:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2027.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Holy Crap, Cleric Channel Madness</span><hr size=1> &quot;With the new information that our tuant only works 8 percent of the time, it really is depressing to be a warrior. &quot;<br><br>WHOAH NELLY!!!!!<br><br>Let's not start a new myth about taunt.   8% of the time to mobs of level 60.
