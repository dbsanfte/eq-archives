The posts here are beginning to look like Sevensword put them all up.<br>
<br>
Over 10 threads in 2 forums bitching about how much warriors now suck within one thread pushing 35 pages...Threads on how pvp sucks...threads on how the resistances are screwed now...threads on how tough it is to get massive experience killing yard trash like we've been doing...Enough already.<br>
<br>
Ok...so a couple of threads talking about the problem with warriors and debunking the whining maggot knights/monks/rangers that come to our house to bitch on our boards is no problem...and maybe one or two on shields, but do we really need the rest of them? Talk about redundant, pedantic self pity parties.<br>
<br>
The resistances changed...big deal. News flash. Not everyone is level 60 or warriors...they like to have their spells have a chance in hell of landing. Sure the lower levels can now land on us if you don't have good resist gear...so what?...they should. Just like the fact that they shouldn't when you have your 250+ resist gear on...and they don't. I got hit zero times by ae damage for the first 5 mobs in HoT with my main 3 resists at or over 250. The tag alongs who didn't bother to spend the money and time I have to get my resists up got their asses handed to them. Good. They should. Even a crappy caster should have a chance of landing a spell. It makes things more realistic and more challenging.<br>
<br>
So the experience grind has changed a bit. Big deal. If you were getting 3 blues of AA experience in a half hour hitting crap ten levels below you, then you were getting too damn much. I'm sorry if this tweaks your mellon, but that's a stone fact. If you're level 60, your butt should be out hunting lvl 55+ mobs, which there are plenty of on the server if your willing to run your lazy ass over 3 zones to get them. The level 50 to 55 mobs should be available for the lvl 50 to 55 pc's...not hogged up by a bunch of friggin uber guild member lvl 60's who just want to be able to aeo their way to even greater uberhood in 5 min. We talk all the time about not wanting to make it too easy to take down mobs and not wanting changes to the class to be so powerful that that becomes possible and yet we're beginning what seems to be the beginning of another couple of 30+ page threads whining about having to do a dungeon crawl into a hard to reach spot where cr's are a bitch. waaaaaaa...my @#%$ hurts. Jeez...what kind of babies are you guys?<br>
<br>
We're warriors...it's supposed to be tough. The only easy day was yesterday. Leave the whinging and moaning to the women and rangers. So you have to go a little deeper into chardok....so you'll have to run a few zones to akheva...so you'll have to relook at zones you never though of hunting in before. So what. Overcome...adapt...drive on. You might just have to think about other group configurations. For all you dual eb item having uber guild member warriors, you might just have to spend a little time getting ft 1-5 items for your wizards and having them in your group. If they have ft 1-5 items, kei, and potg a wizard is regening something like 50+ mana a tic...throw in a vending machine with their badass pets and you have a guy who can throw out 1600 pt bombs all day long without a hiccup and an extra free no experience taking melee with some 1200pt bombs as well, and that's before figuring in spell mastery and crits. Then maybe the robe wearing babies will stop crying about only getting 65% of the experience for 4 friggin mobs at once when they solo because they'll actually be able to get a group outside of a raid.<br>
<br>
Suck it up and strap it on guys...we may be down, but we aren't out. Let's quit sounding like the friggin waa patrol and get back to being the stoic Navy SEAL's of EQ. Let's quit talking about walkouts (yeah...that's gonna happen...and my ex wife might stop blowing the fleet every time the carrier get's to port too. It could happen, but it aint likely in either case). If you want to stop playing a warrior because you're tired of getting dicked around, then do so...chances are, I will be, especially after the shields go live. If you're gonna tough it out and see if the pendulum ever swings back in our direction without smashing us in the face, that's cool too. Just quit sounding like Jerry Falwell after a hooker convention and leave the crying to the dress wearers.<br>
<br>
It ain't nuthin but a thang...<br>

Thx webster.<br>
<br>
Tossing around your OWN opinions that agree or conflict with OTHER people's opinions are what message boards are generally all about (for better or worse), as well as the occasional Proposals, Queries, or ever elusive Facts.<br>
<br>
Berating message board whines you don't like with your very own whine thread is of course a time honored tradition, as well as being Yet Another Person's Opinion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Too bad threads can't be merged, it would clean things up a bit, but I personally don't have a problem with people posting their thoughts on subjects, unless they get abusive.  It doesn't threaten me in any way if I don't agree with em, and often it's fun to try and understand the motivations and assumptions behind the posts.  <br>
<br>
And, lately, there are some very valid points being raised (tho ad nauseam, as you mentioned <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )...<br>

1. To utter a plaintive, high-pitched, protracted sound, as in pain, fear, supplication, or complaint. <br>

You state it once, it's an opinion...you state it over and over and over again, it becomes a whine.  That's the part that isn't an opinion.  I didn't state it over and over...I said it once with some humor.<br>
<br>
Yes..plenty of valid points on the warriors sucks discussion. After 35 pages you've surpassed redundancy without the other 15 threads in two forums methinks.<br>

I personally don't have any problem with either type of whine (and yes, both are- the stuff you were complaining about AND the responses like your's complaining about the complainers).  They all worth just exactly what I paid to read em, or close anyway. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Just figured I'd point out the opinion aspect inherent in this type of thread.  My only (minor) gripe is the NUMBER of different threads; I'm fairly amused by the rest of it, aside from the &quot;real&quot; issues with warriors in EQ.  To wit: whining maggot convention?  Now THATS imagery.  Doesn't make any sense, but very vivid concept... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hakuna Matata! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/7/02 3:33:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1221.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://questing-ranger.com/images/mboards/archer-2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I dream of dancing eggplants!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Leave the whinging and moaning to the women and rangers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hey now - you'll notice that I don't fling flames unless someone bashes my class first. I think the local whiny paladin does a much better job... Ok, it probably would help if I didn't push their buttons so much, but it's just so much fun.<br>

After all there are a few political parties that don't get along.  <br>
<br>
However I don't like being misrepresented by warriors looking to insult me.<br>
<br>
For the RECORD  the whiney warriors were well underway when I should up.  Or do you think I started the &quot;warriors need all this to be greater then anyone else&quot; threads and then came back and bashed them for being overly unbalanceing?<br>
<br>
I supported and do support some requests for warriors.  <br>
<br>
I supported war/pal/sk to be on a different def table with the pal/sk tanking like a monk  damages and the warrior tanking like the rogue damages and everyone else tanking worse then those three classes.<br>
    I didn't support only warriors being on their own def table.<br>
<br>
I supported a increase in warrior taunting with a chance to get a instint double taunt. <br>
     I didn't support warriors getting a taunting ability on par to paladins.<br>
<br>
I supported a minor upgrade to warrior damage.  I didn't support warriors leaveing pal/sk damage in the dust.<br>
<br>
I supported a revamping of how aggro works with tanks (have refined it even more over on PoN although it'd still need to be coded somehow)<br>
    I got some minor support and some minor critisism from a few warriors and monk I beieve.  And from what I've seen it's the first idea posted here that'd allow tanking to stack in a reasonable way in exp grinds.<br>
<br>
That's my basic record from what I can recall off the top of my head about my posts on this board.   I'll admit I'm not the sweetest poster on any board.  However I'm usualy not hostile until my nose gets a bit of blood on it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uslyse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>slyse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/7/02 2:33:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1221.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: make jokes about yourself not others.  thanks.</span><hr size=1> That's your record from your own point of view...but as was said earlier, Opinions are like assholes; everybody has one and thinks theirs doesn't stink.<br>
