<br>
<br>
i read pretty much of that stuff and so far i can agree. I found out pretty soon that my job is not to deal damage, my job as a warrior is to take the aggro, catch the damage and take one for the team if needed. I hate to solo and i love to group. But these days imho it gets more and more difficult for us warriors to group up besides raids. I for myself can mostly find groups when i do exping with Guild or for the famous King/Juggs camps in Seb. (lvl60 Warrior in full ss, CoCW, Epic etc)<br>
<br>
I think i can live with that more or less since i hate exping for more AA anyway, but i see how other of my warlords suffer from it, they get no groups when they come on too late and all guildgroups are full, trying to do it solo...good joke. <br>
<br>
Also since i am lucky to be a Raidleader i tried out to let my monk tank in ToV, he was using his T-Staff, got aggro of me since i was pulling and was holding it the whole time without any problems + the cleric used less mana on him than a cleric would have used on me with defensive disc. Before i made him tank he was drawing my aggro away all the time, i was using kick, taunt, disarm and those chanter aggro buffs all the time and had zero chances to get aggro back and this is what makes me worried. <br>
<br>
Why should you take a warrior when he doesn't deal damage, is unable to keep aggro and get's easily killed when you got monks who can do that job.<br>
<br>
<br>
For you knights out there, i know your pain i spend 35 of my levels with a Paladin at my side the whole day, i know how many problems he had to find a group on his own, on other side, when the both of us were grouping together it rocked, cleric run oom, the pally jumped in, LH , root etc etc etc. He always said he is a support class and he loved and played that.<br>
<br>
<br>
/plead<br>
<br>
Please Verant give us a good taunt and the ability to take dmg better than a monk so we can be the meatshields we are supposed to be!<br>

<br>
As someone mentioned, clerics are now suffering from the same grouping problems to a certain extent. The reason is the same really. Xp groups don't NEED a warrior to tank anymore (any melee will do - that still include warriors though) and cleric healing power is overkill. Basically grinding became trivial as the risk was removed and all that is left is optimizing the rewards. <br>
<br>
That said warriors can still tank and cleric can still heal and there's still room for both in groups - it's just that they can be replaced now, which is really ok in my book. You shouldn't need the optimal lineup to kill mobs 15 levels below you. what's also to consider is that maybe we are feeling the pressure of demographics here. Pre luclin tons of warriors and clerics were created and now there's a LOT of them around, at a time where the grinding game has a been changed and people go for solo play and smaller groups, which is hurting those with poor soloability.<br>
<br>
Still warriors DO tank better when you raise the level of difficulty. They are not always absolutely essential, but they do a better job for sure. <br>
<br>
My suggestion: Make risk in proportion with rewards in the xp game. As it stand now, killing the lowest possible blue is the best xp no matter what. I'd dramatically increase the amount of xp on level 50+ mobs (a la revamped CT) to restore a certain element of risk in the grind game, to make classes that are best at damage mitigation a better alternative depending on how you want to grind. <br>
<br>
That said, I don't think warriors or any other class will ever be NEEDED again in the xp game. They don't like the concept of an essential class among 15 others in a 6 people group - and neither did anyone else that wasn't playing an essential class back when clerics, warriors and enchanters were almost always required to enter a dungeon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/18/02 10:08:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=263>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Understood</span><hr size=1> I would understand and agree with the above post, except for one thing.  Not everyone is equally dependent on grouping to increase the rate of exp.<br>
<br>
Warriors and Clerics are easily the two most group dependent classes.   This USED to be understood by VI, and compensated for by making them the most group attractive.<br>
<br>
Something changed in their thinking, and I suspect that it was the result of a lot of complaints from those who could do without a group, but didn't want to.  In my view, the lack of reward in soloable areas was one of the reasons for this.   Let's have a look at Kunark.<br>
<br>
The most soloable area for higher levels was Skyfire, the problem in my estimation was that while there was an alternative to grouping, the drops were well....pathetic.   So, druids, necros, wizards, mages would be soloing in a place like this, and the exp was coming in, but they heard of the dungeon exploits of Cleric/War/Enc plus a couple in Sebilis, where bigtime cash items were dropping, and also really nice equipment.  The grouping types were making out like bandits, while the solo types were doing something which is by nature, fairly boring and getting REALLY crappy loot as well.   Had there been some nameds which dropped nice resaleable items in those areas, or nice caster items, the incentive to force themselves on the &quot;groups&quot; wouldn't have been there.<br>
<br>
VI can't comprehend that good exp and garbage loot tables makes for bored players and empty zones.  This was proven in Luclin with zones like The Grey and Maiden's Eye, where you actually have some decent items in an outdoor soloable zone, and contrast that with The Deep, Grieg's, and Ssra where all 3 are ghost towns unless there's a guild in there raiding, or prepping for a raid, perhaps one or two soloers because the place is empty, but overall empty.   Contrast that with Candy-Shop Thule where people are motivated to go because of the excitement of the drops, the HUGE table, and the relative difficutly.<br>
<br>
So, because of these couple of factors, people wanted in groups, and to do so, they felt the need to become more attractive to those groups, and petitioned VI for some changes.    They got what they asked for, but the balance is gone.  The ones who are weakest without groups, who are also very powerful in groups were replaced, but the balance loss is in that there's no real alternative to grouping, and they didn't get the tools to enable them to go solo as an alternative.   A druid in light of the upcoming priest &quot;balancing&quot; will inevitably become a more viable group member, while pushing the cleric out further.  If trends continue, the cleric will not receive a corresponding upgrade in soloability, and will fade into the same position as warriors &quot;Overkill, and not enough utility, yet too weak to go it alone&quot;.<br>

<br>
I agree that you should not NEED a Warrior or Cleric in an experiance group. However, under most (not all) circumstances you should WANT a Warrior and Cleric in your experiance group.<br>
<br>
Both classes are group dependant just to get experiance. As a balance to this dependancy, they should bring enough to a group to justify their inclusion.<br>
<br>
While I have no problem with some melee classes being able to solo for experiance, to have them become preferable to Warriors as tanks in experiance groups as well is overdoing it a bit.<br>
<br>
If VI is going to persist in making Warriors irrelevant in all but uber mobs raids, the least they can do is to provide exp points per tick while your /lfg flag is on.<br>

<br>
Why is it that there are currently about 60 Flowing Thought items of various potency available, and about 20 items that have some kind of regeneration effect?  Some of those are MNK/BST restricted, at that.<br>
<br>
Or, consider that the top of the line Mana regeneration buff, Koadic's Endless Intellect has a duration of 2 and a half hours, compared to the hour and a half duration of Natureskin, which has a health and mana regeneration effect.  I believe the two stack, at that.<br>
<br>
Compare also the duration of various haste buffs:  Visions of Grandeur, 42 minutes.  Wondrous Rapidity, 20 minutes.  Aanya's Quickening, 24 Minutes.<br>
<br>
As the game grows and expands, the disparity between casters' and warriors' and self-sufficiency grows tremendously.  I think a great solution would be to have warriors inherently convert some fraction of mana to health... +mana items giving 1 extra HP for every 3 mana, say, and clarity-type buffs acting as health regen.  Heck, make it a high-end AA ability, on all the time.<br>
<br>
This kills a couple birds with one stone, in my opinion.

If there is a seperate Damage table for Monks. Why not make a Seperate Mitigation Table for warriors? Why not fix the HP difference with a couple more AA skills only to us?<br>
<br>
I may sound like a newb at this stuff. But why not just give us constant Defensive while giving the /disc to hybrids? People would want us more now. Arnt we suppose to take damage like that anyways? We are warriors damnit! We are born in battle. Born from sweat and blood. Why do we get hit as well as some Paladin? There should be a clear difference between us and the hybrids. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=44853">Denny_Darksavior</a>

I have had a similar arguemnt going on the Casters Realm Warrior boards with a snot nosed little pally (not all Pally's are bad.. just a few) Who came to the warrior boards looking for some kind of acknowledment as an equal tank to warriors. Well as you can well imagine this spawned Big_Argument_01 and proceded to eat up internet badwith with a totally useless, however amusing argument. IMHO what it boils down to is 3 things in order of decending importance.<br>
<br>
1. Make Taunt a little more effective on even con and higher mobs. As it sits in my huble expierience it is fairly useless right now in those circumstances.<br>
<br>
2. Place warriors on thier own defensive table apart from hybrids.  Hybrids are supposed to have small melee penalties to offset the addition of spells into the mix. I'm not asking for double the defensive capablity but give us that 10 percent we were supposed to have from the begining.<br>
<br>
3. Re-align the damage tables to put warriors back in front of Hybrids. As it stands a hybrid using some of the godly ratio weapons that are available to them only (mostly Pally/SK... most rangers suffer with the same suk weapons we do) can very easily outdamage a warrior. I wont even talk about Pally's against undead tho from a roleplay aspect I'm ok with that.. the sword of the holy should inflict serious damage agains the minions of the undead.<br>
<br>
I'm not asking to be a god, or have godlike qualities (which some call our defensive disc) All I want is to be what I'm supposed to be... THE class to have leading the group/raid into battle. Wheras hybrids should still be able to do the job, they should be SLIGHLY less efficiant than a warrior.<br>

<br>
     Looking at the state of the warrior class as a whole I think they're 95% balanced.  I come from a guild who's just leaving HoT, I'm the 3rd choice tank (after 2 warriors) for the guild and the 2nd choice puller (after our guild leader/monk) so I'd like to think I know whats going on.<br>
<br>
      Someone posted a comparison of healing classes Cleric &gt; shaman &gt; druid.  I think they're fairly balanced (with druids needing some work honestly)  I think the 3 main tanks are in the same place Warrior &gt; Paladin &gt; Shadow Knight (with sk's needing a bit of work) In both of these cases I think both warriors and clerics while the BEST at what they do need some utility or &quot;interest&quot; added via AA's, and that the druid/shads need the same but in the form of a strait power boost (to bring them more in line with their big brothers, most likely this would come in the form of spells, or maybe AA).<br>
<br>
     I've seen a lot of warriors post that the would like their taunt to be in line with a pal/sk, yet they still want to tank better/do more damage.  This imho would be out of Line since it would put Warriors above hybrids in all three catagories.  As it stands, we do taunt better, but we really shouldn't be taking agro (unless we're saving casters, or moving a mob, which are my biggest jobs on raids typically).  On the catagory of needing a &quot;uber&quot; weapon for a warrior to taunt my guilds warriors do just fine using the sword from the guy in echo (captains sword? i can never remember, it's 10/18 + stats, easy easy kill) and a decent off hand (varies between them, frosty, blood point, i swear it changes weekly =P) and neither of them even has a &quot;better&quot; agro weapon along the lines of a willsapper.  Heck, they can even hold agro with good 2h weapons (CT ones) this may do to the fact that our guild raids toghther a lot and simplely knows how to control agro, or maybe I'm missing something.<br>
<br>
     To give actual suggestions, I'd like to see a 3 level warrior AA that would give them 5/10/15% better taunting, with the third level allowing taunt to work on any mob.  (i'm GUESSING) this would put them almost equal to hybrids in taunt even without procing weapons taken into effect).  At the same time tanking hybrids (sk/pal) would be given an AA that would give us the defensive disc in 3 stages (i don't know defensives % mitigated to be quite honest, so i can't split it up).  This would leave warriors with more ac/hp/better skills, and would give hybrids some defense with spells to add a bit of utility/power.  It basically keeps the gap between us roughly the same as it is how (honestly, I think the grass is always greener, and warriors/sk's are about equal now with paladins a bit more desirable just cause they get so many tricks, so it would have to be changed a bit to make Warrior &gt; sk = pal)<br>
<br>
     One quick last note that no one seems to have said is that warriors have been given much of sk's/pals &quot;class defining&quot; utility in the form of items.  Invis, Bp/fungi heals, see invis, shrink, lifetaping/stunning weapons, etc.  Yet we don't get angry that warriors are invading our sacred &quot;tank with utility&quot; roll.<br>
<br>
     Theres of course more that could be done but I think that is an example of a good start.  If my ideas are idiotic I apologize, I am after all only 59, and in a mid-level guild, but this is how I see it)<br>
<br>
P.S. I didn't mention monks once during this simplely because it's so out of whack it shouldn't be considered, they aren't a tanking class but now they are, I'm not screaming nerf, but at some point something got way out of line. <p><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/vashtixx/rikkar6.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=129639 ">58th Revenant (my stuff) </a><br><a href="http://www.sphereofhonor.com">Sphere of Honor</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukirle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kirle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/22/02 1:35:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=273>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The State of Warriors in EQ</span><hr size=1> The point with taunt isn't that we should have to get AA to make it better but that it needs to be fixed to begin with.

Warriors have the worst aggro generation skills of any class.<br>
<br>
Fixing taunt wil not make it so you can go full out and blast a mob from the word go nonstop, it will not make it so a rogue can forget about the evade key, or other classes can forget everything and do whatever they want to. Hell it will not effect the game for the most part. Except that you could see a level 51 - 59 warrior be useable in some places that they would otherwise be a huge crippling factor in. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170513">Varaho Carnicero</a>

<br>
Okay, look.  Agro management can be done effectively using strategies not having anything to do with taunt.  I agree that taunt for warriors in the 51-59 range should be fixed a little so that they can taunt mobs slightly above them in level.<br>
<br>
If you play the game to level 60, which isn't too hard to do, and involve yourself in a guild that does raiding and gets solid equipment, the non-warrior plate wearing melee, rangers, and monks all end up very close to warriors in hit points, AC, and all have extremely useful spells or abilities that make being a warrior less useful than being anything else.<br>
<br>
SKs can pull wonderfully with FD, have a ton of useful spells.  Pallies can heal pretty much as well as a level 49 cleric at 60, and in some ways better.  They lack more than just one CH every once in a while, but those group heal spells and heal over time spells are extremely good.  Monks can FD and mend and avoid damage and regen better than warriors in most cases.  Rangers have extreme bow damage with aaxp and can be used as tanks on low melee output mobs sometimes when snare is useful.<br>
<br>
Warriors have a taunt key.  They have slightly more hit points.  That's it.  They don't have the ability to melee that much better than hybrids.  (sometimes worse)  They don't have better defensive abilities.  They don't get the ability to heal themselves or buff themselves.<br>
<br>
Agro management can be done well with a good group or smart guild.  The only thing that can improve the warrior class is better defensive skills than anyother class.  They must be able to get missed more, get hit for less when they do get hit. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20383">Hulanta</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uceelorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceelorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/22/02 1:14:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=278>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  is that so?</span><hr size=1> You all mention how a monk can mitigate damage better than a warrior (minus defensive) and that this should be changed with a new warrior only mitigation table or something similar, yet what about sk/paladins?<br>

<br>
Granted Monks probably do take less damage in many circumstances than a similarly geared/leveled SK or Pally.  But those two classes are not supposed to be the tank kings.  Tanking is something they do in addition to many other abilities.  For a warrior, all they can do is tank.  They are supposed to be the king of tanks.  More and more the game is making us equal, sometimes inferior, and sometimes situationally superior in the tanking department to other classes.<br>
<br>
If all you can do it tank, that was all you had to contribute, your class couldn't do ANYTHING else, don't you think maybe you should be REALLY DAMN GOOD AT TANKING?  Maybe even better than all other melee classes that had other things to offer you didn't?  And that should obviously be the case given similar gear/levels?  Without having to use a level 55 discipline that you could only use for 3 minutes out of every 10?<br>

Warriors do NOT believe like you do that it's currently balanced, it is currently WAY out of balance in the favor of the aggro generators precisely because there's minimal difference (some, but very minimal) in the defensive capabilities of the two types of defensive plate melee classes.  <br>
<br>
The thing that I think every single warrior here agrees on is that we should be FAR better at defense than any other class, that is what we signed up for, that's what we want, and that is what we do NOT have currently.   We are barely marginally better at defense than Pally/SK and worse than monks.  This is wrong.<br>
<br>
I don't even have a problem not being able to taunt IF we were made the #1 tanking class in the game by a margin which actually differentiated us from everyone else.<br>
<br>
The whole balance thing has alway been, sure you could outtaunt us pretty easy, but you didn't WANT to because it would be too painful, because we were better at absorbing the damage.  This is no longer the case.<br>
<br>
I personally don't see Warrior/Pally/SK as interchangeable defensive tank.  I see warrior as what should be the first choice, Pally/SK second.   By the margin that has been continually been bandied about by Pallies since 2 years ago (Pallies argued that they should be 70% warrior, 30% cleric, and were rewarded by being 93% warrior, and 30% cleric).   <br>
<br>
I personally think SK's are pretty balanced, but should be a little more offensive than they are now.<br>
<br>
7% difference in tanking ability does NOT compensate for heals, resses, buffs, root, SU, vastly superior weapons, equal armor.   <br>
