I'm wondering if anyone here is in a big guild that has completed a wide variety if not all the different types of epics. I think a rough list or any comments would be interesting to read as to how hard one epic is compared to another. <br>
<br>
From what little I can determine it seems Shamans and Rogues have some of the easiest while Mages, Necros and Warriors have very hard ones. <br>
<br>
Any input?<br>

Clearly, the rogue &amp; shaman are easiest, trailed closely by monk (which is only difficult because of the rare spawns - the actually things that you need a group to do are very easy).  Mage &amp; necro are the hardest I think.  Paladins are very hard because if you hit 53 without books youre screwed for a while.<br>
<br>
my list (from most to least difficult), would be something like this I think (btw, i'm far from an expert with this so please dont flame too hard heh):<br>
<br>
mage/necro<br>
bard<br>
paladin<br>
wizard<br>
warrior<br>
cleric<br>
ranger<br>
druid<br>
enchanter<br>
monk<br>
shaman<br>
rogue<br>
<br>
I dunno where sks fit in - I havent looked at their quest at all.<br>

Shadowknight<br>
Warrior<br>
Cleric<br>
Enchanter<br>
Ranger<br>
Druid<br>
Monk<br>
Shaman<br>
Rogue<br>
<br>
Despite how many epics exist, Magician is still the hardest and no one will ever convince me otherwise.  Getting to isle 7 in sky, and a bunch of super rare drops is just not fun.  The next 3 (wiz, pal, nec) could all be interchanged.  I put Paladin higher because even though a lot of people can kill the Kunark dragons, the books are still very very rare.  The Necro drop from Sky, which was basically the only bottleneck, was supposedly increased so this one may become easier.<br>
<br>
The middle few (sk, war, clr, enc) are pretty much in order.  I suppose some people could interchange SK and Warrior, but in my opinion the SK drops are rarer even though there are less things to get.<br>
<br>
The bottom few (rng, dru, mnk, shm, rog) are kind of a toss-up.  Rogue and Shaman are definitely at the bottom though.  I put Ranger above Druid because the trip to Sky is more time consuming than Faydedar.  And I put Druid over Monk because of all the time consuming camps, and the fact that you can kill pretty easy NPCs for the 2 robes you need. <p>~Tunare's Enforcer~<br>

warrior and mage are by far the hardest, necro is close as is wizard.  Monk, rogue and cleric are the easiest.  Paladin ranger druid bard are all relatively easy.  Shaman enchanter kind o midlevelish.<br>

<br>
1. Mage - 7th Island in Sky requires completion of bees or 30 people willing to elevator and die a bunch of first couple pulls plus DT's from sphinxes all to get 0-1 crowns sometimes. Add in Quillmane, Hate Staff, Burning Embers rarity and you have the winner of the epic timesink suck.<br>
(30 people average level 58 ) <br>
<br>
2. Warrior - Severilous is always raced. Queen of Chardok is a very difficult fight. Again having people come to Sky can be a real drawback. 3 golems may not drop the golem ball.<br>
(24-30 people average level 57)<br>
<br>
3. Wizard - Close one with Necro in terms of rarity etc. But VS is a real roadblock to most people around mid 50's. if you include MB wizzies, you throw this whole thing off anyway so ehhh. Oh yah, one crystal staff in 40 phinigels is NOT funny <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      <br>
(24-30 people average level 57)<br>
<br>
4. Necromancer - Rarity of drops is stupid. Slime Blood can take months to drop. The Keeper of souls hasnt dropped the cloak in last two tries, hi that = 48 coffins just to watch happen, plus motivating people to get up there. You run out of rangers needing swiftwind at some point <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       <br>
(24-30 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
5. Bard - Almost interchangeable with Pally. Going to go with Bard here as Trak is beyond some folks. You WILL get your scales sooner or later if you do the dragon raids. I am a firm believer in this. You can always set up and claim scales if you want it bad enough. Can still take a while.<br>
(24 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
6. Paladin - Close to the same as bard. You get your books finally and you have another week sink on Keeper of the Tombs. How lame. Personally hate this quest. You have some Hate work to do as well. Not really that tough but timesinks add up.<br>
(20-24 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
7. Shadowknight - Tough one to call. It all depends on the Hide. You get your hide, you are golden. Getting soul leech and Blade of A is just a matter of patience. The only X factor here is Lhranc. If your average level is 55 because your SK's are 50 and your warriors are 60 with high dmg weapons, no problem. Plus he doesnt regen and you can bind there so you can always zerg his ass.<br>
(20-24 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
8. Enchanter - Prince isn't exactly tough. Most people have the toughest time getting to him. The only thing about this entire quest is that stupid wraith of Shissar. This could be below Cleric in terms of difficulty, as prince is easier than Rage or King, but there has to be some sort of bias in this summary. Shissar sucks and Fear sucks and tracking in fear sucks and racing people to shissar sucks.<br>
(20-24 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
9. Cleric - Used to be a LOT higher (#3 or #4) before they gimpified Rage. Gtting to king and doing ixiblat is just a matter of having a good, not necessarily high-level raid force. The rage fight is not that tough. Again, depends on your mix of guildies, but not that tough.<br>
(20-24 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
10. Ranger - Getting to 4th Island of sky is a pain. Getting a Jade Reaver is a pain. Getting a Shattered Emerald of Corruption is a Super Pain. Put them all together and you have a druid epic with longer timesinks, but no final tough fight. This one could easily be below Druid if you get lucky with the SEoC, but hey, look at all the one sword rangers out there and you tell me...<br>
(20 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
11. Monk - The only reason this gets up here is because of the RotLC and RotWF quests. Eejag, Gwan, Trunt, Deep+Vorash+Xeno can be done in 4 hours easy. Just not that hard of epic fights, but fun.<br>
(20 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
12. Druid - nothing too difficult about this epic besides Faydedar. All other parts can be done with one or two groups easy. People usually seem to want to help with Faydedar if you bring a CoH Mage. The jade reaver requires patience.<br>
(20 People average level 55)<br>
<br>
13. Rogue - Again, not a very difficult quest. The Robe of the Kedge can take a while, assuming here that no MQ's are purchased. The general is the only difficult fight, but anyone with a modicum of initiative can set something up with other general/stanos-box needing rogues and zerg.<br>
(20 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
14. Shaman - This entire epic is fairly easy. Rak can be pet-zerged or solo'ed with a 60 warrior and some healers (hehe done it twice now) Quest can take a little patience and doing Fear can take a little while. Thank God for pick-up raids, eh?Takes less time to get a tear than loot your own Robe of the Kedge. So shaman goes below Rogue.<br>
(12 people average level 55)<br>
<br>
15. Beastlord - Haven't been through the whole thing, but it takes about a week and most of the fights are two groupable. Nothing really to wait for, you just start and keep going till you run out of gas or a quest mob isnt up.<br>
(18 people average level 55)<br>
