<br>
hmm, I think we were talking about xp groups here, where mana IS important<br>
<br>
I don't think most knights feel we need to grab aggro and tank on raids, and we realize that this is not our job.  There is a tradeoff every time you try to optimize a group.  If you want better aggro control, you need a cleric with very good mana regen and VoQ, or you might need a secondary healer.  That healer has to then stop contributing all mana to group DPS.<br>
<br>
If you want to talk about the kunark era 75/25, lets talk about the kunark era xp penalty.  Ya know how many people I saw as a troll SK level from 28 to 36 while I worked on 35 in old CT as a troll SK? It was ridiculous.  I think it took something like 2 months on my play time.  Anyone remember that?  Would I love the exp penalty back in? yes, it stops a bunch of mindless twinks and class envy. <br>
<br>
However, we are talking about PoP exp groups here.  The game has changed, evolved.  For the better? I think so.  Do you guys need help with aggro in exp groups without EB weapons? (and maybe with?)  I would say so.  However, I, just to test it out, taunted in an exp group using just lifetaps, slam, my taunt/disarm hotkey, and snaring at 15%.  Was it as effective as spamming Clinging Darkness or Terror line? No.  Did it work? Yes.  I won't deny that you guys, even the most intelligent and experienced of you, need help, but I won't stand by while you call nerf on my class because you are either ignorant or jealous.<br>

What they are asking for is improvements made to THEIR class. Do you realize what the majority of warriors want? They DONT want to be the only real choice as a tank, they want to be good enough where a group has a real tough choice between knights and warriors. Right now, knights CAN tank more than well enough in exp groups in pop AND can lock agro onto themselves far better than a warrior can. A warrior has a couple hundred more hp, and a much less reliable agro building set of skills. Hmm, who would I prefer? The sk that might take one more heal each fight but everyone else can go balls to the wall damage dealing without risk? Or the warrior who might need one less heal than the sk over the same amount of time but makes fights take longer because rogues are busy evading, shaman are waiting to debuff, clerics have to watch heal agro, and wizards cant nuke as much? Gee, thats a tough one. <br>
As far as I can tell most warriors want one of a few things. Much more hp than a knight can get, better taunt, or better innate mitigation. SOMETHING that would give warriors an innate advantage over knights to make up for knights innate ability to lock agro on themselves. Personally, im in favor of an innate damage reduction thats warrior only. After all, they are warriors. They should be tougher than any other fighting class and so, should take less damage per hit than any other. Now THAT would make for a tough choice! Do i take the knight who is a more than capable tank and can hold agro firmly, or do I take the warrior that may have a harder time with agro but takes less damage than a knight?<br>
Oh, and incidently, I agree. DAOC has a FAR superior combat system to eq. Its only downside is a lack of high end content beyond killing a single dragon for each realm and pvp.<br>

<br>
<br>
Let's do the math shall we?   I'm glad you asked this, because I like math and I like it when people ask me to do the math with regards to healing in PoP in relation to class balance.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, the old cleric method of &quot;As soon as you see the berserk message, start your CH&quot; is gone with PoP, that is simply a way to ensure a dead tank.   Generally speaking, a cleric will begin a Ch at around 50% health.   With an 800hp difference between the 2 classes, 50% health will have a 400hp difference.    <br>
<br>
Making the following assumptions:  <br>
<br>
-A cleric will begin a CH at 1/2 health<br>
<br>
-The difference in 1/2 health between the theoretical warrior and knight is 400hp.  (This is assuming that Cloak of Luclin isn't being used, which would narrow the gap even further)<br>
<br>
-Also assuming BoD isn't being used (80hp/tick x 9 ticks making 720hp recovered)<br>
<br>
-Also assuming NO taps are used (Even though we know that taps = &quot;hidden hitpoints&quot;, for the sake of the requested 'doing of the math', it'd be to difficult to estimate an average interval of casting)<br>
<br>
-Also assuming a 1.5% avoidance difference (I get hit for 550ish 1.5% less times than you do based on my increased avoidance skills)<br>
<br>
-Taking a more or less standard PoP mob which hits for 550ish double, slowed, the difference in Ch intervals is approximately 11/10, meaning that for every 10 Ch's that the warrior would need, the SK would need 11.<br>
<br>
Now, the question is... is the math done?   No, it's not, and I'll tell you why it's not, because there's other factors.   <br>
<br>
- A mob can be slowed earlier into the fight with an SK than with a warrior (see Shaman's Crucible for substantiation).   This means that the mob does approximately 70% more damage to the warrior in the beginning stages of a fight than a SK, lowering the interval difference.<br>
<br>
- If a mob is pre-slowed, the warrior can and will often lose aggro, causing an ancillary heal to need to be used.  I'll get back to the ancillary heal issue, because it's the most crucial.<br>
<br>
- If a mob RESISTS slow and the warrior cannot get aggro, additional ancillary heals must be used, and even if the warrior DOES get aggro, he's still tanking an unslowed mob, vaporiing any mitigation/avoidance/hp difference, and handing the difference to the knight.<br>
<br>
Now, as for the math again, ancillary heals cost the EXACT SAME mana as complete heal, except Supernal Light which costs MORE mana han Complete heal.   I guarantee you that Supernal Remedy is cast more than once per 11 complete heals in a PoP group with a warrior as main tank.  This completely and utterly obliterates any mitigation/avoidance/HP advantage on the part of a warrior.   Generally, in my experience, Supernal Remedy is cast once for every 3ish complete heals in PoP experience groups, meaning that EVEN IF A WARRIOR HAD FULL TIME DEFENSIVE it would cost the cleric more mana to have the warrior tank than the knight.<br>

The difference in power between knights and warriors is far greater than many (not all) knights would have us believe, and certainly greater than it should be. Do I want knights nerfed? No. I hate to admit it but I play a lvl 31 troll SK and have off and on for a long time.  I like him; he's like a warrior only useful.  What I DO want is for warriors to be significantly better than knights at our sole purpose: Tanking.  Not so much better that knights are relegated to gimp status in groups, just enough better that it's at least a tough choice between which tank you need instead of &quot;get the pally/sk, they hold aggro better&quot; which has started to be seen in raids as well as in xp groups I might add.  Warrior &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knights in raids.......yeah, sure we are, I have a bridge for sale too.  Bad enough that we've been losing the tank spot to knights in xp situations, now we're beginning to in raids as well.  And, I can't stress this enough, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>it isn't just a problem in the high end game</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. I'm 52nd level and I see it all the time.  Again, not calling for a nerf to knights, not asking to be made godlike, just want VI to make me a viable tank, not a charity case.  I gave up any and all utility (heals, dots, snares, sow, buffs, feign, sneak....the list goes on and on) to be one thing, the best tank. Right now I'm not the best tank by a longshot.<br>

Plain and simple.<br>
<br>
The long standing argument against making warriors grab aggro effectively has been &quot;It would trivialize the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
But doesn't it &quot;trivialize the game&quot; if Paladins and SK's can pretty much do that anyways? They can get and hold aggro extremely effectively. And yet, the game isn't trivialized by this?<br>
<br>
So why not just do what warriors have been asking for, for ages? Why not just FIX the warriors? Give them something that will get aggro reasonably effectively. Or something that will MANAGE aggro reasonably effectively.<br>
<br>
Sure, taunt's been fixed quite a bit from this time last year. But with the move to the planes of power, that fix to taunt has been negated by and large.<br>
<br>
Would fixing warrior aggro abilities trivialize the game? I mean, really?<br>

<br>
I agree, it wouldn't.  But it does have the Knights scared spitless that they suddenly will be ostracized as a result. What they fail to take into account is that all three plate melee tank just fine for the majority of group situations.  Even if Warriors had an ability to get earlier aggro, this wouldn't make much difference.  It would mean that people would be willing to pick up much any tank LFG rather than having a definite preference.   And it would make grouping with a Warrior less of a chore for all concerned.<br>
<br>
They feel our HP makes us more attractive, but the difference is small enough and the mobs in PoP hit hard enough, that it really doesn't make that big a difference.  If the mobs where hitting for 100 damage a swing, then 800ish more HP would make a difference.  When they're hitting for 500+, it's kind of moot.  An advantage, sure.  A huge advantage, hardly.<br>
<br>
Once you start including things like heals, life taps, additional offensive dots/nukes, stuns, snares, roots, and such, it's kind of hard to say the Warrior's 50ish more AC and 800ish more HP is so telling that he deserves to suck on initial aggro control to the extremely high degree the majority of Warriors do.<br>
<br>
We're never going to convince the Knights of this, in the majority, however. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
The argument that giving warriors a way to generate initial aggro would trivialize raid encounters is bogus.  It would change very little in the current raiding environment.   Every raid which I've tanked, aggro control has been trivial anyhow, the only exceptions being those where aggro reducer procs are implemented, which still don't do much against taunt aggro, only proc and spell aggro, and it's pretty easy to compensate for those raids.<br>
<br>
It's simply what I like to call 'the truth of the cliche'&quot;  You say something enough times and regardless of how incorrect, people still believe it.<br>

Other examples of lies passed on as truth via repitition:<br>

Warriors have a mitigation advantage over Knights<br>
<br>

Low Charisma helps with fear<br>

Consider how many spells you can cast while the warrior is waiting for his discipline to refresh. Now ask yourself how worthless they are.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>most warriors are NOT calling for nerfs on anyone<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And remember when the discussion moved to monks being better &quot;tanks&quot; than the tanks were?  And the results after that?  No, you may not be asking for nerfs, but if VI/sony feels that an encounter is balanced against existing abilities, do you honestly expect them to improve on the tanking abilities of the Warrior, and then rebalance all the conent against the new standard?  or just adjust other classes to give warriors their perceived gains in agro ability?  If it were my decision to make, I would take the path of less resistance and simply lower existing abilities, rather than have to go back and review all current content and see if it's balanced.<br>
<br>
Second thing, you cannot consider xp groups totally seperate raid groups.  Any changes made for the betterment of a class in it's Group abilities, is just magnified in a raid.  Giving warriors fast, assured agro, with the backup of the warrior disciplines would be overpowering vs content.<br>
<br>
And third, so many warriors keep saying &quot;fix&quot; warrior taunt.  Well, what is the fix?  And just how does that &quot;fix&quot; not trivialize content that is balanced against warriors abilities hedged with unsure hate generation? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://spin.emich.edu/sig/utal3.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
So basically you're saying, don't discuss problems in the game even if they impact you directly, because you're likely to get someone else nerfed as a result.  Just suck it up.  And accept the fact that we will be at a disadvantage in a group because of course giving us group balance would overpower us in raid balance.  So again, just suck it up.<br>
<br>
Do you perhaps have anything to add that isn't essentially along the lines of STFU and suck it up? <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
How is this true for warriors and NOT true for knights, who CAN taunt reliably? How is it, with a knight tanking and holding aggro like GLUE, the game is NOT trivialized, but with a warrior, anything short of ping ponging makes the game too easy?<br>
<br>
How is it, with knights making the game easy, everything is fine and hunky dory, but with warriors, it has to be hard?<br>
<br>
It sounds so much like a double standard.<br>
<br>
&quot;but if VI/sony feels that an encounter is balanced against existing abilities, do you honestly expect them to improve on the tanking abilities of the Warrior, and then rebalance all the conent against the new standard?&quot;<br>
<br>
A lot of encounters are currently unbalanced in the planes of power. From casters soloing through trash mobs in low tiers, to melees having practically nothing to do against big mobs in the top planes.<br>
<br>
I think SOE already knows its encounters are unbalanced.<br>
<br>
&quot;rather than have to go back and review all current content and see if it's balanced.&quot;<br>
<br>
They're already having to go back and review current content. Case in point, they rejiggered, Sol Ro, Rallos Zek, Xegony ... I'm sure their Rathe encounter is pretty much FUBAR. I shudder to think what people are going to encounter when they finally do break through the muddled events and the whacky coding and enter the plane of timesink.<br>
<br>
&quot;Giving warriors fast, assured agro, with the backup of the warrior disciplines would be overpowering vs content.&quot;<br>
<br>
How is this different from giving knights, fast, assured aggro?<br>
<br>
/disc defensive? A lot of warriors claim they use evasive almost as much these days.<br>
<br>
And currently having warriors unable to hold aggro reliably enough that they can't even GET groups to get XP is also broken.<br>
<br>
It needs to be fixed. As a knight, I guess you have a hard time seeing that. But seriously, understand for a moment ... casters are lazy, they do not want ping ponging when they finally show enough gumption to group.<br>
<br>
Because of this they by and large do not want warriors in their groups in the trash mob planes. What's worse is, the word is out now. So this is becoming commonplace dreck for your standard pickup group. People are believing the hype and going with knights over warriors, even warriors who can hold aggro reliably.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
It's something that needs to be tweaked, and fixed. Not a huge fix. Not a game changing, content trivializing fix. Just a fix.<br>
<br>
Fix taunt. It shouldn't be so hard should it?<br>
<br>
I'm sure many many warriors in the game would take a reliable taunt over disc defensive and enraging blow weapons. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, what is the fix?&quot;<br>
<br>
Many suggestions have been made about how to fix taunt on many threads.<br>
<br>
One of them was to make it, for warriors only, a SCALING ability that changed over time.<br>
<br>
Like monk special attacks. As monks level up, their KICK becomes Round Kick, Tiger Claw, Eagle Strike, Dragon Punch and finally Flying Kick.<br>
<br>
Well, make it for warriors, as THEY level up, taunt becomes Aggravate, Instigate, Provoke and JOMAMMA!<br>
<br>
And make it work better as they acquire these new special taunts.<br>
<br>
It's just one of the many suggestions. People have made on the myriad of threads kicking around here.<br>
<br>
&quot;And just how does that &quot;fix&quot; not trivialize content that is balanced against warriors abilities hedged with unsure hate generation? &quot;<br>
<br>
Well two things: 1) Content is already trivialized by Paladins and Shadowknights in regards to aggro and hate generation. It won't really affect much to FIX taunt other than giving warriors the FIX they need to be slightly more effective in groups. In other words, BALANCING warriors so that Warriors, Paladins OR SK's can do the same job in groups. Right now, there are frequent times they can't. The TRIVIAL aggro holding abilities of knights or at least the HYPE about them, is making warriors less desirable.<br>
<br>
2) By fixing taunt, it balances the game a little bit. Why is this such a bad thing to knights? What is it knights fear so damn much about a warrior being able to keep a mob from ping ponging a little more reliably than they currently do?<br>

From their perspective, quite a few are correct. After all, considering we have about 1500hp more than knights, higher AC (because as we all know, AC exceeding the soft cap is tremendously important), deal about 20-30% more damage than knights, and have far better mitigation due to our separate tables, and the super godly /disc defensive that apparently allows us to survive being hit full-force by a battering ram while knights get killed by the wind alteration tha ram's forward progression causes. Indeed, considering all of our massive advantages listed in the last sentence, giving us improved agro will surely break Everquest, especially considering knight spells are utterly useless.<br>
<br>
Of course, none of what was said above is true. Parses, logic and factual evidence collected since the introduction of SoL has disproved every point listed. Yet. so many knights are arrogant enough to stand firmly behind those RoK/SoL notions. If they can't accept those facts, what chance do we have of possibly conveying the necessity for improved agro to them. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Wilhelmm D'averam<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Overlord of the Apocalypse</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
