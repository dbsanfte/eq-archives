Advice! </span><hr size=1> I tired it 47 times before I got to boss mob. On the 48th, 49th and 50th tries we each got to the boss mob. Our makeup was really no better than it normally was considering the classes we had for it. Our cleric had a little more mana and the mage we had also had epic plus decent mana pool. Execution is the easiest of all the trials.<br>
The problem with the trials for the most part the other 47 times was people misusing mana or casters ping ponging the mobs. All casters must no how to minimize aggro. All tanks must no how to target fast. All melee must know how to assist right and quickly. If you are doing pickup groups its not easy to find a combination of players together that know their classes and their roles in doing this. It takes a group that is totally in sync to do this. Its not an easy thing to pass, if a player is power levelled through the trials, they may not be ready for the tier two zones. In fact those who are capable of passing the trials with a pickup group are capable of playing in these zones.<br>
<br>
Some of the highlights from my 50 tries in the trials...<br>
-I had a monk charge in front of me before the spawns saying that he could tank the mobs if he wanted to. Needless to say we never got past one mob.<br>
-In the first 23 tries, I had 20 tries where the casters were way on the other side of the room and not getting up with me when they cast. Needless to say, we lost each time we had to do that.<br>
-Many times we never made it passed the third round because casters were out of mana. They didn't really know how to efficiently cast nor did they know which spells to use.<br>
-Had to wait one time for 4 and a half hours to go once. Had a phenomenal group stacked with some 65 mages and high damage classes. 4 groups in front of us passed and we had to reform a couple of times. When we got to the platform and were ready a group decided to kill steal their way into the trials and they passed it. At that point our high level group disintegrated and we had to reform into a crappy group.<br>
-In 50 tries I died a total of 5 times. One time was twice in the same trials from being rezzed into a full spawn.<br>
-Each time the boss mob spawned I had to kite him to help casters and healers generate more mana. I learned the most effective way to do this is to run him all the way around the room (keeping wall on right), and stopping for a split second each time I would reach the wall farthest from the platform, then continuing again.<br>
<br>
As far as what you need to do, it might help if you and friends each hit one more level. Also go in with two rogues and an ench or a rogue and a mage and an ench or something like that. Stay away from wizzies is best advice I can give you. Most wizzies I found have levelled by quad kiting and they think Kite all the time. You can go in with a druid, but if the druid says that they are nuking only, don't trust them, they don't realize that druids have a good heal because its meant to be used. Plus these druids nuke usually because they are used to kiting as well. If your cleric friend doesn't have a good mana pool then get her or him equipment to have a large mana pool. Don't use complete heals at all until the boss mob. Use Supernal Elixur as heals or Supernal Remedy. It is lower aggro and does the healing job with less mana useage. Go in with mod rods. On the last round hold nothing back, have cleric nuke if need be. You can kite the boss mob for 30 minutes if you need  to get mana back. While you are kiting boss mob have cleric heal you with a low aggro heal each time you pass by or when you need it. Have mage kill pet right after final round until you are ready to engage the boss mob. It will aggro the boss mob before you have the mana to fight it. Get each of the casters a low level horse for medding while they fight. Don't get unlucky and draw three or four rocks in any of the rounds. Really they seem to be on a cycle. If you go in after one or two groups just passed I believe your chances of drawing a lot of rocks on one round are less. Always banish when you can. It will save your group a lot of mana. Don't do the trials with 14 year olds. Do it with college kids or with those who are mature enough and know their classes. Watch for players that know their classes well and play them well. You will want to make a group with these players at some point. Don't be stuck on having to do the trials with your friends exclusively. If one of you passes that is going to help the others. If you don't have a good group, don't go in with them. If you have a bad player in your group, leave the group. You aren't going to pass it anyways with bad players, so no reason to waste your time with them. Better to have LFG on while in there rather then being in a sorry group. One time I was asked to tank for an uber guild that was going to PL some of their players through because I had LFG on. Problem was they got one of their 65 warriors to tank it instead of me, but I did make some contact with them and they would have been willing to help me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=iskandaralazeem>Iskandar Alazeem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of the Battlefield</BR>STEEL WARRIOR Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1018<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/2/02 1:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Trials!!!

<br>
1. Get as many buffs as you can - For example if you don't have a paladin in you group get bmb from someone there or ask a friend to come buff you.<br>
<br>
2. Buy/make/steal a damage shield potion.  The easiest way to increase your dps - also stacks with a ds buff get a buff as well if no one in your group can cast a ds get one just before going in.<br>
<br>
3. Target the next mob quickly - F8 is your friend.  Time your not hitting a mob is wasted time.  Try to kill rock mobs first - but if you can don't fret it kill whatever you targeted. Do NOT switch targets you don't have time.<br>
<br>
4. DPS is important but not as important as working together.  To give you an example we got to the 3rd mob on the 4th wave with war, sk, sk, necro, enc, cler the mob was at 4% painful but would have been doable if it wasn't 4am and people just a little tired.<br>
<br>
5. In this little escapade you are in charge - don't be afraid of taking control.<br>
<br>
6. As a general rule of thumb do not allow hydras.  Sure it can be done hydra, but I don't think most people have the skill to do it.<br>
<br>
7. Everyone must stay close if everyone is close all the mobs are close.  If all the mobs are close your not wasting time running around finding your next target.<br>
<br>
8. When you are killing a mob use your F9 views and plan your next target.<br>
<br>
It can be done with a pick-up group.  After 20+ attempts I finally succeeded with a pick-up group.  Everyone must plan on doing it at least 3 times for a pick-up group to really succeed.  You'll probably fail the first time one like the first wave as everyone gets used to you being in charge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glatius2>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 601<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/2/02 2:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Suggestions</span><hr size=1> Its important for the MT to try and get agro early, having eveyone stand behind the MT is a good idea, maybe all the way to the back wall initially, while you stand near the front of the benches.<br>
<br>
Moving from target to target quickly is more important than selecting a particular target (as was previously said).  If you see a likely mob nearby that would make an attractive target, go for it, otherwise just pick the closest.<br>
<br>
Have anyone with cure disease keep it up, having the slows cured as quickly as possible is important.<br>
<br>
Everyone must work on killing the same mob at the same time, no exceptions.  There is very little room for error on this.<br>
<br>
Crowd control is nice, but not required.  Root crowd control can and does work.  AE slows are nice as well if you have a shaman available.<br>
<br>
Have the cleric use CH only on the boss mob at the end.  Otherwise heals over time usually are the better choice.<br>
<br>
The Warrior really needs to save their defensive discipline for the boss mob, he hits hard and fast.  <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
i stand between the benches with everyone else back near the execution platform.  as soon as they spawn i mash my /target a_dark hotkey and if there is one, it will be targeted and i jump on him right away.  then i hit F9 while i'm fighting him to see what the other 3 mobs are.  if it's just the fiends, i just F8 the rest of the mobs when the stone guy is dead.  if there's more stone guys, i mash my target hotkey again and jump on the next stone guy.  i usually kill named ones last since they have a bit more HP and thus the dammage shield hitting them the whole fight will help by the time i get to him.<br>
<br>
make sure when you're clerics heal or shamans slow or chanter CC, that they are standing right next to you.  if they're doing it from the platform, the mobs are gonna run after them, and you'll lose valuable time having to run to them.  don't let your healers heal you when you're low health because it will cause bad aggro for them, and there's no room to pull aggro off anyone and still win the fight unless war has AE taunt.<br>
<br>
DO NOT use defensive before boss mob, no matter how bad things look, you'll need it for him at the end till he gets slowed.<br>
<br>
don't bring people who can't follow directions or are kinda lazy/slow reaction players.  i also don't recommend bringing anyone lower than level 58. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=breoganeq>BreoganEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/02 3:04 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.terra.es/personal5/entilzha/Wolf.jpg width=100 height=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Trials!!!

<br>
61 Cleric (No PoP spells), 61 Shaman (No PoP spells), 64 Ranger (EQ / AM3), 63 Ranger(EQ / AM3), 59 Mage (No epic) and 64 Paladin.<br>
<br>
We teared through the trial. I was playing wife's ranger (63 one) to get her flagged and did it pretty fast. We failed 1st attempt because the group that failed Exe before us didn't leave the room, and when we ported up our cleric got left behind. Managed to make it to 3rd wave before we lost our shaman tho <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Usually paladin would sit before each wave started, so when the mobs spawned all came for him. Then shaman would cast Tigirs on the mob the paladin had chosen (getting the others too) and tanks 2 of the mobs. The mage puts the pet in one of the adds and helps with nukes to kill the paladin's mob and the rangers assist him.<br>
Rangers used disc on 3rd and 4th wave respectively, to help with mana for the named executioner.<br>
<br>
When the boss spawned the paladin was low-hps and got killed before slow landed, so the 64 ranger had to tank him.<br>
<br>
Was pretty funny <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11869&amp;resize=true">Breogan Wolfheart</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.tunare-europa.co.uk/tide">Overlord of Tide</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brokkah>Brokkah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/02 9:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Trials!!!  Advice! </span><hr size=1> My group was 61 cleric, 61 warrior (me), 61 druid, 60 enc, 61 ranger (no EQ or AM3, tried trueshot but arrows were poofing), 62 bst (with paragon). Epic/HoT level gear, no special toys really. I had a 60 shaman buff us before we went in, + primal avatar on the ranger right before we ported in. I'd never done it before but the other guys had tried it.<br>
<br>
We had everyone huddle up in between the benches, nearest the end where exe spawns. When a wave spawned I picked a target and started on it. Generally if we only had 1 rock i would leave it to be banished later, but if we got 2 i would start on one immediately. Each mob after that was F8 target, call assist instantly. We had the enc chain stunning so dmg taken was minimal. The druid called the pace of the fight by watching the executioner, and slowing/upping the pace of nukes, or if needed banishing a rock. Cleric did heal over time and added nukes when exe got close to prisoner.<br>
<br>
1st attempt we failed on the last mob of wave 4, by about 2 seconds, due to the bst getting dazzled and a resisted banish.<br>
<br>
2nd attempt was flawless to 4th wave when the enc died, but bst pet off tanked a bit whilst we cleared the final few.<br>
<br>
Boss mob I'm ashamed to say I died to enrage lol. Still we had enough juice left in the group to finish him off <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baledoricewalker>Baledor Icewalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/02 10:15 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.terstai.net/images/Balepic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Trials!!!

They have to cast res twice on the corpse, 1st cast will pop you to the tribunal area and 2nd cast will bring you into trial area. Res is the only way to get in before the body poofs and you lose the work you have done.  <p><img src="http://www.terstai.net/~terstai/images/Baledorsig2.jpg"><BR> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=402751" target="_blank">My Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azlanaicelander>Azlana Icelander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sexies Warlady in all o'Norrath</BR>     ...an da moon too!</BR>Steel Warrior Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 505<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/02 6:43 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.ringofshadows.org/images/Azlana7.jpg width=96 height=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Trials!!!
