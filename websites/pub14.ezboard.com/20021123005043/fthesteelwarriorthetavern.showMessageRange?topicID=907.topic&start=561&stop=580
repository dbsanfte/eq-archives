I absolutely agree that it is rude.  It's not something I would ever, ever do.<br>
<br>
But according to the guys at Paladins of Norrath, it happened.  And it happened a lot.<br>
<br>
After all, xp &quot;grinding&quot; as it is often known, is about getting the max amount of xp during the short amount of time you have to spend.  Some people see the efficiency (xp per unit of time) as being more important than anything else, including the people they group with.<br>
<br>
Understand, I don't think I ever had this experience personally, but I did experience long wait times /LFG in the Kunark Era.  I'd see groups looking for tanks, and ask if I could join, only to be rebuffed because &quot;we're looking for a warrior.&quot;  Didn't happen a lot, because I didn't pickup group much, but it did happen, and at levels as low as the late teens, early twenties.  I can only imagine how depressing it must have been for higher level paladins.<br>

Face it guys, you are PALADINS, not warriors, you should in no way be close to equal tanks as warriors. &quot;<br>
<br>
That quote was taken from this thread a few pages back. It is the sentiment we paladins hear warriors asking for.<br>
<br>
disecting the whole quote.<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;Paladins make excellent tanks now and even if warriors got upgraded to being better than paladins AS IT SHOULD BE&quot; <br>
<br>
Warriors are better at absorbing damage then paladins right now.  Margin is debateable but warrior &gt; paladin when absorbing damage.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;paladins will still make excellent tanks on the frequent occaisions when a warrior is not there&quot;<br>
<br>
Two things wrong with this statement.  <br>
1 how often are warriors frequently not in a zone that drops good traditional group exp?<br>
  <br>
Seldom.<br>
<br>
2 paladins are only to be used when warriors aren't there?<br>
<br>
This statement is what realy peaves me off.  I believe the job should go to a warrior only if he meets one of three things.<br>
1 He has a better personal reputation <br>
2 He's 1 lvl higher then the paladin.<br>
3 The group needs extra damage.<br>
<br>
The paladin should be picked if<br>
1 He has the better personal reputation<br>
2 He's 1 lvl higher<br>
3 The group needs extra utility <br>
<br>
----------------------<br>
A show of hands please?<br>
<br>
How many warriors agree with the following?<br>
1 In the last few months warriors' once sol ownership to the tank role has been deminished by paladins, shadowknights, monks, rangers, rogues?<br>
<br>
Would you agree the only viable alternitive other then a warrior to most exp group tanks should have been the paladin and shadow knights?<br>
<br>
I support warrior and paladins and shadowknights being moved to their own def table with the warrior haveing a small lead on it over the other two classes. &lt;-- like rogues and monks have on offensive<br>
<br>
I support a minor upgrade to taunt such as a AA ability to make it give you from 10% to 35%ish chance of getting a free instint double check on taunt when you push taunt button.<br>
<br>
I'd support warriors getting a AA ability to get their &quot;bash&quot; to recieve a 25% faster refresh timer on it.  This would increase both taunting a bit and soloing ability a bit by use of getto bashing tactics for all warriors.<br>
<br>
What of this do you warriors support?<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Why am I advocateing small steps?  Two folds.  1 I honestly don't see my warrior friends broken in either raids or exp groups but with the monty haul end game I see these only as clarifying class balance.  2 With small steps my fear of haveing to ask vi for two years to fix paladins is laid to rests.<br>
<br>
I will also promise if I find warriors to be lfg at zone lines over paladins then I'll return here and support even more warrior small upgrades.  Look at paladins we've become balanced because of small steps. <br>
<br>
Please also remember the lack of exp groups for warriors are currently also increased by these facotors<br>
1 AoE groups and Soloing are what many post 50 classes are doing.  Warriors do to their specialization don't offer much to these types of situations.<br>
2 Warriors are currently by far the most played tank class.  That means if the servers come on line there will be 10 warriors logging on and 3 shadow knights and paladins.  Which means the tanks lfg are 10 warriors and 3 hybrids and this has nothing to do with current eq balance.  It's a left over from eq unbalance.<br>
<br>
Now on raids warriors role is primarily tanking and secondary damage.  Paladins combat AoE damage primarily and help keep mt alive so healing rotation comes into play.  Our secondary role is to help out with crowd control if adds/pops happen.<br>
<br>
What does SU3 give paladins?  After 60 lvls and a bunch of aa points we can finaly go and finish the rest of the aa points solo.  Does it make us monsters on undead boss mobs?  There be almost no boss mobs classified as undead so this is just eyecandy.<br>
<br>
What should warriors invest in??  A good 2hander for when not the primary tank.  You're skills still out perform paladins.  We all have the same access.<br>
<br>
As for 1handers? paly no get dual weilding and that's why our dam/delay is so much better yet there be no wise paly useing these for anything other then getting hp/ac when we slip into mt positions n need the hp/ac of them.<br>
<br>
Please don't under sell your AoE taunt.  This is a god send for tank transferance.  No other tank has this ability n seeing how both paladins and shadowknights have always owned taunt it's a huge infringement into our territory.  Yet we accept it because <br>
1 We don't run vi doh.<br>
2 We see it as adding depth to warriors.  If vi incrreases your ability to AoE taunt useing more then you currently have then I'll call foul but currently this doesn't break the game or threaten my paladins comparable ability.  Just like SU3 doesn't threaten anyone other class.<br>

99% of the thread is talking about raids, not exp groups.  COMPLETELY different matter.  and yes for your other question.  they have other things they can do besides tank, so use whos best at tanking to tank.<br>
<br>

faster bash would be a bonus, a toy.  an upgrade that would help lower level warriors that are still IN balance, not lvl 60 warriors that have insane gear and still cant tank as good as monks.  taunt, they need to fix whats broken, not double it.  it still only puts you even with whoever is highest agro no matter how many times you push it.<br>
<br>
*What should warriors invest in?? A good 2hander for when not the primary tank. You're skills still out perform paladins. We all have the same access.*<br>
paladins quite often outdamage warriors using 2h weapons, especially ones tanking that use @#%$ like gnoll hide lariats to hold agro.  dont try and give advice to other classes you have never played..<br>
<br>
a couple final things.<br>
1.  quit with the exp group whine bullshit!!!  exp groups at lower levels have always been fairly well balanced, its the very high end raiding that jacks the balance up.<br>
<br>
2.  ae taunt is only as good as it is because regular taunt is almost USELESS its so broken.  we have no other really good class aa skills to match up with other classes like dire charm or manaburn.  most warriors dont worry about it because they want the class fixed before worrying about extras... you brought it up.  ae taunt makes me able to taunt properly once every 15 minutes. (also, warriors are the only meelee without physical enhancement)<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm quite sure that a level 60 paladin with NO AA is no threat to a level 60 warrior in the realm of tanking.  It's only once the paladin gets Combat Fury 3, Combat Stability, Combat Agility, Natural Durability, and Physical Enhancement that he's really infringing on the warrior.<br>
<br>
So if the level 60 paladin is a better main tank than the level 60 warrior it's precisely because of AAXP that it is so.  And what better way to fix that than with more AAXP?<br>
<br>
Also, here:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> *Warriors are better at absorbing damage then paladins right now. Margin is debateable but warrior &gt; paladin when absorbing damage.*<br>

You plainly either misunderstand or intentionally twist Seventhswords statements.  What he says is &quot;everyone agrees that warriors take damage better than paladins, but the degree to which they are better is debateable&quot;<br>
<br>
Your response that there should be no debate is, umm, to be polite, foolish.  There is still debate about how Taunt works, after 3 years.  There is still debate about where the AC &quot;softcap&quot; (point of drastically diminishing returns) is, after six to 9 months of discussion.  I find it impossible to believe that you think that EVERYONE should have the same number in mind when they say &quot;warriors tank better than knight classes by X percent.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some people would say 10%.  Others might say 20% or 25%.  I say it depends on the warrior and the knight and their gear and their skill as a player.  That means that it's DEBATEABLE from player to player what the MARGIN is.<br>
<br>
Also, you say that &quot;paladins outdamage warriors especially when warriors are using crappy weapons like gnoll hide lariats for aggro.&quot;  Seventhswords point (which you have evaded in the past as well) is that, if you KNOW you won't be the main tank, then take a high end 2 hander, and make yourself a damage class.  You're exactly right that paladins are outdamaging warriors who use crappy weapons.  Whose fault is that?  The paladins for doing more damage?  Or the warriors for failing to adjust and use more damaging weapons?<br>

<br>
No, Talasar, YOU are missing the point.<br>
<br>
If you aren't the main tank, then you can up your DPS to be BETTER than a knight class by using a 2 Hander.<br>
<br>
If you aren't the main tank, you don't NEED aggro (unless your a Rampage tank or standy Second Assist).<br>
<br>
Lemme try it this way.<br>
<br>
Main tank = needs aggro<br>
Not main tank = Doesn't need aggro<br>
<br>
needs aggro = needs crappy weapons for aggro generation<br>
doesn't need aggro = can use high damage 2handers to up damage output<br>
<br>
Therefore<br>
Not main tank = doesn't need aggro = can use high damage 2hander to improve damage output.<br>
<br>
I don't think I can make it any simpler than that.<br>

Warriors give up EVERYTHING to do out job, including using good weapons for crappy weapons that happen to proc something that generates aggro.  Who's the more effective tank?  Someone using a Gnoll Hide Lariats just to try to hold aggro or someone who can use a 50/50 2h weapon and hold aggro even better? <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

<br>
But warriors shouldn't ever do anything but be main tank, and should never, ever aspire to do damage?<br>
<br>
Okay, guys.  You have two roles you can play.  You can be main tank, or you can hide behind the mob like all the other melee's and put in your damage.  And if you choose weapons fit for the first role, but end up doing the second role, then you screwed yourselves.<br>
<br>
I understand your point that a warriors role is to be main tank.  But hey, guess what?  that means theres only ever a need for one warrior at a time!  What if there's two warriors in a group, or on a raid?  is the other one just standing around dual wielding his main tank weapons, hoping the first tank will die, so he can jump in and be main tank?  or is he doing his best to contribute to the group/raid and doing the most damage he can?<br>
<br>
If you've limited yourself to fulfilling one aspect of your class while disregarding the potential of your other aspect, you have no room to tell paladins that they have all this &quot;utility.&quot;<br>

<br>
The point is, warriors who aren't in the MT rotation are dead weight. <br>
<br>
You saying we have a choice to go &quot;rogue&quot; on a mob is smoke and mirrors. Sure I can do decent damage, but I am not the &quot;melee nuke&quot; that rogues or rangers can be. I tank, it's what I'm equipped for. Remove that and you remove my reason for taking a spot in a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
Every other class bring something else to the table besides their primary ability, warriors bring one thing and one thing only. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9966>Roehm Ironwolf </a><BR>

warriors have very weak meelee damage, not like were overpowered or anything like that.  we get outdamaged by just about every damage class save bards and petless mages/necros/beastlords<br>
<br>
especially coming from paladins.  we BARELY outdamage them using the same weapon, and quite often they outdamage us with their paladin only weapons.  i've seen my guildmates prove it before, i've seen parses of it.<br>
<br>
and yes i still think that 'warrior = best tank' should be true and not debateable.  as it stands, its not just debateable how much, but, which one is best is also debateable in most lucin fights.  my guild still uses warriors to tank everything out of habit, but i have seen times when we shouldnt..<br>
<br>
noone said paladins with 100aa and great gear shouldnt be better tanks than warriors who just leveled, but between equal knights and warriors... the warrior should tank better.  (equal meaning:  same level of equipement and aa skills)<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;If you aren't the main tank, then you can up your DPS &gt;to be BETTER than a knight class by using a 2 Hander.<br>
<br>
This statement would only be true if we had access to equivalent weapons, but we don't, so the point is moot.  Your skill level difference is already compensated for with superior weaponry.<br>
<br>
You are correct though in terms of dishing out damage when not being MT.  I ALWAYS switch to 2h weapons when not tanking, as it increases my value TO the raid by dealing a ton more damage over the course of the fight.  <br>

Warrior thread?<br>
<br>
Warriors are tanks, knights can be tanks and a bunch of other things.<br>
<br>
This thread is about making it so warriors can actually tank for a group, for a raid, etc.  Right now we do a poor job getting, holding agro as compared to ANY other class as per design.  We also mitigate damage pretty much the same as any other class in the high end game thanks to game mechanics.  We avoid damage worse than some other classes thanks to game mechanics.<br>
<br>
Warriors can still be a tank.  I do it sometimes for my guild, so I know we can do it.  Honestly, I shouldn't be.  It would be much smoother to have almost any other melee class do it outside of rogues on any mobs except the hardest hitting ones with limited healing support.<br>
<br>
I made a warrior so I could battle the baddies toe-to-toe.  I don't want to stand behind the mob whacking it.  I do it as needed, but I want to be tanking.<br>
<br>
I am not talking about paladins or any other class in this plea.  I signed up to be the best tank, and I am not, and I am sad. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20383">Hulanta</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utoren2k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>toren2k</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/02 7:39:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=579>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Another Angle</span><hr size=1> Today in ct at 4c i was asked by my group to let the paladin tank as he could hold aggro alot better than me, guees i felt abit useless.

<br>
Hybrids as they stand are ok as they are, but warriors are not.  I feel if a defence goes up, ac soft cap goes up(for warrirors only), hps go up, dmg output goes up....this might make a step to remedy the situation.  <br>
<br>
Not all of these though they are just suggestions.  <br>
<br>
As far as the argument of monk/SK/Paladin versus warrior in group......forgive me if you feel I am wrong but in many situations a warrior SHOULD have more defensive capabilities/offensive capabilities by a fair shot.  <br>
<br>
Paladins may well have got screwed in Kunark, but they werent overly bad, SKs - well they are ok, often had good weapons etc.  <br>
<br>
The penalties warriors suffer are no spells, no heals, no FD, no dots absolutely nothing to save you like root, snare (unless you got a proccing weapon).  <br>
<br>
Post Velious - you can add to that list:  dmg output, challenging our rightful spot as a tank from paladins/SKs/Monks all of which were and are versatile classes. <br>
<br>
I do think they should tank to a certain degree but next to a warrior they shouldn't even be in the same league.  <br>
<br>
As a comparison.......where's the substitute for a cleric ???? well ya have a 60 paladin they can heal quite well - but say your fighting in DN for instance a paladin wouldnt cut it as healer(unless you were really careful).  <br>
<br>
Okies another one.....wheres the subtitute for an enchanter ??? - Bard ? They cant mez even close to an enchanter....very few bards have even come close to an average enchanter in ability for me.   Bards sorta move into their own at higher level anyway and become a separate class.  <br>
<br>
Paladins - The versatile role, 2nd tank, support healer and buffer, protection of the groups casters with stun and their taunting abilities....LoH. <br>
<br>
SKs - The versatile role, 2nd tank, supporting casters, pulling, dotting and protection of the groups casters with their taunting abilities...HT. <br>
<br>
Monks - Versatile Role, 2nd tank, damage output, self healing, pulling.<br>
<br>
Warriors - Single roll - Tank, soak up all the groups/raids damage, average damage output.<br>
<br>
Warriors will never have a versatile roll, our job is to tank thats it.   We don't have a choice, we chose warriors because we are used to do nothing else.  <br>
<br>
We need to be pushed ahead of SKs and Paladins, purely because of our inflexibility as a class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
