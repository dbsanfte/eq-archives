<br>
What makes Furor (from FoH) better than that other 60war that didn't make it into FoH?<br>
<br>
Assuming you have two warriors, both the same level, exact same equip, same race, same hp, same ac, same atk, same skills (1hs, Taunt, Swimming, etc.) would would put warriorA over the edge? What would warriorA have to know to make him a better warrior?<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is because, quite frankly, I'm tired (as a Half Elf) of being passed up for a &quot;better&quot; warrior simply because they have a bit better gear or are a Ogre or something. Or because the Ogre has the cliche warrior armor: full crusty, 2 lammies, 65hp ring, CC ears, he must be better because everyone else has seen that stuff before (whereas I have a mix of stuff, only 2 pcs of crusty left [and I'm about to replace the arms, leaving only the legs]) So I can't be as good of a warr because I have all this crazy armor that people have never heard of.<br>
<br>
Your level and equipment is a big part of how good you are, but if you are close in those respects, SOMETHING has to make one warrior better than the other - what is that SOMETHING?<br>
<br>
I know if there is me vs. a level 46 war w/ fungi, full planar/thurg armor, 10/18 and a frosty, 8th coldain ring, djarns ring, etc. he's going to take my spot whereever we go no matter how EBAY'ed he is (which brings up another point, how do I convince people that I'm better than Ebayed_n00b_01 even though his equipment is leagues ahead of mine?)<br>
<br>
I've been reading this boards for awhile and I've learned alot, and they are helping me learn new and good things that have helped me alot. And I want to make myself the absolute best warrior I can be, whenever I put the LFG tag on, I want people to be fighting over which group I should go to, I want my rep to be a legendary one. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Baadan! He's the guy who saved that &lt;insert zone here&gt; raid last month! Man if it was for that &lt;thing&gt; he did, the whole raid would've wiped!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Get Baadan! Screw that 50warrior he's @#%$ to Baadan, man that kid has some l337 skeelz!&quot;<br>
<br>
blah blah you know what I mean, kinda like walking around and seeing a very well-respected person on your server (leader of resident uber guild or something) you know if that person goes LFG, people are going to kill to get him, simply because his grasp of the game is so in-depth, nothing goes wrong when he is around.<br>
<br>
Well, I could go on forever but I think I'll stop here, hopefully I got my point across. <p><table  width="40%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<br>
That is just my opinion however, some people might like a Warrior never to talk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Be aware of things like warping points, mobs abilities, spells, drops, locations, quests, etc.  While this may seem like a ton of knowledge, this will help you with any other EQ character you play.<br>
<br>
Most people who have never played a warrior or who don't respect warriors think all we have to do is mash auto attack and hit taunt every time it refreshes.  I think we all know there's simply more to our class than just hitting things.  Every class should learn these things, but many just forget about it and concentrate on getting that uber stuff.  <br>
<br>
A warrior's primairy goal is agro control, and second is hit points.  Agro control is the most useful thing you can learn, and will make you well known and respected in the higher end portion of the game.  One thing you should know is to trust your taunt, and not rely on the taunt key.  Yes, max the skill, but don't hit it every time it refreshes.  Save it for when the shaman slow's and the enchanter tashes.<br>
<br>
Your Hp/AC are a direct result of your equipement.  With that in mind, you need to save as much money as you can to keep your equipement up.  Now you probably won't beable to buy everything you want (SBoZ HoH please Santa!), but you should try your best to make sure you use your money to keep your equipement up.  Things like getting haste, 6/65 rings, some basic resist gear, decent weapons, ect, are all things you should put your money into.  You do what ever you can to get as much agro, HP and AC as you can.  The more of those you have, the better a warrior you can be.  Will you be able to keep up with ebayers?  Probably not, but you can do just as well after they die, and pick up their slack.<br>
<br>
The road to being a good warrior is a hard one, espically since we all had to deal with the twinks out there who at lvl 5 had CoF's and CBoL's.  But the lessions you learn about the game from not being power leveled will help you greatly in this way.  Also, keep an eye on the ebayers as they will teach you the wrong way to do thing and save you the death learning from their mistakes. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=31658">Raun Stonecutter 55 Warrior</a>

As a warrior you can end up being the puller for the party many times, more so at lower levels because you can survive longer taking hits and make it back to the group alive.  In this regard you learn about mobs, spawns, tricks and tactics.  <br>
<br>
Also there are little things you can do that make you stand out.  For example, do you have a magic shield?  Since only big races get slam and kick doesnt have a stun component until level 55, learning to ghetto bash caster mobs is a big plus to many people.  Bash is a stun and interrupting casters is always a nice thing especially those pesky cleric mobs.  Back in the 40s and early 50s people seemed pleasantly surprised when I would swap in a shield and bash-interrupt mobs.<br>
<br>
Other little things I can think of:<br>
<br>
- Multiple &quot;incoming&quot; messages letting the group you have 1 or multiple mobs coming and if possible able to quickly point out which mob you'll be on to give the CC person a heads up on which to target for mez or root.<br>
<br>
- Have an assist button and always use it if you're not the main tank<br>
<br>
- Be aware of mob positioning.  Are you pushing the mob in a bad direction?  Is the mob's back open for rogue backstabs?  Especially at raids, you'll see everyone but the main tank hitting the mob from behind.  This means of course the mob is being pushed at you.  Therefore, you can direct the mob where you want him to go by having your back face that direction.<br>
<br>
- Use the F9 key to be aware of your surroundings when needed.<br>
<br>
- Save the taunt key for moments when you lose aggro, not just hit it as soon as it pops up everytime.<br>
<br>
- Later on when you get disciplines, have a feel for when you think you should use it and dont be afraid to use it if you deem necessary.<br>
<br>
- Sometimes sacrifice is necessary.  What's more important, that you make it to zone when there's a train or the cleric that's gonna be able to rez you and everyone else make it safely?  Or if you're pulling and you know you have too many mobs on you and you cant zone, just die rather than bring them all to group and wipe them out too.<br>
<br>
- Crystalized Pumice Stone is your friend.  In certain situations, pulling with one you can do some fun stuff. e.g. Seb Crypt<br>
<br>
- Have a personality.  Sometimes, the best conversations come from random people you meet while exp'ing and sometimes groups lead to friendships.<br>
<br>
Reputations are made over time and it's mostly by your grouping experiences.  There are people I still remember from leveling in my 40s and 50s whether it was good or bad.  In certain zones like for example Overthere, Lower Guk and Karnor's you can group with the same people multiple times.  While I dont think you'll ever have a legendary reputation, one good grouping experience may go a long way later on down the road. <p><Table Style='Filter: Alpha(Opacity=100, FinishOpacity=50, Style=2, StartX=85, FinishX=20, StartY=0, FinishY=0)'><B><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6495" target="magelo"><Font Color=#FFCC33 Size=3 Face=Times New Roman, Helvetica>Rula - warh0bbit, esq.</Font></a><br><a href="http://www.shattered-sorcery.com/blight/" target="Blight"><Font Color=CC00FF><i>&#60Blight&#62, Vazaelle</i></Font></a><br></B></Table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uroehm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roehm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will KICK YOUR @$$</span><br>  Posts: 471<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/17/02 11:56:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=950.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_atk.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: What Makes A Good Warrior?</span><hr size=1> To sum up all the long posts above...<br>
<br>
A warrior <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> his gear. Yes, yes, I know knowledge is king, but without my gear I am as useless as a pala...errr...gnome monk.<br>
<br>
You need to read up, study, know the game, know the mobs, the zones, your abilities, and your class. Alot of this knowledge is bought with virtual blood. This is why Ebay'ers, who do not know the game, are frowned upon. They didn't earn, and hence do not have, the knowledge to play their class.<br>
<br>
The solution to this is to earn you spurs, son. <br>
<br>
We all did.<br>
<br>
Prove to a group of five others you are the walking hand of god to strike down with furious vengence and great anger those who seek to harm your brethren. <br>
<br>
Word will spread. <br>
<br>
You will become known as a warrior who can walk thru blood and hellfire to bring your group out of it with experience and loot beyond their wildest dreams.<br>
<br>
Don't whine about ebay_whore_03, do your job and tank.<br>

<br>
-I do use F9, assist keys, multiple INC msgs (including what i want to be killed first) <br>
-I'm always movin the mobs around because i see im too close to other aggroing mobs or the cleric etc etc. <br>
Whenever I pull, I always do atleast 100dmg (if using 2h) or hit the mob 10 times if I'm duel wielding, as well as taunt once or twice before I ever get back to the group, then i switch views, target what i want killed, tell the grp whats coming and tell em what to kill first.<br>
-Sacrafice is a lesson best learned early - I accidentally aggroed Veltar in DL once and he was kickin my ass, rather than run to grp for a heal, I went to the big crater place by the east wall of KC and died in there, so my cleric knew exactly wher my corpse was and Veltar was far enough from my grp not to aggro anyone.<br>
-I'll have to admit I dont &quot;ghetto bash&quot; and I suppose I should, but right now (in DL) the only thing that casts is the spiders with their weak spells. I should train now tho..because I'd rather be lvl46 with 200(?) skill in bash and not need it than level 60 with 50 skill in bash and desperately need it. <br>
Also, what are those &quot;Crystallized Pumice&quot; things you were talkin about? Dispell magic or something? Where are they from?<br>

Here's some things that I myself have done, and still do, and they contribute to what I think is a pretty good rep on Xev as a Warrior.<br>
<br>
From your posts, I reckon you probably do a lot of this already, which is cool =) .. Hell, if you do all of it (and more) then I'd say you're probably well on your way to having a good rep on your server, if you don't have one already (and don't know about it).. But here's some thoughts anyway....<br>
<br>
.  Be known for being a considerate Warrior, one who respects his caster's mana levels. Be seen to quote the rule: If your casters aren't ready, your group ain't ready. Your casters *will* notice this and appreciate it. At the same time, *don't* wait after every pull for sleepy_cleric01 to tell you he's 95m. I usually tell groups when I join them that I pull until the cleric cries for mercy. It gets a laugh, and the group know that a) they'll be getting chain exp, and b) I will stop when told to by the casters.<br>
<br>
. Be known for being a friendly Warrior. Always welcome new arrivals to the group. Have a laugh, have a joke. re: my pull until cleric cries for mercy quote above. Say funny things during the fights. I have two banks of macros - one 'serious' one for raid situations, and one 'joke' one for normal exp grouping. No one likes the exp grind, it's heartless and soul-destroying, and people like to have a joke around to liven things up, otherwise you'll find everyone's falling asleep on their keyboards. Say stuff like 'Taunting a Drolvarg Rager, telling him his momma was a gnoll!', or after a particularly damaging pull, say 'Bringing in a Drachnid Silkmistress, errr .. I damaged her a bit. Sorry, guys.' Don't be a fool, but don't be aloof either. Strong and silent only works in Hollywood movies.<br>
<br>
. Be known for being a courteous Warrior. Don't be one of the jokers that spam /shout and /ooc with pointless streams of d00dsp34k. Don't continually ask where the 'ph4t lewtz' drop. Don't be the first to jump on the corpse when it dies. If your cleric is symbolling you (which he probably doesn't need to if you're killing trash in DL, but anyway) then offer up some gems or whatever for the costs. He may refuse them, but the offer is nice. Maybe he won't, but hey, there's more to life than money, right?<br>
<br>
. Be known for being a professional Warrior. esepecially one that knows how to hold and retain aggro. Taunt intelligently and use melee proximity to your advantage. If there's rogues in the party, make sure you're not pushing the mob back into a wall, that sort of thing. People appreciate that sort of thing. If your ranger's not jolting and pulling aggro, then politely suggest that he do so. Explain to your group that as a Warrior, most of the time you don't take aggro, it has to be given to you by the other melees. Monks FD, Rangers jolt, Rogues evade, etc etc. Be friendly about it, etc etc. It also demonstrates your in-game knowledge and appreciation of other classes skills and abilities. People notice this, too.<br>
<br>
The repuation you're looking for is two-fold. Skill *and* personality. I know Warriors who are respected for their skill and in-game knowledge, but people won't group with them because they're regarded as assholes as well. And vice versa - I know Warrior who are the nicest guys in the world, but don't know the first thing about the Warrior class.<br>
<br>
You want your name to be known, not just as a tank who knows his stuff, but also one who's a nice guy, fun to be around and is always good for a laugh.<br>
<br>
Whilst it may be true that a equipment makes or breaks a Warrior, your actions will make or break your repuation.<br>
<br>
Remember - When people shout LFG, they don't list their equipment. Just their name..... <p>--

<br>
Taunt is simply a chance to move to the top of a mob's hate list.  Each taunt is either a success (moves you to top of mob's hate list) or is a failure.  If you have aggro, then there is no need to taunt as you are already at the top of the mob's hate list.  When someone takes aggro away, i.e., they are now at the top of the hate list, then you taunt until you regain aggro.  Its a horrible feeling when you have just hit taunt needlessly and THEN lose aggro, because you must now wait for it to refresh or hope for a quick weapon proc while the mob is beating on your cleric, chanter, etc.<br>

Generally bought from towns with magic item (potions, chipped bone rods, summon food/drink stones) merchants (felwithe, rivervale, etc.).  Basically you use them for a long range pull where you want to pull but dont want to damage the mob because that would cause the other mobs around the target to aggro as well.  Prime example as I said before is Seb Crypt.  Since it's not top secret or anything I'll explain it in better detail.<br>
<br>
Deep in the Seb crypt camp there's a room with 1 mob who would either be the Blood of the Chottal or its PH.  After killing that, the next room has the Emperor Chottal or his PH as well as 6 spectres and/or skeletons that &quot;protect&quot; him.  Opening the door, targetting him and casting a non-damaging spell on him will pull the mob straight across the room to your group without having to deal with any of the other guard mobs.<br>
<br>
Also, another good feature about crystallize pumice is it doesnt need line of sight.  I've pulled mobs through/around walls before such as getting the 9th coldain ring mob Murdrick Tardok solo with the help of a druid or ranger. <p><Table Style='Filter: Alpha(Opacity=100, FinishOpacity=50, Style=2, StartX=85, FinishX=20, StartY=0, FinishY=0)'><B><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6495" target="magelo"><Font Color=#FFCC33 Size=3 Face=Times New Roman, Helvetica>Rula - warh0bbit, esq.</Font></a><br><a href="http://www.shattered-sorcery.com/blight/" target="Blight"><Font Color=CC00FF><i>&#60Blight&#62, Vazaelle</i></Font></a><br></B></Table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ujustfive.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Just Five</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 1:18:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=950.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: If you don't mind me answering ;)</span><hr size=1> Furor's gear didn't get him to whatever pedestal you are placing him on.<br>

I would guess it's a heck of a lot, although I'm not particurlarly sure why. Is it the class that atracts the type of 'thinker' to it or is it the simply the class at high level puts you right into the middle of the action so you are more aware of what's going on than some others?<br>
<br>
I wouldn't say I'm the 'tactician' for my guild but I'm one of 2 or 3 raid leaders and for a while I always made myself MT. Not because I thought I was the best warrior but because I needed to be in control. Again though not because I have a particularly controlling personality (although some would diagree :P ) but because if I had a clear idea of how I wanted the fight to go the best way to ensure the 'plan' was followed was to be the linchpin - the MT.<br>
<br>
It's much easier though for a bad MT to wipe a raid than it is for a good MT to win it. In our early raiding days I MT'd Terror once and forgot to press auto attack, many other raids I'm so caught up in other things I forget to press defensive. I think another part of it is if someone is going to scerw up the raid with a mistake I'd much rather it was me than someone else.<br>
<br>
Eventually though it became clear a lot of other tanks in the guild were not only probably more skilled than me but also getting bored as I guess for many it's like being the difference between making the team and being captain of it. Many people want that added responsibilty and a chance to better prove themselves. Others don't though - for god's sake don't force someone to MT if they ask not to, the fear of failure can take the fun away for some.<br>
<br>
A few, like Furor, have the 'magic' combination of a great 'EQ brain' and playing the class that is often the linchpin on raids. Sort of like the difference between a quarterback that can throw well and one that can throw well and has a great head for the game - the ones you see on TV are the latter type.<br>
<br>
These days I play a cleric 99% of the time on raids and whilst it's a bit frustrating at times not having the same degree of control over situations (mostly positioning - some things are jsut hard to describe in text in a 3d-world) I don't think it really matters too much, as long as the other warriors have the brain to adapt to situations etc.<br>
<br>
As for the key factors for being a good warrior - levels, AA and gear all the way. For being a good MT though I think adaptability and a good memory are key to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukilaara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilaara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/19/02 7:57:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=950.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.elchtom.de/Fantasy/f49.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: If you don't mind me answering ;)</span><hr size=1> Hm what makes a warrior better that others.<br>

Gear is nothing when you allways attack the mob the chanter plans to mezz.<br>
Gear is nothing when your behavior is uggly<br>

Reputation is the way. You enter a zone. Ppl. see you. You get invited before shouting for a group.<br>
<br>
I am a gnome warrior - means my hp arent so big than ogre ones.<br>
I had in Level 60  1 Part Indicolite 3 Parts Cobalt Rest this and that and a 25 AC Chain Tunic ( later upgraded to 30 AC ).<br>
I had nothing special in weapons ( Chelaki Tail Lammy ... )<br>
<br>
In my leveling time in Karnor , Sebilis .. I have never had problems finding a group in (sometimes seconds after logging in ) some minutes. Sometimes I couldn't say hello to my guild cause I was asked for a group .. .<br>
<br>
Why ? <br>
Hard to say why.<br>
Maybe that<br>
I never trained my group or others<br>
I am so good looking when I am fighting<br>
No one makes so good sounds when hes been hitted<br>
I made things ( whith pumice ... ) in a way ppl. never have seen in Sebilis before<br>
I played with my brain <br>
I always were able to hold aggro against (Epic monks Epic rogues Rangers )<br>
I did not hold my mouth when ppl. do not work like intended<br>
I knew how to manage the classes for best abilites and results.<br>
I made more exp with groups where ppl. thought that they can't stand there ( Hands in KC without Chanter (LD) for hours with a 53Level group .. Chef in Sebi without Cleric (LD) for hours with druid as healer :. )<br>
<br>
All and more .. <br>
<br>
The thing is<br>
<br>
Ppl. must trust you. <br>
<br>
I played between 40 and 60 95 % of the time in  PickUps. On my black list of not to invite ppl. there were lots of bad players. Bad in form of bad play. Ninjalooters. ..... <br>
<br>
Youre reputation is the only thing you can't really repair.<br>
Youre reputation is the only thing which is important in finding a group.<br>
<br>
I found groups with my &quot;decent gear &quot; when other Warriors in full Thurga  or indicolite ... with better weapons were looking for groups too.<br>
<br>
And when there would be a group or groupleader who would throw you out of group for a &quot;better equipped&quot; warrior ... put him on your list, cause he is a moron.<br>

Warriors need to be able to taunt effectively etc, but lets look at a roleplaying perspective:<br>
<br>
Warriors are the Kings of Combat. We know about everything. We have to know stratagies for mobs and be able to come up with them when we don't, we have to know zones like the back of our hand, we have to be able to correct other people when they screw up as well as take criticism and learn from our own mistake. Warriors have to be able to make quick descisions in combat (such as evacing or camping a cleric). Warriors need to have a commanding presence.<br>

What makes a warrior?<br>
<br>
Knowlege?  Yes.<br>
Ability?  Yes.<br>
Machine/Connection?  Yes.<br>
Gear?  Yes.<br>
<br>
...and my little contribution...<br>
<br>
Confidence.  All of the above mean jack and sh*t if you question yourself in the least. <p><table width=350 height=120 border=1 style="border-color:#000000; border-width:3; border-style:solid;font-family:Arial;" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

Good stuff here, a caster sitting down when you bring a mob into the camp after doing this won't take aggro - you have hard aggro as opposed to soft aggro, which is attained by moving into the mobs reaction radius (monks often do this).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  as well as taunt once or twice before I ever get back to the group<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You might as well not bother, taunt is a yes/no skill - either it moves you to the top of the hatelist - or it doesn't move you anywhere, seeing you're already on the top of the hatelist either option spells the same oucome.<br>
<br>
Lots of good stuff in this thread, I've been living a sheltered life as a twink warrior - have almost always exclusively grouped within the guild where everyone know and trust each other to do the right thing (tm).<br>
<br>
What is most important is:<br>
<br>
1. Know your stuff, all of it<br>
2. Get to know the stuff you don't know all of<br>
3. Learn what other classes are capable of, and in particular incapable of (ie. mages don't get root, necros do get undead slow etc.)<br>
<br>
You'll need 3. for when you plan your groups, back when I played a wizard I'd oftentimes arrange, or help arrange, a group the day before trying to get a well balanced group together. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions</a></i> <br>
