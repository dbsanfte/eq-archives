<br>
Oh the irony in the fact that you actually call us stupid after throwing together the above little concoction of words (because the above lacks the bare minimum sentence structure and spelling to be deemed a post). I mean, @#%$ even Bush would argue that even his &quot;wratin' skills&quot; put that literary blob to shame. Next time you feel the need to write something, just remember:<br>
<br>
- Spell check = good.<br>
- Hitting Enter twice at the end of a sentence will make a new paragraph. Use them<br>
- Capital letters = good. <br>
- think before you speak. In your case; maybe just don't speak at all.<br>
<br>
Now, to address your absolutely ridiculous claims. You know what, yea, we warriors do want realistic combat setup. Why; because that way we'd be on a separate mitigation table, instead of sharing one with all other plate classes. (hint, when warriors have the same max damage/hit as most other classes; you've got a problem).<br>
<br>
Another hint; monk damage avoidance is already better than plate classes. However, you shared the same defensive tables as us, all the while parsing out 2x our damage (yes, I have seen parses out of NToV, regular mobs and ssra to validate my point. I've actually seen a monk parse out close to 3x the damage of a non-tanking warrior). Not to mention that the HP gap between monks and warriors was decreasing percentage-wise (thanks 125hp all/all items with &lt; 1.0 weight). <br>
<br>
You wanna talk realism; explain to me how a pajama-wearing man with a stick can do 2-3 times the damage of a class which, by Verants own definition is supposed to be &quot;a master of armed combat.&quot; Furthermore, the monk is still avoiding damage better, holding agro better (sustained DPS holds agro very well), while remaining on the same mitigation tables. THe monk also has a 25% heal every 6 minutes and this funky little ability called FEign Death, which can effectively drop them from the agro list. All the while, the monk gives up about 1500hp and doesn't have a 3-min wonder disc (although monks do have Stonestance). PLease explain the realism behind any of this.<br>
<br>
Let me reiterate, monks were already better at avoidance, but shared the same mitigation tables. This is not realism, although I'm sure it will heavily damage your ubar Velks soloing ability; where you could solo better than ANY class if you had epic and fungi. <br>
<br>
Let me summarise, in a manner befitting for you. Monk not warrior. You are bad troll. Go away.  <p><center><p><font size = 3 colo = "blue"><b>Wilhelmm D'Averam<br>Warlord of the Apocalypse</b></font></p></center>

<br>
The reason that monks lose mitigation is that monk mitigation was EQUAL to plate class mitigation, when it should have been inferior from the start.<br>
<br>
So, now monks are inferior to warrior mitigataion while warrior avoidance is inferior to monk avoidance.<br>
<br>
Why should we loose any more avoidance? <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions ~ Team Headstart</a></i> <br>

<br>
My theory is that some of the really lame trolling flames at MB supposedly written by warriors are actually written by monks pretending to be warriors in order to make warriors look stupid.  I think that likewise, some of the totally lame posts made here that are supposedly by monks are actually by warriors who are trying to make monks look stupid.   <br>
<br>
Why?  It just boggles the mind how lame some of these posts are.  I am talking about people that spew a constant stream of abuse (usually full of spelling and punctuation errors).  They won't discuss the issues.  They merely launch a barrage of insults at their target, as if that would change anybody's mind on the subject.  <br>
<br>
As far as any particular class being full of morons, I got news for you.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to play any of the classes in EQ.  A 12 year-old kid of average intelligence could do a halfway decent job of playing any class in EQ.  That includes warriors.  That includes monks.  I wish I could say that being a monk means being a cut above the rest, but it doesn't.  Being a warrior doesn't mean that either.  Your class in EQ doesn't define your intelligence, your personal character, or anything about you.<br>
<br>
I can't remember if it was on this thread or not, but someone mentioned that in the long, marathon length encounters that a melee could hit auto-attack and go afk to take a nap or order pizza.  That is just silly.  If I did that more than a couple of times and anyone noticed, I would be banned from raiding with my guild and possibly de-guilded.  I would be in trouble the very first time it happened if I got caught.  It's one of the cardinal rules of raiding that you NEVER go AFK on a raid without permission.  If you do, your wife better be having a baby or something of similar urgency must be going on.  <br>
<br>
I don't trust Verant.  When Verant discovers that they can't turn a screw with a hammer, their solution is to get a bigger hammer.  On the plus side, they actually used to be much worse about that than they are these days.  <br>
<br>
As some other monk predicted, I think that they will likely nerf monks too much on this patch and then gradually, over a period of months, bring them up to a tolerable level.  Meanwhile, it will really, really suck to be a monk or someone that depends on monks.<br>
<br>
So what if some of you have had some bad experiences with monks?  Who gives a crap!  Grow up!  I have had some bad experiences with monks myself.  I recall when I was camping an area in a dungeon where I was at the end of a dead-end tunnel.  Another monk and his shaman girlfriend moved into the next room in the tunnel, &quot;locking&quot; me into that room.  Every pull I attempted to bring past them, they took for themselves and accused me of kill stealling.  When I attempted to camp the room past them, they did the same.  I could have fought it out with them, but I just left.  I have also had bad experiences with warriors.  I recall the ogre warrior that stood in a tunnel, blocking my escape to the zoneline while FD failed on me three times in a row.  He just stood there and roleplayed a dumb ogre while I was dying and begging him to move.  As I went unconcious and into an overhead view I saw him say, &quot;Me go now.&quot; and turn and zone.  Do I hate monks because of this?  NO!  Do I hate warriors because of this?  NO!  None of you are impressing anybody with your stories about why you hate &lt;insert class&gt;.  We've all met people from a variety of classes that did us wrong.  I could tell you about this cleric I once met . . . . <br>
<br>
I can almost guarantee that whatever happens, this patch will not be final.  Verant will either: (A)  make things too easy, such as making it possible for one group to kill all of NToV, catch their mistake within 30 minutes of it going live and fix it in an emergency patch hours before I log on that day, or (B) totally screw up one or more classes, say it's working just as intended, then fix it six months later.<br>
<br>
P.S.  That monk that screwed me over ended up trying to get into my guild months later.  Muahahahahah!!!!  What goes around comes around!  <br>
<br>
P.P.S.  Okay, I have to confess, I didn't remember what the guy had done until after he had already been rejected because of what he did to another guildmate, but still, it felt pretty sweet!<br>

<br>
Monks are better tanks than warriors under specific circumstances, right?  When their mitigation AC = warrior mitigation AC, AND the mob isn't hitting for completely unreasonable damage (because monks remain 1-2k hp behind warriors, correct?).<br>
<br>
Furthermore, this circumstance includes that the monk can keep aggro better, long-term, than the warrior can, due to outrageous damage output.  And finally, the monk gets hit less, because block is superior to parry?<br>
<br>
The only data I have seen vis-a-vis block v. parry indicates that block avoids 6% more hits than parry.  So monk avoidance is 6% better, hp are 1k-2k less, damage output is about 150-200% of warriors, and because of damage output, they can maintain aggro well.<br>
<br>
I hope I'm still on track here.  Let me know if I'm wrong about something so far.<br>
<br>
Now, just for some perspective (I'm not asking anything be done, not complaining, just trying to point something out).<br>
<br>
Warrior avoidance skills, according to Frodlin, mean that a warrior avoids 8-11% more hits than a paladin.  Warriors mitigation is just as good as a paladins.  Warriors have 400-1k MORE hp than paladins, and damage output is pretty much a wash, with some claiming paladins hold the high ground, and others claiming the opposite.  Paladins do have the ability to get quick aggro more consistently than warriors.<br>
<br>
Bearing in mind that warriors feel monks are/were better tanks (in some situations) and that warriors feel that paladins are too close to performing as well as warriors, this leads me to believe that the biggest issues warriors feel they face are 1) aggro problems, and 2) damage output.  (ARGH!  I'M BLIND! hehe)<br>

<br>
That and the perception that several other classes are constantly being adjusted so that there is less and less of a clear division between them and us.<br>
<br>
We'd like our agro problems adjusted.  We'd prefer taunt be more reliable.  Verant has as much come out and said that isn't going to happen, or at least that's my perception.  We'd also like our damage output to be more in line with was stated by Verant in relation to Monk and Rogue damage output rather than the large jumps in damage they have over us.  I suspect we're not going to see that either.<br>
<br>
And finally, we really don't want to see the Knights upgraded in such a way that you can't really tell a difference between a Knight tanking and a Warrior tanking except where defensive is needed.  Not that Knights should not be able to tank, but once you make them just as effective at it as a Warrior you restrict the need/desire for a Warrior to only raid situations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uraluvinssteele.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raluvin Ssteele</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/15/02 7:24:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The way I see it</span><hr size=1> Well, I dont wanna rip your point of view to pieces, because in all honesty there are a lot of good points in there and there is a lot of truth.  <br>
<br>
But!!!!!!<br>
<br>
You dont sound like you have played a warrior.  <br>
<br>
I have both a warrior and a monk.  <br>
<br>
Warrior<br>
<br>
Solo'ing forget it!, until I got a Willsapper.  Now I can solo maybe the equivalent of a level 55 character.  I can solo in KC and Velks a little bit, but spend the best part of 20 mins healing.  Fungi or no fungi, its still a lot of hps to restore.  <br>
<br>
But there again, if I was playing, I wouldn't solo.  <br>
<br>
Monks<br>
<br>
Solo'ing is so fecking cake for monks its unbelievable.  Oh your losing ? FD.  Plus that have massive damage mitigation...30% more than warriors ? I cant see this being right.  Where did you get these statistics from ? <br>
<br>
I also managed to level up a monk from 1-51 in 2 weeks with 85lbs on him, no PLing, no going out of the way for buffage, some deaths with sometimes no rez or a 39 rez....and bingo..Job done, I am pulling in PoH/PoF and wherever else.  <br>
<br>
Just going as a pure dmg machine with average equipment on.  <br>
<br>
Throw a Fungi Tunic on a monk and it has massive differences as it would on a warrior.  As a primary puller, a monk with a fungi can wait until their hps go up accordingly.  A warrior with a fungi is relatively useless.  <br>
<br>
Warrior v Monk <br>
<br>
Very different classes with very different roles.  <br>
<br>
Monks atm DO have not one weakness apart from their hps.  However, with the availability of the epic (is it the easiest?), then the monk can quite easily get away with good weapons, s some decent equipment and the rest you dump on resist and HP equipment.  <br>
<br>
The monk class can actually boost up their weakness to make it a strength and yes, a monk can have hps almost compariable to a warrior (obviously a lot of time and effort needs to be input). <br>
<br>
This means that the monk has NOT ONE major weakness.  Attack is excellent, defensive is excellent, hps are excellent and resists are excellent.  Their only slight weakness would be that they cant carry much (so I have my fun using autosplit when a monk is in group).  With equipment also carrying an average expense for monks, they can also get by relatively cheaply. <br>
<br>
With Warriors, we do not have the versatility in benefitting from both attack and defense.  We have to be heavy on AC/HPs most of which is obtained with equipment.  Equipment is MASSIVELY expensive for a warrior.  We are, bar none the most expensive class to run in EQ as we are heavily reliant on it.  <br>
<br>
Our strengths are obviously taking damage, but where we lose out is dmg output (average) and spell capabilities (none).  <br>
<br>
A combination of these and naff disciplines gives warriors a problem definitely post Luclin. <br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
It is sad that Monks have been nerfed.  I don't like to see any class nerfed (apart from Manaburning wizards - feck em).  Sadly if their role in standard groups is replacing warriors/paladins/SKs I am sorry but nocando.  <br>
<br>
At the end of the day, monks should be looking to fill the Rogues/Rangers/Monks/BST/Shaman/Mage/Necro spots in a group (note: there are usually 2 slots for these in a gruop and 1 for a tank).  They should not be filling in for a tank (SK/Paladin/Warrior).  <br>
<br>
Their role is puller and damage mitigator and like ranger, scraping the bottom of the barrel a tank.  <br>
<br>
At no point should any class whatsoever have total benefits, which I hate to point, monks do which makes them more desirable in groups, more diserable to solo, more diserable for travelling, more diserable for camping. <br>

<br>

<br>
EDIT:  actually, warriors need to campaign for SOMETHING to improve damage output now.  On test the Yaulp spells (used by paladins and clerics) have been changed, and now have haste and +atk on them from yaulp 1 (paladins get at level 9).  I see this as being a problem for warriors, since it could conceivably mean that a paladin at level 39 could potentially outdamage a warrior (Yaulp 2 on test has 10% haste, if both wore the same haste item, would 10% more haste for the paladin make up the damage difference?).<br>
<br>
I don't honestly know what really to suggest, although I'm thinking along the lines of an innate boost to ATK, starting around the same time warriors get critical hits (level 12?).  Maybe a boost of a couple points of ATK every 5 levels or so? <br>
<br>
Again, I confess to not really knowing how dramatically this would affect the damage output of warriors, so it may be an entirely wrong-headed solution, but again, I think SOMETHING needs to be done for lower-leveled warriors, and it needs to scale with level in order to bring higher level warriors damage output in line with other classes (Rogues/Monks especially). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A> at: 10/15/02 8:12:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uchatjaogre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>chatja ogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 335<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/15/02 8:10:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=118>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The way I see it</span><hr size=1> ToD is 50 percent slow, trident of the deep sea (whichs proc you just listed) is only 10 percent<br>

How many monks tank anyways?  Sure, it always got annoying whenever I grouped with a monk to find out that he, a monk with halfway decent equipment, had higher AC than I did and could tank just as well or better.<br>
<br>
Do monks out there really think they should be tanks?<br>

I doubt it and I don't know where all the warrior vs monk talk is coming from.  So they got nerfed: Welcome to EQ. <p><br>

 Warriors 3 lvls lower than me outtank me. Good, because when the mob is at one bub health i want to pull another. Aggro is a problem for me to avoid, aye, i keep FD-ing a lot during a fight as ghetto evade...sigh. When i get hit by for instance a Chardok mob, i get hit for 150+ hits. Spells kill me extremely fast as the cleric/healer is always focused on the tank(On pulls i'm also often out of range). I can't solo since lvl 45, unless i cough up 70k for a fungi, i dont have a high lvl alt, so earning cash is hard. Groups are extremely hard to find on Brell for a monk, since most monks can't pull a cow from a barn, or non-monks have been trained/shoved aside by twink-monks. I suffer the bad rep on monks everyday, since i'm not in an Uber Guild, while i try hard to become a super puller and focus especially on what most groups look for in a monk.<br>
<br>
The worst effect of this nerf is the dispising created towards the monks because of all the old discussions being stirred up and the mentioning of the 1% monks who tanked an uber mob.<br>
<br>
Before you judge all monks as powerplaying twinks who are anti-social. I ask you to keep an open mind when you meet a monk, because *gasp* some of us are actually good to play with...<br>
