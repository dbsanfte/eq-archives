<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
Mobs do damage based on the following formula: (found by Joimster)<br>
<br>
Damage = Bonus + (Damage_Rating * x)<br>
<br>
Where:<br>
Bonus is a number assigned by VI<br>
Damage_Rating is a number assigned by VI<br>
x = integer from 1 to 20<br>
<br>
*Warriors Defensive Discipline Modifies x to a range of 1 to 10.<br>
<br>
*Monks Stonestance Discipline Modifies x to a range of 1 to 2.<br>
<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
Base damage for Characters is calculated from the weapon:<br>
Damage = round/truncate[Bonus + (Damage_Rating * x)]<br>
<br>
Where:<br>
Bonus is the Damage bonus listed on the weapon<br>
Damage_Rating is the Damage listed on the weapon divide by 10 (result is non-integer)<br>
x = integer from 1 to 20<br>
<br>
*Some irregularities and possible explanations.<br>
<br>
1. Effect of High Strength on damage?<br>
(*Test in extreme strength differences of 75 or less versus 200+ to see more obvious differences)<br>
<br>
Q: Does extra damage from Strength add simply to the damage bonus of a weapon therefore increasing damage bonus and therefore increasing both max and min hit?<br>
A: Easily tested by using a character with Low strength and parsing min and max values and then buffing strength to very high and parsing min and max values.<br>
<br>
Q: Is extra damage from Strength added as an integer?<br>
A: Easily tested by the above method and seeing if the increase to min damage is the same as increase to max damage. If they are the same then damage from high strength is added straight onto the weapon damage bonus. If they are different it is possible that the extra damage from strength is added to the damage rating of the weapon and is therefore multiplied by 20. This would mean that it may add 1 to your min damage and 20 to your max damage although it need not be integer values such as these as they may simply be rounded before damage is displayed on screen.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Effect of higher level characters on damage?<br>
<br>
Q: Is this phenomena caused by higher ATK ratings, damage tables for higher levels or both?<br>
A: ??? Research and logs at each level required.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Calculation for offhand damage?<br>
<br>
Q: Is the formula the same as the above with the damage bonus simply defaulted to 0?<br>
A: Put a fire beetle eye, lightsone in main hand and weapon in off hand and parse damage. Put same weapon in main hand and the fire beetle eye, etc in off hand and parse damage. What is the difference in min and max values?<br>
<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
On the subject of Avoiding and Mitigating damage taken from a mob. (particularly mitigation)<br>
<br>
The raw data listed by Aauminki while tanking Seneschal Aldikar show that hits were indeed mitigated to min damage five times greater than the average and hits were also found at max damage two times greater than average.<br>
<br>
Indeed 37% of all hits that landed fell as either max or min damage. Note that the fact that this is a single set of data makes this unreliable but does point at an avenue of exploration.<br>
<br>
An initial hypothesis is that x (as used above in the damage by mobs formula) is not initially calculated as an integer between 1 and 20 but is truncated and/or rounded to this in the final steps of the algorithm.<br>
<br>
Example: Mobs ATK is compared to your AC and the R.N.G. is also used somewhere and comes up with a number. That number is then truncated/rouded and made to equal 1 for any number lower than 1 (therefore mitigating damage to a min. hit) and made equal to 20 for any number greater than 20(making sure that the damage does not go above max damage).<br>
<br>
*Your AC is much higher than the mob's ATK:<br>
More x values are lower and in quite a few cases are negative values and therefore made into an x value of 1. Comparatively few hits are for max damage.<br>
<br>
*Your AC is much lower than the mob's ATK:<br>
More x values are higher and in quite a few cases above 20 and therefore made into a value of 20. Comparatively few hits are for max damage.<br>
<br>
*Your AC is almost even with the mob's ATK:<br>
The x values have a fairly even spread between most possible values except for the min and max which have more occurences than the others. Reason being that x may still have been in a bigger range than just one to twenty, i.e. -15 to 35.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
Then we can infer that if your AC is high enough that the non-random part of hits is mostly BELOW N = 1, you will get the largest spike at minimum damage. This represents a ceiling on mitigation AC, since the random component will always put SOME hits over (N = 1) and reducing hits further below (N = 1) doesn't help. If the random component continues to be reduced even when the modal hit is far under (N = 1), this becomes a soft cap.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we can infer that as the modal hit moves through the range (N = 1) to (N = 20), we see the 'sharp dropoff' effect that so many people have reported in the AC 700 to 1200 range.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, we can infer that if the modal hit is often over (N = 20) most times, you see the big spike at max damage. This represents a floor on AC, which has been observed but never really commented on. Since at (N = 20) the random component will ALSO be large, we find that the floor is softer than the ceiling.<br>
<br>
It's just a hypothesis. Have fun tearing it apart.<br>

An interesting side note: The damage distribution against me while I was naked seemed to be approximately uniform. I would think this is true because my mitigation AC while naked was zero, and the young kodiak's ATK was close to zero also. I might guess that equal mitigation AC and mob ATK would give a uniform distribution of damage.<br>

These are just some preliminary ideas from a short (few minutes) tanking session - take them with a grain of salt.<br>

Well the RNG is pretty trashy.  In a larger log, I am fairly certain you will find that both naked and equipped your results tend to some value in the middle.<br>
<br>
The hypothesis to match this is that all avoidance is pre-determined based on your Defense Skill, Defensive Table and your Defensive Skills.<br>
<br>
I've actually argued for some time that there is no difference between Avoidance and Mitigation.  Apparently this is incorrect - sort of.  There is a difference but *only* mitigation can ever be effected by any class assuming their skills are maxed.<br>

If the theory about a 1200ish soft cap is correct, then that is likely not true - it's far easier to get to 1200 AC (buffed or unbuffed) than it is to get to 255 AGI (assuming AGI adds to avoidance AC, which seems likely). Most people don't hit 255 AGI until they get primal, by which time they should already have at least full HoT armour.<br>

Re-read the threads.<br>
<br>
The *only* conclusion you can draw from the hard facts is that Avoidance is 100% static for the character and based only on the skills developed.  Agility, Armour, Buffs all only effect Mitigation - there is only one effect of building your AC outside of improving your capped skills and it *all* works hte same way.<br>
<br>
Whatever Furor (profiled AC of 1700+) or Denzalo (profiled AC 1450+) say about a 1200AC soft cap is not borne out by the facts presented and clearly not borne out by their *own* choices of equipment.<br>

The max damage is calculated solely from the dmg rating of the weapon.  The more STR you have, the more your attack rating goes up.  The more attack you have, the more often you hit a mob for max damage.  So strength affects how often you hit for max, not what your max actually is.

Your wrong.<br>
<br>
ATK is a *composite* figure.<br>
<br>
One half represents your chance &quot;To Hit&quot;.  This is *only* effected by your Level, Weapons Skill, Offense and any raw ATK buffs such as Wofl Form or Avatard.<br>
<br>
The other half represents your &quot;Maximum Damage&quot;.  This is effected by the above factors *and* Str.<br>
<br>
However, your Modal damage doesn't change with Strength, only your maximum, so the effect of Strength on average damage is minimal.<br>

Bottom line is that strength, like other stats in EQ, is worthless.<br>

However, your Modal damage doesn't change with Strength, only your maximum, so the effect of Strength on average damage is minimal.<br>

<br>
Do you have any logs to prove that? I have noticed quite large improvements in average dmg(not logged) when I have shammy buffs on, unless I imagine things. <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD> <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl"><IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/10.png"

<br>
Here's some stuff that's slightly off topic, but it maybe somewhat relavent.  I'll get the actual logs out sometime (I'm a huge space cadet, so I tend to flake on follow ups =p) and see about DI and such.<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
AC means piss vs. fungusbeasts =)<br>
<br>
Here's the breakdown.  Missing some exact numbers I have on notes at home (I'm at work atm), namely my exact AC, but I can ballpark it.  I have combat stability2 for this test.<br>
<br>
Test1 ( http://underwearninja.com/ytrilynth/images/fungus1.jpg ):  Doesnt mean much by itself, so we'll move on to Test2.  AC here was 1485ish<br>
<br>
Test2 ( http://underwearninja.com/ytrilynth/images/fungus2.jpg ): Exact same fungusbeast from test1.  Seeing some slight randomness, I probably didnt parse quite enough.  .25 difference in average damage. 1.6% difference in avoidance.  AC here was 1385ish.<br>
<br>
Test3 ( http://underwearninja.com/ytrilynth/images/fungus3.jpg ):  Still the same fungusbeast.  Notice I was getting bored, I didnt spend as much time on this one.  Mitigation still in the same range differing only by 1.23 from 200 AC higher.  AC here was 1285ish.<br>
<br>
Test4 (http://underwearninja.com/ytrilynth/images/fungus4.jpg ): This is where I @#%$ some @#%$ up.  I managed to die (lets not ask, k?) and when I got back, pulled a different beast.  This one had a higher max damage (most likely a higher level beast), but I parsed it anyway.  AC was about 1180.  Notice the Avg Damage is still about 70, despite the mob being higher level, and the most noticible difference in avoidance change is here, just over 2%.  Basically this set is junk because of the change in mob though.<br>
<br>
Test5 (http://underwearninja.com/ytrilynth/images/fungus5.jpg ):  Kill off the beast in Test4, and find one that maxes for 131 again.  I'm below 1100 AC, around 1080.  Virtually no change in Avg Damage, and virtually no change in Avoided damage. (assuming we throw out test 4)  At this point I've lost so many HPs, cleric was having a hard time keeping up the mana to CH me, and I was losing interest.  Hence the small sample size, but still consistent with other tests.<br>
<br>
Test6 (http://underwearninja.com/ytrilynth/images/fungus6.jpg ):  Under 1k AC.  Was about 975 I believe.  (yes, nine hundred seventy five).  Notice I switched beasts again.  Yeah I'm lame, sorry =/.  Luckily it's a 137 Hitter, so we can compare it to Test4.  Before we do that though, lets compare avoidance to Test5.  No change!  Higher level mob, lower AC, no decrease in Avoidance!  This is my smallest sample size, as I had about 1000 less hps, making mana regen an issue.  Despite the small sample, I think it's safe to say AC has little bearing for most purposes against Fungus Beasts for damage Avoidance.  This is the first noticable increase in damage intake, almost 4 points a hit higher than on the similar level mob in Test4.  I would have gone on farther, but I had already spent 5 hours at this, was getting kinda bored, and felt I had enough evidence to see a soft cap of some sort versus Fungus Beasts.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:  Hit Points are what counts for people when fighting Fungus Beasts.  My assumption is that all creatures in the same level range are going to show similar results.  I have yet to parse out another creature yet though.<br>
<br>

    Max dmg = ([(strength + weapon skill)/100] * weapon damage) + damage bonus<br>
<br>
So strength does affect the maximum damage that you will hit for, and thus have some effect upon average damage. But Ed's point is that damage in EQ is heavily centered around the modal (modal is NOT the same thing as average, modal is the number that you hit for most often). The forumla for the modal is:<br>
Modal = (2 * weapon damage) + damage bonus<br>
<br>
Note that STR does not affect the modal. Ed contends (I think rightly, though I plan to do some parsing to test this) that the modal weights the average so heavily, that increasing the max damage has little affect upon the average damage. That make sense? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30346">Gimmel Greatheart</a> - Vicar of Kaladim<br>
