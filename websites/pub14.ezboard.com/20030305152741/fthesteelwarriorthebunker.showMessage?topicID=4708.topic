<br>
Problem: We rehash the same discussion's on weapons every 3 to 6 months due to folks either not searching, search failing to find the right topic, or posts falling off of ezboard.<br>
<br>
Benefits: As time changes rehashing old topics is good because you get new angles on the subject from folks who have had more new experiences.<br>
<br>
Cons: This is not efficient, the old posts contain valuable feedback that folks have taken the time to share.  As we learn more about the weapons new posts can be added and folks new to the weapon can get a more well rounded opinion of said weapon.<br>
<br>
Proposed Solution: Created another moderated forum with a regulated structure for the first post that will facilitate well rounded discussions on weapons.  Here is an example of a first post for any given weapon, and a reply<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

<br>
Discussion:<br>
1. Is this a aggro or a DPS weapon (ie would you reccomend this to an MT)<br>
2. If this weapon procs can you explain some pros and cons of the proc<br>
3. Is this weapon easy to get ie what does it take to kill the mob or do the quest<br>
4. What are some items similar to this that you would prefer instead of this<br>
5. If this is a one hander what are some combinations you would recommend for this main/offhand<br>
6. What is you're experience with this weapon<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>POST REPLY</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Me tinks dis is a gud weapon fer dat aggro.  Me smacks da mob wit it and when the sword sparkles da mob gets a poison spell on it dat really pisses it off, o course it all pisses off me chanter friend when i land da dot and he tries to mez the mob.<br>
<br>
Da damage ratio on dis weapon makes it not a gud DPS weapon doh so I would save dis for dose days where ju gotta be da disc'd defensive MT.<br>
  <br>
I neber had to kill da guy to get dis here sword cuz some ripoff gnomie in da bazaar was sellin a stack of em at 100pp a pop.  <br>
<br>
I likes ta puts dis in me offhand and me frostbringer in da mainhand its da best combo ive found so fars<br>
<br>
I have only recently found dis here weapon so i havent used it to much but I like it so fars.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->I think if we just structured the first post it would serve to bring a little order and reduce some of our double and triple posts.  If someone wanted to know how the snare whip compared to the BBOT all they'd have to do is search topics for silken OR torment and find either post, then its simply a matter of reading both posts for there answer and if they dont find it then adding it as a reply to either thread.<br>
<br>
Right off the bat we could churn out a list of weapons we could do this for: Every weapon on the aggro list that is stickied, defiance, lamentation, bbot, anklesmasher, drathor great hammer, ornate general sword, etc etc ad nauseam.<br>
<br>
I admit that at first this will be a bit of work but with just a little effort up front we can make a change for the better that will help warriors for a long time.  This suggestion is up for discussion and endorsement if anyone has a suggestion for a format on the first post I would love to hear it.  If this came down to needing another person willing to moderate the forum I would volunteer to fill those shoes if needed, i can be emailed at &quot;barshbarsh@hotmail.com&quot;.<br>

<br>
Unless you're the sole owner of the linked image ( ie. you paid a host to host the pic for you like my sig and avatar ); linking someone else's image is basically wrong unless you have written permission or however.<br>
<br>
stealing someone else's bandwidth isn't fair; and they are paying to host that pic. linking to it as a remote link; but the image ( as above with the BBoT ) is theft of bandwidth ( unless you do host it )<br>
<br>
back on topic...on having all/most/some of the weapons listed and their pro's-con's-discussion-effect-usability..it's a great idea ( especially for the steelwarrior.org site which Jaikar owns )..but for a messaeboard it's not a stable nor economical decision. People stop by most of the time for a quick breeze-through, stop and drop off their .02, and/or just add some words of advice. As a database here it's not really what the board was designed for ( although there is a wealth of information here already that should be archived )..<br>
<br>
I know personally it'd be too time consuming to try myself to make a stable database on a webpage ( and my lack of any HTML skills ); nor do I play EQ any longer so my time spent here is slim.<br>
<br>
I'm not flaming you at all; it is a genuine idea that serves a nice purpose. but this is a messageboard, not an encyclopedia ( even if we've crossed the line a long long time ago ) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://publish.hometown.aol.com/crushr85/myhomepage/max.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radhaz>radhaz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.spiritpack.org/images/sigs/grrr.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/23/02 10:08:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4708.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/radhazzone/images/barshhead.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Great idea, but lots of work involved</span><hr size=1> I see your side of the coin Shikarii that this is first and foremost a messageboard not a database.  I'm going to try and approach this from a different angle and hope for some more feedback. <br>
<br>
Rather than go through and locate the post's I am just going to trust that everyone who reads this has seen <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>at least</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a dozen posts on the lammy vs defiance, two dozen the wavecrasher, three or four dozen on the epic.  Many times these topics are redundant and the responses are deemed a waste of time because few people like to repeat themselves.<br>
<br>
I am simply proposing a forum designed to reduce the redundancy and increase the usefullness of steelwarrior.  An example for you would be:<br>
<br>
When I was level 30 I cared about the centi LS and the wurmy I had no desire nor a clue about what it took to chase after a willsapper and I ignored those posts.  When I hit mid 50's I wanted to know more about the willsapper and vaguely remember some discussions and went and searched but they had fallen off the forum.  Rather than being redundant I didn't bother asking again about it and scoured the web for the info I needed.<br>
<br>
Had we kept a simple forum on the side like I am proposing the data that meant nothing to me at 30 would be there until I gave up EQ (I know we have 20pages of archives but I don't think theres enough weapons that interest warriors to get that far).<br>
<br>
The forum would not be as much a database but as moderated discussion with a focused topic's of interest.  If it's a matter of time and effort required on someone's part I would gladly volunteer to assist a community that has helped me tremendously in my growing time as a warrior.<br>
<br>
If a separate forum would someway hinder the steelwarrior I fail to see it and apologize for my blindness.  I chose to voice this on the forum to get feedback from my fellow warriors (flame's and all).  I think this would/could be a huge asset for the community and if I'm the one proposing to carry it out I can't see the harm. <br>
<br>
Now I suspect some individuals might suggest to start up another ezboard site and carry this out.  I think doing that would be just as bad as not having a separate forum and would be a waste of time for one simple reason.  Steelwarrior is the warriors forum its where we all congregate and discuss shop.  A separate site would require new ezboard registration ($$) and we would still have redundant posts on the bunker without a valid place to send folks too.<br>
<br>
So thoughts anyone....?<br>
<br>
Oh yeah about linking to other folks images Shikarii is right, its bad mmkay <p><div align="center">

I'm sure if you were ambitious enough he'd consider it; or even help host the place..i'd like to see the site grow besides the messageboard here; and unfortunately the site itself is in dire need of an overhaul and would require a lot of work.<br>

<br>
I have to agree with you about the site, it's definitely dated but having been the admin for two guilds now I think that the forums are were to focus.  The site would be good for posting writeup's that came out of the forums like the condensed ubermob tanking post, or the guide to rampage, etc.  Things like quests and weapons really are so dynamic though that we could leave the data to the forums for people to discuss in an open fashion.<br>
<br>
The quests are already covered by allakhazam's so it wouldn't serve much a purpose and almost be a waste of time to bother doing up.  If folks wanted to condense the quest's to simple checksheet's or thing's like that well I could see having things like that on the site.  Really there's a lot that &quot;could&quot; be done it's just a matter of taking the time and effort to do it.  <br>
