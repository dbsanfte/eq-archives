<br>
Great f*cking job guys! Improved Warcry! Improved Bandage Wounds (Did I call this one or what?)! 6 minute Rampages!?!?! OH @#%$? Upgrade to FLURRY!?!<br>
<br>
They PAY YOU PEOPLE TO COME UP WITH DESIGNS. ORIGINAL DESIGNS. Instead, you are so horribly braindead that not only can you not come up with anything new, even with thousands of suggestions, you IMPROVE on the most useless of our class AAs.<br>
<br>
The best part is.. well you can wait for the best part. Whoever hacked out this info will undoubtedly hack out the rest. <br>
<br>
Can't wait for the fuming masses to see the new Monk AAs and Rogue AAs. I'm sure those will be a HOOT. Who wants to bet me their AAs augment their PRIMARY job, doing lots of damage...<br>
<br>
These people have no vision. The rest of those AAs you listed are more than likely available to all melee/hybrid classes. That Vanishing Blade is probably a rogue AA (at least going by the sound of what was listed).<br>
<br>
So once again, everybody gets better tanking/avoidance abilities - across the board. The other two pure melee classes will undoubetdly get AAs that increase their CLASS ROLES, and Warriors will be stuck with a bunch of f*cking gimmicks, just as promised.<br>

These sound interesting, but I have the feeling they will be available to all melee classes. So it's probably not balancing, but it will help a warrior.

Vanishing Blade would be nice if you can turn it on or off.  As MT turn it off, when not MT, turn it on so you aren't screwing with the MT's aggro.  If it's always on, then it better be a Rogue thing.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'm sure the hybrids will get all this stuff too, but we can console ourselves knowing that most hybrids will be stuck getting all the other cool AA's they already get, so it will be a while until they get these new ones...  ok, that's not much consolation. <p>Hyardgune Varangian <BR> 57 Ogre Myrmidon of Gathered Might</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uraaj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raaj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 495<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/24/02 7:34:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1312.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_exp.gif" align=absmiddle>  So...</span><hr size=1> I seriously wonder how much crack these guys smoke.<br>

Also it looks like the knights are going to be able to upgrade their dps on 2h weapons. Monks will be able to solo a little easier with the hastend mend. <br>
<br>
So unless the general skills for stat enhancements are warrior only, my as well level that monk or knight you have on your account if this stuff really does come out. Cause I am sure that all warriors are gonna get is new items that instead of haveing a 50 person raid, it will take 80-90 people to get and only .0001% of warriors will ever see. :(<br>
<br>
Sure, this is bit*** about stuff that might be in a realease that is comming out in another month or two, but it just does nothing to lighten the spirits of warriors anywhere. Our choices are look forward to absolutly nothing in the new expansion, or complain about this bs even if it doesn't make it to release.<br>
<br>
Oh well, when is Shadow Bane supposed to come out again?<br>

All it does is make you resistant, maybe immune, to Fears for 5 seconds at first skill, and 15 at third. To actually get there requires burning 12 points on fear resistance crap archetype, and 18 more to max out Warcry. For it you get a skill that you will never once have any use for, barring Fears in PoP. Then it will have the tiniest amount of usefulness. <p><img src="http://strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Fulorian/fullsize/sig1.gif" border="0">
