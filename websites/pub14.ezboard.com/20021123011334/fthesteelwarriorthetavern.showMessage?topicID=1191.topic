<br>
If the Customer Service was great and you never had any complaints.<br>
<br>
Patches where never bugged.<br>
<br>
No beggers or ksers or other bad elements.<br>
<br>
Guides and GM's had full knowledge of the game and where always very helpful.<br>
<br>
items droped more frequently and there was no need to camp stuff.<br>
<br>
if eq had all these things  from the beging would you still be playing or would you have gotten bored after the first few months and quit?<br>
<br>
Personaly I think all this adds to the drama that is EQ. someone from Sony was quoted as saying (refering to EQ2) &quot;we'll get it right this time&quot;. my first thought was &quot;you got it right the first time&quot; i meen half a million people paying 10bucks a month for over 3 years, and they think they did something wrong.<br>
<br>
I think the failures in EQ is what makes it great. I look forward to seeing how bad the next patch is going to be bugged and the chaos that it will create. I look forward to seeing the drama on the boards and waiting to see who the next guild is that is going to get band cause of a GM that either does or doesnt know whats going on. its the negative aspecs in Everquest that I look forward to each day. if EQ had no bugs, no problems and everyting about it was good, i would have gotten board after the first month or so and quit.<br>
<br>
just a though realy.<br>
<br>
/em tacklehugs everyone then does his ding ding dance<br>
<br>
Edit: I think what im tring to say is that getting past all these obsticals give more meening to what you get in the end. the GM-Guides, the buggy pathing, the ksing, the hours of camping, just everything. if you could just walk into a zone and get levels and uber items with minimal or less effort they would meen nothing hence you character would meen nothing. does that make sence?<br>

I could deal without the bugs, griefers, and fickle CS. I will agree with you on instant gratification of loot and exp, though. If there was absolutely no need to camp anything, people would very quickly lose ways to advance their characters. That would lead to boredom and eventual retirements before long.<br>
<br>
No, I'm not saying that the Zordak death march is justified; what I am saying is that EQ is not Burger King. You can't have it your way, right away.<br>

DAoC wubs made ter appeat ter everbody, buts its whole premise ubs &quot;good gear fer da masses&quot; really mades it kinda generic n' borin.  Me wubs happy ter come back ter EQ. <p><center>

I could do without pisspoor CS, all the backstabbing between the Guilds, KSing etc. etc.<br>
<br>
However I do think the limitation of EQ's game engine regarding itemization (having items that are only in the reach for the most dedicated/addicted people out there) add  alot to the appeal that EQ has.<br>
<br>
I don't think EQ would be such a huge sucess if they took over the itemization system that DAoC uses (best stuff is playermade, most loot is readily available etc. etc.)<br>
<br>
I also like very much the bad pathing/warping all that crap <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  adds to the raid interest hehe... <p><CENTER>

One of the most important skills you must posses in order to get far in EQ is people skills. If youre a likeable person youll have an easier time getting into guilds and groups, finding friends, and in the end getting uber loot. All the drama is part of a social game and frankly EQ wouldnt be the same without it.<br>
<br>
Only thing I'm not quite happy with is the fighting/racing over raid targets cause of the lack of content. Whenever my guild feels like raiding there should always be a target up for us. Hopefully PoP will fix this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Everything else, I could probably do without.<br>
<br>
Take Saryrn for instance.  We have 2 top-notch guilds who are always racing for the stars, but are usually civilized and respectful of each other.  We have ump-teen other guilds who have cracked the post-60 game, and dozens who are in the post-50 stages of dragons, epics, and what I like to call the &quot;Velious Political Struggle&quot;.  And of course, we also have a couple higher-end foreign guilds to keep everyone on their toes when rare-spawn mobs appear.  Mix this all into a big bowl with the right amounts of lying, back-stabbing, treason, treachery, and good ol' &quot;Us vs. The World&quot; attitudes, and you have one HELL of an entertaining atmosphere.  <br>

<br>
If it wasn't for my gildmates; friends on my server; and everyone here on the boards EQ wouldn't be fun at all; and probabally not even play anymore.<br>
<br>
Y'all make the game fun. The content of the game itself doesn't lend too much to the imagination. Compare it to playing whack_the_mole at the carnival. Sure; beating the mole's head in with a mallet is fun for a while; but doing it with all of your friends makes it time well spent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uzumbukfleshcarver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zumbuk Fleshcarver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/3/02 1:10:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: would you still be playing EQ if...</span><hr size=1> I have always believed that if a game had a strong enough back story, history, and plotline it could survive on its own without having the need for &quot;uber items&quot;, long boring camps, and massive time sinks. DAoC failed not because everyons items were somewhat common...it failed because there was nothing to keep people there. Nothing interesting going on. No history, no plot. EQ lacks these things as well, but EQ is different... it feeds off the need for a person to stand out and be a hero. It tells you &quot;keep at it, youll get that uber item eventually...you NEED this item or else youre nobody.&quot; <br>
<br>
Remember back when level 50 was the utmost. &quot;Im level 50&quot; and tons of low level players would gasp in astonishment. Well now you aint crap if youre level 50. Youre still crap if youre level 60... only if you have every item off of Vulaks loot table..THEN you can be someone. People hate and love this. They strive at it because humans dont like to quit, but at the same time they hate the fact that they &quot;need&quot; some little virtual sword in a game to actually be anyone in a virtual community. <br>
<br>
EQ plays on the phychological side of things. But I still think a game with plot and history could very well stand on its own without having to lure people into thinking &quot;that next level I'll be uber.&quot; or &quot;all I need to do is get me one of those, and I'll be someone.&quot;.<br>
<br>
If EQ was missing all the bickering, posturing, ego tripping, backstabbing, lying, KSing, camp hogging, and bottom of the barrel human traits... Yes. If they were missing the items and gear and need to attain these things? No. There is nothing else left if those things are gone.<br>
<br>
