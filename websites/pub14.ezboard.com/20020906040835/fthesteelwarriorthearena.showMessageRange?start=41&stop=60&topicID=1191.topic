Someone proposes a scientific attempt to get to the bottom of this and my hopes rise, and then the conversation gets sidetracked by anecdotal opinion. <br>
<br>
For those of you tanking ubers and keeping logs, please, please keep at it. Bring in the data.<br>
<br>
I think Darador's comment, that AC matters for mobs of lower level is *an interesting hypothesis* that would make a good point for testing.<br>
<br>
I also really like Splaktar's emphasis on damage (absorbed) per second. As the main tank, that's all that matters to me. How fast can the CHers keep me alive. Will the AC mitigate and avoid damage, or will extra HP as a deeper pool do the trick?<br>
<br>
So, could all you 60 warlords with your 255 agility and uba AC run logs on various MA fights and post the DPS you're taking? Wear low armour keep a log. Wear high armour keep a log. And only provide numbers for fights when the critter is above you in level (ie, above you in ATK).<br>
<br>
In theory, we could create a scatter graph with AC on one side and DPS on the other side.<br>
<br>
And the results can trickle in. Put the mob, your AC and the DPS you suffered. If we get enough of people going against the same mob, we could separate them into different graphs.<br>
<br>
If that gives any solid numbers, then we try the same results against lower level critters to see how AC affects blue mobs for XP groups to see if there is a soft cap.<br>
<br>
To all you people attempting a scientific analysis of this, don't let the anecdotes throw you off the tracks. <br>

<br>
I think the problem is that you're trying to bring in all sorts of variables that just aren't relevant. You mention that Juggs used to hit you harder back in the day, and you also say that it could be due to a number of factors such as level. Obviously level has a huge influence on how mobs hit you, so any disparity between your current performance against juggs and your recollection of how you performed back then is much more likely attributed to your level than your AC. Besides it's hardly fair to say there isn't enough data to support an ac cap on the one hand, and then defend your position with vague recollections of how juggs used to hit you on the other.<br>
<br>
In the controlled tests that people have been performing, with a single mob, constant level, constant agi, constant buffs, constant debuffs, constant skills, and varying only AC, there just aren't that many variables to contend with. That's why I think you're over complicating things, it's a lot simpler than you're making it out to be.<br>
<br>
You're familiar with Ockam's razor as I recall... Is it more likely that some complicated set of variables are being changed in just the right way to cause average damage to be the same at widely different AC values, or is it more likely that AC is soft capped?<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ockam's razor is silent on this issue for the following reason: BOTH explainations are simple AND consistent with the known historical and testable data.<br>
<br>
Fact: there is a &quot;knee&quot; in the damage/hit vs. AC curve at lower levels, varies due to a number of factors I mentioned before.  A level 17 bard twink in mixed singing steel vs. &quot;red&quot; mobs gets hit for minimum damage a LOT, so level isn't the only factor by any stretch.  Very possible that the same response/dependencies exists at higher levels but the &quot;knee&quot; hasn't been reached yet (i.e. simple answer).<br>
<br>
Fact: verant HAS used &quot;softcaps&quot; in the past on other skills/attributes, and clips a number of other calculations (i.e. fall damage, etc).  Very well established they used em on wis/int for mana calculation, indications there might be some on resists, etc.  Very possible that a similar type of coding exists on other calculations, such as melee damage.<br>
<br>
My point in the last post is that you can't tell between the two equally &quot;simple&quot; explainations until you a). exceed the threshold value or b). show experimentally or via industrial espionage none exists.<br>
<br>
So far as the list of &quot;complicating&quot; variables I listed goes, those simply serve to make things (more) indeterminate.  Almost none of the &quot;interesting&quot; calculations/results in EQ are linear, they all have discontinuities and asymptotes and REALLY don't extrapolate well at all.<br>

<br>
That is no more a fact than the AC soft cap is. I can only assume that there is some post somewhere that proves this?<br>
<br>
Even if it is true, I don't see how you can say this:<br>
<br>
&quot;Very possible that the same response/dependencies exists at higher levels but the &quot;knee&quot; hasn't been reached yet &quot;<br>
<br>
after just saying this:<br>
<br>
&quot;Extrapolation = foolish for nondeterministic nonlinear systems&quot;<br>
<br>
The &quot;knee&quot; theory is a nice one, but I've seen even less hard evidence to support it than I've seen for the soft cap. <p><html>

Its just the ppl that did were a minority and most were unwilling to even consider that ac didnt mean much anymore.  Then throw in a few famous type eq players who outright insisted that ac meant everything.  I can still remember Legacy of sorrow insulting ktf calling us no ac gimps cause we all had around 1250 ac, haha =).<br>
<br>
I know my guild has been ignoring ac for over 9 months now, maybe longer. <br>
<br>
Asharad, as i said earlier, i am not totally sure if gorlab ever did post his numbers on stratics.  I know i read them but i think it was on my guild board.  Either way the conclusions he reached was that from 1200 ac to 1500ish ac showed a net result of zero difference.  There was a small variation up and down even with hours and hours of logs, and it was all within a standard deviation.  <br>
<br>
There was also a few other things that was noticed in the results.  Like did you realize yelinak can only hit in specific increments of 25?  It seems almost all npcs are like that, in that they have a specific dmg table and can only hit for specific numbers, unrelated but kind of interesting.<br>

<br>
Hrm.  What Jody Foster movie?  Who's Jody Foster?  Wasn't she a brat pack type actor in the 80's?  /e *needs to get out more*...  Also, I've always seen it spelled &quot;Occam's&quot;- tho the english dude it's named after was named Ockham I think.  Go figure.<br>
<br>
Anyway---<br>
<br>
The existance of a &quot;knee&quot; in the dmg vs. AC &quot;curve&quot; is EASILY demonstratable and has been posted numerous times.  It's not really subject to debate, but if you REALLY wish to test it, it's trivial to do.  The observed result is that mobs that severely outclass the pc will hit for max damage most of the time; at some point in increasing AC/level/etc, the same mob starts hitting for intermediate damage, and the mode damage (most common hit) drops from the max value.  As the difference increases even more, the mode damage a mob hits for drops to the min damage it can hit for.  It is NOT a smooth transition at all, and the &quot;critical&quot; range of AC can be as little as 20-30pts.  About a zillion ways to test this, use your imagination, but I'm really surprised you hadn't noticed it??  You obviously have to look at the damage distribution to see it clearly, but it's super obvious when you plot it out.  Heck, you can see it when fighting mobs yourself- you hit ones with higher AC for minimum damage (mode 1 pt) offhand, unless you get piles of STR/ATK buffs and/or someone debuffs the mobs AC.  Other (blue) mobs you hit for intermediate values, and greenies you hit typically for full.  Same deal, different values in the variables tho I'd imagine.<br>
<br>
Also, extrapolation of a indeterministic nonlinear function (damage/attack in EQ) is WAY different from extrapolation of human behavior (lazy verant programmers re-using functions from other parts of the codebase).  There's a demonstrable &quot;knee&quot; in dmg/AC for lower levels, why change it at higher ones?  Heck, on the flip side, there's a verant &quot;confirmed&quot; softcap (900?) in the old world- it's no stretch to suggest there isn't one in velious/luclin too.    Make more sense now? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      <br>
<br>
Gonna try a ascii plot (dmg = mode dmg/hit)<br>
<br>
|.......................<br>
d.......................<br>
m++++...............&lt;max hit<br>
g........++...........<br>
|...........++.........<br>
|...............+++++&lt;min hit<br>
+-----AC---------<br>
__________^ <br>
Critical AC value, VERY dependent on other variables tho, but ALL else being equal is always at the same place.<br>
<br>
Note that *IF* there was a softcap, and it was low enough, you'd never get to the point where you'd get minimum hits as the mode; there's basically no way to tell the difference between the two then!<br>
<br>
Think of it this way- to a level 50 player in old world gear, a juggy ATK is effectively WAY superior to what AC he can reach, and he gets clocked for full dmg almost every hit.  Sure looks like a softcap doesn't it!?  Can't see that there isn't until you get past the combination of AC/Level/etc. necessary to overwhelm the mob's ATK to observe that there isn't one there.  We can do that in the old world (~900) and kunark (~1100), but I haven't see or experienced anything in luclin that suggests where, if at all, there is one.  There MIGHT be, but there's no evidence that there is, or where it's at.<br>
<br>
Moral: if the fully debuffed mob hits you for max damage &quot;all the time&quot; (i.e. mode hit) when you are fully buffed and in AC gear, then HP is obviously the way to go.  If newer/more-uber AC gear or better/bigger mob debuffs become available, it's worth checking AC.  There simply isn't any other way to tell the difference right now, barring a spoiler from verant.<br>
<br>
I think.<br>

He's described the tests with yelinak etc, but typically he simply goes do your own tests and then when people complain about that he basically whines about that and refuses to back up his statements.<br>
<br>
That is not to say that there isn't an AC cap, I'm relatively indifferent to the idea, there is a bit of evidence that suggests there is one, but I guess there just hasn't been a post that that just doesn't have any issues with it.<br>
<br>
My personal belief is that its probably more based on the mobs attack value vs your ac value.  If this were the case, there would be a 'cap' for every single mob, and likely in the case of most 'uber' mobs, players would be hard pressed to reach it.<br>
<br>
I know simply from tanking them that Yelinak and Tormax are distinctly different as far as attack and average damage.  I do believe you could run 1100-1500 ac logs against Yelinak and find that at some point, it caps, but I doubt you would find the same thing with tormax.  Also the effect of defensive can mess the results up imo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugrimmlokk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimmlokk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://grimmlokk.homestead.com/files/icon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will KICK YOUR @$$</span><br>  Posts: 532<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/6/02 7:29:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://grimmlokk.homestead.com/files/spinhead2.gif?flezbwidth=30&flezbheight=41?

You have to keep defensive parses with other defensive parses and non-defensive parses with non-defensive parses.  Mixing the two during calculations of ADPH would be the only way defensive would skew the results.<br>
<br>
I also don't know where you are getting this stuff about these mobs hitting for full damage almost all of the time.  Have you actually ever tanked these mobs and/or paid attention to the hits while doing so?  Log them and look, you'll be surprised.<br>
<br>
*edit*  I went back to my oldest log of Vind with a known AC and made a cursory inspection of max hits.  At 1275 AC he hit me for max 41 times out of 236 total hits.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is this:  the only legit tests I've seen or heard of have supported the cap.  I have yet to see any that say otherwise, with the exception of Kreugen's admittedly flawed tests on the mist panther.  You can sit around and talk about theories all day Remf, but we've put the numbers forth and you haven't. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45589">Aeryl Firebrand</a>, Warlord<br>

<br>
All the data shown and testing done to date that says there's a &quot;cap&quot; simply isn't conclusive- all that ANY of the posted tests show is that, for the AC range tested and the player/buffs/debuffs/mobs in question, no dropoff in damage was seen.  Right?  Am I missing any relevant data here?<br>
<br>
That's ENTIRELY equivalent and consistent to TWO different situations, NEITHER OF WHICH CAN BE PROVEN CONCLUSIVELY.<br>
<br>
1). There IS a softcap w/ velious and/or luclin, and it's in the 1200-1400-ish range.<br>
<br>
2). There ISN'T a softcap, but the &quot;uber&quot; mobs in question are high enough level (some 70+), have high enough ATK (stats or combat table), etc. that they &quot;overpower&quot; ACs up to the tested 1500ish range.  Think level 50 player in oldworld gear vs. Seb protector; no matter what oldworld armor he's wearing, it isn't going to reduce the damage he takes.<br>
<br>
Number 1 would be &quot;consistent&quot; with the way verant implemented old world/kunark soft caps.  Number 2 would be consistent with how the combat engine works on ACs &lt;&lt; a softcap.  You can't tell the difference, at least from the testing done to date.<br>
<br>
For example, even tests with large AC ranges (from 1200-1500) show that there is no massive dropoff in damage done, rather that it's fairly constant over the range.  That in itself suggests that there isn't a &quot;soft&quot; cap at all, otherwise the damage (mode, dps, whatever) should gradually diminish with AC, correct?  From what's been posted, it doesnt... which actually suggests the tester is still in the &quot;gets hit hard a lot&quot; AC range, not above a softcap or near a knee in the dmg vs. AC curve.<br>
<br>
The testing I can do with the gear I have has already been shown (with varying degrees of clarity) to be flat- Remf can only hit the low-mid 1400's fully geared up, not even close to the full NTOV gear folks.  I have tanked most of the mobs in velious (basically all but statue/AoW/Tunare), and a couple of the new luclin ubers, and logged a few of them.  Nothing I saw in them was conclusive at all, as expected.   AFIK a softcap isn't provable OR disprovable, unless someone has the number for the psychic friends network and/or a bribeable verant coder handy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
RdT.<br>
p.s. how would I &quot;prove&quot; a softcap?  Only thing I can think of offhand that would be persuasive, aside from a spoiler by a verant programmer type, would be a careful analysis that showed a gradual diminishing in the mode damage/hit taken as gear AC *ONLY* (i.e. mitigation) was varied over the suspected AC cap range.  That would mimic the behavior seen with the old world softcap.  For the avoidance component, you'd have to do the same thing, but for hit/miss percentage (or perhaps DPS?) and show that it also dropped off (slowly) as well.  No change in either would suggest a hard cap, or an insufficient AC range in the testing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=81&stop=91>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showPrevMessage?topicID=1191.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showNextMessage?topicID=1191.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.emailToFriend?topicID=1191.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.threadControl?topicID=1191.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1191.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1191.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
