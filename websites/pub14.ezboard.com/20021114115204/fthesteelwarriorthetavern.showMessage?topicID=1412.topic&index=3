Guilds moving on.</span><hr size=1> Well may be on other servers people move on,  but on the Nameless they are not moving on they are killing as much as they can, that others can also  kill. Then move on to their higher end things. <br>
<br>
For instance, a while back Legacy of Steel was selling rights to loot NToV loot. Most of their guild and Twinks had all they could use  so they offered to sell it. Then CoH you in for you to loot. They may have finally moved out of NToV  but still cleared  as much as they could right up until moving into VT.<br>
<br>
Maybe it is  just the Nameless, that has this problem but there is a guild on about 24/7 which can wipe  out NToV, AoW, and Tunare.  Either European-Remedy , or TW-Kylin Eyes or US-LoS, Euphoria, Crimson Tempest. <br>
<br>
Even when they do not need the items   or they use ony to twink characters or sell dropables.<br>
<br>
I know i may seem to be  whining a bit,  to many of you that have played awhile. But hey  this is just Norath as I  have seen it.   I mostly posting to  blow off frustration. After all I am  so addicted I play 7 days a week and love raiding. If i had started from the early days, or had  contacts in top guilds when i began playing.  i would probably be in the  High end game now.  <p><center>

Guilds moving on.</span><hr size=1> I can see where you are coming from Yaldatin. This is one of the reoccuring problems with EQ; the placement of certain key items on certain mobs, making them quite contested. let me explain:<br>
<br>
- Dain: <br>
Dain is, at least on our server, up quite oftenly. Now, Dain's loot table, from my perspective is complete and utter trash for the most part. The Hammer is a fun solo toy, but nothing beyond that. His loot it garbage for me, except one piece. The problem is, his head which drops 100% of the time, is used to make arguably the best warrior/melee belt in the game. Short of perhaps Girdle of Thorns for warriors (which is actually worse than dain's belt after casting the effect), Belt of Dwarf Slaying is the best belt in the game for melee classes and some casters as well. <br>
<br>
- Yelinak:<br>
Same case as above. HOwever, his head is also used to make 75hp/75 mana 41% haste gloves, good for both melee and caster classes once again. He also drops a talisman used to make an ST key. <br>
<br>
- Tormax:<br>
This I fear is the worst mob of them all. Tormax wields one of the best loot tables I've seen in the game, better than every other velious mob except AoW from my perspective; and even better than quite a few luclin mobs. <br>
a ) Boots of the Storm are the 3rd best plate melee boots in the game. <br>
b) His head is used to make 85hp/110 mana boots with FT-2. Very few casters I've met have better<br>
c) His crown is a 100hp item with saves to all and 35ac. The crown is also an all/all item with only 1.0 weight; a perfect item for many classes<br>
d) His head can also be used to make a 100hp all/all droppable helm.<br>
e) 75mana ring (I think 75hp on it as well)<br>
f) ST key. <br>
<br>
The loot table above shows why Tormax would be so popular<br>
<br>
- NToV:<br>
For the most part, the drops are not very good. However, Blackstar, Cloak of Thorns, Wyvern-hide greaves, are a couple of the very attractive items that drop in this zone. They are once again mixed in with some other poor drops.<br>
<br>
- AoW:<br>
His loot table is awesome (for me at least). True, some of the ubers have no more use for a BoC, or War bow of rallos or monk greaves. However, they have uses for the rare helm or rallos zek, and BELIEVE me, they all have use for the Ring of Destruction. <br>
<br>
<br>
The reason you are seeing this pattern going on is because certain amazing items have been placed on the loot table of easy, lower-tier mobs. The loot is heavily sought, and make these mobs attractive to higher-end guilds. The fact that more guilds go for them makes them all the more competitive. The guilds go for 1 or 2 items and sell the rest. after all, cash is somethng all uber guilds could use considering the necessity for lots of peridots and the like. <br>
<br>
It's not very fair; but this is unfortunately how these things work. <p><center><p><font size = 3 colo = "blue"><b>Wilhelmm D'Averam<br>Warlord of the Apocalypse</b></font></p></center>

Guilds moving on.</span><hr size=1> I have seen similar problems being in a small guild myself, but POP sounds promising.  One of the things mentioned about it that I like is the fact that there will be some content that spawns a separate area for any group that triggers it.  So you can have 40 groups all doing the same content without conflicting with each other.  I hope they do that with most of the quest stuff. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85547>Khumak</a><br>

The main issue, of course, is that even though they have been killing much of that content for a long, long time, there are still many members who could use the drops.<br>
<br>
I can't remember the last time anyone went to Thurg for the Dain.  Sure the belt is still great but it certainly is not a big enough draw to bring everyone over (and fewer people have the faction or desire to camp out in Kael waiting for KT for the turn-in).  KT is another matter, that is a pretty good loot pool still and a ST key never hurts.  AoW is another again, a fun fight and a great loot pool.  Yelli has those gloves and a key and would certainly die if found up.<br>
<br>
None of those are first targets for guilds that can kill stronger though.  On patch day the desire is to log on, figure out what Remedy didn't kill that is still up and go from there (while also finding out where LoS is).  In terms of priority it is definitely anything in Ssra first, perhaps Shei after that.  Burrower if there or even CT if nothing else is around.  First Brood Dragons are worth heading for also and ST would be a target on occasion also I am sure.  Seru isn't being contested much as far as I know, so he can wait.<br>
<br>
I see the way things are as more of a comment on the slowness of loot dropping.  With 50+ members showing up for raids, a guild needs to do a huge number of Mob X kills to outfit the members in the loot that he drops.  In some cases (Cursed, HP, AL etc) there are so many strong rare drops that no guild will be 'done' with them anytime soon.  PoP will change priorities of course but upper-tier guilds will still head back to earlier Mobs to some degree of course, for ST keys if nothing else. <p><center><b><font color=RED><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78504>Celeris Tujimson</a><br>Assassin of The Nameless<br>
