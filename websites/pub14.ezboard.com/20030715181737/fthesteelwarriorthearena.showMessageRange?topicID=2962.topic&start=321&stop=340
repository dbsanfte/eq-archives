To reiterate - desirability at raids and desirability at exp groups are 2 completely different issues. If the knights feel they are not needed in raid situations to the same level as warriors, then start a separate thread addressing the issue. But don't tell me and my exp group that warrior taunt won't be fixed because I can tank on raids. Because that is what you are saying. You cannot draw a parallel between raid desiribility and xp grouping. They are 2 radically different activities.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do not see that as the problem. A good knight being chosen over a good warrior is ok, they are both good players.

Define good. If good is defined as able to hold aggro over slow and tash cast on an incoming mob, then a whole lotta warriors are in big trouble....<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The functionality of a test is to get as many variables equal to assess the importance of the attribute being tested. The attribute in question is warrior aggro vs paladin aggro - so you want 2 players of equal level and equipment in the exact same environment  to assess the relative use of both. Saying that 'warrior taunt is ok' because it was tested between a 'good' warrior and a 'bad' paladin is ludicrous in the extreme. Good and bad are in any event completely arbitrary assessments - how does one define that exactly?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It is my suspicion that a warrior significantly more dps than at least a paladin tanking. I know I give up dps in order to tank. Yes, we can cast stuns between swings, but with the fast weapons of today, that is hard to time, and with a lot going on, usually low on my priority list<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
DPS is irelevant to tanking - a tanks job is to BE hit, not DEAL damage. But in any event, 2handers are better DPS than dual wield and paladins can use them, admittedly with a lower offense cap. So the result might not be as favourable to a warrior as you may be thinking. Galtius' point about group DPS is very valid though. And how exactly as a paladin are you holding aggro if stuns are low on your list of priorities? <br>

To be your best for raiding you need 65 and various AA's, raid exp is not a very rapid means of getting those levels/AA. If your guild raids 10 hours a day that would seem to suggest that you only have limited time available to exp you don't really want to be LFG too long right? <br>

<br>
Yes actually I do. Make any group dependant class undesirable to group with and all he can do is sit on his hands, thats the concern being addressed in this thread. Raiding cannot be placed on one side of the scale with exp on the other, it doesn't work like that.<br>
<br>
Raids are a group effort and everybody usually has a part to play in the success or failure of the guild - being the offtanker/group healer/DA mob positioner etc may be considered less glamorous than the main tank position but those jobs and others that knights perform admirably are no less vital to the guilds success. i'm level 62 in a guild with 6 warriors level 65 and numerous AA's guess I need to exp some eh?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I can not think of a single boss mob that we do which I could tank on a raid. Can I off tank adds and such? Yes, I can. But the main bosses? No, I cannot. Could I tank some things we finished with 6 months or more ago, sure, probably, but those encounters are beneath us in the challenge involved, we have moved on. I think you will find in most guilds that only warriors are able to tank the hard bosses they are fighting, whatever they are. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
...and I think you'll find that many, many guilds on all the <br>
servers are only today moving through that content that you left behind 6 months or even a year ago. For them the use of knight tanks is a very viable alternative. Only a very small percentage of a server population will be always on the cutting edge. For a proper look at balance all levels of play need to be given consideration - that includes the non- EB'd level 61 player in the not-quite-so Uberguild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Let me put it to you this way. If warriors were given a 1.5 second 'cast time' ability that generated hate, like a stun, which they could use between swings, but knights were given defensive and evasive would you be happy?

Let me ask you this in return, would you give up your spellbook in exchange for defensive/evasive? it's about as balanced as your own proposal i.e. not very <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>One thing I would like to be clear about is knights consider themselves tanks.

Really, I do find that arguement ludicrous.<br>
<br>
Everyone plays their part in guild raids, exp groups are a much less inclusive activity....and exp groups are something that everyone needs access to.<br>
<br>
It's a good thing they do leave warriors as best choice to main tank in raids otherwise Afterlife would definately be making new recruitment guidelines eh?<br>

My point was to illustrate the some classes are less useful on raids, and sometimes feel completely useless. Of course no one who is already guilded is going to get turned down for a guild raid. I do not see that ever happening, no matter how bad a class is. That is just not how guilds work. However, guilds can and do refuse to guild any new people if they consider that class not useful. <br>
<br>

No, my point was to give a counterexample to the person who said that raids did not matter because most of his online time was spent in exp groups. Most of my online time is spent raiding. Which brings us to the following point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote:<br>

<br>
They may be different activities, but they are both part of the experience of playing Everquest. To say that you can ignore one while trying to balance the other is to not take the whole picture into account. This is how wild imbalances occur. You have to account for both desirablity while raiding and in exp groups. This probably will mean that some classes are better in exp groups and others are better on raids. I will ask again, would you be willing to swap places with knights, being better than knights in exp groups, but less desireable than knights on raids?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Define good. If good is defined as able to hold aggro over slow and tash cast on an incoming mob, then a whole lotta warriors are in big trouble....<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Good is defined as being skilled at playing your class. Good is knowing when to use the taunt key to be most effective. Good is knowing how and when to use /shield to be most effective. Good is good enough so that an exp group feels like you are a real benefit to have in the group.<br>
<br>
We are not talking about an emperical test of comparison. That very idea is impossible. There are way too many variables to assess, most of which are subjective. We are talking about desirability in groups of both classes. You simply cannot reduce the problem to which class can hold agro the best, and then try to even it out. The fact that knights can gain agro better than warriors is one of the strengths of knights, to balance out their weaknesses. <br>
<br>
Class balance is a big picture thing. You cannot reduce it to the one point where you are weak and say fix just that.<br>
<br>
And so therefore, dps is a valid thing in a group, because more dps means mobs die faster. Now the point that it is possible overall group dps goes down, because they might have to hold back more with a warrior, is a good one. If this is the case, if good warriors really cannot hold agro, then that certainly should be addressed.<br>
<br>
I would like to make one final point. That knights can hold agro better than a warrior is nothing new. It is not something that changed in PoP. It was true back at level 30 when I got my first stun in 1999, and is true today. It might be true that holding agro is more important now, perhaps because mobs hit so much harder, but the fact that knights can gain and hold agro better has always been true in EQ. It has been a signature of the knight classes for longer than warriors have had defensive.<br>

If during Kunark I had said that the problem wasn't with the Paladin class, the problem was whether or not the player running the Paladin was a good player, how might you have reacted?  I'm thinking you wouldn't have taken that too well.  In fact, you might find it somewhat insulting.  Sort of like I do with your implication that if a Warrior sees problems with initial aggro control, they might be or must be a poor player.<br>

Indeed.  So by this concept, since Warrior HP is one of their great strengths and one of the things that a group will select them for, it would seem reasonable that they should have considerably more than a Paladin, much as the Paladin has considerably more initial aggro.  It would make sense that the Warriors should be using their strength to perform the same function Paladins are using their strength, obtain and hold aggro.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, since it takes about 10 seconds for a Warrior to gain and establish aggro, while a Paladin can do so instantly, Warriors should have enough HP more than a Paladin in the same gear that they can stand up to an unslowed mob for 10  seconds and not drop below the value of HP a Paladin would have in the same situation.  What is the rough DPS of most common mobs in PoP?  500 DPS?  More?  Less?  The Warrior should be able to stand up against an unslowed mob every single battle for the duration specified without danger of dying.  So the Warrrior should have something like 5000HP more than a Paladin, right?  That would be playing to our strengths.  However that amount of HP is far beyond what 90% of the Warrior population will ever see. As a result, the aggro difference will need to change.  The time required to gain aggro should be short enough that the Warrior can gain aggro in the time frame his HP advantage will allow so that the slower can slow.  Not instantly, but quickly enough that he only loses 1k or so, about what he would normally have more than a Paladin.  To do otherwise would skew the game too dramatically in other ways.<br>

But yet your alternative solution would be to tell everyone who plays a Warrior, unless you're raiding a majority of your time, forget about enjoying your character or getting a group.  The Knights don't add as much value on a raid, therefore they get the groups and you get to log.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And so therefore, dps is a valid thing in a group, because more dps means mobs die faster.

<br>
And how exactly can the DPS not be greater?  If, as has clearly been established, a slower can slow immediately upon a mob getting in range with a Knight tank, how can you not have other people able to do other things sooner as well?  Please explain how stuns can negate slow aggro and yet not allow a Rogue to BS more, a Wizard to nuke sooner, and so on?  Logically, you can't.  It's impossible.<br>

<br>
Yes we know.  And prior to PoP it wasn't that significant a problem.  Because the common experience mobs in previous expansions had no where near the DPS of PoP mobs.  Wouldn't you consider that a pretty obvious fact?  That being the case, aggro control in the first few seconds of the common experience encounter is much more important than in any previous expansion.  I would consider this also to be pretty obvious.  How could you go expansion after expansion with initial aggro control not being that important and then in one expansion have it jump to the top of the importance list if in fact the expansion hadn't caused the change?<br>

Just out of curiosity, what are these weaknesses you are talking about? The 4% difference in avoidance caps that amounts to about 1.5% less damage, an amount easily surmoutable by paladin healing ability? The HP difference that is surmountable whenever a group has no cleric? The offensive skill cap differences that will amount to all of 100atk rating? The 3-minute plunder disc which is used in XP groups as &quot;emergency-only,&quot; much like your own heals and LoH? Do you honestly mean to tell me that you believe these minute differences are balanced against the virtual inability to achieve initial agro in a group, thereby making knights far superior as XP tanks? If honestly believe this, then you are no different than the warriors who claimed knights were just fine in RoK/SoV.<br>

<br>
True, it has. However, until recently, the defensive skill cap differences between knights and warriors were more significant. We had separate offensive damage tables. Our mitigation was better (it isn't now). Our AC was better back when it really mattered. Duel-wielding was better than 2-handed weapons. None of this is true anymore. We share the same offensive tables, 2-handers are WAYY better than d-wield, the defensive skill caps are much narrower, we have equal damage mitigation, AC differences between warriors and knights have decreased, not to mention higher AC has very diminishing returns. <br>
<br>
All the above changes have been in favor of knights. All have come within the last 2 years. Can you show me what has changed about the warrior class in that time? Don't ask, I'll tell you; nothing significant. Couple this with the fact that the role of taunt in XP groups has increased massively in significance, becoming far more important than minor mitigation differences. How do you justify this?<br>

This IS the issue we're talking about. Good warriors cannot hold agro. The suppressed group DPS with warriors tanking instead of knights is far greater than any DPS differences between knights and wars.<br>

You can when agro is really the lone important factor in determining which is the preferred tank class. There is NO significant difference between knight and warrior tanking ability in Xp areas. Both classes have the HP and tanking ability to fulfill the role, but warriors lack agro ability, while knights have it in plentiful supply. <br>

This is your standard knight beat around the bush response. Are there minute factors in subsequent areas involved in the whole knight vs. war in XP groups? Yes. Do these factors matter? NO. It's simple, in PoP, because of the greater demand for sufficient agro ability, Taunt is the only factor that needs to be addressed. Everything else, the minute diferences are insignificant, even when added up. The bottom line is simple, we have @#%$ agro ability in a time when Agro &gt; all. This needs to be fixed, very simple.<br>

<br>
Ah, the raid issue. This other fallacious argument hanging on by a small ripping threads that knights always bring up to impede any warriors fixes. Tell me, which class is more important on raids, wizards or rogues? Clerics or shamans? Answer; they are all important in different roles. Same goes for warriors and knights. Yep, knights don't usually MT on a raid; thats the warrior role. However, knights have their own purposes, notably in add-tanking because of their superior initial agro abilities, BSS and heals in the case of paladins (you can't tell me that pally group heals aren't useful in an AoE mob fight), or FD and agro-increasing spells brought by SK's. O<br>
<br>
n raids, knight roles are fare more versatile. Yes, a tanking warrior is more important than a knight, but you only need a couple of warriors to serve as tanks. However, knights are FAR more useful to a raid than non-tanking warriors. So, your claim that warrior superiority in a raid balances their inferiority as XP tanks is pure and utter <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BULLSH!T</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. After all, if you're gonna travel down that road, I could use the argument that SK solo ability, and paladin solo ability is &gt; warriors ability, therefore they must serve as inferior XP tanks.   <br>

I'm so sick of my warrior right now its not even funny. Im sick of excuses from people and from SoE. We bitch about taunt, mitigation, useless AA's, we get the same story every time. No one wants an upgraded taunt for the warrior because then they say......<br>
<br>
&quot;It would make hunting trivial and do away with aggro management&quot;<br>
<br>
THATS SO MUCH BULL /eyetwitches Newsflash folks the only reason my warrior tanks any better then a pal/SK is because I have a fricken discipline. Yes for a few seconds you can notice a increase in my mitigation abilities. SK/pals have lower caps, it doesnt matter. It really doesn't, the equipment available out there truly does make up for their lower caps. <br>
<br>
They can pull aggro on a dime anytime they want, tank just as well as us in 90% of raid encounters and have a zillion options for fun. What do I have, someone tell me. Please let me know what I have. Wait ill tell you what I have<br>
<br>
A half assed taunt ability<br>
Crits that fire off at normal damage 80% of the time (which other classes now have)<br>
A defensive discipline that I Can use once every 12 weeks<br>
98% reliablility on Proc weapons for help with AGGRO<br>
A horribly painstaking epic for a half assed reward only good for the proc <br>
AA Melee skills that fire off at such low percentages that you may never see them for hours. But if or when they do they only increase DPS by a minute amount <br>
A hitpoint advantage that can be made up for by other means<br>
<br>
<br>
What do I bring to a group? Nothing, piss poor DPS, piss poor Aggro control, piss poor Damage mitigation. <br>
<br>
what do I have....<br>
<br>
So my fellow warriors, go on and keep preaching how we are fine. We aren't, we were made into a dull, useless class that is slowly taking its place on the bandwagon of classes to put down previously occupied by the ranger and the paly. You other classes shouldn't feel sorry for us, we let it happen to ourselves. Telling ourselves we are fine, finding other means to make up for our lack of abilities we should of always had and always been wonderful at. <br>

When inviting people for an XP group, it is Paladin/Shadowknight/Warrior in terms of group desirability.<br>

Call me crazy but I think warriors should mitigate damage and control aggro NOTICEABLY better than Knights. In the current state of the game this is simply not the case.<br>

I say modify taunt so that it never fails, and it adds a ridiculous amount of aggro when used.<br>
<br>
Or, possibly add an AA ability that allows you to taunt from 100 feet away, adding X amount of hate to you. You have no spellbook, no healing power, no utility and no instant-aggro spells - why on earth would anyone choose a warrior in an XP group over their Knight counterpart?<br>

The only times I invite warriors into the group is when I know they have good gear or I am friends with them.

<br>
The most important point I wanted to make is that things are pretty close to balanced right now. It would be very easy for a change be made to make warrior taunting too good, such that they not only took over knight spots in exp groups, but also took over their spots on raids. <br>
<br>
I would like to see warriors get some sort of change to make them perceived to be more valueble in exp groups, but I do not want to see the change be so big that it changes the balance when raiding, and frankly I think that will be very very hard to do.<br>
<br>
I am just going to have to disagree with the people who think that balance raiding and balance in exp groups are separate things. I do not think it is, just as someone rightly points out, being able to solo is yet a third thing, although from a SoE perspective, since they want to discourage soloing, this is going to be less of a focus.  <br>

<br>
How they do this without screwing up current encounters I have no idea, but it should have been obvious that warriors should tank better from the beginning. Somehow that fact was missed by the development team at the time, and as sucky as it is, is not something simple to repair.<br>
<br>
I could see any significant improvement in warrior mitigation making tons of MT strat encounters trivial. Would almost need retroactive revamps to some (many?) encounters giving them &quot;PoP'esque&quot; twists to maintain the challenge.<br>
<br>
As for those that believe warriors should get improved agro, I simply cannot agree. No class should get the best of both worlds. Make holding a MOBs attention equal some amount of work is fine and in my mind welcome, but the reward for that needs to be a superior ability to deal with that attention. I am in the group of people that could care less if knights can grab agro at will, just need to make sure warriors bring something to the table to make them a viable choice in tanks.<br>
<br>
I also believe a lot of this comes from Sony's horrid itemization in EQ. I really think they screwed this up bad. So many items are either all/all or useable by all plate or whatever, which really tends to flatten the HP/AC curve pretty damn fast. Not until you hit the elemental armor do they start to make this a little better really. I wont even go into how silly I find items with like 130 HP <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>AND</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 130 MANA. That would be fine in some cases, but it seems like every item they make like this they mirror the damn mana over, making it much more valuable to hybrids. Not only do they get the same HP from it, they get enough mana boost to easily heal themselves a few hundred more, or mitigate some serious damage with stuns or whatever. grr.<br>
<br>
They got all held up on classifying items by plate/leather/silk where instead grouping by class would have been tons easier to balance.<br>

I dont whine that a SK in my guild has 200+ more AC than myself unbuffed using a 2hs.<br>
My AC is good enough to tank Cursed, XtC, TT, Behemoth....<br>
<br>
Last saturday i was playing my 62 cleric in CoD as we had no cleric but another warrior LFG in guild.<br>
The warrior has around 150 AA's compared to the above mentioned SK with around 20 or so.<br>
Who was tanking better wasnt really the issue.<br>
The warrior has a lot of offensive 2h AA's so they made a bet if the SK could still taunt off when he started attacking at 70 percent mob health.<br>
Of course he could.<br>
Then i showed the SK how a warrior feels when he cannot get agro.<br>
With a secondary healer (65 druid) in group i loaded 4 stuns and rotated them on the next mob.<br>
Guess who couldnt get agro this time ?<br>
It was a bulbonian war rat, according to message, the stun part of the spell never took hold, so only the 300 or less damage pissed the rat off enough so sk and warrior never saw it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65418">Gnomb Goodbasher level 65 troll warrior</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
