<br>
This should get a lot of people shouting at me, but oh well. Last nigth I went from around 680<br>
ac to 709, now granted this is not a huge change but none the less...<br>
<br>
I am a lvl 33 warr and proceeded to take on the Hero with a friend.... needless to say we did kill him, but it was a very very close thing in which he did in fact kick my but!! I did not die but that was due to a sow and a snare. Now he does hit hard... but what does ac really really do? I did not notice a diffrence in my ac when he hit me beforeor after this change.<br>
<br>
I was very very tempted to get naked and see if he hit me for 600 hp in in one hit. <br>
One day I think I am goign to try this, I am sure it does something but how much does it lessen the blow. <br>
All those casters who have 200 ac, doe she hit them fro 400 as opposed to the 87 hp he took off me? <br>
<br>
Just a little curious.... I guess when I was a lvl 4 those skels hit me for 20 and now they hit me for 1, but how does a lvl 7 skel even manage to hit me for 1?<br>
<br>
Any opinions on this?<br>

<br>
AC reduces the average amount of damage you take.  Monsters will still be able to hit you for max though.  You could test it by fighting a monster on your own with someone to just heal you.  Then take off your armor and use the same weapons and log both fights and see how much damage you take for each situation.<br>
<br>
Also, a 29 point difference won't make a visible difference but I imagine if you parsed it out over a long period of time you would see the benefit.  I used to do Sebilis in my early 50s when I was wearing a few pieces of Cobalt, an EB BP and Indo greaves.  I recently came back at 60 in Champion's and Cobalt and I barely need a healer against the frogs up top, especially if they are slowed. <p>~Tunare's Enforcer~<br>

Just that the frequencey of how much he hits for max will be very great compared to wearing armor.<br>
<br>
Really, the combat system seems to be a battle between two numbers.  AC and ATK.  The higher your AC, the better roll you get against the mobs ATK.  Likewise, the higher your ATK, the better roll you get against the mobs AC.  I'm pretty sure that ones AC also has a huge impact on the attacker's misses.  That orc pawn you used to wail on way long ago could hit you a decent amout of the time when your AC was low, and on par with his ATK rating.  But now at the higher levels with a much bigger AC value, that orc pawn swings and swings and swings... but rarely lands a blow.  His ATK rating didn't change at all, yet he doesn't land blows as much as he did before... but your AC did grow, causing the misses that the little guy is most likely getting frustrated with. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There could be a roll to see whether you're going to miss or not, which I would assume there is.  Just a standard, no AC into consideration at all, roll.  The standard &quot;nothing is guarenteed, there is always a chance to fail no matter how high your skill&quot; roll to see if you miss right off.  Then after that, calculate the AC and ATK to see if the successful attack roll actually lands against the AC of the defender.  If not, you see a miss (what our poor little friend the orc pawn keeps seeing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ... and me way more often than I'd like heh).  If the roll against his AC is successful, calculate damage using the AC value once again (lowest damage roll would always result in at least a 1 damage attack at this point I'd assume).<br>
<br>
That's my take on it anyway.  Not sure as to how accurate, but I do remember hearing something on the Sony boards about not all misses actually being misses... but rather most of them are your blade being deflected off the armor of your foe.  Which makes sense... just that I wish they would have distiquished between a miss and a full armor absorbtion if this IS truely the way it's done. <p>--Defender Hagus Bruichladdich, 55 Myrmidon of Divine Legion.<BR>

<br>
That's close, but at some point I believe the game also does a roll against all the defensive skills.. dodge, riposte, parry, and so on.<br>
<br>
I don't think those skills are calculated into the AC roll (else we wouldn't see 'but you dodge' messages in combat).<br>
<br>
&gt; lowest damage roll would always result in at least a 1<br>
&gt; damage attack<br>
<br>
Only before level 28. After that our damage bonus starts to increase, which means our minimum damage on a successful hit will be higher. <p>Xzzy, from the Bristlebane server.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhagusbruichladdich.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hagus Bruichladdich</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/01 6:18:04 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.divinelegion.com/images/Hagus_256color.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AC has anyone ever tried?</span><hr size=1> Aye aye... Dodge and parry.  I didn't mention those.  Not sure which one is checked first, Dodge or Parry.

Aye, didn't mention the STR bonus added ontop of the damage either.  The reason weapons such as the Moss Covered Twig were sooooooo uber while they were primary handable heh. <p>--Defender Hagus Bruichladdich, 55 Myrmidon of Divine Legion.<BR>

Its all over this board, just how AC works in relation to how much damage you take etc. <br>
I've heard the argument before, that level is what determines how much damage ye take.  USUALLY AC goes up as skills increase or you get a new piece of equipment that increases yer AC.  <br>
AC is the mitigating factor, it does have an effect on how much damage you take.  AC along with all those other afore mentioned thingys like dodge,parry etc etc, more about not being hit at all when it comes to those.<br>
I've heard it said that each pt of AC adds to a percentage, that percentage goes through a roll to determine if its max or minimum but its the % of the max damage the mob can inflict.  i.e X mob hits max for 100, yer AC of y equals a percentage. After roll the percentage is applied against the max damage of the mob and you take whats left.  I dunno if thats exactly how it works or not, just been told it is.  I didnt program it either do don't actually know exactly.<br>

<br>
As a fully equipped level 33 warrior with just over a 700 ac, the level 30 mob does enough damage that death is a real possibility.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level is the primary determination of whether or not you are hit, AC plays a very small roll in this.  AC IS the primary determination of how much damage you get hit for.<br>
<br>
If a mob can hit for 500 on me when I'm armored, it will hit for 500 almost every time when I'm not.  Armor does play a big part in mitigating the damage you take, but not in being missed. <p>Lie, Manipulate, and Crush them all.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaerildroigheann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeril Droigheann</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/25/01 12:04:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AC has anyone ever tried?</span><hr size=1> I don't think it's level that makes the difference in your example except maybe indirectly.
