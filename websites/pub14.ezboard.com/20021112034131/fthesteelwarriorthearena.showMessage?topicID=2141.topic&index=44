<br>
It was a bad bad idea and only done in desperation.  Now in some of the simpler exp groups it was passable but by no means a good idea.  Warriors had far superior hps and AC to a monk.<br>
<br>
How do I know?  I was a cleric back then b4 Kunark.  I did all the &quot;raids&quot; that were to be done.  Tell ya what, I *hated* when the monk pulled aggro cuz his health dropped like a rock.<br>

Note.  All old world.  None has upgraded stats.  Only three items are no drop - common PoS belt and a L20 quest reward plus the Sode - knock off 7AC if you don't want to include such rare items as the Sode.<br>
<br>
Total AC - 956AC with 745AC input as the baseline (had a bit of trouble confirming this as, obviously, most Monks I know aren't L50 and few want a quick death to check).  It's easy to check the Warrior AC as they had 200 Defense - same as my Shaman - which is 524AC naked.  (or did that get upped to 210 at one stage?  That would add another 25AC to the baseline).<br>
<br>
The thing is, these games with items are all well and good.  But what you need to examine is what the average *intelligent* player was at.  Smart monks who waylaid the Black Pearl crap were sitting, in the main, around 900AC without a huge amount of work.  Topping out about 940AC.<br>
<br>
Warriors were sitting, in the main, in the low 800s.  Even with full Indicolite, as can be seen from the above profile when you strip out the Ac25 Dagas (did it have *any* AC back then?  I don't recall it did) that uber-Warrior is barely breaking 900 (916AC minus Dagas).<br>
<br>
Sure, the dumber player in his Black Pearl and Str items would have been at 800AC.  But there were *plenty* of Warriors that did the same and some of them were barely breaking 700AC at L50!<br>
<br>
And as I said before, what *are* these Kunark items which changed all that?  I used, hmm, two when I twinked my Monk.  The rest was *all* Old World and that was with a good budget to buy and Velious having been out for a few weeks.<br>

Base AC was 560 on a level 50 Half Elf Warrior with 107 Agi, which is what I was, and which is what my base AC was at 50.<br>
<br>
With your primarily AC equipment, your HP was significantly lower than warriors' as well, as favorable warrior stats were on almost every piece of Indo.<br>
<br>
Pre-Kunark pretty much every monk wore stat jewelery over AC that I ever encountered, even post-Kunark for some time, and VERY few went + Stamina.<br>
<br>
The only reason monk/shaman was first duo to do FG's was because monk was able to solo pull, and you know this.   Had nothing to do with the takability of monks.   Had a warrior been able to feign death, there wouldn't even be a question.<br>

warriors get close to 920ac with god loot and full planar (note the monk gear is more comment stuff) however the warrior have about 2800hp vs the monks 1400hp.<br>

I guess clerics would prefer healing a warrior with 40 less ac then the mob, where a sup heal seemed like half a ch, but who knows.<br>
<br>
Monks are good in duos, cos descent damage output (better then warriors, even before the damage table upgrade) and cos of there ability to pull, especially FD pulls.<br>

If what you are saying is all true then there is no role at all in VI's plan for warriors. Monks tank damage and everything better  by your logic so like we are saying warriors need a major upgrade or like the case you are making monks and others need a major nerfing. Personally I think upgrading the warrior is the better route to take but thats just my opinion. <p><BR>

No monk in their right mind would use Hero bracers or some of that other crap you listed to have AC over (what was then and still is now in the case of the Tranquil Staff) good weaponry.  And why wouldn't they choose AC over weaponry?  Because they know they are supposed to be damage dealers, not tanks.<br>

Monks also did the most frontal damage, tanked well, avoided better then everyone and could somewhat solo decently.

</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, cos clearly you haven't understood any of the points made.<br>
<br>
No class should have a dominance over a single role in the game.  That is a broken mechanic if it is allowed.  For some *unfathomable* reason, Verant allowed this to persist (and still do) with Cleric healing.  But for every other skill and ability there is choice.<br>
<br>
Monks provide an easier path to tanking well.<br>
Monks provide marginally better tanking where their AC is either so high compared to the mob that it is fully mitigated (pre-XP Change &quot;XP mobs&quot;) or so low than no AC achievable can mitigated the mob (Bosses).<br>
<br>
Warriors provide an ability to maintain a CHeal chain on harder hitting mobs (more HP means you can sustain a mob with 8k damage per round instead of 7k)<br>
Warriors provide a safety net (again due to HP advantage) to cover poor play, lag, whatever.<br>
Warriors have superior taunt mechanisms beyond simple damage.<br>
<br>
The problem is that Warriors should also have the ability to do the physical tanking better on higher level mobs where only their AC can begin to mitigate.  This doesn't work in the current game mechanic because Verant never bothered to balance the Velious and beyond encounters.<br>
<br>
Instead of balancing the ATK (or level or however the mechanic specifically works - we are speculating here, but it is probably Mob ATK) for various ranges of AC as happens for lower level mobs, Verant seem to have just gone &quot;make em all 3k ATK&quot; and that's the problem.  Not enough mobs show a benefit from AC between 1200 and 1800 (or whatever the current max attainable is).<br>
<br>
This *has* already shown signs of change - Cazic Thule 2 has *50s* mobs where ACs beyond 1250 are pretty useful (not really done much to determine the upper limit but I'd expect it fades about 1450 or 1500 for full mitigation).<br>
<br>
I think that Planes of Power will show more of the Cazic Thule 2 design and less of the Luclin &quot;just make em all 3k ATK&quot; approach.  That *alone* will fix Warriors.<br>
<br>
But Verant, being Verant, might need prodded.<br>

You say that other people are not understanding the points you try to make and then say something like this? *boggle* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uedtubrutus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ed Tu Brutus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/2/02 2:41:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2141.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: huh?</span><hr size=1> Drach,<br>

I didn't say *reliable*, I just said superior.  And Warriors to get weapons designed to taunt and the taunt skill for mobs below L65.  This gives them advantages over Monks and makes them superior.<br>
<br>
Just not reliable.  As it should be.<br>

Heh I mis-read, I thought we were talking since Kunark was patched (ie, anything pre-Velious).  So nevermind. <p><center></A><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=104582">Veteran Reinholt Talanthas</a><br>Warlord<br>Black Tower<br>Xegony
