It's already been said that 6 non-wizards can kill Gore or Sev.  That can, has, and will be done.  Some people responded that there is risk involved and that with MB, there is no risk.  Again, that was responded to that wizards DO have risk in the situation.  I believe that this has been argued effectively.  My conclusion is that MB simply allows the kill of a mob like Gore or Sev to be faster, but with no less or more risk than 6 other similarly equipped and AA'd classes.<br>
<br>
2.  People that gank mobs from people that are engaging a mob can be reported.  Please do that, it's jacked up.<br>
<br>
3.  People that try gore twice and fail deserve to have someone else get a crack at it, IMO.  If you fail twice at nagafen at lower levels (at least on the bristlebane event calendar) you've already gone one more time than you should have.  Same thing here in my opinion.<br>
<br>
As I see it, manaburn can only be abused in a couple situations:<br>
<br>
-PvP.  This is definately messed up.  No one should get a 1 shot kill guarantee on most people.  Not PvP personally, but I see this as broken.<br>
<br>
-Ganking a mob out from someone.  Can't say I see a solution, but I hate that aspect too.  Jerks will be jerks, I suppose.<br>
<br>
That's all I see.  There may be more, but I haven't seen them.  Since &quot;Team Manaburn&quot; has come into play, I've had the option (though not the cash) to buy a green scale.  I do not belong to a guild, nor do I want to.  I like the freedom and lack of politics.  Before Team Manaburn came around, this was not even possible.  Similar situation with bards, more white scales have come to the market for those who do not want a guild or those who do not have the raiding power to take gore.<br>
<br>
I've personally never been affected negatively by Manaburn, and I plan on eventually getting my 52 wizard (rapidly approching my 55 warrior) manaburn if I ever get that high.<br>
<br>
I apologize to post a novel, I just tend to vent when I see misconceptions about a class, and people wanting to nerf another class for any reason.  Ask necros that played 2 years ago what the nerf stick feels like.<br>
<br>
Chaotic Conformity<br>
<br>
P.S.  ShowEQ may be limited to showing 999,999 HP.  It's definately feasable that the sleeper is capible of having more than 1 million hp.  And good luck trying to get 150 keyed wizards at all together.

I am pretty sure that manaburn doesn't have its damage reduced by 2/3 in PvP like other spells do and its also lure resist.  At a minimum I think that VI needs to nerf the damage by 2/3 like all other spells and give us some chance to resist part of the damage.  Right now high level PvP is a joke on RZ because of manaburn.  I personally have stopped wearing resist gear altogether since it is completely useless.  I just go full no drop with empty spots if I don't have an item for that slot. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=179608>Gartuff</a>

<br>
Only one thing ya missed with respect to manaburn's downside... it really limits VI's options for future encounters.  Since it's not resistable, there simply can't be any worthwhile single group encounter mobs that have less than about 6x average manaburn hp, or the encounter is probably trivial before it's even introduced.  Same deal with raid mobs, only on a bigger scale.<br>
<br>
I dunno about others, but with fights lasting 20-30 minutes occasionally, it does seem a lot more... satisfying? than the old 1-2 min fights were you either won or CRed.  It allows flavor to be added (repop control, positioning, non-stupid effects (i.e. not DT) to otherwise cookiecutter fights... a good thing.  Clearing in for a half hour or so to a fight that was over in a minute (one way or the other) always seemed kinda lame to me.<br>
<br>
That's pretty much my only complaint about MB, otherwise I think it's a pretty cool skill.  Might make sense to make it have a non-stacking 1pt dot effect (or similar) tho, to keep massed MBs from being a problem.  You could still burn a mob, but not everybody at once... pvp thing is pretty messed up too, but at least forlorn totems cast faster than MB does. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Personally since manaburn has been wide spread (3-4 months) I've seen 0 outdoor kunark dragons.<br>
<br>
I think there are only two solutions for manaburn:<br>
- limit it to 150k+ mobs (around the point where you need as many wizards as you do a normal raid)<br>
- donalesque nerf, manaburn adds a buff (on mob) that cannot be overwritten.  That way you only have a MB every 30 seconds or whatever. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6318"><img src="http://www3.sympatico.ca/lchisholm/luth_sig.jpg" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ueldryc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/29/02 1:51:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> The claims that manaburn HELPS mid tier guilds are just plain laughable.  Is it so helpful when you're hoping to do Gore and Sev now that the uber guilds aren't too concerned with them, but you can't because team manaburn keeps smoking them instead?  Yeah, real helpful there... and yes, guilds do try to raid these mobs.  The main reason would be for the epic drops.  Well I bet they can buy it from some wizard for 100-200k.  Lucky them! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And in what strange fantasy do these guilds actually get their own manaburn wizards?  Yeah, right.  Maybe in rare instances there's a L60 wizard with 23AA who actually stays in a mid tier guild.  Most don't.  Particularly when they hit L60, they become more valued by the top tier guilds and they leave for them.  I've been in mid tier guild land pretty much my whole EQ playing time and when highly desired classes for raids reach a certain level, most of them leave to join the ubers.  About the only time they will stay for long is if they're a RL friend of some of the long time guild members and they stay for that reason.  Even then sometimes they leave.  That's the way it goes.  Don't expect the 60 wiz with a bunch of AA to hang around.<br>
<br>
Yes, warriors need some better class AA skills, but also, manaburn is NOT okay.<br>
<br>
oh well, the game is Evercaster now anyway (and monks with insane AC thanks to ridiculously high AC monk items in north ToV and beyond... and don't get me started on the AC softcap)).  Put an epic mage in your group and watch that pet go.  It was already sick.  A mage friend with his epic agreed with me on that before.  then recently they made it even better for no apparent reason at all.  &quot;Hey, it's really powerful!  Let's make it hit more accurately and give it better saves so it will be even more uber!&quot;  <br>

<br>
You dont need 150 people to kill AoW, you need about 36 as a very minimum.<br>
<br>
So saying that 150 wizzies could kill Kerafym is kinda dumb when you could make the same statement about AoW.  Who cares if you could kill him with 150 manaburn wizzies, when you can do him with 40 people in well balanced groups?<br>
<br>
And just to clear up a misconception, when Velious was released, they revamped the HP system so that mobs could have more than 32k hp.  With this change, the server no longer sent the total HP and HP remaining, it only sent the percent.<br>
<br>
Therefore it is technically impossible that anyone ever saw how many HP kerafym had with SEQ, because in order to have more than 32k hp, SEQ had to show percentage only.<br>
<br>
And btw, I dont use SEQ (Im too lazy to learn Unix), I dont know anyone who does, but I do read the hackersquest boards when Im bored at work sometimes and thats where my info comes from. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usolinarinnoruuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solinar Innoruuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/29/02 2:50:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> double post <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usolinarinnoruuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solinar Innoruuk</A> at: 7/29/02 2:54:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utakatok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>takatok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 6:58:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> I would like to add my 2 cents in here because, while I agree overall that manaburn is a good thing.. the pro-MB team side of it is fudging just a bit.  Manalow seems have summed up the pro-MB side quite nicely so I'd like to respond to his points:<br>
<br>
1. ..... My conclusion is that MB simply allows the kill of a mob like Gore or Sev to be faster, but with no less or more risk than 6 other similarly equipped and AA'd classes.<br>
<br>
6 Mana burn wizards each need 1778 mana to MB down a mob like Gore.   Now a level 60 wizard with only 1778 mana is extremly poorly equiped.  I would imagine most MB wizards have 2.5 - 3k (uber)  end of mana.   6 non-wizards who were equipped as well as a 1800 mana wizard could most definately NOT kill gorenaire.<br>
<br>
3. People that try gore twice and fail deserve to have someone else get a crack at it, IMO. If you fail twice at nagafen at lower levels (at least on the bristlebane event calendar) you've already gone one more time than you should have. <br>
<br>
I agree with this pretty much.  However,  my experience so far with the MB team is this:  While forming to try tallendor (for the first time) with my mid level guild, we failed at first because of underestimating Dragon Fear.  While we are rezzing for our second (and final try) of the night  (with about 5-10 more poeple incoming to help);  Team Manaburn of Terris Thule ports in on us.  While telling them we were going for tallendor a second time they setup in front of us and proceed to pull tallendor off of our druid who'd been keeping track of it while we rebuffed and ZOT him down.  No discussion, refusing to answer my tells.. just port and whack him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Manalow also said:<br>
Since &quot;Team Manaburn&quot; has come into play, I've had the option (though not the cash) to buy a green scale. I do not belong to a guild, nor do I want to. I like the freedom and lack of politics<br>
<br>
This is a VERY valid point and I do think your right.  But the very fact that these are on teh market for people with the plat, in some cases means, that guilds who are ready for this level of content  are being denied the experience.   I would also tend to argue that overall, the average firts time player climbing through the levels is very unlikely to get a shot at buying these items.  Most of the time its going to be some uber level player with spare cash who would like it for his twink.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall I agree with the conclusion that Manaburn is a good thing.  Its a VERY useful tool for the mid level guild.   However,  I am firmly of the opinion that Team ManaBurn is NOT nor ever will be a good thing.  <br>
<br>
IF, the team MB went around and only knocked of dragons that were up for longer periods of time, i have no fault with that.  However,  when they are moving in on guilds actually attempting this content.. it just falls into the realm of being loot whores.    Seriously,  on TT i bet team MB gets 50 + percent of the MB targets if not more.   Why would they feel they needed to muscle on a night of what would have been great fun for our guild?    Only 2 outcomes of letting us have a second try would have happned:<br>
<br>
A)  We win on second turn, and the MB wizards would just lose 1 of MANY tallendors they would kill.   Also, losing to a big mob you've never beaten, recovering and winning is probably one of the best feelings you can get as a guild.  You get blown away, your recoup, revamp your strats and you win.   Its the best feeling in the world.  And Team MB now has the power to steal that from people, and from what i've seen proven over and over again they will do it.<br>
<br>
B) We lose a 2nd time and team MB gets to zot the damn dragon anyway.<br>

Despite what many proponents of Team MB have claimed, no set of non-MB wizards can effectively and easily knock of Kunark Dragon level encounters like they can.   If this were true, we'd have seen it already.    I find it highly improbably that all the other players in this game are just idiots and don't realize how easily they could get good cash loot.  Its equally improbably that these MB wizards are fools and wasting their time.   <br>
<br>
Additionally, I would wager many servers have a Team MB like we have on Terris Thule.  Team MB is nothing more than a moderated channel that the wizards pop in and out of to go get a mob.  While there may be a few wizards who have a the good conscience to use the MB responsibly (Wandor on our server comes to mind), the majority (like anyting with people) tends to fall far short of this ideal.  I have been told by MB wizards on our server:  &quot;I can honestly say if you were prepping for a pull that I wanted to MB down, I would most likely burn it down&quot;.  This is from someone who've I've known casually for a long time and had loose ties with our guild.  I really doubt my guild would get much more courtesy from complete strangers.<br>

Er, try 3k-4.5k. Any wizi at 60 with less than 3k is running around nekkid. Best I personally know is 4700 mana. Hell, my wizi is only 55 and I already hit 3k, and I don't even have uber wallpaper.

<br>
MB does and doesn't help mid level guilds.  These guilds can't organize and group at the speed at which a team of MB wizards can.  It's also very discouraging to these guilds.  Why try to even race when MB wizzies get there faster almost always?  A bigger guild can beat MB wizzies, but that's because of organization.  Now, if the guild gets an MB wizard or two, these guys could join the MB team and get what the guild needs...that's the way I see it helping these guilds.  Yes, they could help their guild kill the mob, but chances for that are considerably more limited and you still have all the organizational hassles.  Much easier to cut your wizard free on a mission to get your guild the epic pieces it needs.<br>
<br>
Yes, other small number of people can kill these dragons.  But they require some pretty nice gear to do so.  A much larger time investment than a piddly amount of AA (yes, the amount to get MB isn't that much, especially if you want to compare it to the time it takes to get gear to match Furor's).  Additionally, those other small groups of people still need some balance.  Those people also take longer to organize and buff.<br>
<br>
The MB issue is only going to get worse.  Don't bother giving crap like that there aren't enough MB wizzies and they are all in uber guilds.  There are plenty and more and more of them aren't in uber guilds.  All it takes to get MB is time.  These newer MB wizards aren't going to be tied up in guild raids on patch day.  MB (combined with the power of wizards vs high end mobs) will draw more people to the class.  Some people like to say &quot;if you are so jealous, make a wizard and get MB&quot;...their logic being that people will see how much work it is.  Guess what, people are making wizards and like any other class, wizards can be easily powered (group with a melee or else run some varition of beat down/mem blur).  Wizards can now be twinked much like melees...slap a KEI, an FT item, some focus items and watch them go.<br>
<br>
Anyway, to me, there's nothing wrong with MB in principle (PvE-wise).  What is wrong is what is mana burnable.  It shouldn't be Gorenaire, Talendor, and Sev.  These dragons are important to people for their epic drops and haste.  Wuoshi and most others?  Who cares?<br>
<br>
Simple enough solution: leave the existing dragons as they are and add a spawnable epic version for them, like they've done with ranger and druid epics.<br>

Normal day is to locate target using a lower level character.  Once target located, log onto MB wizzie.  TP to target sight.  MB target.  Loot.  Gate back to nexus.  Go AFK for 2 hours.  Log on to 2nd account on 2nd PC and go have fun for 2 hours.  Repeat.<br>
<br>
It should nerfed.  Not even counting the PvP aspects, Team mana burn has trivialized too many encounters.<br>
<br>
Simple fix:<br>
<br>
Have manaburn place a &quot;buff icon&quot; on the target when it lands.  No other manaburn will stick on the target while they have this &quot;buff&quot;  (make it last for 2 min or so, that way manaburn could still be used on raids and such, but would eliminate Team Manaburn).<br>
<br>
For PvP, change the &quot;buff icon&quot; to a &quot;curse icon&quot;.  This curse would last for like 12 hours or so.  That way if you do in fact get manaburned, you are immune to mana burn for 12 hours.  This would give you a fighting chance if you did infact try and get revenge on the manaburn wiz. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufaileaybara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FaileAybara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 10:54:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tearnet.com/everquest/images/members/faileaybara.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> A) leave the wizzs alone<br>

And MB wizard are far more common than you think. We are a mid level uber guild (moving to giants, killing WToV named) with a smallish roster...50 or so platers.<br>
<br>
I think we have 3 MB capable wizards. And we ahve more coming on strong. I will bet you dollars to doughnuts just about every guild could put together their own team mana burn--certantly the 6 they need for RoK dragons.<br>

I don't know what the answer is, but yelling the usual &quot;leave the other class alone and worry about your own!&quot; doesn't convince me or probably anyone else who's concerned about it of anything.  Everytime an issue about a class ability being overpowered comes up, someone says it.  Heck, even when bards could use a charm trick to have the scion kill gorenaire for them and the body wouldn't poof (woot! soloing gorenaire!), there were a few people arguing that it should be left in the game and was a legitimate &quot;tactic&quot; because bards were the &quot;masters of trickery&quot;. lol... good one.<br>

<br>
That's the best answer I've seen.  A MB group swooping in and blasting a kunark dragon while a mid 50s group gets ready to engage is lame.  Then seeing the scale at auction the next day.  It's not reportable/petitionable if you don't engage...  Though a report might build momentum for something to be done about it.<br>
<br>
It doesn't help smaller guilds much.  I've read posts showing that just nuking with regular spells the entire time in long fights is more efficient than MBing then rodding/robeing back to full.<br>
<br>
It's a neat ability that's being abused by a few. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwarriorrmog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarriorRmog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 9:57:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  My only problem with MB</span><hr size=1> Thank god my sever has a rotiation on RoK dragons.<br>

Team manaburn has done something on my sever that nobody has even mention in this thread.<br>
<br>
They have locked epics.<br>
<br>
Cleric epics.<br>
<br>
As if trying to get Rangefire wasnt hard enough.   She is FFA on my sever and is MBed down very fast every time.  <br>
<br>
I would dare to say that after RF change and luclin AA that maybe 5 or 6 guilds on my sever have gotten every single rangefire.<br>
<br>
I come from an alliance that considers these dragons raid lev content.  Yes we are getting stronger but without 3 MBers of our own we have 0% chance of getting a cleric epic as it is right now.<br>
<br>
I find that sad that we could be cleric epiced (We could easliy take RF), if we ever got a chance.<br>
<br>
Grats Guild XYZ on your 9th cleric epic.  That will help you save 3 min on your next wipe, great.<br>
<br>
We will keep CRing for 25 min at our raids I guess.<br>
