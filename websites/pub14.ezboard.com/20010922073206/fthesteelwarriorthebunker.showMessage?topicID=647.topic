Yes, it's a huge stamina drain but it's also one of the highest damage 1handers you can get from level 20-45 or so.<br>
<br>
I had a Wurmslayer on my mid 20s warrior for a while. Then I sold it to a level 40 friend that had crappy weapons and started using a Lamentation. My damage output dropped dramatically using the Lamentation because I was too low to be able to count on the damage bonus. Scrapped up some more money to buy a new Wurmslayer and used that till level 45 and my damage output and taunting were just fine.<br>
<br>
For certain levels, 20-40 or 45 the Wurmslayer is about the highest damage 1hander you'll get. After that drop it for a good low delay weapon when you can. Just my 2cp.<br>

Case and point: Weighted Axe. High damage yes? Delay sucks, and you couldn't taunt a rabid blood-crazed orc with it. Taunting is what we do, we are meat shields (as much as I hate the term) and having no stamina and a slower weapon will not help us do this.<br>

Plug in Wurmslayer and Lamentation for a level 20 or 25 warrior, not 50+ and watch the Wurmslayer dramatically outdamage the Lammie. It wasn't the big numbers blinding me, it was the fights taking almost twice as long when using the Lammie over the Wurm. My normal hunting partner was complaining because stuff was dying so much slower than it did before.<br>
<br>
Comparing the Weighted Axe to the Wurmslayer is pointless. Wurmslayer has a damage/delay better that 1/2 where Weighted Axe is worse than 1/3. The only thing that makes Wurmslayer bad at high levels is it's high delay, not it's ratio. And if you're not the main tank it wouldn't even be bad for doing damage without taunting.<br>
<br>
Remeber, the thing that makes low delay weapons so much better at high levels is your damage bonus for your primary hand. I believe the formula for that is (level - 27)/3, so in your 20s and 30s you have little or no damage bonus to help you do damage so your damage is determined by the damage/delay of your weapon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utalicmoore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talic Moore</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/con's RED</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/01 2:14:52 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://eyesonff.com/ff1/fighter.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Opinions on Wurmslayer</span><hr size=1> Not really, because you are using the argument higher damage is better.<br>

We taunt. End of story. If you are not a good taunter, people tend to die. Wurmslayes do not help you taunt, other weapons do. And I don't see how you did more damage with a WS than with a Lammy...<br>

He states specifically level 20 or 25 warrior.  At those levels you should have zero problem taunting and it should outdamage a lammy easily, seeing that the damage bonus at those levels is minimal.  <br>
<br>
I understand that the consensus on this board is it's the devil...but I would have to say at low levels, it looks to be a nice weapon.  Especially for the cost.  If you're giving advice to a low level warrior and they blow their entire wad of plat on a lamentation at level 20 because you say the wurmslayer sucks, I think you're doing them a disservice and helping them waste their money.<br>

Just my two cents from someone who's never owned a wurm <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  But remember the context of his statement...level 20-25...not 50, boys.<br>

Hope I can get this to look right.<br>

45       524             528<br>
<br>
My damage was computed on a warrior with 150 str and no haste. Only wrote down the damage/minute of the primary hand. As you can see Copeland's has Wurmslayer outdamaging a Lamentation until about level 45 when Lamentation finally over takes it. Feel free to test different weapon combos on your own. I know it's not 100% accurate but it's helped me decide which weapons to get my warrior in the past.<br>
<br>
For lower levels damage output and some taunting ability is controlled by your weapon's ratio, not just the speed. Once you get to 45 or so ditch the Wurm for Lammy or Jade Mace (prefer Jade Mace personally) as soon as you can for your main hand, but until then it's a very solid weapon for doing damage and taunting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/umintzyfresch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mintzy Fresch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/01 10:03:43 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/uryvichk/mintzy2.jpg width=119 height=193></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Opinions on Wurmslayer</span><hr size=1> As has been said many a time before: Nothing *wrong* with the WS at lower levels.

Wurmspayer . . <br>
<br>
why it's bad to a warrior is the eye candy .<br>
sure, at lower levels doing the damage it does is great, and, yes it does outdamage most weapons at those levels.<br>
<br>
bad thing is when you progress into the 40's and above you've become so accustomed to the big numbers, moving up to a faster weapon doesn't seem like a good choice. how many youngins think that slashing once ( or twice on a nice set of double attack damage ) of like 60-70 damage each is better, or, in the same amount of time swinging 6-8 times for like 30 each. second point, try prying a wurmy out of a young warrior's hands and try to make him or her believe that using a cane of the tranquil, or, and of the nice mid level weapons ( yak warclub, smoldering brand, etc. ) will be more beneficial to group dynamics, at any level. the wurmspayer at 20's is a better short-term investment; but, thinking of the long haul, wouldn't the lammy or even less of a cost a cane or yak club be a more beneficial investment ? even if he could get a lammy at his level it would be a hard item to find a replacement for.<br>
<br>
that's why, to me, a wurmy is a bad choice. it hypnotizes the user into seeming he's doing more good damaging critters and not paying attention to his or her role in a group, hitting fast and often, thus maintaining aggro.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ushikariiapoccalypse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shikarii Apoccalypse</A> at: 7/2/01 8:01:32 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugrontorgrimblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grontor Grimblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/01 8:57:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Opinions on Wurmslayer</span><hr size=1> <br>
People mention taunt.  Dont discount it.  With a lamentation + 11/22 1hb in offhand I am able to out taunt/keep agro over a warrior 5 levels higher than me with a wurmslayer.<br>

I never had a wurmslayer, so I'm not really commenting on that, but I'd just like to put my 2cp in and say it is MUCH easier for me to regain agro now. <br>
<br>
I never lost agro to a single pull even after it got nuked or I got healed (probably chalk that up to good agro management from the nuker/healer too). And if I lost agro on a multi pull (usually from being healed) it took me no time what so ever to get it back.<br>
<br>
It was hard to change weaps from doing around 75 per hit to 30 per hit but I'm glad I did. It's easy for me at the higher levels (with my druid) to see how important it is for the tank (pref. warrior) to keep the agro. It almost seems like damage output is secondary, just don't force the healer to waste too much mana on people that shouldn't be getting hit.<br>
<br>
I've rambled on, seemingly off topic. I'm sure that wurms are just fine up to the mid levels, but if you want agro, get some fast, decent damage weapons (from my limited experience).<br>

Try grouping with a ranger with all his spells that cause aggro, snare, procs, etc are what I am talking about.  You both have some type of haste as well.  If you are using a wurmslayer, you will hardly ever get aggro, regardless of how much you taunt.  The way that aggro is calculated, you just are not hitting the thing fast enough plain and simple.  Faster weapons generate more hate.  This is the same reason that people who are being the main takn would never consider using a 2H weapon, regardless of the ratio.  You might be dealing major damage, but what good does that do you if your group mates are the ones aggroed and dieing as a result.  A ranger, rogue, etc cannot take near the damage or have near the AC that you have.  Let them worry about any little bit of extra damage while you worry about TANKing.<br>

Personally I've always been leery of big and slow weapons. Big and slow may have better potential damage than weak and fast, but your min hits tend to be the same and when you figure you're usually doing an &quot;average&quot; hit... I think the advantage goes to swinging fast.<br>
