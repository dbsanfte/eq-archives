(Taunt Related)</span><hr size=1> Greetings Fellow Warriors, <br><br>I am curious to the fact as why we warriors live with the fact that our ability to taunt is not up to par. I do not want to step on any toes or begin a war of the whines. <br><br>I just simply want to know why the Warrior Community hasn't tried to form some kind of organized petition or voice on the subject of taunt. Everyone just seems to live with it. <br><br>Most Speak of taunt from warriors of all levels seem to be of a joking tone. I love my warrior, I do! He is great fun and I am having a blast. But I simply think as one of the few classes who never really bitched about anything. I think taunt might be one of those things to start bitching about to someone over at Verant. <br><br>We are in the game not to deal the most damage nor do any fancy feign pulling or buffing. But to hold aggro and take a good beating if your the MT and to provide support damage if your not. <br><br>It's too hard to taunt, thats it. Relying on weapon procs is not a plan but a cover up. It's a loophole on how to become better at something (taunt) that we should already be great at. <br><br>Taunt is a half ass skill at best, talking to numerous 50+ warriors it doesn't get any better later on. In fact it just gets worse. <br><br>I don't see how anyone could say it would be unbalancing for our taunt to be better. Shadowknights could out taunt us hands down with a click of a button (disease cloud). I won't even mention Paladins, or Rangers. Lets not forget monks who don't even have a mean of taunting besides pure damage. <br><br>Like I said I am not here to become a flame sponge, I am just posting wondering YOUR thoughts on this. Your thoughts on our taunting ability. If you think we should recieve an upgrade or change. <br><br>Some Idea's I have pondered are...<br><br>~ An upgrade in skill and success of Warrior only taunt. <br><br>~ A taunt discipline, something with a low refresh time and upgraded maybe 3- 4 times throughout your life. For example...<br><br>Level 20 - Discipline of the (whatever) <br><br>This discipline would add X amount of hate. <br><br>Duration - Instant<br><br>Refresh - 4 Minutes (which would decrese with level)<br><br>Then another taunt discipline at (example) 30, 50 then finally at 60. <br><br><br>Well I have rambled long enough, please post your thoughts and try to keep it flame free. <br><br><br>Windance Warwillow<br>30th Warrior <br>Brell Serilis<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaabidano.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aabidano</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 9:22:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why???

(Taunt Related)</span><hr size=1> As it stands today, a competent warrior must be grouped with other players who are also competent for taunt to work properly.  As a 60 warrior I have little to no problem holding taunt unless the players I am with are marginal or worse.  This is for regular experience grouping.  And I don't have the best agro holding weapons (ornate blade of the general main hand and sword of morning off hand).<br><br>Now, this doesn't address tanking the big mobs.  Taunt there does seem a little buggy at times.  Basically it requires everyone to be doing their job pretty much exactly right for it to work the way it ought.  And strangely enough, it seems getting 30 or 40 people together who understand what their jobs are and can do them competently can sometimes be a real strain, at least for my guild.<br><br>I guess my thoughts boil down to this.  If everyone is on the ball and doing what they should, taunt works great as it is today.  If not, then its a problem.  Why should Verant be responsible for making it easier to succeed with sloppy play and a lack of class competency?<br><br><br><br>   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ushadokastr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shadokastr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 10:44:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why???

It can be a pain when your shammy is always getting agro and then running away, so educate them.  If your guild can't figure it out, educate them or find a better guild.  When everyone works together to do something cool, it feels much better than just standing there hitting kick once in a while.  Leave the challange, revel in it, enjoy it, and scream at your groups and guild if you have to.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This game is all about people working together.  and when people work together, aggro isn't a problem (most of the time)<br><br><br><br> <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146119"><img src="http://www.logicfactor.com/spinfire/Nevsig.jpg" border=0></a><br>click sig for profile</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwindenwarmheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winden Warmheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 10:46:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Im not...</span><hr size=1> I am not in any means condoning sloppy play.

Yes, we do, on average, less damage than the other melee classes, thus making it harder to keep aggro.  Yes, it *is* a challenge to keep aggro.<br><br>I like challenges.<br><br>It makes me think.  &quot;Hmmm...how can I increase my taunt value further&quot;...&quot;Wonder how I can do more damage and not lose taunt value&quot;...etc etc etc.  If all there was to being a warrior was /autoattack, /taunttuanttaunt, I'da prolly quit by now.  As it is, we have to think about how to keep the mob facing us, and I like that.  I like the fact that I have to yell at the rogues/monks sometimes.  I like the fact that I get to yell about people to get the positioning of a mob right.  I like critiqueing my weapons and armor, searching for that next thing that'll give me the little bit of an edge I might need.<br><br>&quot;Give us something that we can use as a last ditch bailout&quot;...use your head so you don't need a last ditch bailout.   @#%$ happens...when it does, you have to deal with it.  If it was because of a mistake, learn from the mistake, you become a better player that way.  If it was bad luck, accept it, after all...@#%$ happens.  Want something similar to AoE taunt?  Work your ass off to level 59, and earn it.<br><br>&quot;The druids are whining and might become better because of it, why shouldn't we?&quot;  Well, for one, it's generally accepted that Druids have relatively little use at highend raids, except a couple buffs and the ability to get people there quickly.  Secondly, you're a warrior...I see the warriors of EQ as being a fairly no-nonsense group of people...people who aren't inclined to whining, griping, complaining, etc.  So we've chosen a class that may have a couple faults.  We deal with it, silently, and still manage to be successful, effective players.  In chosing a class with our given ability set, we've accepted a challenge...the challenge to make the most of what we have, and to succeed at whatever levels of the game we persue.<br><br>I like challenges. <p><table width=350 height=120 border=1 style="border-color:#000000; border-width:3; border-style:solid;font-family:Arial;" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td background="http://www.guardianalliance.org/gfx/gasig.jpg" style="border-style:none;">   <img src="http://www.guardianalliance.org/gfx/x.gif" width=30 align=left>   <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=200>      <tr>      <td>         <font color=#FFFFFF size=+1>         <b><center>         <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45412"          style="text-decoration:none; color: #ffffff;"><u>Thak Havocblade         </a>         </u>         </b><br></font>      </td>      </tr>      <tr>      <td>         <font color=#969696 size=-1><center>Myrmidon of Brell's 56th Keg         </center>      </td>      </tr>      <tr>      <td>         <font color=#969696 size=-1><center><a href="http://www.guardianalliance.org" style="text-decoration:none; color: #969696;"><u>Guardian Alliance</u></a></center>      </td>      </tr>      <tr>      <td>         <font color=#969696 size=-1><center>Zeb Server</center>      </td>      </tr>   </table></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwindenwarmheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winden Warmheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/02 6:51:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  hehe</span><hr size=1> Well I would have to agree with Thak a bit, Man yelling at monks is so fun. <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufuloriancavestomper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FulorianCavestomper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/con's RED</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/02 8:45:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: hehe</span><hr size=1> Um?
