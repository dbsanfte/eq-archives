I've been flagged for PoV/PoS for some time as were several other members of the party, so the objective was to three out of six of the group through.<br>
<br>
First attempt, the Wizard in the group was ping ponging the mobs all over the place.  I was working my ass off trying to taunt when appropriate.  Willsapper was procing, but it was unpredicatable as it always is, and sometimes it still wasn't enough.<br>
<br>
So, on the second attempt the Cleric asks the SK in the group if he could out aggro control me.  The SK's response?  &quot;Easily&quot;<br>
<br>
They decide the SK is now going MT and I'm going to be DPS.  Well, it was a bit of a shot to my pride, but if that's what needs to happen, I figure fine.  I do mention in group chat that I resent the way PoP has screwed things up for Warriors.  So the SK tries to make me feel a little better by comparing our AC/HP.  I've got about 40 AC on him and about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2200 HP</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  That's right, he's in the low 4k range and I'm in the mid 6k range completely buffed with what we had available.<br>
<br>
We go in and try it again.  He owns aggro all over the place.  The mobs never leave him to beat on the Wizard.  Wizard is nuking at will.  Cleric makes the comment that, &quot;this is so much easier on my mana bar this way&quot;.<br>
<br>
Great.  Wonderful.  I've spent six months working on black smithing so I can make Barbarian cultural for myself.  I've spent countless hours in NToV getting no drop gear.  I have worked my ass off getting 25 AAXP.  All so some SK with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2200 HP LESS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> can make me look like a chump because he can dance circles around me aggro control wise. <br>
<br>
To add insult to injury, after we run a few more cycles and still aren't quite doing it, they decide they need a bit more DPS and drop me for another SK.  Excuse me, I'm using twisted steel bastard sword, one of the best DPS 2hs this side of Ssra, and they dump me because my DPS is too low?<br>
<br>
I'd like to thank SOE for the opportunity to feel like 3 years of playing a particular character and pouring as much time and energy as I possibly could into it in order to be a useful participant in the game has been complete and utter waste of my time for reasons completely and totally out of my control.  Oh, and the first SK did point to my defensive as being really useful.  Gee, thanks.   <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
Lets examine this shall we?  Wizard was nuking a lot because the mobs needed to go down fast.  So it wasn't just a matter of the Wizard sucked.  If the Wizard had waited until I had solid aggro, the chances are decent we would have lost even worse than we were.  The group combination was not a particularly high DPS one, so we needed as much from the Wizard as possible.<br>
<br>
SK was controlling his aggro fine, his was just a @#%$ load better than mine.  He could have cast voice on me, but why bother when he can just keep the mobs on himself with a lot more assurance and a lot more easily.<br>
<br>
As far as the DPS thing is concerned, I have no idea.  They eventually won the trial.  Could they have won it with me tanking?  Probably, but it would have taken more effort on their part and why should they bother if they can do it easier without me?  Kind of the point, isn't it? <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

If you do this, then all 4 mobs come for warrior. Use max Damageshield and HoT like Supernal Elixir and you should likely win, with a CH maybe at the end of a round (at least this is my preferred method). The DS will chew a nice chunk of the mobs' hp for the 3 &quot;adds&quot; before you get to fight them. If you have a second plate tank, don't be afraid to use him to do some damage to one of the other mobs while you are beating down the first ones. The Executioner has to walk a shorter distance each time before he chops off the head, so killing 2, 3 and 4 needs to be done in increasing tempo - this is why I ask the nukers to lay low and not drop a bunch of damage on the first ones, because it is in essence wasted.<br>
<br>
Another point is to keep everyone close together so you won't have the ping pong effect. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions ~ Team Headstart</a></i> <br>

I think what he's trying to point out is the most crucial thing:<br>
<br>
The cleric remarked how much mana he was SAVING using an SK to tank rather than a warrior.   This was EVEN with a 2200 point HP difference, showing that HP differences don't amount to mana savings in anywhere NEAR the magnitude that solid aggro control does.<br>
<br>
Why didn't Glatius have voice of Terris on?  Who knows, perhaps the SK didn't have the spell.  Why was the wizard nuking so hard?  Well because he or she HAD to in the group to polish off the mobs.  Most of us are aware that in order to beat the trial of execution, the one that most people do for some crazy reason, you are required to maintain a specific DPS or you lose.   The wizard nuked hard to maintain that level of DPS.<br>
<br>
I had a similar thing happen to me, except that he group chose a Paladin instead of myself.   The reason was that there was no slower in the specific group, and there was a lot of concern about mana using me, the warrior when it came to the final boss.<br>
<br>
I was perplexed as to why they said this, I wracked my brain over and over.   Wait a minute I thought, I can use evasive or even defensive against the boss, that makes no sense that there would be more of a concern than with the Paladin, but then the light went on.... OF COURSE!   If the Paladin is capable of focusing the cleric's heals throughout the encounter, there will be a significantly larger pool of available mana at the end of the encounter, so any net savings of mine due to EVEN USING A DISCIPLINE are not nearly close to the net cost savings of a single target taking the beating.<br>

Rangers SK's and Necros have nasty agro if they dont know what they are doing. nuke happy casters come in below these 3 IMO<br>

I dont like being in groups that are not made up of people from my servers top 4 or 5  guilds mostly because alot of them dont know how to control their agro.<br>

I've had Happy Dotter the Lunatic Necro pull and nothing short of the necro dying was going to make the mob lose agro.<br>
you know what I mean. HDtLN pulls a mob with like 500,000 hp and the mobs comes into camp with like 30% hp and the necro says &quot;landed a few dots&quot; followed by &quot;WHY ARN'T YOU TAUNTING&quot;  then I look like the dumbass when he dies.<br>

Everyone wants to do more damage..nuke more, DOT more, etc.  With a warrior, you can only do so much.  SK/pallies let your casters do ALOT more to that mob, killing it faster, saving mana on ping pong and in general making everyone's lives easier..in return for what?

<br>
Yep that's the whole problem.  Our lack of aggro control is supposed to be made up for by our superior HPs and our superior avoidance/mitigation.  If that's the case then our HP/avoidance/mitigation advantage should be proportional to our aggro disadvantage.  The example above actually is a good representation of some of the PoP raid encounters where low HP, high DPS bosses need to be killed FAST.  That means having a warrior tank requires the guild to hold back on DPS which makes the warrior a liability.<br>
<br>
The fact that a 2200 hp difference did not make up for the superior aggro control of the SK is just ridiculous but it's true.<br>
<br>
I am using a Blade of Carnage + Blue Epic and have noticed a huge boost to my aggro control over the Windblade I used to use.  That being the case, I was doing a nice easy xp grind in Valor last night and our chanter died twice because I couldn't pull aggro off of him when he got a few resists on slow.  Sure AE Taunt worked the first time, but then I have to wait 15 minutes to use it again.  After the first 10 seconds or so my EB procs kicked in and aggro was locked on me but during the initial stages of the fight we would have been better off with the ranger tanking. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=472195">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Lack of Snap agro. if I work my ass off, I can establish agro quickly. Maintaining agro isn't a problem as much. However, my agro establishment is greatly dependant on when my BoC procs. EB is awesome for helping maintain agro, and a well-timed proc does gain agro faster. However, our woes regarding lack of instant agro are still present<br>
<br>
I think an idea presented by an SK on another thread involving an additional taunt button that would give &quot;snap&quot; agro with short refresh time would work wonders. Have a button with re-use time one minute that gives warriors an Addition XXX points of agro. The one-minute refresh time would make warriors consider exactly when to use the ability; after slow, or on an early cheal, or broken mezz perhaps. It should be single-target only, and move a warrior up a certain amount of spots on the agro list. I think 300 points of hate would be a good amount on such an ability. This will move a warrior 3 spots up, likely to the top of the agro list, for a short time.<br>
<br>
This won't be game-breaking by all means, because we still won't have terribly stupendous agro, and that top spot can be lost quickly. So, if a chanter slow, warrior uses it and keeps the mob on himself. However, if the cleric has to cheal early and the warrior doesn't have enough established agro, the mob bounces back onto the cleric. This will force warriors to carefully consider when/how to use this ability.<br>
<br>
in my opinion, this won't make agro trivial, because warriors could lose that top spot easily if other group members aren't careful. However, this will give a huge boon to the agro establishment category, among the bigger problems faced by our class to date. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Wilhelmm D'averam<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Overlord of the Apocalypse</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

Also tell the casters in your next trial group not to ping pong the f'ing mobs.  If they are going to nuke they need to stand right next to the mob they are nuking.  It doesnt do the group any good for the casters to pull the mobs out of melee range so none of the melees can do any damage <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=179608">Gartuff</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> &lt;Ex Tempore&gt;<br>

Is it really making so much of a difference that warriors really are being forced to stand aside in favor of a hybrid who can and will tank mobs with zero melee and relying stricly on spell aggro?<br>
<br>
Well, lets take a look. I'll break down zone by zone how my guild uses Warriors and Paladins &amp; Sk's. I am going to just ignore most of the very low teir experience zones since I will be talking strictly about our performance durings raids.<br>
<br>
I'll specify what we use to clear, and what we use to kill the end-boss for the zone.<br>
<br>
Nightmare-B:<br>
Clearing: We don't select a main tank, it's ussually FFA killing all the way up to Terris. Kills go faster when we go all out in this way, and the mobs never live long enough to ping pong anyway.<br>
<br>
Terris: We use a Paladin as tank, they can hold her attention <br>
while the rest of us kill the adds, and discs are completely unneeded for her.<br>
Moths: Free-for-all AE and Melee.<br>
Gargoyles: We use Paladins and Sk's to grab these because they gain aggro faster and hold it, period.<br>
<br>
Torment:<br>
Clearing: We use Paladins to tank all trash mobs during the clearings so we can kill faster. We also use them as main tanks on all the smaller named mobs because our nukers can go all out without ping-pong, making for a much much faster kill.<br>
<br>
Saryn: We use a Paladin to tank her because they can hold aggro without hurting her while the rest of us kill adds. The adds are tanked by Rangers who stand farther back using their bows, making it so they can grab aggro before the birds add to the casters fleeing Sorrowsing (which he even works).<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong: Paladin tanks.<br>
<br>
Innovation:<br>
Xanamech: We haven't killed him in months, but when we did we still used warriors for tanking. If we were to do him in the future we'd probably stick with a Paladin so nukers can go all out.<br>
<br>
Clearing: FFA clearing, nothing can hurt us here.<br>
<br>
Behemoth: Paladin tanks, they hold aggro so well we can keep casters out of the room and they can go all out without him running out of the room and warping. If a caster gets summoned the Paladin can get aggro so they they nuker can again leave the room. We use warriors in the corners killing the light blue bugs, they don't need alot of DPS so we do well there.<br>
<br>
Drunder(tactics):<br>
Clearing to Rallos/Vallon/Tallon: Paladins, no ifs ands or buts. Almost all adds are mezzable so we mez everything and have an sk watch for unmezzables and take those if we ever need it at all.<br>
<br>
Vallon Zek: We use Sk and Paladins to handle Vallon Zek, they grab aggro from the splits much more quickly and reliably than a warrior ever could, and from quite a distance to boot.<br>
<br>
Tallon Zek: He is pretty much FFA he dies so fast anyway and never sticks to one person as he jumps around.<br>
<br>
Rallos Zek and the Warlord: We use a Warrior, we just have to let her build aggro long enough so that our casters can go all out when they are called, all other melee have to periodically turn attack off.<br>
<br>
Bastion of Thunder: <br>
<br>
Clearing: Shadowknights, they pull too.<br>
<br>
Agnaar encounter including smaller named: All Paladins except for the mana-tap encounter where we use a Warrior. This inclused summoned named during the encounter and the named leading up to Agnaar.<br>
<br>
Halls of Honor:<br>
Clearing: Shadowknights, our Paladins are offended at the thought lol.<br>
<br>
Trials: We use Paladins and Shadow Knights and main tank for all encounters except for Rydaa, we use a defensive warrior as main tank and a defensive warrior for rampage when it sticks, but this is a zarg fest unlike any other, he has a tendency to pong like crazy.<br>
<br>
Halls of Honor-B:<br>
Clearing: We use Shadowknights to pull and tank. <br>
<br>
Guardians: We use Warriors on the 3 named Guardians in fromt of MM.<br>
<br>
Mithaniel: We use a Warrior to Tank him with a Shadowknight on rampage when possible.<br>
<br>
Crypt of Decay:<br>
Temple clearing: We use Shadowknights to pull and tank.<br>
Temple Sequence named: We use Warriors to tank the ones who lifetap and Paladins for the rest.<br>
<br>
Bertoxx event:<br>
Trash: Shadowknights and Paladins tank and handle mez breaks.<br>
Named: Shadowknights pull and tank 6, Warriors Tank 1, Paladins tank 5.<br>
Bertoxx: Warriors for Tank Shadowknights for Rampage.<br>
<br>
Tower of Ro:<br>
Clearing: Shadowknights pull and tank most of these, monks pull and Paladins tank in certain areas.<br>
Named: Shadowknights and Paladins, so nukers can go all out.<br>
Sol Ro: Warrior<br>
<br>
Earth:<br>
Clearing: Shadowknights pull and tank.<br>
Named: Mostly warriors.<br>
<br>
Water: <br>
Haven't explored.<br>
<br>
Air:<br>
Haven't explored.<br>
<br>
Fire:<br>
No Access.<br>
<br>
With this breakdown it is very apparent that warriors really are a liability if used during raids for anything other than tanking a mob who can potentially do more damage per round than a player can have as hit points. But, this will certainly change once we have our hybrids properly equipped in Elemental Plate, the hit point gap will almost close.We'll probably be reduced to using Paladins and Shadowknights as main tanks because of superior aggro control, and funneling off the damage taken by having our warriors with the Living Shield-3 AA /shield them in a rotation. Laugh if you will, we've been working on perfecting this in Plane of Earth, where aggro control is CRUCIAL.<br>
<br>
Warriors I know who bitch enough to tank are looked at like attention whores. The guild suffers as a whole when using a warrior to clear to bosses, because nukers can't go all out, and this slows us all down.<br>
<br>
Aggro control used to be heralded as the responsibility of the guild and not the individual tank, not so in PoP. Because a single Paladin and Shadowknight can hold uncomprimised aggro durring encounters and clearings other classes have lost the sense of danger they feel when a warrior is tanking. Nukers begin to whine if they have to hold back, shaman begin wo whine that they can't slow a mob while it's incomming and just let the Paladin/SK peel off the aggro before it reaches the Shaman, and healers have no one else to watch but the main tank, except for mobs that AE. When you have a warrior tanking everyone has to be at the top of their game, and sometimes it's just more trouble than it's worth with such a safe and easy alternative tank.<br>
<br>
We already know it isn't 'fair' that we're a one-track class being replaced, but is it really fair to ask our guilds to slow down their progress because of our lack of ability to compete with hybrid tanks? Hopfully SoE will adjust the reliance guilds are having on hybrids as tanks, and the problem is only getting worse as guilds realize what REALLY works most efficiently, regardless of what is considered 'fair'.<br>
