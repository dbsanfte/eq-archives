AS a warrior we are the hardest class to play period.  As far as travleing goes, no other class has the problems with traveling that we do.  We are the only class that has no option when traveling but to run ur butt off.  Other classes have hide, sneak, feighn death, camo, invis, lev,ports, sows and what ever i am forgetting.  If we need to get somewhere we basically have to hope we run accross a kind soul to help us or hope our hitpoints last till we get to the zone line. Those are our choices.  This makes traveling on most of kunark, velious, and luclin damn near impossible. I have yet to see most of velious and kunark because as a warrior goin into some zones alone is just suicide and wheres the fun in that.  And 120 stones of armor dont make us run no faster let me tell ya.  As far as making money we have very little options as well.  The other classes can port, sow, rez, clarity, or at least pickpocket, I think we get beg?  Monks hae no abilities to offer others for donations but with the FD that makes farmn like giants and other stuff possible.  Warriors dont try to solo giants ever unless we come accross a bored healer and thats not to common. And most trade skills require forage or somthin of that sort so count urself out of baking or brewing unless u got a lotta plat that u are willin to give to the foragers and I dont.   Warriors cant solo anything post 40 for exp.  If someone has found a way for a warrior to solo after 40 without being a twink(i.e. buying regen bp or having a cleric alt sittin there healin urslef with) please post it here i would like to know about it.  And now that I am post 50 gettin in a group seems harder for us as well.  I see more warriors LFG than anyone else.  We are always hangin out by the front of the zone or somewhere we can run to cause we cant gate or escape any other way till the rest of the classes think oh yeah maybe this mob needs someone to beat on  we need a warrior.  Other classes Disc make sense, most of ours are useless.   And I dont know about you but fightin the pally or the monk all night for aggro gets old. And chasen the cleric or the chanter around in a cirlce while they yell for help b4 they die gets just plain silly.  Maybe taunt should ohh i don t know work once in a while maybe?  And why is it some of the War only armor comes with wis or int?  Who the heck wants  smart warrior?  We may be the base for all other races to compared to but what is left to compare?  We are not the strongest anymore. We dont hold the most hps anymore.  We dont bring anything to the table cept to be able to stand there and get hit and we cant even do that anymore.  I dont know if verant pays attention to EQ anymore but maybe they should have a warrior GM or guide.  Anybody ever see one?  I havent, cause even they know that we are being husseled out the door like an unwelcomed guest.  I just see the warrior class being left behind the rest and it just gets harder at the higher levels cause they really dont need us then.  I dont know how to fix this or if it needs fixin.  I just think the rest of the classes could be kind and remember we are still here and usually we will be more than happy to get the snot beat out of us and die for you if u would just ask or hit that invite button.  Maybe folks should start huggin tanks instead of gnomes?  Maybe we should go on strike for a week or 2?  All tanks off the battlefield and into the taverns and when asked to go kill Naggy or whatever just tell em sorry your busy or you have to log soon?  I dont know.  Just frusterated and ranting.  Sorry you had to read it.<br>

<br>
About travelling, well, I have to disagree.<br>
I enjoy travelling and discovering new zones.<br>
I get jumped by a mob ? Hell, /disc evasive and let the mob hit me while I go to zone, laughing at him while he try to hit me.<br>
Last time I was really in trouble was when I jumped in the water in Swamp, discovering these new Black Ravener mobs, hit for 200. I lost 3 bubs of HPs, but that's because I ran away in panic instead of running to the zone just behind me. <br>
Anyway, I can't even remind the last time I died when travelling.<br>
I want to run faster ? For 100pp I have a 10-charges SoW potions (and run3 fit well for most of the travelling I do), and for 200 I have a 10 charges of levitate potions (for dreadlands and Letalis zones <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). Less than that if I ask my shamy friends.<br>
And cloudy potions are our friends.<br>
Clerics have more difficulties for travelling.<br>
<br>
About money... Hell, I think the other way.<br>
Take an enchanter, does he makes a lot of money with clarity ? I don't think so. Even with KEI, there are only a few greedy ENC that charge for this spell (or when random_dr00d_01 come ask the ENC for KEI so he can quad faster).<br>
Only money-makers I can see so far are: rogues (pickpocket), in zones like Sebilis.<br>
That's all. Teleport charges won't make you earn a lot of money, this helps at lesser level, but when you're 55+, this isn't worth it. You gain far more by hunting in Sebilis.<br>
<br>
About taunt, and our group desirability, I think it's already bein' debated in others threads <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Well, that's true we lose some of our desirability, that's a part of what we ask to VI. But saying you're stuck in a zone because you aren't able to quit it... What zone do you speak about ? Chardok ? Sebilis ? Really, zones are easy to quit, just need to shout , &quot;Train ! Save Wifes, Children, and rangers first !&quot;, and go zone. Eventually, if you're a bit low, use your evasive disc, this is the best disc when running to a zone. I've done it myself a lot, through level 53 to even now, at 60.<br>
<br>
You're wrong when you say we do not have the highest amount of HPs. We still have, the main problem is the gap always diminishing, and that because the extra-HP is not worth the loss of aggro when you have to choose between a SK, and a War, as a MT (considering the raid DPS differences when you choose a WAR as a MT, instead of a Knight).<br>
<br>
I don't want to be rude, but I see your post as a non-constructive rant <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
&quot;Clerics have more difficulties for travelling.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope, not true.  Clerics have root &amp; atone.  This is all they ever need when traveling (assuming only one mob aggros on them at a time).<br>
<br>
How can you honestly claim warriors can travel well, when you point to *purchased* potions and a disc warriors don't get until after 50 as the means?  Face it, no class in the game has the travel difficulties warriors do.  I know it's probably been a while, so you don't remember what it was like before you reached 60 and mobs' aggro radius became 1 inch.  Trust me, travel sucks.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;About money... Hell, I think the other way....&quot;<br>
<br>
If you can get into a group in a place like Seb, sure you could win some decent loot.  But this is a total crapshoot, and you'd better pray to the RNG.  I do agree that porting or trading buffs for donations isn't a good money-maker either.<br>
<br>
However, the single best way to make money (for the non-uber) is to farm.  And there isn't one thing worth a damn that a warrior can farm.  All the good soloing classes have a huge advantage in this area, as often they can farm and grind Xp simultaneously.<br>
<br>
And look at how much cheaper it is to equip the other classes.  Because all warriors are chasing the same gear, prices are way out of line.  Ever compare the price of any piece of cobalt to all the other Kunark armors?  It's crazy how much more it costs.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to be rude, but I see your post as a non-constructive rant&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe that post was not very constructive, but it did a good job of summarizing the current state of warriors in EQ.  We are at a severe disadvantage.  We can't solo for crap.  Groups are catching on that we hinder more than we help, and even if they do decide to accept a warrior as a tank it's limited to just the 1.  They'd rather have damage dealers or somebody with utility to fill the other spots.  We're only as good as our equipment.  Traveling below 50 *is* perilous and difficult, and CRs in many zones can be impossible without help.<br>
<br>
We are rife with problems.  They exist from 1 to 60, but become more apparent as you level.  I think the warriors fate was sealed when the powers that be decided we would be out-damaged by monks and rogues (who had more skills than us to begin with).  Tanking doesn't stack.  That means we have to compete with the knights &amp; monks(?!?) for that single role.  The future is bleak unless something is done.  It's already too late as far as I'm concerned.<br>

<br>
travel isnt really hard for any class post 55 or so, its just time consuming and boring.  ports make it easy, gate and invis help a lot, root/fear help a little..<br>
<br>
with jboots or runspeed, i have almost no danger travelling (not counting ww, @#%$ mraaka).  i have a tinkered invis device, but only use it in a couple zones...  4k hp and runspeed get me around pretty good.<br>
<br>
travelling sucks for any non-porting class, period.  gate makes it faster, other spells make it a little less dangerous, but it sucks all the same.<br>
<br>
at lower levels, travelling can be very dangerous for warriors if your not carefull what zones you travel through, i was a twink and learned which ones to stay out of quick<br>
