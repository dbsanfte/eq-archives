<br>
I just want to say this. I dont think that Verant has any idea how to fix the problems that have come up with Warriors. <br>
<br>
Really i think that the only way they know to make classes better is to give new spells. In the case of the non magic classes they dont really have any available channels to take. At least without getting griped on by everyone. In order to really put the warrior in a position where noone would really gripe as much it would take a complete overhaul. Something that from a programming perspective is about as fun as the sudden stop at the end of a 200ft freefall. Not to mention the fact that the massive undertaking would cause no telling how many bugs. This would end up in a customer service nightmare. <br>
<br>
Having said all this heres what i think that they need to do.<br>
<br>
First: change the formulas for how well we take and dish out damage to increase both. One way to do this would be to increase our cap per level on our mellee type skills. for example skill=5xlevel + 10 instead of +5 or maybe an even more dramatic jump. This really wouldnt take much coding i think and it would be a very welcome change. This also would prevent the classes that arent affected (SK pally ranger) from complaining cause they lose nothing.<br>
<br>
That is a temporary solution to a permanat problem. So to this i offer solution 2<br>
<br>
give us spells <br>
<br>
yes i did just say that, i think that we should get &quot;special attack&quot; style attacks that use stamina instead of mana. these attacks would be things like....Warrior wants to disable the opponents attacks so he aims for the foes arm, thus damaging the arm and causing the foe to lose some of its attack power. Or attacking specifically to damage the armor of the opponent and thus lower its AC. My personal favorite would be to use a piercing attack to hit the foe with a DOT, anyone who has seen the end of &quot;Gladiator&quot; can hopefully relate to that idea. These attacks would be skill based off weapon skills, such as the piercing skill being used to see if your dot works, instead of spell skills like evocation. Also required is that you be holding the weapon that corresponds to the skill in your primary hand for it to work, this would make it a bit more of a skill thing to being a warrior as timing and cycling weapons would require some effort. <br>
<br>
now i know im mentioning all warriors , since this is a warrior board, but the same idea can be applied to Rogues and Monks.<br>
<br>
Rogue: Make the posions work like spells with a component cost. Maybe change how well they work or tweak them to be not AS damaging and such to make it more fair that they can now be used more than once a fight.<br>
<br>
Monk: oh come on, watch any martial artist. does he use the SAME attack all the time? no of course not, so put the attacks that monks get on seperate timers and stick them in the spell gem slots ( the same with warrior specal attacks and rogue poisons) these changes i think would make the game more interesting and allow for changes later should things be needed to be taken to the next level, AKA next expansion.It would be no different than adding a new spell to a casters repetiore.<br>
<br>
Well thats my idea. If you think its decent or want to make adjustments go ahead, just keep them reasonable please. <p>~Gatsu Bloodbourne, Champion of Clan Twisted.<br>

Advanced combat &quot;feats&quot;  where one could do something other than just X damage would be nice to see, however we have procs which are essentially the same thing however random and crippling they are to rely upon.<br>
<br>
/disc I belive was the VI attempt to add depth to melee combat beond attack on and pushing ( flying )kick/backstab every 6 seconds and we all know how well thought out those were <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Really if you think about it VI fluxed up melee combat from the start and there isn't a damned thing they can do about it now without scrapping it and starting over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kess0n>Kess0n</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/9/02 2:57:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2450.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://link.freepichosting.com/image.cgi/10723/0.jpg?x=60&y=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I want your opionion</span><hr size=1> Solution 1 is better and will probably be easier to implement anyway than a line of stamina using spells. I want to tank. I'm pretty sure 100% of the warriors out there want to tank as well. I don't want to slow, I don't want to snare, I don't want to debuff or anything. I just want to tank and be the best at it. <br>
<br>
Increased skills, improved HP boosts throughout 60-65, an AA that increases taunt abiltity maybe? Or an AA that increases the effect of STA or STR? A CS/CA warrior only AA? I'm surprised that the tanking AAs are given to just about everyone.<br>
<br>
There are enough concepts and various abilities out there. If I wanted them, I would start the class that has them. I wanted taunt, I wanted AC, I wanted HP, I wanted damage mitigation and I wanted weapons and armor so I started a warrior. Increasing those abilities is the right way to go.<br>
<br>
Adding gimmicks while leaving the lacking abilities we already have to rot is the temporary solultion and will make warriors what they are not. <br>
<br>
Plus it's highly unrealistic. I doubt you will log in one day and find out you have a spell bar. Increased skill caps and new AAs are possible and have happened before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=farlanderb>FarlanderB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/9/02 10:32:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2450.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I want your opionion</span><hr size=1> Warriors do not need to be fixed with AA skills.<br>

I certainly got well thought comments here. Im well aware that the second choice i offered would NEVER happen in the present system. It was an extreme solution. Some random wacky idea that i thought up at the height of a fever perhaps. <br>
<br>
Anyways thanks again to everyone who posted and gave me feedback i really appreciate what you wrote....no if only Verant would do the same.<br>
<br>
Edit: oh by the way when i think of changes im not just thinking about the post 50 crowd as i get the impression that many people talk about, i mean every warrior at every level. I mean really my job from day 1 was to tank and take a beating. Gaining agro and keeping it was a living nightmare and required that all the other classes hold back from what they could do so i could feel helpful. At least thats how it feels sometimes. well nevermind its late and im rambling on.  <p>~Gatsu Bloodbourne, Champion of Clan Twisted.<br>
