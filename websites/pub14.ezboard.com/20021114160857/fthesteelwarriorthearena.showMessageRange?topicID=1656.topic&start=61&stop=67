<br>
Soloing through my levels as a monk (just got 150 days played) I found that I could determine what level most of the mob's I soloed were by how hard they  hit.  The formula for most lower level mobs is<br>
<br>
(Max damage - DB)/2 = level<br>
<br>
Almost all mobs below 40 have a DB of 2.  Several old world mob's that are 40 to 47 have a DB of 27 (giant critters in Perma, Stone spider and Nox in Sol b, and Shady Swashbuckler in EC *117 max hit level 45*)<br>
<br>
Untill I read this topic I never had cause to look at minimum damage of these mobs or to figure out a DI.  I will start looking at this to determine if I can come up with anything interesting to add to the conversation as it pertains to lower level mobs.<br>
<br>
There may be a way to determine the DI of certain types of spawns according to level and type.  Like if a drake in ToV is X level it will have this DI and this Max hit.  And Veterans in Kael will do such and such... <p>Serack Doushi<BR>

<br>
I'd like to point out that an NPC's &quot;misses&quot; are actually hits for zero (or less), which actually reinforces the modal damage- and DI arguments.<br>
<br>
The executable probably checks to see if a hit was &lt;=0 first, then if &gt;=0  assigns a min, med, or max hit per the mob's DI value (more likely than use of any lookup-table for various reasons), relative to players' AC values.<br>
<br>
Stuff that influences, or &quot;moves the scale&quot; of, hit&lt;=zero? Our damage avoidance skills.<br>

Nice to see that the thread was not lost but there are some items I feel needs adressing.<br>
<br>
From the first post in this thread:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Mitigation AC should just determine the distribution of hits over the twenty different X values. The distribution would just be a probability for each X value, based on mitigation AC and the mob's attack rating in some way.<br>
<br>
For a tank with high mitigation AC, the probabilities would be skewed such that, generally, there is a higher probability of being hit for a lower X value than a higher X value.<br>
<br>
And it should also be noted that it is possible to mitigate hits into misses. Go tank a decaying skeleton and you'll see that this is true (you have high mitigation AC, it has a low attack rating).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I want to address the last paragraph. I have still not seen any concrete data that consistently shows that a HIT is being mitigated down to 0 damage and therefore a MISS. The example that is used with the Decaying Skeleton could just as simply be that the Avoidance AC of the Player is so much higher than the Skellie that actual misses occur. While the hypothesis that HITs can be mitigated to MISSes is a possible one no proof has been presented nor I believe is it possible to be presented from our view of the game engine.<br>
<br>
IMO it is not likely that this hypothesis is the case. We know that damage = DB + [DI *x] (where x is an integer from 1 to 20). Which gives a MIN of DB + DI and a MAX of DB + 20DI. For the damage then to be mitigated down to 0 would mean that the formula DB + [DI *x] is at some point totally disregarded, I could suppose that this might be coded to be the case if x is &lt; -100 or some other low cutoff figure but it seems strange from a coding point of view to do this. Still, not impossible but to my reasoning unlikely.<br>
<br>
I think the idea of HITs being mitigated to MISSes was a hypothesis created at some point to describe a certain set of data values and it was embraced by a few who thought it sounds interesting. As of yet I have not seen any real proof for it although as always I am open to to it.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
The excerpt by Thresher in the first post I almost totally agree with.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
The first post presented by Gjin LoL (wthin the condensation by Tugurok if I recall correctly, was not embraced by too many others in that thread. Hard to recall as it was a long time ago, but I do remember it from back then and I also remember opposing it personally.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lets assume that Z = (1 - AC/Atk).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Again this was a possible explanation but never demonstrated to fit any relevant sample data. I also remeber presenting the idea that instead of AC being related to ATK as a function of divsion it might be closer to a function of subtraction. No progress was made towards finding a suitable formula IIRC. The most useful part of that post was simply that the distributive values for the variable x are likely to be a function of AC, ATK and possibly the levels of the two parties.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
In the second post where Gjin LoL presnts his proof he assumes that Cazic Thule has a ATK value of 2000. He then uses his own hypothesis to prove that to jump from a modal to the next modal that it requires an extra 100 AC each time. I am not sure if he really understood that using the numbers he orignally assumed all that he proved was that 2000 / 20 = 100. I will elaborate:<br>
<br>
He started with<br>
(1 - AC/2000)*20 = x<br>
<br>
which can be shown also as<br>
20 - AC/100 = x<br>
<br>
or<br>
20 - x = AC/100<br>
2000 - 100x = AC<br>
<br>
Now, since x is a integer value from 1 to 20<br>
MIN DMG: 2000 - 100 = AC<br>
MIN DMG: AC = 1900<br>
<br>
MAX DMG: 2000 - 2000 = AC<br>
MAX DMG: AC = 0<br>
<br>
And every step between the min and max damage modal is in increments of 100 AC. If a different number than 2000 ATK had been assumed then his conclusion of 100 AC increments would not have eventuated. Lucky guess on the numbers I guess but all he proves is 2000 / 20 = 100.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Kryai's post is quite a accurate and concise explanation of some details that we know so far except for what I point out in my next paragraph. Only problem was he listed the DB of Emperor Ssraeshza as 250.3. Asky did correct him 3 posts later though but without referring directly to his error.<br>
<br>
Kyrai made a slight error here:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> #3 PC and NPC damage is calculated differently. I should NEVER hit for 1 damage if using this formula. I've never seen Emperor hit anyone for 1 damage. PC damage then has to take a further thing into consideration (MOB AC perhaps)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->When you are hitting with your main hand hand you never hit for 1 if you are a level 60. You hit for a minimum of 11 + (Damage_rating / 10). For Reference the acronym DB comes from Damage Bonus, the DB for any PC weapon is the listed Damage bonus if in main hand and is 0 if in offhand. Also DI for a PC weapon is the damage rating listed on a weapon divided by 10.<br>
<br>
Zebedi points this out in a later post:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I did some testing, and you actually will never hit for less than 12 damage with your main hand.<br>
<br>
It's off hand hits that can be 1.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Tugurok later responds to Zebedi with:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Zebedi, as far as I know that is not news because 60 warriors have a level damage bonus of 11.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Hopefully now Tugurok sees why Zebedi was making that statement, he was correcting Kryai. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
secondly, anyone found if debuffing a mob's attack affects its DI? this might be the x factor that affects the DI skew.<br>
<br>
if there was a way to skew DI downwards this would increase the effectiveness of evasive... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I don't think that a mob's ATK would be linked to its DI, when a mob is debuffed its DI does not decrease although its ATK is affected (assuming mobs have an ATK rating like us).<br>
<br>
What you might be trying to say though is: Is there a correlation between a mob's ATK and the distribution of x? This is quite likely, ie you may be able to reduce the AVG or modal hit of a mob by reducing its ATK.<br>
<br>
Would reducing the AVG or modal hit of a mob (by reducing its ATK) make evasive more effective? Perhap, but it would have to be a massive debuff to the mobs ATK value to do so. It can be tested but the results will probably not show a large difference except for mobs that are near the borderline anyway.<br>

That would make DB = 200 and DI = 25 which is what others have quoted.<br>

<br>
I haven't enough data to say yes or no to your statement about DI and I was under the impression that final calculated damage values were rounded up rather than being just rounded. Just ran some quick checks on data that was posted in this thread  for Emperor Ssraeshza though and it appears you are correct. Damage is rounded to the nearest integer after being calculated.<br>
<br>
This would mean using a 15 damage weapon gives a better minimum damage hit than a 14 damage weapon. Similarly for a 25 vs 24 damage weapon. I am little behind in this department, can anyone confirm if this is the case or not?<br>

Xaylin states:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> h2h never does less then 2 damage, so this generalization is only partially true <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->As graal points out to you in the post after yours<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Damage is never less than DB + (weapon damage/10)....If you have a 15+ damage weapon in offhand, you will never hit for less than 2 with it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I personally can get a MIN hit with my first of 1 if I have epic equipped.

Stizok wrote:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1) u can avoid hits completely<br>
2) u take max damage more often than all other values (against uber mobs)<br>
now, u assumed there is a formula that calculates a value X from 1 to 20 which will add a damage interval to a defined base damage. X depends on AC of tank, level of tank, class of tank, attack of mob and level of mob. not that i could tell for sure, but i assume verants formula first calculates a value from negative infinity to positive infinity, after that the numbers smaller than 0 become 0 (0 means miss) and all the numbers larger than 20 become 20 (20 means max hit) and all the numbers between 0 and 20 are rounded to the next integer. this would explain why<br>
1) a decaded skeleton misses a high level so often (many negative numbers, thus rounded up to 0) or why<br>
2) uber mobs hit often for max damage (many numbers larger than 20 and thus rounded down to 20).<br>
verants formula will most likely stay a secret forever.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Your first point says that you can avoid hits completely but since this whole thread is about the mitigation side of damage i would assume that you meant to say that HITs can be mitigated into MISSes. I do not acknowledge this still and would appreciate any data, parses or proofs available on the subject.<br>
<br>
The place in your post where you say &quot;numbers smaller than 0 become 0 (0 means miss)&quot;. I would porpose (like others before me in this thread) that numbers smaller than 1 become 1 (1 means a MIN hit). I find no grounds to support the usage of a 0 value for x becoming a MISS, if x could equal x then we would be more likely to see a MIN hit of DB (instead of DB + DI) rather than it being mitigated cmpletely to a MISS.<br>
<br>
The reason a decayed skeleton misses so often is because you have very high avoidance ability in relations to its ability to hit you. IE MISSes are completely natural and computed before any type of damage or x value is considered. If a MISS is registered there is no reason to calculate x.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
NoOneOfNote makes an interesting point. With testing of varying levels of AC against mobs of the same level it could be tracked whether the modal does move after a certain amount of AC. Rather than just tracking total or AVG damage taken, tracking where the modal (or second modal) falls will give a much more detailed way of guaging the real effiency of AC.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Crayno, in your post about the Statue fight I think you forgot to take out any values of a defensive warrior.<br>
<br>
From your data I would have to guess that the real MIN hit for crush was actually 245. This would give the Statue DB = 200 and DI = 45. Making the MAX = 1100 and MIN = 245. Under defensive the MAX = 650 and MIN = 222.<br>
<br>
Note that if you use (from the values I give above) the non-defensive MAX and the Defensive MIN you would get the values that you assumed were a non-defensive MAX and MIN data set.<br>
<br>
Also you wrote: &quot;DB=Min hit+DI =201+47.3=248.3&quot;<br>
<br>
Note that the formula for calculating DB is (MIN - DI) not (MIN + DI). As a general check for you next time, the DB can never be greater than the MIN hit.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Akila, that work has already been done. Look for a post by Jilaman (2 above yours) where he says he has a file from Crayno hosted for download. Then D/L it.<br>
<br>
Also of great use is the post by Rundris eariler in this thread where he quotes a post by Solinar from a different thread. Nice work although I would say inomplete/inconlcusive until more work is done to cofrim that DI/DB = 0.14 is actually the magic number. I would say that it would end up being more along the lines of a different number for each mob. Depending greatly upon the ATK value fo the mob.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
LaotzuQigong, excellent work. By this time in my post I am unfortunately getting too tired to comment fully upon what you ave written but I sincerely hope you continue your line of investigation. Most useful original post that I see here.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Serrack, good work also. I do believe that your values aren't going to be useful for any mobs that are classes as bosses or detailed indivually by Verant staff, but there is a good chance you have come upon the default values used by the EQ generator for low end mobs.<br>

I would be interested if you could re-examine your data with an eye towards what mobs fit that pattern from which expansion. All of the mobs that you named in your post were from the old world,I would be interested to see what happens in Kunark and then Velious and Luclin.<br>

I just need one person to demonstrate or prove this please. Otherwise stop saying that &quot;HITs can be mitigated to MISSes&quot; and say &quot;It is a possible hypothetical that HITs could be mitigated to MISSes&quot;.<br>

I am not saying that this does or does not happen, I am open to it being proven or demonstrated. But people saying that it is the way it works makes me think I missed when VI stated this to us or someone provided a proof. Prove it or let it go guys.<br>

Fendryl, this is the only time someone has stated that mob hits don't completely follow the formula of DB + (x * DI). Serioulsy if this is the case please provide us with us much data as you have, we really need to look at this in depth. CT is a newly revamped zone and it is possible they did something new there that we should be factoring in.<br>
<br>
Please, gather data and post as much of it as you can. Same goes for anyone else reading this, go get data off mobs in CT.<br>
<br>
If it's an error by Fendryl I would rather find out quickly and reinstate the formula as complete. If it's not an error then we have a situation where VI can modify MIN hits only (which is bizarre).<br>

Night all, this has been a hell of a post. Not going to proof read it, you will have to please excuse and spelling errors. <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=157667">Junu Peeth</a></b> on Mithaniel Marr<br>
