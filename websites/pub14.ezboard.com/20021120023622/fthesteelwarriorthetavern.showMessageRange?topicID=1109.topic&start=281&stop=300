giving them extra taunt is either here nor there in many regards.<br>
<br>
SK and Pal want to tank as well as me? They aren't far off already.  They are the clear choice in xp groups and are close to being MT for raids on most big mobs.  Shield buffs will only make them more efficient at tanking - maybe warriors will be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  slightly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ahead still, but we give up taunt to them.  It would most likely be better for the raid to spend a bit more mana healing the Pal/SK and not have other classes worrying about over-agroing - hence killing the mob faster anyway.<br>
<br>
You want to tank as well as me and do as much damage as me? Fine, give us all your spells.<br>
<br>
The only solutions I could see at the moment, is put us on a slightly better defensive table, maybe 5% better. If the shield fix goes live, allow us to block with offhand weapons.  Give us abilities similar in use to monk flying kick etc.  Some that do an extra couple of hundred damage every 10-15 seconds, some that give us  taunt etc.  Have them scale with levels like the monk skills do.<br>
<br>
That would fix warriors at all levels without having us rely on items.<br>

As I understand it, a large gripe here is that warriors have not been &quot;buffed&quot; in the last two expansions, while Knight classes, and Rogues and monks, have been.  So the warrior class has become relatively less preeminent, has recieved, shall we say, an &quot;inactive nerf.&quot;<br>

Your quote, above, indicates that you understand how bad off knights were in the days of Kunark, yet you bemoan the lack of corresponding changes to warriors.  By adding corresponding changes to warriors, you would be maintaining the Knight classes at their relative level of worthlessness.<br>
<br>
Knight classes were not balanced post-Kunark.  Today, they have been tweaked and are in good shape, but to improve warriors again <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> by a corresponding amount</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> would put the Knight classes back where they were via another &quot;inactive nerf.&quot;  This would return knights to the worthless class that they were, whether or not that is what you intend.<br>
<br>
This is the reason why paladins continue to read this thread and respond that Yes, warriors need an upgrade, but that it must be carefully done so as not to put Knights back in the position they were relative to warriors before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udobbanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dobbanz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/26/02 12:53:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=283>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The Age of Despair</span><hr size=1> For the thousandth time, upgrading warriors will not make paladins and sks useless! You WERE worthless for the most part but guess what, you arent anymore! Even if warriors do get the boost they NEED it will take nothing away from the fact that paladins and sks are viable tanks and from now on always will be. The knight classes have been improved to the point where they no longer give up any real tanking ability in the high end game to warriors. Noone wants to nerf you guys, these warriors just want to be where they are supposed to be. Im sorry you feel otherwise but paladins are not supposed to be equal or just barely worse tanks than warriors!<br>
800 hp is NOTHING at a high end raid. Stop pointing to an 800hp difference as if it matters because it doesnt. All it means is that the warrior will survive to be killed by the 4th shot from a mob instead of the third. Paladins and sks were made to be SECONDARY tanks, there to take agro if the warrior falls on a raid but not meant to take the mob for the whole fight. Can you HONESTLY claim that paladins should have the same ac, better hate production, marginal hp difference to a warrior and STILL be considered balanced? Im sure you will just ignore this post for the most part as if it never was written but at least be honest with yourself. There is no way you were meant to be as good as warriors at tanking and have spells.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Actually, we looked at this very carefully. No matter what class or race combination you choose, if you play together at all times, characters will never gain a gap wide enough that they can't gain experience together.

-- Alan <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A maximum of 3 levels difference will exist over 60 levels. That would indicate that no matter what race or class you play there is a maximum of 5% difference in experience over 60 levels between any race or class. Now...if you take into account the racial penalty for large races, and the racial bonus for small races, then that doesn't leave a helluva lot of bonus to experience by being a warrior instead of a hybrid.<br>
<br>
I looked through all the patch messages on that board and couldn't even find the one that changed the damage tables, let alone the one I remember talking about experience bonuses. Unfortunately, the patch message archive only goes back a couple of months, and the developer's corner didn't detail all the patches, but I think this quote puts to rest this malarky about a 10% bonus to warrior's experience. <br>
<br>
It's like class balance or warrior taunt ability...it just doesnt exist.<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The large gripe is that warriors not only lost a considerable edge, or preeminance as you put it, but have been rendered almost completely redundant. We all understand the problems with knights and I don't believe anyone wants to take away their gains. In fact, I personally think the SK's need more work. The changes we want are to pure melee only. The upgrades to knights have been in both melee and in spells/mana. This has overbalanced them and relegated warriors to second class citizens at the one and only thing we do. I WANT knights to be our equals in total damage output, and in fact would like to see them outdamage us in any encounter with the undead in both melee and spells...but I want that damage output to come through a combination of spells and melee, not melee alone with respect to non-undead mobs. What neither I, nor most every other warrior wants is yet another item to be introduced that further errodes the warriors place in a group or raid, which is what these shields will do. What I also don't want is for Any class to be able to take anywhere near the same punishment warriors do. A few hundred hit points, with damage mitigation being equal, just isn't enough. No monk should ever be able to come close to taking the damage I can as a warrior...he should Avoid damage a helluva lot better than me, but he sure as hell shouldn't take it as well. To a lesser extent, this should be true of knights, for 2 principle reasons. Number 1, there has to be some tradeoff for having spells else there is no point to not having them as a warrior, and the class is totally useless. Number 2, you have healing abilities whereas the max healing i can get is 100pts from a bp that is out of reach for small guilds or independents and not even available until lvl 50. You can heal yourself if you have to, even in combat, which negates the need to have as many hit points or as much damage mitigation as we should have. By having much higher hp and/or damage mitigation, it also secures our place as being a necessity for raids and desireable for groups without removing the gains knights have been given over the last 2 years. I don't want knights to be worthless...in fact, as a raid leader, I wouldn't think of going to battle without pallies for their lay hands ability and sk's for their ability to quickly get agro on adds and then tank them for enough time for an enchanter to get in a mez, a shaman to get in a slow, or an st to take over.<br>
<br>
I don't even really have a problem with the shields...shields have needed an upgrade since their introduction...they don't function as a shield should. However, in the current incarnation on test, they would give a bonus to classes that don't need  a reduction in damage and increase in agro gaining ability, and further reduce the dps of a class that's already too low. This will put warriors further behind the 8 ball. <br>
<br>
If shields are to go live in their current form then the warrior deficiencies Must be addressed at the same time or we might as well all reroll. The only way we could maintain even a modicum of parity is if our offhand, if it's holding a weapon, were given the same type of agro generating ability, block ability and ac bonus, retroactively as the shields will get. <br>
<br>
This won't fix what's already broken with the warrior class, but at the least it will not introduce an item for which we are not trained to use, will get proficient with at a very slow rate (because we will never use a shield unless we are MT), that must be procured, reduces our dps significantly and removes most of the utility of our class in terms of scalability in raids and desirability in xp groups.<br>

<br>
WE (warriors) have been crusading for our cause for over two months. Paladins and Shadowknights have been a major part of that crusade - to help OUR cause - &quot;Our,&quot; meaning Plate Tank classes. QUIT your bickering. It is totally counterproductive to the points that are trying to be made in regards to plate classes/damage mitigation, etc...<br>
<br>
Now, there is a patch tomorrow night that should address some of our concerns. Let us WAIT and see what happens.<br>
<br>
If it is not satisfactory, I promise you, we will continue the crusade to be made scalar. <br>
<br>
It's as simple as that... This thread should just be straight up LOCKED. As should the &quot;State of Warriors&quot; thread. They have served their purpose and have now degenerated into a class battle between BROTHERS. How utterly inane is that? Just stop it... <br>

This is something that tees me off sometimes. How many items do clerics/paladins get with unlimited charges of right click invis?

<br>
I have a couple of problems with that. First, do you really think there would be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  any</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> role left for the knights in an xp group if warriors tanked 50% better than they did? Honestly? Secondly, you tell the knights to go mind their own business and stay off your board when you are discussing changes that, if implemented, would have a very large impact on them. That's not very realistic.<br>
<br>
....<br>
<br>
Yes, warriors should tank better than knights do. They already DO tank better than knights do. Warriors have about 15-20% more hp and have higher dodge/parry/riposte caps. The hp difference doesn't mean much in xp groups that don't use CH for healing. It does make a difference when CH is the primary heal. The D/P/R differences always make a difference.<br>
<br>
A knight should be about 90% as effective at tanking as a comparably equipped warrior and do about 75-80% as much damage. When you are looking at big raid mobs, knights are less than 70-80% as effective in tanking due to the part that total hp plays in CH chains and due to the difference in D/P/R caps. That seems fine to me. <br>
<br>
I don't know how damage output plays out at the very high end, but knights should not be doing the same damage as warriors. Personally, I probably do about 60-70% of a similarly equipped warrior, which I think may be a touch low, but I don't have any problems with that. <br>
<br>
My personal opinion is that knights should tank at about 90% effectiveness compared to a warrior for xp stuff, and about 70% as well for CH chain type things. Knight's should do about 75-80% of a warrior's damage output.<br>
<br>
PS, the only time I ever use a shield is when I'm trying to tank nasty as hell stuff.<br>
<br>
EDIT: wanted to add that like Furor, I think that the problem lies not in any disparity between the tanks, but in the growing DPS gap between tanks and damage dealers and the lack of benefit to adding mitigation AC.<br>
<br>
It is the insane damage output of rogues, monks, and to a lesser extent, rangers that is the root of the problem. How many groups want 2 tanks when they could have 1 tank and an extra damage dealer? When the DPS difference between the tanks and damage dealers is so large that choosing between a second tank and a second damage dealing melee is a complete no brainer there is a problem. When you compound that problem by closing the gap in tanking ability between the tanks and the damage dealing melee, you end up with the mess we have now. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

<br>
Verant will improve us in the ammount they see its fair and balanced. <br>
<br>
I dont post in the Paladin boards against the requests you(referring to paladins in general) make to improve your class even further than it already has/and will be, because of me thinking it will &quot;indirectly nerf warriors&quot; even further.<br>
<br>
I am sure you are aware of those request: <br>
1) paladins ask to do more damage than they do already(want better 1hs than they already have and ignore that they have knight only ratios to compensate the difference in skill caps/dualwield with warriors and that they are supposed to do 80% of warrior melee),<br>
2) to tank better than they already do(they want to tank better than monks). <br>
3)to heal better than they already do(because druids/shammans getting heal upgrade. I am sure you can confirm paladins are discussing of obtaining your own toned down version of Complete Heal).<br>
<br>
Why would I bother posting in their threads against it? I find it absurd that Paladins want to be equal to warrior melee/tanking and equal or better than druids in healing. <br>
<br>
Paladin requests will be met to an extent for next expansion, but not in the absurd way some request.<br>
<br>
1)We all know that every expansion brings new weapons with better ratios/stats. <br>
2)We know this shield will benefit the knight class in a greater extent that it will benefit a warrior. Your class is shield based and have 1hs with ratios for shields in mind. You always had shields and always used spells to get aggro. This is an upgrade. You will benefit of the Bash aggro and wont have to use spells as much to get aggro <br>
3)We all know new expansion bring new spells that are improvements to previous ones.<br>
<br>
<br>
As it stands now, this is what warriors MIGHT have incoming for next expansion. <br>
<br>
1) Improved damage - Every expansion brings better weapons. Every melee class will get improvement here.<br>
<br>
2) Improved tanking- Shields will be war usable. BUT warriors are not a shield based class. We are a dual wielding class. We rely on dualwielding and procing weapons to get aggro. We dont have 1hs for shields taken in mind. When this goes live we wont have a 1hs desgined for a shield AND a shield we can take from our bags/bank. Our Damage output and aggro generation(which lacks already) will be hurt considerably because we are a dualwielding class. THIS would be a nerf for US. This will be an improvement for knights and any other shield based class. REMEMBER, we dont have a shield in the bank/bag nor a 1hs with a ratio designed for it like YOU ALWAYS have. Your damage output nor aggro will be crippled in any manner because you ALWAYS had a shield and 1hs to go with it.<br>
<br>
3)Fix our unreliable taunt- Improvement to enchanter spells, SK targetable aggro spells(which could be used on monks for tanking too :P) and aggro generation from shield bash that every other shield based class will get (see #2 above). Again warriors innate abilities untouched. <br>
<br>
4)AC/HP improvements- Every expansion brings new gear and new high hp items. But if the Luclin trend continues it will be ALL/ALL. Benefiting other classes the most and closing the hp gap even further. More AC will mean squat if the AC softcap is not lifted.<br>
<br>
<br>
If that is what is coming for PoP, warriors will be nerfed directly while other classes are improved(add &quot;indirect nerf&quot; as you put it). <br>
<br>
<br>
If you cant see it, its because you dont want to.<br>
<br>
<br>
If this shield aggro implementation is done to the point a warrior can hold aggro with a non-EB weapon (Lamentation, Venomous Axe, Frostbringer ) and no spell buff(from SK, enchanter) against a rogue, monk, ranger with epics (you would think Verant is aware how easy/early is for these classes to get epics) ... then the nerf in DPS we would be getting from it wont be such a bad trade. While MTing a big badass this could mean less ripostes to worry about. <br>
<br>
Its retarded to think all warriors have EB weapons at their disposal. Still negative points remain...DPS will be lowered big time. Warriors have to hunt down for some good shields and a 1hs to go with it. While other classes will just use what they ALWAYs had in the bank/bag and will recieve the same aggro boost(thus knights using their aggro spells less. Another &quot;indirect nerf&quot; for warriors?). And until warriors got a 1hs designed for a shield in mind, the knight classes would do more damage than us with a shield equiped.(Remember the supposed melee balance of Knights doing 80% of warrior melee?)<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm done with repeating what has been said over and over. <br>

Graal, most of what you are talking about here are convenience items.  Yes, its convenient to have clicky shrink, its convenient to have clicky invis.  Its really not something that makes a huge difference in the day to day function of the game.  So rather than having the cobalt bracer passed around among the Warriors and clicking all the large races small for a raid, you make the shamen group them all.  It would just be more annoying and time consuming.<br>
<br>
Unlimited clicky invis?  How many of those are there actually? How many Warriors have them?  I know I don't, and I suspect the majority of Warriors don't.<br>
<br>
And Knights have clicky items too.  DW bracer is kind of nice for manaless stuns.  And DW helm for manaless heals.  But I think you would agree that normally they aren't much of an impact on the day to day functions of a Paladin either.<br>
<br>

I know for a fact that everyone desires brells, I ask for it myself.  And I have been kept alive in more than one battle solely by a Paladin with group heals, when not MTing.  A Paladin is usually right near the MT against many boss mobs, waiting to pop LoH if needed.  And if push comes to shove, a Paladin can battle rezz if it all goes into the crapper and the clerics die, yet we manage to win anyway.  It may not happen often, but it does happen.<br>
<br>
Now the Shadow Knights, I admit finding their raid niche is a little bit more problematic.  They do respectable damage though, if you combine their melee and their spell damage.  And an SK tends to be fairly self substaining on a raid, with minimal need for heals.<br>
<br>
If a Warrior isn't MTing though, all he does is mediocre damage.  And he is dependent as hell on healers.<br>

I was on my druid at the time and died from trying to keep ANY tank alive. It was a near complete wipe. All that remained was a single monk that feigned, a paladin, and a ranger. The paladin had managed to keep the ranger alive JUST long enough to kill off the last mob that had wiped out a 40 man raid. Now THATS freaking impressive. If it had been a warrior instead of a paladin then all that would have been left would be that monk to drag all the corpses to the dn zoneline.

<br>
No, if you had taken the time to read you would have seen I was talking about a paladin using a aggro spell (hint:stun) which would get the mobs attention far quicker than some warrior in defensive trying to get aggro. I mentioned your heals in a reponse to YOUR comments in a different area entirely (hint: uses of Paladins on raids). of course this is all theory however, and its impossible to say for sure as there are so many different variables on different raids. My scenario is far more viable in my opinion.<br>
<br>
&quot;And no, your avg paladin doesn't do even 90% of a warriors dps, its about 75%.&quot;<br>
<br>
Umm, refer to above about reading. This time though read and understand your own comments. You were talking about tanking (95%) to which I replied 90%.  Where the hell does DPS come in there? Again DPS was mentioned in another area.<br>
<br>
&quot; I would not take a paladin over even the 9th or 10th warrior most likely in a raid. Paladins are low DPS output class with poor healing and no disciplines.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ever been to a raid with AEing mobs? If you had the choice to pick whatever you wanted for a raid why have 10 more warriors when all they bring is damage? Just bring rogues, monks or the real damaging class. Paladins do a @#%$ load more on raids than just DPS. And because of that versatility there is more room for paladins to be useful IMO.<br>
<br>
edit:- for example<br>
<br>
Patch healing MT, healing the fallen up after rezzed, backup rezzers if raid whipes and they manage to camp, secondary tank if things go bad and quick aggro is needed (a paladin can heal himself three times over while holding an add (4 times with LOH, better than defensive on an add IMO)), LOH order on Mt or someone important about to die, AE buffs only they get, ae healing group after damage ae's taking effect, helping with dispells. added DPS to mob and general healing after fight. <br>
<br>
But of course you already knew this, afterall you are the Paladin.<br>
<br>
end edit.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't say but yeah our top paladin does higher dps than our 3rrd best warrior in the guild and say that changes things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Our top Paladin does more damage than our top Warrior. Not because of skills mind you, but because Paladin weapons with better ratios are so much easier to come by. So of equivalent gear and level, yes Our Paladin does his fair share damage wise and is up there with the warriors.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The only sad things is I think SK's have it worse than the paladins.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sk's are another class entirely. I agree they could use some upgrades as far as raids are concerned. But No chance you are going to convince me Paladins have it bad. Don't need a post to tell me that (which it didn't, lots seemed to agree with me), I have seen it with my own eyes.<br>
<br>
All this is raid talk mind you, not even exp situations. Its funny that people are telling us we are only supposed to excel for raid situations, then complain that we are better there(which I find mostly baseless).<br>
<br>
Anyways not in the mood to fill this board with semantics and repetition. If you want to discuss it further email is johnjohn352@hotmail.com<br>
