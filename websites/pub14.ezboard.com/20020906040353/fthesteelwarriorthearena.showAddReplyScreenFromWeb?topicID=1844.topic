question and uber pets</span><hr size=1> For the critical hit archetype skill, the first level says you get an additional 2 percent chance to crit, the 2nd four percent, and the 3rd your total is brought to a +7 percent chance.  My question is, does anyone know how this is figured?  I remember when it came out that Verant claimed when another class gets all THREE levels of it, they would have a chance to crit about equal to what warriors start with.  If the 3rd level for other classes means a 7 percent chance to crit, then that's BS.  I logged my damage for... let's see... 6814 hits (slashes and kicks).  I got all of 135 crits.  That's 1.98 percent.  now my dex is nowhere near maxed and most of the time during this logging I did not have Boon or a shaman dex buff.  I just had my usual gear.  When I had the high level shaman buff, it seemed to give a slight increase in the percentage of crits, but not a huge amount.  So 2 percent... oh boy.  The average dmg per crit/crip (mostly crits, wasn't low on life much) was well under double the regular hit average damage, so overall effect on my damage output is less than 1 percent.  <br>
<br>
So if someone puts 1 level in the AA skill, do they actually get a 2 percent crit chance?  In other words, roughly equal to the base warrior rate if they are another class and for warriors double their current rate?<br>
<br>
Logging some other interesting stuff too...  mage pets, the epic in particularly, are insanely uber now.  In a grind against toilers, an epic mage pet with my group was averaging 61 points dmg per hit and hitting fast.  We found that the MINIMUM dmg for the pet's offhand attacks was 40 and I think 22 for primary.  /boggle... not sure why that is.  Suffice it to say that combined with a huge DS, huge procs, and the mage's nukes, the one L58 mage could kill his own toilers faster than a L60 epic monk and myself (L60 warrior with fleshgrinder) combined could kill ours and we're not talking one mob that he nuked hard.  We're talking every single time over the course of the grind.  What is verant thinking here?  Recently they actually made pets even MORE powerful.  wtf?  <br>
<br>
Now I realize that I had only my 36 percent item haste because we didn't have a chanter/shaman and the pet had a 75 percent haste buff, but still... and the monk was hasted almost as well as the pet on his own.  As a warrior I basically feel like the lame gimp class of a grind group these days.  My damage is a joke even with a primary hand weapon that outdamages the warrior primary epic blade.  So am I needed just to take dmg?  Not really.  The pet or the monk can tank the usual grind mobs just fine.  Are warriors a raid only class now?  sigh....<br>

<br>
As for crit percentage, I seem to get them in spurts, someone suggested this is how the EQ server for this works, in that certain people or classes or levels or I don't know what get a chance to crit at the same time, so if you crit then someone else in your group does a few hits later, or if you crit twice in a row...this would kinda explain that. <p><hr width="267" align="left"><table  width="*" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><tr><td  align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168211" target="new"><img src="http://www.imahosting.com/sigs/baadansig1a.jpg"></a></td><td  align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=54401" target="new"><img src="http://www.imahosting.com/sigs/azumaansig1.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td  align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112720" target="new">49 Half Elf Warrior</a></td><td  align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=145036" target="new">34 Erudite Necro</a></td></tr><tr><td  align="center"> &lt;Dragon Maw&gt; </td><td  align="center"> &lt;Dragon Maw&gt; </td></tr></table>

<br>
claiming pets are broken means absolutely nothing to me when I'm watching what this pet can do every time we grind.  Typically when we got 2 mobs we'd put the mage pet on 1 and the monk and I on the other one.  EVERY single time, the mage finished his mob first.  This was in a fast grind.  He wasn't nuking heavily.  The grind was too fast for that.  The fact is that a mage in terms of damage is absolutely destroying a 60 epic monk and a 60 warrior  with dmg dealing on par with his epic combined.  Before I got there when it was just the 60 monk and the mage dealing damage, the mage would kill 2 mobs while the monk was still on his first one, then come help finish up the monk's.  That's the facts.  Broken?  Seriously in need of an upgrade? lol... yeah right.. even the guy playing the character said it was doing crazy damage before the recent patch that made it even better.  The thing max hits like mad. Before the recent upgrade patch we had a grind where he singlehandedly outdamaged myself and a 54 monk with epic.  We didn't try it with the 60 monk pre-patch, just after we see an upgrade so that pets hit more accurately.  Absolutely ridiculous... Welcome to Evercaster. <br>
<br>
I don't believe whines about &quot;pets suck!&quot; when I'm seeing the exact opposite.  Also, I have a necro and didn't find the pet broken at all.  Before this recent patch, I dusted off the necro and solo'ed from 45-51.  It was easy and experience was very fast.  I turned down groups because i just wanted exp and soloing was much faster.  the pet did fine.  I had nothing complain about there.  He wasn't even coming up the max level every time or hitting &quot;more accurately&quot;. He did fine though and kicked out  a lot of damage.  <br>
<br>
Pardon the whines, but I'm very frustrated with seeing warriors crapped on while others get upgrade after upgrade despite Verant's claim something like a year ago that they were almost done balancing classes.  They already gave pets a massive upgrade in terms of effectiveness by making them non aggro and unable to hit mezzed mobs.  That's huge.  Be happy and be done with it.  But no, that's not good enough.  For no apparent reason something that already does a ton of dmg gets to do even more.  The bottom line is that for this and other reasons if you want experience in your high level group, you might as well shelve the warrior and dust him off for the occasional raid.  <br>
<br>
note - my recent experiences have been with a mage epic pet so i can't speak for what the other pets are like at L56+.  That would be an interesting thing to check. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ueldryc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldryc</A> at: 7/31/02 9:20:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ueldryc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 9:23:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1844.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: crit hit percentage question and uber pets</span><hr size=1> oh, quick comment on the crits... the thing is that I logged over 6800 hits and on several different days.

Warriors aren't meant to do damage.  Warriors get high ac, high HP and powerful weapons.  Casters get their spells and their pets and cloth armor.  Casters SHOULD be able to kill a mob faster<br>

<br>
They kill whatever they are fighting as fast as possible without getting agro.  They have ONE escape method other than running, which is gate (no snare, evac, fd, mez, charm, da, or anything else).  A mage without a pet is like a level 20 warrior fighting Gorenaire (all hits are usually for max damage).  The class has one thing going for it, damage and lots of it.  It's their job to do this damage.  Epic pet is the hardest epic to obtain in EQ and most mages do not have the epic, it better be something substantial.<br>
<br>
Warriors are not damage dealers, they are tanks.  Warriors are supposed to keep the MOB on them and keep the rest of the group/raid alive by taking insane amount of damage.  A warrior can tank MOBs that most classes don't even last a single round.<br>
<br>
There is no need to have class envy, threads like this do nothing but start arguements and are pointless.  Learn your class and don't complain about what someone else can do.  If it bothers you so much, go start that class.  <br>
<br>
Warriors should be proud of their incredible ability to absorb damage.<br>

btw ask a caster on a pvp server if warriors can deal damage...at level 60 by far the toughest class to kill.<br>
<br>
and to answer the crit % question last i knew combat fury was bugged for warriors...it does grant 2 4 and 7% crit rate but neglects to add warriors innate crit % in.  This may not be the case with cf 3 but i know 1 and 2 were bugged.  i have cf 2 atm and i seem to be critting a hell of a lot mroe than with cf 1 so maybe they fixed 2 but dunno.<br>

They can do damage.  And if you noticed, he was saying monk AND warrior.  Monks are meant as a damage dealing class.  Mages own warriors hardcore xp grinding and according to this person the pet was owning the war and monk combined, mages especially duo'd with a shaman for torpor/mod rods/chain summon pet with reclaim mana 3 can easily outdamage.  But thats a different story.  He wanted to know about crits =). <br>
<br>
Also:<br>
<br>
(no snare, evac, fd, mez, charm, da, or anything else). <br>
<br>
Mages can buy snare glands and recharge at merchant, and or crystalline items from CCaverns.  Can use gate, just as good as evac (faster casting time, just can't bring group) .  They also get right click root items in cazic thule.  But I don't think mages are broken, maybe a little over powered since mr2, but they are fine now.  Especially since it summons the highest pet from spells now.  Instead of random.  <br>
<br>
Mages are essential to raids now for almost any high end encounter with mass rods + super 70dps (on rogue par) damage.  Thats probably not counting pet (or is) which is another 20dps (about same as warrior, if not higher on higher ac mitigation mobs).  Oh and debuffs.  <br>
<br>
Imo mages are fine, though could use tweeks, but so could every other class.  I'd be more worried about the Necro (necro pet REALLY sucks) or druid class needing upgrades.<br>
<br>
But your right about tanks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     They are meant to take damage, not ness give.  Though paladins with 2handers do better damage by far than wars now. (high end game only, least in my guild, paladin with 120dps on some mobs).  But to be quite honest, wars are quite gimp now except for defensive.  Which can't even be used in Xp groups.  Better off with a Paladin  or SK for taunt and taking damage.  Gear is what makes a warrior, not stats or natural things.  Thats why warriors NEED to get the best gear over a casting class.  Its not fair, but you wont do well otherwise.  Mage pets do not make mages.  (especially when they can do 50 to 70 dps, debuff, modrod 2 the WHOLE guild) <br>
<br>
&quot;They kill whatever they are fighting as fast as possible without getting agro. &quot;<br>

hardly, but mainly the wizard/rog's job I imagine =P<br>

Then don't come to a warrior board.  I don't have envy of magicians though I think I know well enough that mages are not made from there pets.  Sorry.  The only thing that makes a warrior is super taunt-holycrap weapons + defensive and &quot;maybe&quot; 800 hp more than a paladin/sk.  Maybe.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying wars need tweeks either.  Just pointing out the obvious flaws in the reply you made to a fellow war =P.  I'm perfectly happy with my class minus the boredom of waiting for &quot;my turn&quot; to MA.  Which is almost never now with a MA of 7400-7600 hp .  Unless verant add's HT again =o.<br>
<br>
&quot;Warriors get high ac, high HP and powerful weapons. &quot;<br>
No.  Warriors get high AC/HP/powerful weapons through claims/mooching off of raids.  Then people call them loot whores, but in truth, they have to be.  Thats ALL they have. It's a common stereo type like saying half-lings are worse tanks than ogres.  Its the gear.  Defensive only helps 3 mins every 10 mins, and cuts dmg (thats already low) in half.<br>
<br>
To answer the original topic question:<br>
<br>
&quot;Are warriors a raid only class now? sigh....&quot;<br>
Yes.  Unless its really heavy dmg zone (CT probably only one that comes to mind) or deep chardok for regular xp groups.  Most people dont' do research on how warriors are different than Paladin/SKs so they just assume a warrior is better.  When in truth u'd have ot look at the gear of the warrior as opposed to the pally/sk.  <br>
 <br>
&quot;Warriors get &quot;<br>
&quot;Think big picture instead of your own little world. &quot;<br>
<br>
Please take head out of ass.  He asked about regular group xp, NOT raids.  Warriors do not &quot;get&quot; gear, they earn it.  So do magicians, and every other class with mana /hp gear.  I don't think you read his thread all the way.  <br>
<br>
As for the AA question.  I believe people have run tests, but no specific long ones to be of any proof.  It has been shown however that warriors do not do more crits than other classes (unlike what the aa actually reads...that they do)  and they don't seemingly get 7% crits.  If anything, they get less for some odd reason than the 2%.  Least people think so from looking at crits non recording.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I wasted to much time trying to explain things in any event simply because I know the response will be &quot;but but&quot; or some flamitory line since the replys to this thread have all been &quot;oh shut up&quot; in a sense.<br>
<br>
Another:<br>
<br>
&quot;Warriors should be proud of their incredible ability to absorb damage.&quot;<br>
<br>
Play a warrior to 60 before you make that assumption.  Then compare yourself to a 60 paladin/sk, or hey, even a magician pet.  This thread went way off topic =P.  Furor himself has already made plenty of rants about this type of stuff (not ness pets) on FoH guildsite.<br>
<br>
Person who just posted before though I agree with everything cept one thing :<br>
<br>
&quot;thats why their weapon skills are greater than sks or pallys&quot;<br>
<br>
Paladins can use hategiver, SoD etc and hold aggro over a warrior so well its a joke (sk taunt, paladin chain stun aggro).  Just guilds don't give them it because thats not there &quot;role&quot; =).<br>

I have many classes over 50...  I try to understand their advantages and disadvantages.  I don't like seeing class envy, it doesn't solve anything.  Often class envy is based on a small subset of abilities, like clerics get a bigger nuke than mages (not accounting for mana efficiency and recycle time).  This is just such a case.<br>
As an example consider a monk and warrior for damage output, sure the monk will outdamage a warrior if both had average gear, but can the monk out tank a warrior, not likely.  The epic does huge damage but does not have the damage mitigation of a warrior.<br>
Class envy threads rarely ammount to much useful info.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Furor himself has already made plenty of rants about this type of stuff&quot;<br>
In my opinion Furor speaks for the 0.001% (yes I made this small # up) of the warriors, he is so far and above any warrior as far as gear/skill is concerned his opinion is not as applicable to lesser geared warriors.  He brings up many valid points but so many will not encounter many of the problems.  Aftathott wrote a lot of rants about bards too, not many mage guild leaders out there to write rants <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
I do log analysis often on raids and epic pet is usually well below most melee (especially monks and rogues).  I have yet to find an epiced monk that doesn't outdamage the epic solo.  So that comparisson holds no water.<br>
<br>
Did you guys have haste?  What weapons was monk using?  Did the monk have epic?<br>
<br>
As a point of reference the epic pet with muzzle of mardu and burnout 4 (maxed haste) does damage roughly equal to a 60 epic warrior with 30% haste.  Epiced warrior with 75% haste easily outdamages the pet.  Not even mentioning some high end weapons that are better than epics.  And as we all know there are way better weapons and better haste items.<br>
<br>
Epic pet DPS against soul binder is around 36DPS with muzzle and burnout 4, only counting melee.  Against akheva zonein trash and shrooms the DPS is around 70 with melee/procs/ds.<br>

<br>
I'm aware that the warriors main purpose is not to deal damage.  As someone pointed out to you later, what I'm talking about is a 58 epic mage consistently outdamaging a similarly equipped L60 warrior and monk COMBINED.  As a warrior I do less dmg then that monk with me and that's fine.  I have no complaints there.  I do less dmg than the mage.  That's fine too.  But come on, he's outpacing both of us combined even in a fast grind where nuking like crazy wouldn't be an option?  That's absurd.  Can I tank? yes. But in these exp grinds the mage pet tanks great too.  he's now taking out blue mobs in ME with a cleric contributing heals and only having to heal the pet once with cel elixir per battle.  That's it.  That's way, way less damage per fight than I would take trying to drop those mobs.  And believe me, ping ponging is not an issue so don't come back with &quot;you've got taunt&quot;.  When that pet's tanking a mob, that mob stays on the pet unless someone walks up and stands next to it.  The power of a mage in a high level exp group is unbelievable now.  Pets needed upgrades? lol... i still have to laugh at that.  When you've been in a grind group many times with a high level mage and seen what they can do, you realize just how powerful they are.  We have an interesting log showing the pet's high melee dmg (average hit of 61 with max 79) and then procs and DS together adding an amount of additional dmg nearly as high as it's melee dmg.  <br>
<br>
Before the recent patch (havent played him after yet), my L51 necro's L49 pet could tank low blue mobs while I dotted them.  Fear often wasn't necessary at all on low blues unless I just felt like it.  He did not fair well against higher blue mobs and fear became necessary (or if i was playing a mage I'd need to nuke harder to drop the mob faster so the pet would survive).  That's as it should be.  I had no complaints about the power of my necro's pet and soloing was easy.  I can't believe people did have complaints and more, that Verant actually listened to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ueldryc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 5:38:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1844.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: crit hit percentage question and uber pets</span><hr size=1> read that again, glasya.  The monk was using epic and SoS.  I'd have to ask him what haste item he had besides that.  I'm thinking RBG...  I have a fleshgrinder in primary (which outdamages the epic - 12/19 160dd proc vs 14/24 100dd, or is it 120 on epic?) and a somewhat inferior to epic dmg frostbringer in the offhand (12/22 60dd proc vs. 14/24).  It's going to add up to roughly epic level dmg.  My haste was a CoF, so yes, we lacked a chanter/shaman to provide additional haste.  that was stated also.  This was definitely not a case of inferior equipment though.  We're talking epic level dmg for all characters involved.  With chanter haste, yeah, the 2 of us together could beat the mage though not by an enormous amount.  Not sure if said before, but before I got there the mage and monk were killing stuff with the cleric healing and the mage would kill 2 mobs as fast or faster than the monk got thru 1.<br>
<br>
Also, as I stated before, it's not just melee damage.  The mage would throw what nukes he could in a fast grind.  that's part of his overall dmg capability.  Also, take the pet's melee dmg and add about 95 percent to it.  That's what his procs and DS added up to.  I had a smaller DS as unlike the pet I don't come equpped with a 50 pointer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It procs a 143 cold based DD and 80 point magic based stun. The damage shield is LVL+2 (which is 51 points on a level 49 pet).<br>
<br>
In Akheva I get about 70-80 DPS with epic pet with muzzle and burnout 4, I can add 20dps chain casting velk boots or use the mana nuke for 1015-1200 damage.  Which puts DPS for mana free at around 100 and mana based to around 120-140 (depends on delay waiting for pet to retaunt, if pet loses are the mage is in a bit of trouble).<br>
<br>
I can see how the pet may have been so overwhelming, mages are meant to be damage machines...<br>
<br>
Now consider a typical raid, I am OOM, clicking my 20 dps boots, petless (if fighting anything with AOE), summoning mod rods to feed the clerics so they can keep warriors alive in CH rotation.  Raid mage does 2 things: COH and Mod Rods...  So it is a tradeoff, melee classes get to do the damage and fight MOBs, I sit behind a wall somewhere in a pile of mod rods talking to myself... but seriously the pets needed an upgrade.  On major encounters the pet barely hits anything, fighting high AC luclin MOBs the pet barely breaks 10dps which melee (with necro or SK in group) can break 50 dps easy.  It just happens that the MOBs you were fighting are suseptible to melee, cold and magic.<br>
<br>
When fighting things that are high MR/CR then spell effects are resisted and epic pet DPS drops to before paladins (yes that is embarassing I know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
My suggestion is to run a log while fighting a boss level MOB and see how people perform, you will be surprised at the outcome.<br>
<br>
BTW our MT warrior usually does 50% more damage than the epic on longer fights like vindi, tunare, etc.  (The rogues usually do double of warriors, monks about 80% more than warriors, rangers about 20% more than warriors, and SK and paladins are around the warriors depending on weapons used, bards usually bring up the bottom end).<br>

I'm not talking about them and I realize the warrior class is pretty solid there.  Let's see... for nukes the mage was using scars of sigil and a more powerful one (925 dmg or so, i forget the name).  Mana based so he may be running around 120 dps.  I'll try to find out next time we group.  <br>
<br>
how much does a 60 epic rogue do?  I've never checked but it seems like we're talking about epic rogue or near epic rogue dps with the ability to tank really well too.  It's absolutely huge on an exp grind.  This post really didn't start as an intentional attack on mages.  It's more like... ya want an inferiority complex as a warrior?  Go exp grind with a mage.  he boosts the exp for everyone in the group.  Just about anything past him and a shaman or cleric as a duo would actually slows him down expwise.  That seems... crazy.  <br>
<br>
The fact is that I don't raid all that much and really prefer 1 group stuff anyway, so that's what I'm concerned with.  The mage happens to be very, very powerful in these situations and the warrior seems to be extremely weak now.  i don't like having what seems more and more like a raid only class, but really really don't feel like trying to level another character to 60.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhaass.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haass</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 320<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 6:25:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1844.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: crit hit percentage question and uber pets</span><hr size=1> So, a warrior with 36% haste, without an epic and a monk with roughly 67% haste should outdamage an EPIC pet, with a 51 point DS and 2 procs, with a max hit of 79?

Dude, seriously, class envy gets you nowhere.  Mages solo.  It's what they do.  In fact, until they get to raiding level, it's ALL they do.  No one wants mage/necros in groups, so they solo.  They have pets to do damage for them.  What happens if that mage pulls 2?  He's screwed, quite frankly.  What happens if your warrior/monk duo pulls 2? They're probably okay.<br>
<br>
Nerfs hurt everyone. Like I said, think BIG PICTURE, not just your little box.  Your fleshgrinder and the monk epic is NOWHERE near the effort that mage put in to get that pet.  Respect him for it by shutting up about how unbalanced you think it is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uredinko.showPublicProfile?language=EN>redinko</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 7:02:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1844.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: crit hit percentage question and uber pets</span><hr size=1> I think I see where the original owner is getting at now.

Very frustrated, I returned to the warrior I started long ago (I'm so old school I put starting points in INT :P ) and enjoy every minute of it.  The guild gets some return on its investment of the mage, as I am able to 2box - pooping out rods and sicing a pet multitask well with a warrior.<br>
<br>
So here's my point - I've seen both sides of this fence and you know what?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HOORAY for #$% MAGES</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Its about damn time they got thrown a bone or two.  The original poster said he was grouped with the mage, why not be glad of the extra contribution the mage can make from before?  In the end its just more exp for you.<br>
<br>
Also, you've got to compare apples to apples -<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
...I had only my 36 percent item haste because we didn't have a chanter/shaman and the pet had a 75 percent haste buff, but still...<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
If you aren't fighting at the same haste level, that comparison just isn't valid.  Also don't forget the mages epic has a damage shield that is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very situational</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> dps.  The only way that worked was you guys were letting the pet tank a different mob.  If you were fighting only 1 mob, there is basically no way for a PC to let an NPC tank if they are doing mele dmg. <p><center>

<br>
Whoever said the mage epic was the hardest to get is wrong.  Flat out wrong. Most of it is single group stuff.<br>
<br>
Getting the Crown on PoS 7? Bah, it's trivial to get a ride to PoS 7.  Costs less than a rebreather.<br>
<br>
Sk epic looks very hard, warrior epic is very hard. Cleric epic is insane due to bottleneck.  With some ingenuity, mage epic is somewhere between druid and warrior - closer to the druids'.<br>
<br>
We have 2 epic mages in our guild, and no epic warriors.  I can tell you, it's GOOD to group with these mages.  That's my solution to the &quot;Mages are too powerful&quot; argument - Group'em! :-D<br>
<br>
And the mage I play with can solo 2 spiders in Velks at the same time.  He's level 55, untwinked, and not particularly well equipped, btw.  Skillz, baybay.<br>
<br>
With the advent of new super weapons for SKs and Pallys, and these being much more attainable than similar weapons for warriors, coupled with a closing of the &quot;class damage table&quot; gap, there is a problem with warriors.  All else being equal, I'd group with a SK or Pally before a warrior any day for normal exp.<br>
<br>
And this isn't class envy (which is the king of cheap-shots) this is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> analysis</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>

<br>
again, I'm quite confident that my dmg is on par with the epic, so that's no argument.  Except for the hate proc, the warrior epic is pretty lame for the effort it takes, but that's a different discusssion.  The slower haste was acknowledged from the beginning.  someone mentioned what if the mage pulls 2 mobs.  From what I've seen ME and akheva recently at least, ya know what, it doesn't matter. He obliterates 2 mobs.  There's no concern there.  They die so fast that the epic pet can handle it just fine. <br>
<br>
now last night we had an ideal situation for a mage with a grind on toiler hill in ME.  I've heard people claim that pets dish out a lot of dmg but they take a ton too.  Not true in this case.  The pet had 1-3 mobs at a time on it virtually all the time during the organized chaos of a full group pulling every mob in the area to the top of the hill.  At one point the pet had 3 mobs on it and when i went to attack one, the mage told me no, he had these 3, go help the other warrior. lol... pet had to be healed on that one, but not a huge amount.  Cleric had no concerns about it.  That thing seriously has to be healed less than I do.  We had a chanter but she wasn't mezzing much because it was more efficient to let the adds beat themselves up on the mage pet's DS.  Maybe the stupid AC softcap is SO low on toilers that Kibartik (Lobobkn, Zibarker, whatever) is at the cap too, i don't know.  And yes, we're taking big advantage of the insane dmg output to get experience.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Sure, it's situational.  It's a grind group.  I never said it was anything but that.  In a lot of areas where you exp grind it's easy to pull at least 2 mobs and stick the mage on one.  <br>
<br>
Incidently, everyone &quot;worked hard&quot; for the gear we have, whether it's armor, weapons, epics, etc.  We all spent a lot of time and plat to get what we have and we've (being the people I usually grind with) all been playing about the same amount of time and in the same difficulty zones.  So I don't buy the &quot;so and so worked really hard for what they have so shut up&quot; stuff.  It's a comparison of very similar characters.<br>
And yes, even at somewhat slower haste, one would think a 60 warrior and monk would outdamage 1 freaking pet.<br>
<br>
I'm just saying, damn, this is a wildly powerful class.  Class envy?  Call it that if you want.  I'm trying to take an honest look at the relative power of these classes in a single group situation and wondering why you'd want a warrior around at all.  anyway, enough... take it for what you want.  It looks to me like epic rogue damage with the ability to tank adds and do some other nice things for the group.  So get them in your groups I guess.<br>
