Me (at 52), a 52 cleric and 60 warlord fighting the vamp castle in TM. Warlord brought a named and we got a coterie add. I'm instructed to tank the add...getting hammered. The warlord yells &quot;Go evasive!&quot; I yell back &quot;what? i don't have that yet! should i zone it?&quot; He yells back &quot;type /disc evasive&quot; I do, go evasive, felt really stupid, but we survived )<br>
<br>
Now at 55, we did the Arena in Kael. We had one death so far (Ranger hehe) and we're having fun. Then the pullers go OH OH GET READY....here comes 6 huge gaints (normal ones, a couple cleric dudes, and others i can't remember since i only see their knees and below.) I'm the MT so i start the target messages, chanters mezzing/charming right and left, everyone /assisting and WE DID IT! All the pullers died tho and you should have heard them in guild chat when the giants were all dead. A most fun night and I felt good that I keep calm, called for the assist, didn't die, and also, if felt really good that I didn't really pay attention to my health because I had one of the best clerics in the game who I knew was right there healing me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uygnirthundersson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ygnir Thundersson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/18/02 11:38:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1250.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.oozbv.demon.nl/ygnir.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Fighting the general on this ledge... the first time we attempted it, we poofed when he touched a wall.

We were in the Plain of Air and they had just put in the patch that gave mobs Enrage so nobody really knew about it yet.  Don't remember which Isle we were on but we were doing the first boss that enraged.  I think most of us were in the 47-51 range.<br>
<br>
It's a hard fight and we've lost a few people, casters are mostly OOM, suddenly the mob goes enraged.  Within about 3 seconds while everyone's staring at their screen in disbelief wondering what the hell is going on almost every melee on the raid is dead.  I survive along with maybe a couple of hybrids.  Suddenly everyone is shouting HEAL KHUMAK!  I basically solo'd him the rest of the way after getting about 10 CHs.  That was the first time I felt badass.<br>
<br>
Most common quotes immediately after from the melees were &quot;WTF happened&quot; and from the healers &quot;OMG I've never seen so many people die so fast&quot;.  Trivial now but man was that a rush. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85547>Khumak</a><br>

One of the lastest ones was a couple of weeks back, due to the fact I'm and aussie I have weird playing times anyway it would've been round 12am my time when I get a tell asking me if I wanna head to BW to kill some undead mobs our main cleric had just gotten an unber weapon that procs an undead only dd spell. Anyway we're there me I guess a 47-48 warrior dwing a CoT and a lammy, with the cleric meleeing just to try out his new wep and our shammy. Shammy is 54 and cleric 53 so both way ahead of me in lvls. Anyway while I'm dodging wurms and stuff trying only to pull the monkeys and skelles I find this named undead monkey (he mentioned back in this thread a bit) anyways I ask the cleric and shammy if they want him. Can't remember what he conned to me but with them both being 50+ they thought easy. Well I pull this monkey and I'm hitting it for some real crappy hits damn that CoT. At this time I didn't know that the monkey was almost 100% MR so I'm standing there wondering why no ones nuking the crapper outta it as my hits ain't doing F all to its hp bar. Meanwhile I'm getting the crap kicked outta me (hehe what can I say bad weps bad armour =\ ). Anyway about halfway though the fight the cleric says hes OOM I'm think crap no more CH's I'm gonna die so cleric meds and shammy takes over heals shes chain healing me for all shes worth only just keeping up with the hits every now and then the cleric would say CH rdy the procedd to CH me.The monkey only had about 15% hp left when both the cleric and shammy sya OOM your on your own. I'm like crapp!!! I've got full hp thanks to the last CH. So I'm rdy to greet death again so I just let loose (I've got so many hotkeys that have %T your going down yadda yadda yadda) Hotkeys flying eveywhere.The rush I'm getting from this fight is just kewl I'm soloing a 100%MR mob thats way above my lvls and I'm knocking him back. I get this mob down to 5% when I see I got bugga all hp left and think well this is it I'm a gonna. next few secs go by and the cleric yells out CH incoming I'm like hurry up man get that spell moving. with out thinking to the cleric takes a step forward and says crap moved CH is gonna fail. I&quot;m just thinking this is it. I get knocked unconsious, then all of a sudden CH goes off and I'm back standing needless to say I beat the mother down to a pulp with a crit of 15 points would you believe it lol (gotta luv kick crits their just soo high /sarcasm off). I won the shoulders he dropped and even now they grace my shoulders always a rememberance to the fight that I undertook to get em.<br>

I was in an uber guild for 6months or so and realised I missed my old guild (who I had left on good terms with).  <br>
<br>
I returned, was re-instated as an officer and applied myself to helping the guild move forward.  I had never fought VS but I had laid out plans on how to do him.  <br>
<br>
My guild (Moonlight Crusaders) had attempted him on 4-5 occasions previously without success.  <br>
<br>
I stepped in explained the plans, and on the first night he popped.  <br>
<br>
We went in and prepared with our allies and I engaged him - we owned him completely with 0 deaths, which started a landslide in the guild in terms of mobs falling:  VS farmed, Trakanon owned, Sev owned etc.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uthatkiagirl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>That Kia Girl</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/19/02 7:48:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1250.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/lgl525/nom.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> I have to say vindi too =p<br>

That left us with a 53 and 52 cleric and some druids.   I thought forsure we were going to wipe just cause these guys were the ones with crappy mana pools and little raid exp and here I am getting creamed by a mob no one expected.   It was a really fun fight and won with minimal losses although I got under 10hp twice when CH's landed talk about a rush hearing just about everyone say 00MANA and then a CH landing.<br>
<br>
I think other then that I would say that Single group Halls of Testing has got to be the most fun.  Vehament(sp) Wyvern's when you only have 1 cleric and a druid to do the healing is crazy and the fights last up to 10 min.<br>

I'm level 9 and taking the trainer in Crushbone with my druid partner.  We get a little bored and she says the fatal words:<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll go get us something.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm waiting, and she suddenly appears with 3 slavers and a lego.  Okay, I'm thinking, thats not good, but I wade in waving my sword.<br>
<br>
Lego goes down and I'm at 50%.  Slaver goes down, the other two are on her.  I taunt them off, and she's pretty hurt.  Another goes down and I'm berserk.<br>
<br>
Last mob I'm thinking, we can do this, and I hear her elvie death cry.  The trainer has popped!<br>
<br>
Slaver goes down, and it's me versus the trainer.  I'm whacking  away thinking he has got to run, got to run.<br>
<br>
I can't even see my life bar anymore, and I turn him.  As I follow him down the hill, flailing away for the death blow I pop up my inventory and look at my hit points.<br>

I had 3 left.<br>

I am a level 51 Warrior now, and was looking for something to do when a call went out that Vox was up and an impromptu raid was being organized to take her down.   I headed to Permafrost with 26 others and we cleared through the giants.<br>
<br>
I was picked as the MA and we started buffing.  Charge call went out, and me along with a Pally (thanks Antariel) ran into the lair.  I positioned her in away from the ent of the lair and proceded to bring a whooping to her.  I soloed her for about 10 to 15 seconds and when low on health, the Pally LoH's me and the melee call went out.  All melee came in and starting pounding on Vox until about 60 percent health, and then the nukers let loose.  <br>
<br>
When the smoke cleared, there was one dead dragon, and ZERO, that's right, ZERO dead raiders.  I held aggro on Vox for about 90 percent of the fight. <br>
<br>
It was a total rush soloing her for as long as I did, and living through the entire fight.  Of course, I could not roll for crap (as usual) and did not win anything, but there will be more to kill.  <br>
<br>
Anyone else?? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uyzellvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YzellVZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/26/02 10:48:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1250.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Dozer</span><hr size=1> This was probably 4-5 weeks ago, and our 2nd attempt on Dozeker in HoT.

The MT goes down at about 60%, Dozer eats 4 rogues, a couple monks, and a couple other warriors, I grab the aggro(finally /sigh nev claws and SoZ), tank him the rest of the way.

<br>
Level 50... Tenebrous montains. <br>
With a allied Guild, we were pulling the vampire tower. The 55 MT war is doing well, Killing two nameds. So we enter in that tower, starting to climb the stairs... Sudently 5 coteries and 2 generals rush us. we start doing our stuff, killing those bozos, but other ones adds. Then twho nameds. This fight last 10 looongs minutes, we lost 15 players on 25, but we killed them all. That's one of the greatest melee I can remember <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Level 52, permafrost.<br>
We're here to help a friend kill the big beer under Vox. So we clear, jump in the trap, kill small ones, kill less small ones. We buff, kill the big Shammy that flurry to 250, Yeay ! One step done for that &quot;Ranger particle #2&quot;. so let's exit ? no wizards, no druids. Yeay. So basically, all level 53+ charge vox, while the only mage CoH us at entrance. <br>
The evacuation was almost finished, There was only a cleric 52, a Beastlord 48 and me to CoH left. Suddently, a tentacle pop, con white ! I charge it to save cleric, it blow me away with his nuke, hopefully i was not near Vox lair entrance. So I tank it, with the other two assist me. I pursue it at 10%, happy to save friends (the pride of warriors). I am going to step back, near cleric, when 2 other tentacle pop ! Before I can do anything, They double-nuke me, I'll bump a wall, see another wall, bump on it, and fall in... Vox's lair.  /Target Lady Vox, Autofight on, /disc evasive, External view, I put my helmet in my bag (it's more aesthetic without), Taking a screenshoot, taking a Screenshoot, Taking a scLOADING PLEASE WAIT.<br>

<br>
We were farming armor drops in HoT and had a nice white con mob on the chopping block.  We like to move them around as standard practice for the gating mobs, and had just flipped it around on the ledge.  I wasn't the MT this round, so I'm behind the mob doing my best to take it's head off when I see a Vehement Wyvern pop up behind our casters.  At this point no one else had really seen it come up, so I leap over the current mob, run over and dive right in.  Call it Karma, good timing or just sheer luck, but I started right in with a chain of crits and procs that got the aggro right away, saving a druid and chanter in the process.  All this with no defensive, as it still needed 1 minute to refresh.<br>
<br>
So.. I'm hitting the Tank Mez key as fast as I can while getting the mob in a good position for everyone else to jump in.  We generally set up a cheal rotation for this particular mob, as it's been known to wipe a raid if left to it's own.  So I'm watching my hp bar slide down a bit faster than like, still pressing the TM key..  then the rotation gets in gear, discipline refreshed and down went the mob.  <br>
<br>
The big bonus on this was the BP drop.  I didn't get it, but the next one that day is now my SS bp. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
We were me(51), (49 druid), (50 chanter), (48 roguue), (48 shammy).  With the exception of the shammy, the rest of us are friends in RL.<br>
<br>
We were hunting the Taskmaster and his skellie friends for XP, then Xilniov (nasty lvl 52 Enchanter) popped.  We had read that he was a tough mob but tried him anyways, we got whiped out very very fast.  <br>
<br>
We talked about what had went wrong and decided we were confident that with a different strategy would could take him.<br>
<br>
So we came back a few days later for more XP and he popped again, this time we owned him.  The strategy we had discussed worked like a charm.  Took just bout all my HP and all the casters mana to take him, but it was the most rewarding (in terms of satisfaction) kill i have been a part of!<br>
