this, so here will have to do, please bear with me while I get some stuff off of my chest.<br>
<br>
Premise:  Warriors have been experiencing a dramatic and steady decrease in relative power, as many other classes have been coddled and upgraded, and the class is fading into a role of second or 3rd tier melee, their use being exclusive only on raids where only thier most powerful (yet 2 expansions old) features are necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Let me state unequivocally that yes, the discipline of defensive (and to another degree the discipline of evasive when selected correctly) are very powerful tools in the arsenal of a warrior.  This solidifies their need on raids on &quot;high melee&quot; mobs.  Let me also state that these disciplines are 2 expansions old, and weren't nearly as useful when they were fresh as they were in Velious (and to a MUCH lesser degree in most of Luclin).<br>
<br>
When the preposterous notion of &quot;melee balncing&quot; came out, a paraphrased version of the message given to warriors was...<br>
<br>
&quot;You guys have the highest AC and Hitpoints, and decent melee, therefore, you will experience no changes and will be the standard by which we judge other classes&quot;.<br>
<br>
Well, it turns out that this wasn't necessarily true, it would be true under certain conditions, such as...<br>
<br>
...When naked, you have the best AC/HP of any other class.<br>
<br>
...When all equipped in class specific Velious quest armor with epics, you have the best AC/HP of any other class<br>
<br>
What we've learned is that AC is for @#%$, and therefore, unless you're talking about low level mobs, even similarly equipped toons of the same level will all receive the same benefit from AC, which seems to cap out around 1250ish.   There is simply no melee class who cannot fairly easily get to the &quot;soft cap&quot; which sort of deflates the 'you have the highest AC' argument to meaningless.   <br>
<br>
We've also learned that the 2 plate wearing hybrid classes (those who should suffer SOME penalty to melee for their utility, escapability, class specific features, spells, etc.) have FAR easier access to (and this is key, LIMITED ACCESS) equipment which is dramatically better than that which is available to warriors.   By this, I mean that the rate of VI limited Pal/SK only equipment, particularly in Luclin is fairly dramatic.   Compound that with the fact that there's very little, to nothing in the way of &quot;War only&quot; shiz around in any of the slots that represents any improvement of OUR class (Whereas flowing thought abounds).  <br>
<br>
Add to this, the stuff that DOES represent a huge increase in warrior usable equipment normally makes warriors feel like an ass taking because it makes the most sense being on another toon.  Examples of this are particularly available in light of things such as the belt from the restless burrower, which includes +100mana, +15 Wis, and +15 Int, while the things of importance to the warrior are the +Sta, and the +100hp).  What happens is that the upgrade path for warriors now takes SIGNIFICANTLY longer than it does for others, in particular for conscientious warriors who feel bad about wasting stats on them such as mana/wis and int.   <br>
<br>
This is NOT, nor should it ever be construed as an attack on other melee classes, or as a desire to see nerfage, but let's get realistic now.  I'm about to touch on AA skills.<br>
<br>
Warriors were alone in the &quot;eye candy&quot; department (crits, crippling blows), this was given to us many moons ago as a way of &quot;balancing&quot; us, as we were relatively weak (in a similar position as to where we are now in my estimation).   From time to time a big crippling blow made a difference, but the cool thing was we were the only ones, what we did made people look.  Now, it's nothing but spam.  Everyone who wants to get it can get it.  But this is compounded by the fact that we're still getting minimal damage on these, and they're more of an annoyance than anything else.   In the advent of 19,000 point critical manaburns, a 500 point crippling blow is nothing but /yawn.   This was our exclusive domain and now clerics can even get critical blasts if they spend their points like this.<br>
<br>
Rangers:  Went from average melee with some utility spells to GODS with AM3, and Endless Quiver.   I absolutely LOVE that for them, they should have been archery masters all along, but at a cost, as is the philosophy behind &quot;balance&quot;.  When a ranger can hit the same AC and 6k+ hp buffed, with CS3 and CA 3, they can be and are formidable tanks as well.   There seems to be no real tradeoff, no balance.<br>
<br>
Paladins:  While they SHOULD be the masters against undead, Slay Undead has become simply a way of taking a class that SHOULD suffer a penalty to melee and made them GODS (again, 5,000 point critical hits in melee with all of the utility allotted to Paladins while warriors still pound away at similar con mobs for 50, 60, 70 points, or 290ish max with primal seems totally out of line).  Free horses, and an abundance of available equipment at relatively low cost, along with no need to hold back on NON-Int/Wis/Mana items which also have +Sta, and +100hp, because they're not limited seems wrong to me.<br>
<br>
Shadowknights:  Well, they haven't gotten the MASSIVE aa increases that others have gotten, yet, they can STILL acheive the same levels of AC/HP as warriors, and STILL out taunt warriors, making them PREFERRED tanks on certain mobs over warriors and the ONE job that we're supposed to have.<br>
<br>
In aa skills, warriors will follow the same road EVERY TIME.   3 in Run 3, 3 in something else (usually regen) 3 in Natural Durability, Slap Area Taunt (Because we need to have a taunt that works!) then back for Combat Stability and Combat Agility.  After that, nothing truly makes a warrior THAT much more powerful, or THAT much more capable of performing their jobs.   This doesn't mention that Natural Durability, Combat Stability and Combat Agility can ALL be used by everyone else.   We have ONE class skill that we use regularly, AE taunt.  But wait a second, AE taunt wasn't designed nor was it supposed to be used as nothing more than a guaranteed taunt buttin, but this is what it has become because VI has not been able to give us RELIABLE taunt.   They didn't have the foresight to have as a CLASS skill *increased agitation* which modified the effectiveness of taunt, the ONLY thing we're good for.   <br>
<br>
This leads to basic exp grouping!   VI revamps a dungeon that they may as well have called &quot;The temple of Hybrid Heaven&quot;, as they completely disabled taunt, making us worthless in the zone.  Fine, they fixed it after the nightmares, but it still doesn't alter the fact that their intentions became known, which is that they feel that warriors needing to tank exp mobs is undesirable.<br>
<br>
With the ability of everyone who can wield a weapon to train in CS3 and CA3, warriors' place as tanks has been relegated to zilch.  Why?  Well, because we really do suck at gaining aggro, whereas all hybrids can gain it FAR easier and more reliably than we can if they assert themselves, therfore we have no real place in an exp group.   <br>
<br>
I've never seen a time in EQ where warriors were forced to solo so much because their group desirablity has gone from one extreme to the other.   While with the right equipment, we CAN solo, we're nowhere near the capability of repeatedly soloing like a SU Paladin, or an arrow kiting ranger.  We're STRICT melee, and should in my mind have some advantages to that, such as being BETTER, not a little, but a LOT better than non strict melees, not significantly WORSE based on mob choice.  <br>
<br>
My recommendations for improving the current pathetic state of warriors:<br>
<br>
1. Itemization in Luclin/PoP (and this is true in a lot of Velious)<br>
<br>
Make some warrior only stuff, or at least some -Int/-Wis/-Mana +HP, +Sta stuff for plate classes so that there's a logical idea that this should go to a warrior.  Jesus, all you'd have to do is have an item with +100 hp which has a negative mana/tick effect (i.e. Escaping thought).   We're damn sick of being conscientious and forking over the stuff that best suits someone else, yet when stuff best suits US, it also well suits everyone else.<br>
<br>
Also, WTF is wrong with making some spiked plate boots that increase kick damage, or proc?   We HAVE a button for kick, but regardless of our skill, we cannot increase our melee damage on kick.<br>
<br>
2. AA Skills:  Make them not suck ass.   I've got some ideas:<br>
<br>
- Increased Agitation:  Make taunt friggin WORK so we don't have to be forced to used a decent situational skill (taunting all mobs in an area) into &quot;The only way to reliably taunt&quot;.<br>
<br>
- Decapitate:  I don't know why the hell we don't get the ability to decapitate when using 2hs, similar to rogues use of asassinate, on mobs of similar size or smaller than us.<br>
<br>
- When I was level 54, Mightystrike was the coolest thing ever.   Now that I'm 60 with aa skills, I see it as a waste of time and energy, and dangerous because it disables my disciplines for so long, even though it's not overpowered.   Why not an AA skill which acheives a similar effect for a longer period of time?   I mean, come on, manaburn is ok, but having an &quot;always crit/Crip&quot; for 30 seconds even while using discs is?   I'm a friggin WARLORD, and I should be able to get fire in my eyes and go on a frenzied rampage laying devastation from time to time without sacrificing my ability to go defensive for the next hour.   Make a mightystrike type aa class skill.   It certainly wouldn't take anything away from anyone else, but would sure make MY experience more fun.<br>
<br>
Finally, in summary:<br>
<br>
Don't fuggin upgrade EVERYONE but warriors, give out items that best serve someone else, but then not protect us on items, give out AA skills that are meaningful to everyone BUT us, and expect silence, that's B.S. and shouldn't be tolerated.   <br>
<br>
And if my snarepoop ever gets nerfed...I cannot be held responsible for my actions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukbern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kbern</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 10:51:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The State of Warriors in EQ</span><hr size=1> Very well thought out post.

Items.  Seeing a Warrior only drop is incredibly rare.  I think Monks have it just about the same.  With Warriors if its a weapon its usually desirable to Paladins/Shadow Knights/Rangers/maybe Rogues/maybe Bards/maybe others.  However there are numerous Paladin/Shadow Knight only weapons.<br>
<br>
With armor its usually also desirable to Paladins/Shadow Knights/Clerics/Bards.  Frankly, I think it pretty much bites to have to compete with Clerics and Bards for armor.  I'm not saying they don't deserve it, but it shouldn't be a choice between tank or non-tank.  Yes they take a beating, no doubt about it.  But their primary job is not to stand up front and take the beating.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ubrutultarewmarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brutul Tarew Marr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 559<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 11:35:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.blackcompany.cc/member_pics/45.jpg height=185 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The State of Warriors in EQ</span><hr size=1> Paladins and SKs were increased in power because they were horribly underpowered compared to ...you guessed it... warriors!  Now how much sense does it make if you upgrade pal/sks to compete with warriors, to then upgrade warriors?  Warriors still have a very solid role in both raids and exp groups, and are absolutely necessary for the vast majority of uber encounters.  All you are asking for is for warriors to be as overpowered as they used to be, which ain't gonna happen.<br>
<br>
Warriors don't compete with anyone for weapons.  Knight classes have a huge number of weapons that are better than anything warriors can use for the most part, and the other dual wielders don't want the type of weapons that warriors go after because they don't want high aggro procs.  SoD's and blades of carnage aren't warrior only, but how often do you see any other class with them?  Hategiver and Bloodfrenzy are both WAR only. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6629>Brutul Vilesilencer</a><br>

<br>
Remember, the &quot;balancing&quot; took place Pre-Luclin and Pre-AA.  Therefore, the argument that this was done in response to warrior overpowering, which was true, is no longer valid.<br>
<br>
The equipment I was referring to, and I apologize for not making it more clear., was in terms of armor, and high HP non-weapons.<br>
<br>
We get decent weapons, you're correct (although I'd argue that there's a fairly substantial jump from trash like willsappers to higher end weapons whereas most other classes have a more smooth upgrade path)<br>

You spent a great deal of time at least typing that message up so I won't demean the effort or the intent but I completely disagree that warriors are underpowered.  Yes, there are &quot;perks&quot; that we could be given and yes, there could be more useful AA skills (I mean, who needs underwater ballet 3?) but on the whole, our roles are defined.<br>
<br>
Is it that there are warriors without roles (MT, leader, strategist) who are more prone to wanting these &quot;perks&quot;?  I mean, fark, I'm a main MT, I'm pledgemaster for our guild, I'm an advisor.  I don't have *time* to think about how my 4th toe from the left is less uber than my 3rd toe from the right.<br>

Durability grants an extra percent of hp based on your unbuffed total right? Warriors will naturally get a larger bonus from this as you have more hp than the other classes. <br>
As for class abilities, doesnt flurry also add more damage to your class? I dont know how effective rampage is since ive never seen it done by a pc but from the description it sounds fairly nice when used in conjunction with aoe taunt to help build that much more agro on the mobs you arent currently focused on. <br>
Im not saying your wrong, because in a way you arent. Warriors DIDNT get any increase in ability with the melee balancing, the hybrid classes DID catch up somewhat in tanking and damage dealing. I just dont think that warriors are in danger of only being used on the specific raids where defensive is needed.<br>

They participate in encounters where a Warrior will always be needed, and yet they comment on other areas of the game which they (probably) haven't experienced at very least since the release of Luclin. Sadly, warriors really AREN'T needed anymore. I have to beg even my guild for a group, because they always have a SK with them. Rangers consistantly get tanking spots in groups over me. Is it because I have a bad reputation? Not likely, unless those 4 other hapless warriors waiting at the zone do also, and none of us know.<br>
<br>
Warriors are incredibly underpowered now, once hybrids start getting Archetype AA skills (and even before it, with thier new spells and weapons / armor), Warriors become dead weight in a group, because one could simply get a Ranger who can buff, snare, nuke, DoT, and tank as well as us.<br>
<br>
And gear...it's not so much that I feel bad about taking things that has good stats for other classes that I won't make use of, so much as the fact that we have to COMPETE with those classes for almost every piece of equipment we get, then they can turn around and get a class specific piece to replace it within weeks.<br>
<br>
There is a time now, for me it came early in the 50s--when I progressed from the hell that was DL, the only place where I was desired as it was--where Warriors stop being desired, and that doesn't stop until guilds start raiding big things. It is a dark gap in a warriors progression, and while other classes have similar gaps, they come much earlier, and are much easier to work through. <p>_________________<br>

Although I wouldnt mind seeing a boot proc, that would be kinda cool.<br>
<br>
I don't know how you can call warriors in a pathetic state. We are meant to tank, we arent meant to have pretty little eye candy like other classes. We arent meant to do tons of damage. We are meant to take damage and keep mobs on us so other classes can do their thing. That means hit point items and there are plenty of those. If you have a good guild leader that looks out for the well being of your guild, they will equip the main tank first instead of other players, even if that means giving the war +15int belt with 100hp on it. Off the top of my head I can think of at least 5 items for each slot that is war useable that have 50 or more hp on them.<br>
<br>
Taunt works fine on every mob I have tanked. This agitation, would be nice, increase the effectivness of taunt with a class aa skill. <br>
<br>
Overall, I think warriors are in a fine state. We are the standard by which other classes are judged. In truth your post reads like nothing more than a class envy post to me, granted a well thought envy post, but an envy post all the same.<br>

This is in my eyes the core of the problem in itself.<br>
<br>
A Warrior lives only for combat and is suited only for fighting, and because of this devotion should, in theory, be the best with weapons and fighting others.<br>
<br>
Now the knight classes were designed to be less powerful in combat, and have their spells and utility make up for this. At least in theory.<br>
<br>
As for Rangers I have never understood them comparing themselves to Warriors, I think of them A Rogue/Druid Hybrids that by some bad stroke of luck were given taunt. With the Jolt line and the new Archery powers, this becomes even more clear. <br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong on this I am all for class interchangeability but there needs to be a point where the classes that specialize clearly need to stand out without a question. <br>
<br>
I fear myself that the role of the warrior will be limited to raids, and only a few raids at that, not long after PoP is realized.<br>
<br>
Gear will only get better, in the form of higher stats and better ratios and more focus effects. Useful and more powerful spells will get added to spellbooks. Not just at the 50, 55 or 60  level of the game, but throughout all the levels. And as we know a tanking is 49% gear, but what happens when the gear is the similar, and you add skills and spells that add to a group even more to any encounter to some but not all?<br>
<br>
Why bother with a Warrior whose taunt button doesn't work when you could grab a knight who can easily maintain Aggro on demand, and even help with upkeep on themselves? <br>
<br>
But that is not just a problem with the knights, it is happening with all tanking classes, even Monks and Rangers who soon can tank as well as anyone, still deal out more damage, and have other uses directly or indirectly related to combat.<br>
<br>

Yes we are, and thats exactly what the majority of this post is about. Just another high end warrior who doesnt know what the F*ck he's talking about, because of COURSE a warrior is needed then for defensive, but GETTING there is getting harder and harder. And the line is getting thinner and thinner, guilds are using SKs to tank ST, NToV, Tunare, and the such. They grab agro better than any warrior EVER, their agro is far more consistant, pairing DoTs, Snares, and taunt, they deal more damage (with massive 2hers like Massive Heartwood Flamberge, no warrior could keep up), and its getting increasingly obvious that they can take damage as well, if not better than a warrior. The things Warriors are supposed to be able to do best, we still do, but by an extremely small amount. <p>_________________<br>

LOL, Megunna, I was playing a warrior since before the patch when warriors got critical hits, so yeah I do know the @#%$ I am talking about. Yeah when your hunting frogs in seb or goblins in lake of ill omen, or spiders in velks, a warrior isnt needed so bad. And yes other classes can get agro much easier than warriors. But then the high end game isnt about who can get the most agro or who can get the biggest hit. It is about working as a team to take down a major mob. yeah on some of the easier high end mobs, like ntov, a paladin/sk is fine to tank with, hell my guild used to let rangers tank dragons in ntov just for amusement. But for tough mobs, like Emperor, cursed, burrower, high priest, arch lich give me a warrior anyday.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufuloriancavestomper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FulorianCavestomper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 787<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 4:02:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The State of Warriors in EQ</span><hr size=1> NT <p><img src="http://strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Fulorian/fullsize/sig.jpg" border="0"><BR>

They believe that level 60s are out to get them, have life easy, and have no clue what their talking about. Because they haven't lived the 'struggle' that they are going through. Like that inconvenience of dying every few weeks and loosing 10 percent of their xp every time, omg.<br>
<br>
Poor baby, we never had to deal with AAers taking up groups, and life is easy. Try running back to a corpse 10 zones away. Try wearing a weapon with a lower ratio and 2hs at level 50 than level 10s have in their offhand now, thats 1hs. <br>
<br>
Try wearing Rusty Weapons into your teens, and Fine Steel into your thirties. You might get an idea of what most of the 60s have gone through. <p><img src="http://strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Fulorian/fullsize/sig.jpg" border="0"><BR>

<br>
I happen to be level 60 with AA skills in a raiding guild where I'm both an officer/raid leader and MT.  I DID do my own crafted quest, and had 2 langseaxes while hunting in Cazic Thule in my 30's that I did the quest for.  This isn't about not knowing what it's like, because I'm afraid you're wrong if you think so.<br>
<br>
This is about the steady decline in the relative usefulness and melee power of a class in the game over the last 9 months or so.  It affects not only the high end encounters, but the &quot;up and comers&quot; as well.  Just as it was hard for you and I while we were level 49 and just getting our first UBER SSOY, we DID go through our 50's in a time where we were not only overpowered, but absolutely essential in exp groups, which made LFG a much less traumatic experience for us than others today.  <br>
<br>
This is about a scale which has tipped from being heavily IN our favor to being heavily OUT of our favor, the pendulum having swung too far in the other direction.   It's gone too far, and the lack of good class specific, or stats favorable equipment for warriors has put us into a position where we're forced to say &quot;Yes, I realize that this is most suited for a hybrid, but the MT needs the +100HP, and therefore gets&quot;  This is simply wrong, with all of the various loot items out there, modeling a few who's use is limited or who's stats favor a single class would create a much more harmonious (read fun) environment in which to play.   <br>

Also, a couple of effective aa skills (i.e. Increased Agitation as described above) and some decent melee output on a class who's viability depends on melee solely will hurt no one, and in my view, would make the game much more fun to play.<br>

<br>
The straight damage caster (the wizard) is hands down, the best.  Manaburn accentuates that fact.<br>
<br>
The straight damage melee (the warrior) is NOT hands down the best.  Warriors have a very marginal edge.  Should that be right?<br>
<br>
Roll up an SK or paladin and hit their AA button.  Look at everything from Arch and Class and then come back and look at warriors.  They get some really ass beating @#%$. We have broken flurry and AE taunt.  I'm very grateful we got that, but come on.  There really needs to be a bit more there.<br>

I read a lot of class boards... And this is by far the quietest.  Read the Safehouse or any other class boards and you'll come by lots of class rants demanding some change or another [small or outright ridiculous].  But here... I just see tons of posts regarding what weapon choices you should use... Mageolo gear checks... Questions about how you should spend your 10k on your new warrior twink... It makes me think this... Are the majority of warriors on this board twinks of bored classes out to spend their cash so they can dress up a warrior like some barbie doll?  After reading the majority of these posts, I'd only call a very few people here &quot;serious&quot; warriors.<br>
<br>
After getting over the glory of seeing just how much HP I can get unbuffed and taking screenshots of myself dressed in a variety of multi-colored plate pieces, I find the warrior class to be the class with the least utility out of any class in the game.  Well, I previously played a rogue and druid to 60, so maybe I'm a little spoiled.  But I'm going to use a little common sense here...  All these so-called &quot;utility&quot; classes that sacrifice melee for &quot;utility&quot; are getting upgraded in the melee department tremendously... And they are getting some nice extra utility as well... But warriors aren't pushing for any extra utility in any regard... Why is that?  Is it taboo to ask for some utility?  But it's absolutely alright to have utility but ask for extra melee?  I mean... Where's my AA summoned horse?  Does it make sense for utility classes like SKs and Pallies get some nice utility AAs like that horse but also embellish themselves in Physical Enhancement and Combat Fury?  I'd like to step into their little utility territories as well... Where's my AA 72 hour refresh super nerfed version of LoH?  Or perhaps an AA 72 hour refresh super nerfed invis. I don't get it... Hybrid AAs strengthen their weakness and embellish their strengths... But warrior AAs do jack and squat, nor does it help with utility at all [other than bind wound - which is kinda funny].<br>
<br>
Which takes me to epics... There is no reason to not request changes to Severilous...  The logic for a triggered Trakanon for bard epic was that Trakanon was being killed &quot;regardless&quot; of whether or not a bard needed to complete his epic.  He was being killed specifically for his loot, which had no regard for epic pieces.  Some guilds had him on raid targets simply because they could kill him and wanted to fill their guild banks.  A bard might have been waiting a week for Trak to spawn to complete his epic, but a guild who regularly kills him and want to send yet another mana robe to their guild bank may just come and kill him regardless.  Thus, Verant put in a triggered Trakanon [their exact reason].  In the same regard, a warrior may camp EJ for days, even weeks, but a guild who wants to fill their guild banks with CoF or just have Sev as a &quot;raid insta-kill target&quot; will just come in and kill him regardless of epic pieces that are sought out.  Mana burning wizzies who want some loot to sell find Sev as easy pickings, regardless of epic necessities.  More and more green dragonscales are finding their way to auctions for outrageous prices and Sev is killed almost as soon as he spawns.<br>
<br>
Finally, I'd like to address the insane high end game.  I've seen some insane magelo profiles... Monks with 4000 hps, 1500+ AC, and some insane ATK/damage output.  Hybrids can now match warriors in AC/Hps, with warriors pulling out ahead by as little as 500-800 hps, and at times... even less.  I was in Cazic Thule the other day and saw a monk and cleric camping sewers.  I was totally blown away.  The monk was tanking very well.  It may surprise some, but high dodge caps and block coupled with 4000 unbuffed hps and 1500+ unbuffed AC makes monks better tanks there by far.  I don't think I could have done nearly as well with the same cleric... Not to mention trying to split pools of slime [which takes me back to the area of &quot;utility&quot;].  Nor could I keep up with a decent damage output to keep up with such a camp before respawn, even with my gear [which is pretty nice].  I mean, even asking for some better dodge modifier items to help with our extremely low dodge cap would help us out.  Hybrids get huge offensive modifiers on high end weapons to help with their caps [not to mention their utility].  <br>
<br>
And is it just me or is the desirability of warriors in guilds going down tremendously?  Guilds establish their main tanks and their little suicide damage sponges with no purpose but to soak up rampages.  What incentive is there to get more warriors?  Certainly not damage.  And certainly not utility [LOL].  Many guilds have closed their doors to warriors for good.  Even hybrids are sought out more by established guilds for simple little utilities.  Is there a reason to have a surplus of warriors?  There certainly is not.  Not all warriors have a &quot;solid&quot; role in raids.  Only one or a few.  The rest just do damage.  A surplus of monks or rogues never hurts.  But a surplus of warriors is just looked down on.  <br>
<br>
