I'm not sure how Warriors in the top 5% of the EQ population tanking in PoW have any real relation to the other 95% of us.  Most of us will never see Seru, let alone some place like PoW.  <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
In some situations yes. Those abilities you mentioned are great, and I am not going to say they aren't. Their utility is much reduced when tanking a mob unslowed. I can't LoH if I'm stunned. It is very difficult cast a spell if I'm getting hit twice a second. My ability to heal myself is great when you are looking at long term mana efficiency. My ability to heal myself is not so great when in a situation where the difference in tanking ability of a knight and a warrior are most pronounced. I have a very efficient heal that heals 700 points of damage for 225 mana. The downside is it only heals 175 hp a tick. I do have a nice, fast heal that will heal 850 hp in 1 second. The problem is that even that thing gets interrupted quite frequently when tanking an unslowed mob (it also costs 400 mana, which isn't relevant to this discussion) and it has a 5 second recast, so I can't chain it. I can't begin to tell you how many times I've died to unslowed mobs with my lay hands button ungreyed and plenty of mana because I was stunned. By the time I realise that the cleric isn't going to be able to heal me in time and I decide to handle it myself, I usually have 2 or 3 seconds at most to get a heal off. Burning 400 mana every time I get a bit low on hp is a great a way to piss away mana and piss off the cleric, who now thinks you don't trust them. It is also completely unfeasible to do on a continous basis unless the group wants to stop and wait for me to med every other mob. That heal is 400 mana for a reason, it is designed as an emergency heal, on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>someone else</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
If the group is in a situation where we are getting tons of adds that the chanter is able to lock down but the cleric is slowly running out of mana, then those abilities kick large quantities of ass. They do have their strengths and weaknesses though. Those secondary abilites are even better when used by a secondary/ghetto crowd control tank. <br>
<br>
Anything that a warrior will have a hard time tanking will be much harder for a paladin/SK of the same level of gear to tank in the same situation, assuming the primary healing comes from CH. If it is simply a question of healing efficiency then it is a different story. Survival is usually a question of healing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>speed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Will the heal land in time? Will it be for enough hp to buy enough time for the next heal to land? The difference in hp between a warrior and knight can be the difference in whether there is enough time for CH to land. That generally is not the case for most xp mobs...that I can tank. I can't tank giants in PoS. How do I know this? Because no group I've been in has been willing to try. &quot;We need a warrior&quot;. Whether that is the truth or not, I have no idea.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686">Graal MacBladefury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The plantiff and defendant blow things so far out of proportion in their favor that the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.<br>
<br>
Granted, while I may be seen as just another one of these people that will spew forth non-sense, I can tell you that I honestly dont care if they gave warriors more agro control or not.  Why do I say this?  Well, Im trying to add a *3rd party* point of view, despite the fact that many will immediately conclude that I am biased.<br>
<br>
My main is a 65 SK and I bot a 65 shaman.  That is the main reason that I am replying to this thread, as I can speak from two points of view.<br>
<br>
There were quite a few things I wanted to comment on, so I apologize if this seems a bit out-of-whack order-wise.<br>
<br>
Firstly, while I cant speak intelligently about paladins (&quot;PLD&quot;), I can assure you that SKs SELDOM run OOM, especially at higher levels.  And we dont need C3 (or greater) to get to that point (crack is SO easy to get nowadays though...).  Deathly Tempation is adequate mana regen for me to go for hours on end, to say nothing about Pact of Hate, which actually has a higher mana regen then C3 (C3 is MUCH better overall though).  Sorry, but If you are running OOM, you are not casting your spells wisely.  <br>
<br>
While PoP has gone a long way to *define* the roles of the knight classes, our DPS/heal spells are still awful in comparison to other classes of similar level.  Translation?  Yeah, they help and are really cool to have, but our primary job as a tank (all of us, warriors, SKs and PLDs alike) is to ABSORB damage, not deal damage.  You want to be damage dealer, you have picked the wrong class Im sorry to say.<br>
<br>
The main problem I have with the *warrior* arguement, however, is that many of you have blown it so far out of proportion, it isnt even funny.  A warrior is, in absolutely no regard, a *liability* in a group.  Talk about silly, Im sorry--that takes the cake.  I know of no person that seriously thinks that way at all.<br>
<br>
If I understand this thread correctly, the primary concern from the warriors seems to be *ponging* the mob.  This pong seems to be at its greatest concern when the mob is pre-slowed.  I dont know how many mobs Ive slowed (its a lot though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but you guys are just focused too much on something that doesnt seem that big a deal to me.<br>
<br>
Firstly, malo then slow is seldom resisted in a normal XP environment (PoTactics and above are harder, I admit, but still).  My experience has been slow lands at a very high rate of success in zones such as CoD, PoV, PoS, BoT, HoH, etc..  Why is this important?  Well, a shaman/chanter slowed mob is essentially a turd.  I know that if all incoming mobs get slowed, we have a extremely good chance at winning.  <br>
<br>
For instance, in a 5 person group in PoV, with 1 tank (me) and no chanter, several months ago, we got 5 adds, 2 at the beginning and 3 later on as we were fighting.  All of them got slowed and we only lost one member.  One of the most enjoyable EQ moments I have had I must say.  hehe  Anyways, this is not an effort to say how great we were, but a comment as to the power of slow.  I pretty much believe that a slowed mob (full effect--I hate the ones that have partial) equals a victory substantially all the time.  As a matter of fact, I fail to recall any wipes to slowed mobs.  Its the unslowed adds or somethign that cause all the problems.<br>
<br>
Why mention all of that?  Well, who really cares if you pong a slowed mob?  They are such turds, a wizard could probably tank them!!!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Furthermore, getting agro back is seldom a huge time-sink.<br>
<br>
So, that seems to leave us with an unslowed mob pong.  Well, as stated above, I just dont see that happen all that often.  An unslowed mob pong, however, can cause problems, but the few times that it does happen, it just doesnt seem to present a task that a good to great group cnat overcome.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, however, that yes, I do end up tanking for the majority of my groups.  So, many might immediately jump on the *you dont understand* bandwagon.  Well, actually, I do.<br>
<br>
I frequently group with a 65 warrior friend.  I let him tank over me because....actually, Im not sure why I do, but....hehe<br>
<br>
Anyways, I found myself ponging the mob frequently to my shaman, as I am used to the agro control of my SK, but it was never a big deal at all!  The mob was slowed almost all the time and the warrior got agro back really fast.  It honestly wasnt that big a deal.<br>
<br>
Also, all I had to do was slow the *slow* spell just a little bit and the problem was reduced significantly (although its wasnt too big a deal in the first place--unless you consider that the 3 melee class had to move a little  =P  ).  Malo doesnt seem to make the mobs too mad at all.<br>
<br>
I also bot a 65 chanter friend quite a bit too.  Chanters are FAR MORE TRICKY to control agro, especially when grouping with a warrior.  Tash gets hell-a agro fast, but sure as heck casts fast too. <br>
<br>
However, it still wasnt that big of a deal!  So I have to cast malo/slow (or tash/slow) a little slower.  Big deal.  And did I mention that I am a very average shaman / chanter?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Come on guys, if I can do this pretty well, I cant believe that, for the most part, the shaman / chanter population cant do it significantly better!!<br>
<br>
I guess I just dont see it as that big an issue.  Could warriors use a boost to their agro control?  I dunno---guess so.  But in the big picture, that seems to be a simple wisk of paint to me.<br>
<br>
On a related note, however, one of the few, but primary reasons that SK/PLD are deemed worthy of playing MT in a group is due to their agro control.  If VI was to allow warriors to get and control agro ON THE SAME BASIS as SK/PLD, then YES, without a shadow of a doubt, you would automatically reduce the appeal of grouping with SK/PLD.  I know that some warriors agree with that school of thought and I just wanted to re-enforce that.  There might be an arguement to increase warrior taunt, but it CANNOT ever equal a SK/PLD, all things equal, or you will essentially kill the hybrid tanks.<br>
<br>
Make no mistake about it, agro control is one of the best attributes of SK/PLD at the moment.<br>

<br>
At the moment Knights tank/mitigate arguably 80-90% as well as a warrior and warriors taunt 40-50% as well as a knight.<br>
<br>
For playing my warrior in XP groups I would appreciate either a small upgrade in taunt or a small upgrade in mitigation so that either the gap in agro control between myself and a similarly geared knight becomes smaller, or I have a sightly larger mitigation advantage.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse Im not expecting either so Im just gonna take the groups that come my way and play my chanter when I can't find them.  <br>
<br>
I still enjoy playing my warrior and when I tank I do a good job of it, but its certainly not unusual for me to be in groups where I bag my red blade for my blue blade and let a knight tank because agro control at the touch of a button makes things easier for everyone. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50585" target="top">Eoden</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Half Elven Warlord<br>

<br>
You sound essentially honest so I'll take what you say at face value.  You even admit you don't know why you let your Warrior friend tank, I suspect you're just being kind to him.  And there is the crux of the matter.  You have a choice between an SK and a Warrior, and you can't see any particular reason to use the Warrior.  I'm not saying the Warrior should always be the first choice, but damn it would be nice to really be able to say there was a real reason they might be preferable, wouldn't you think?  That is, if you're not doing hard hitting PoS giants and such.<br>

Maybe for you it wasn't.  You compensated for the difference between your SK and your Warrior friend and went merrily along.  Some people can't do that.  They're aggro understanding deficient.  Some would say stupid.  I would say they just don't understand aggro.  Some people can compensate, but don't want to be bothered.  They know they can keep the SK or Paladin standing with only minor additional healing effort, in most cases, and would much rather have the addtional aggro control.  Which leaves Warriors grouping with people like you, willing to deal with the reduced aggro control of the Warrior, because they don't see it as a big deal. But of course, since you'll take any tank that comes along, if a Paladin or Shadow Knight shows up first, you swoop them up, meaning that the Warrior can be left with just the people that can't adjust or don't want to.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>On a related note, however, one of the few, but primary reasons that SK/PLD are deemed worthy of playing MT in a group is due to their agro control. If VI was to allow warriors to get and control agro ON THE SAME BASIS as SK/PLD, then YES, without a shadow of a doubt, you would automatically reduce the appeal of grouping with SK/PLD. I know that some warriors agree with that school of thought and I just wanted to re-enforce that. There might be an arguement to increase warrior taunt, but it CANNOT ever equal a SK/PLD, all things equal, or you will essentially kill the hybrid tanks.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Understood.  Completely equal aggro control would be bad for the hybrids.  So the point would be to give enough to make slows not a big deal for everyone, then allow the natural difference in aggro generation to continue from there.<br>
<br>
And Graal, while your groups may never have tried the PoS giants, my groups have.  And I die about half the time because the Clerics can't compensate for how hard the giants hit, even with slowed.  I would never want to face one of those things for more than a few split seconds unslowed, I'm already dying fairly regularly with them slowed.  Maybe it's just bad luck or bad Clerics, but it happens.<br>

You even admit you don't know why you let your Warrior friend tank, I suspect you're just being kind to him. And there is the crux of the matter. You have a choice between an SK and a Warrior, and you can't see any particular reason to use the Warrior. I'm not saying the Warrior should always be the first choice, but damn it would be nice to really be able to say there was a real reason they might be preferable, wouldn't you think?

Actually, what the primary reason that I wonder why I let him tank is because Im geared much better then he is.

To be honest, I dont believe that Im not the only one, or even in the minority.  I believe that most people dont want to sit and do nothing and, if they need a tank, will grab the 1st damn one that they can, warrior or otherwise.<br>

All you seem interested in is sitting on this board boo hooing yourself to sleep because a sk/paladin got a group.

If the mob will not get off then use AE taunt. If you are taunting properly AE taunt should be ready for the extreme cases every time. You know.. people actually do recall the GOOD warriors from the BAD. Take some advise on taunting and be a good warrior and not a person ready to roll over and die like a crippled turtle.<br>

The whole &quot;well we are the 95 percent of the warrior population!&quot; speach doesn't cut it anymore. Level up to 65, get your guild to level up and fricken kill stuff.

<br>
My wife ( 65 Monk 7 k hp raidbuffed ) said that she can only bring out all of her damage without looking for aggro when a hybrid is tanking. With warriors she has to have a look at her aggro what means she is loosing damage.<br>
<br>
So were speaking about exp grinding.<br>
<br>
The normal exp group has<br>
one Tank<br>
one Healer<br>
one Slower<br>
3 Damagedealer<br>
<br>
So when a Warrior is tanking he maybe makes a fluffy of damage more than that tanking hybrid.<br>
1. the Cleric needs more mana for healing per fight<br>
2. the Slower has to control his aggro more .. means slow later ...<br>
3. the Damagedealers have to controll their aggro means lower their Damageoutput.<br>
<br>
Summary .. More healmana less groupdps .<br>
<br>
So when the Hybrid is tanking<br>
1. the cleric needs less mana for healing ( maybe now he can nuke once in 2 fights)<br>
2. the Slower can slow early .. ( maybe he can Dot the mob now )<br>
3. the Damagedealers can dish out more damage <br>
Summary ... Less healmana more groupdps<br>
<br>
More groupdps = faster kills = more mobs to kill in the same time = more EXP = thats why groups are exp grinding.<br>
<br>
And there is the point where the problem starts. Now ppl. see that they can make more exp in time with an hybrid as a tank. Now ppl. see that a hybrid as a tank is less risky than a warrior.<br>
<br>
Hm less risks more exp or more risk less exp.<br>
<br>
Which choice ?<br>
<br>
Sure the ppl. also take a warrior, but only when he is <br>
1. a friend<br>
2. a guildmember<br>
3. well named<br>
4. the only tank around.<br>
5. the traditional tank.<br>
<br>
But never they choose a warrior now cause he is the best for that tanking job.<br>
<br>
Man as a 55 th warrior in Sebi in March 2001 I had never the problems finding a group as now as 65 warrior with 1500 buffed AC and around 6.7k hp clericgroupbuffed with around 80 AAs.<br>

I'd like to know where all those not-so-uber people that are rejecting the not-so-uber warriors in a group (since I understand this problem is supposedly the problem of the common folks, not the ubers) but managing to do sustain some crazy amount of DPS.  I know in pickup groups I definitely see my group's casters (not healers) lose mana over time without getting aggroed.  I'm sure in a Paladin group that caster will use his secret mana regen to sustain even more damage.  Right.  <br>
<br>
If your group think they do more damage with a Knight around, they're simply delusional.  It might be better for you and the group that you never got into that group.  I know plenty of uber casters that can maintain no net gain of mana without me trying very hard at all because they know when to nuke.  If a decked out max FT wizard can keep his mana constant with me doing nothing more than autoattack, then your pickup group casters can do the same, assuming they want to learn.  Get a good puller sometimes and see how little, if any, damage a Knight can actually squeeze if the mobs are coming at a constant pace.  Your casters cannot do more than their normal sustained DPS if they don't get a chance to med betwen pulls and it's fairly trivial to maintain aggro over casters at sustained DPS level.<br>
<br>
I'm also not sure where these secret areas people go LFG at, but when I join a decent pickup group in any zone that resembles remotely populated, we usually run out of mobs to kill.  All the DPS in the world isn't somehow going to make you XP faster when you run out of mobs to kill.  Yeah, there are the not so good pickup groups too, but such groups aren't going to suddenly become a mean DPS machine just because a Knight is there, either. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninaor@thesteelwarrior>Ninaor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/18/03 3:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   more sweet info to add :)</span><hr size=1> Ok, I'll *TRY* to keep this as short as possible.  I have more info to add as requested by previous posters.<br>
<br>
I was asked by someone previously in this thread to come up with more than one situation (forest giant irmin's in PoS) where defensive allows the group to do something they normally cannot do.<br>
<br>
Well, today I spent a LOT of time in PoV at a different camp than my normal IC/OC.  I was at DG.  And I was without my wife (63 cleric) there to help out.  I was in a true pickup group of 2 wizards, a ranger, a cleric, and an enchanter.<br>
<br>
Basically the day went nearly flawless.  About 4 hours of constant exp'ing and I died 2 times - and I was the only one in the party that ever died.  Both deaths were related to the over zealous pulling of the ranger during what the group had agreed to as &quot;afk breaks&quot; for bio/food/whatever.<br>
<br>
I am now a level 64 Ogre War and I was at this camp today to try and gain as much exp as possible.  I was sitting at about 1360 AC and 5475 HP fully buffed.<br>
<br>
This was my first time at this camp, and my first time of course fighting the crawlers, arachnae, and golems out there in that part of PoV.  Any of you who have ever fought these mobs probably know that the crawlers are pretty predictable - they all max for 508 and they don't get the &quot;lucky streaks&quot; of hits and ripostes that the spiders sometimes do and the golems OFTEN do.  I however did not know this - and one of the times my cleric was caught off guard was also one of the times I died due to a string of red in my melee spam window along with a double proc of 375 DD per hit.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as I tanked at this camp I learned.  I learned that we would occasionally have to pull a golem whether we like it or not, and I adjusted.  I started using defensive on golem pulls and having the ranger immediately pull another before defensive wore off so I would be protected from those lovely &quot;damage spikes&quot;.<br>
<br>
So this situation would be another example of one where the warrior has an advantage.  However, I'm not sure if this could be avoided by stuns but I definitely can assume that if it is avoidable by stuns then the stuns would have to land 100% of the time or the pally would most certainly be dead.  I mean if a warrior can't withstand the damage spikes and he has the same AC plus better mitigation and more HP's than a knight class, then how could the knight possibly withstand the same onslaught ?<br>
<br>
Also, on the subject matter of taunt.  My taunts were hitting 80+% of the time.  And this is not a &quot;gimp&quot; situation either.  This was an enchanter that would tash within the first 2 swings of my axe (which I would immediately follow with a taunt) and then slow within the next 6 to 10 seconds (which I would also follow immediately by a taunt).  My taunts were amazing me.  I mean after reading all the stuff on these boards I assumed that at level 64 I certainly wouldn't get more than 6 out of every 10 taunts to hold.  But yet here I was getting like 9 out of 10 to take hold.<br>
<br>
I think Kunthaak is on to something with the timing idea - I mean that was basically what I was doing - timing my taunts to be as soon as I saw the message that the mob was tashed or slowed.  And it was working like a dream.<br>
<br>
Some people in this thread choose to argue with myself or with Kunthaak or with Graal.  I guess you feel like you have to because we seem to be &quot;against you&quot; in this sort of &quot;debate&quot;.  I don't feel like I am against anyone - I'm simply bringing IN-GAME experiences and specific situations to the table to show that some of the nay-sayer views expressed here are very isolated incidents and on the whole I don't see my non-uber warrior with a Windblade as being in any kind of problematic situation where agro is concerned.<br>
<br>
Now the reason I bring up today's group in particular is because of what happened about 2 hours into the group.  We lost our chanter and had to go with a 63 chanter - 2 levels lower than the 65.  Of course when we asked the 63 chanter to come to DG he had just gotten a shouted invite to OC about 2 seconds before I sent my ooc invite.  What is interesting is that he messaged me and asked who our tank was.  I told him it was me - the 64 ogre war.  He immediately asked if I could hold agro well.  I explained to him that no one in the group had died yet (left out the 2 deaths I had cause they were not agro related - but rather afk/RL related).<br>
<br>
He decided to come to our camp (no idea why) and he really tried his hardest to get some agro.  He's one of those chanters that uses his pet to add to DPS.  Needless to say he was fairly impressed with me... probly thought a warrior couldn't hold agro.  He was tashing within the first few swings, slowing as soon as the spell timer recovered, then boggling, and then DOT'ing the mob.  Now some times he took a hit, some times I hit taunt before the mob's weapon delay.  There were even times he would sit down right after casting slow or the DOT and the mob would stick to me.<br>
<br>
There were a few fights where his pet did not attack because, try as he might, my taunts were outdoing the tash/slow/DoT strategy he was using and he could not take a hit from the mob.  It almost became a game with us after a while because he relaxed and realized he was not going to die in this group.<br>
<br>
Of course on the times that taunt would fail I would simply hit my shield hotkey (which is /assist followed by /shield) and the caster would be safe.  Granted we had to be slightly more careful when I was in defensive for a golem pull.... but then again there was no need to slow as quickly because I simply asked the healer to hit me with an elixir before I engaged the mob.  Problem solved - even unslowed the golems couldn't do much to me in defensive with an elixir going.<br>
<br>
Ok so I posted another HUGE post again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Sorry.....<br>
<br>
Hopefully I have illustrated yet another situation where a warrior can give a sense of security to an exp group on the edge through the strategic use of defensive and shield while also explaining the strategic timing of the taunt key as I used it in the field.  I agree with Graal and Kunthaak on many points (hope I spelled both their names right) and I think we should all listen to actual in-game experiences before we attempt to pick apart and criticise a game engine that may be far more well-balanced than one would like to believe.<br>
<br>
I'm just an average geared warrior with 2 AA's at level 64 that has never been turned down for a group that a pally got into nor have I ever had someone tell me the exp was going too slowly.<br>
<br>
~Ninaor<br>
<br>
p.s. Later on in the night I was helping 4 more guildies get flagged in trials.  There was another group there that is very similar to the groups I have been in all 10 times I have beaten trials between level 60 and 64.  That group failed all night long try after try.  My group entered trials 3 times, and succeeded 3 times.  The MT for the other group was a 62 Troll SK.  He kept dying during the fight with the executioner and the rogue just could not tank him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The only time I ever died to the executioner was on a lucky string of hits he got back when I was level 60.<br>
<br>
Coincidence?  Or could it be that the warrior really is a better overall tank and these extreme situations just bring out that point?<br>
<br>
Sorry for any gramatical errors... it's damn late and there is NO WAY I'm going back over all this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I play a shadowknight, and i generate taunt on the pull so that warrior can taunt off me - instead of taunting off a enc/shaman etc. If i pull this works well, if i taunt off the puller on inc then warriors taunts off me that works also.<br>
<br>
Sometimes warriors cant be bothered to work properly, dont know how agro works, dont have the right equip to balance out or doesnt know how to work with the group.<br>
<br>
The most common is that the warrior doesnt know how to work with the group or equally as strong people in the group dont work with the warrior, it's a two way street and once you get on the same side it flows smoothly.<br>
<br>
I dont think it's a major equipment issue, i know people who tank/taunt fine without EB type wepons, it is harder but can be done.<br>
<br>
I will say that i am not uber, and here is my magelo to prove it: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=373940">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=373940</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> It probably has some lacking AA i forgot to add - but with that setup i tank golems fine, i can heal through a slowed golem completely on my own but it burns mana, if a shaman takes a few hits on ping/pong i heal with group tap anyway so one or two taps fills them up. It is ok for a mob to ping/pong now and again - if it happens all the time something is causeing it so evaulate if you can/need/want to stop that happenning or is it more efficent to say sod it and carry on.<br>
<br>
A good warrior can let me do a lot more DPS - an bad warrior can drop me around 2000 damage through spells per standard Valor mob, if i snare its closer to 2500-3000 damage depending how long it lives, then throw in melee DPS lost because i had to turn off attack or backout.<br>
<br>
Any good group will pick a warrior to tank if they know they are not going to loose significant DPS - The fact is if i dont want to group with warriors i dont know because i loose to much DPS, then other classes must feel simular.. there are some class act warriors who taunt out there and do not have hate procing wepons, they taunt because they work with the group and learn to fit.<br>
<br>
Anyways, i dont mean to sound negative, but i love it when i have a fine warrior tanking so i can do DPS - but when i cant find those warriors i cring at haveing anyone else... and about the thing about warriors only getting a group unless it's a friend, guild or well known - thats the same for any class, a bad or exceptionaly good cleric, overnukeing wizard or wizard who is know for spotless evac timing, the monk that pulls good or the monk that trains you all... It's the same for every class not just warriors.<br>

However, I'm not sure if this could be avoided by stuns but I definitely can assume that if it is avoidable by stuns then the stuns would have to land 100% of the time or the pally would most certainly be dead. I mean if a warrior can't withstand the damage spikes and he has the same AC plus better mitigation and more HP's than a knight class, then how could the knight possibly withstand the same onslaught ?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Stuns do help, usually. Being able to stop an unslowed mob from swinging from 1-4 seconds is very, very nice early in the fight. I only have 1 stun that will actually stun 60+ mobs though and it has a long recast time and relatively high mana cost - I still love it though. It is fast casting (high fizzle rate, but nothing is perfect) and if I can channel it through it buys me a little more time. <br>
<br>
I don't really think warriors have better mitigation than a knight with the same AC. They will have slightly better avoidance from higher D/P/R caps, but it isn't anything really noticeable except through parses, I would imagine. The main difference is the hp differential between a warrior and a knight of the same level/gear more than anything else, IMHO. Other than disc defensive, which as Glatius rightly pointed out, isn't really something to rely on for each mob. That being said, it sure as hell is nice to have for the situations that need it. The same can be said for LoH and HT too, of course. LoH and HT generally won't allow a knight to tank something that would defensive would allow an equivalent level/geared warrior too tank.<br>
<br>
Knights can and do tank the golems in PoV just fine, it just requires a bit better gear than a warrior would need to tank at the same level with the same healing support, barring the constant use of defensive. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also, on the subject matter of taunt. My taunts were hitting 80+% of the time. And this is not a &quot;gimp&quot; situation either. This was an enchanter that would tash within the first 2 swings of my axe (which I would immediately follow with a taunt) and then slow within the next 6 to 10 seconds (which I would also follow immediately by a taunt). My taunts were amazing me. I mean after reading all the stuff on these boards I assumed that at level 64 I certainly wouldn't get more than 6 out of every 10 taunts to hold. But yet here I was getting like 9 out of 10 to take hold.<br>
<br>
I think Kunthaak is on to something with the timing idea - I mean that was basically what I was doing - timing my taunts to be as soon as I saw the message that the mob was tashed or slowed. And it was working like a dream.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'll be honest and say that I stopped giving the argument that warrior taunt is broken as much credence when I saw the overwhelming reply to the &quot;Are you a masher?&quot; poll. That poll, along with some in game experiences (including a 3 hour xp session that included the use of no stuns, just the taunt button) made me to come to the conclusion that some people are exaggerating the problem wildly, not realizing the benefits a warrior has over a knight, and/or simply do not understand how to use the taunt skill. <br>
<br>
Every time I've been grouped with a warrior in PoV it has been a matter of course that the warrior is the tank. It isn't even discussed. There is no comparison of level, AC, or hp. It's a warrior, he's the tank. Period. I personally prefer that, since it allows me to use my spells to produce actual benefits like crowd control and healing instead of having to use the majority of my mana maintaining aggro.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And Graal, while your groups may never have tried the PoS giants, my groups have. And I die about half the time because the Clerics can't compensate for how hard the giants hit, even with slowed. I would never want to face one of those things for more than a few split seconds unslowed, I'm already dying fairly regularly with them slowed. Maybe it's just bad luck or bad Clerics, but it happens.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The point I have been trying to make is that if it is borderline for a warrior to tank, it is undoable by an equal level/gear knight with the same healing support. If you were dying half the time, it likely would have been 75-90% of the time for me, at best. Most likely, an equal level/geared knight simply wouldn't be able to do it at all with the same healing support. And to be completely honest, while I think that sucks (for me), I also know that there is a valid reason for that. I just think you underestimate how important that advantage is.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686">Graal MacBladefury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Tanking something that is going to kill me about half the time is not a particularly valid experience group situation.  Yes, I can do it, if I'm willing to throw the dice and lose.  But that doesn't really move the experience bar much.  So other than saying we did it or to try and gather quest pieces, it sure isn't something I'd want to do regularly.  I'll grant you my chances of surviving are better than yours, but they aren't good enough to make it a particularly desireable activity. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
Personally, I got my quest pieces when my guild took a couple of groups into PoS regularly specifically to get quest pieces.  Two groups have a much better chance of succeeding than one.<br>
<br>
Could I have gotten them without the guild help with one very solid group?  Yes, probably.   It would have entailed some willingness to bite it a number of times though, in all likelihood.<br>
<br>
And again, this is one case.  It's more of a mini-raid than it is an experience group scenario.  It's certainly not something that people who are looking to grind out the greatest amount of experience in the shortest period of time are going to want to do.  It's a quest.  Nor is it all that common a scenario.<br>

What warrior gets to 65 without knowing when to taunt?  If taunt worked a significant percentage of the time then timing your taunt would make a big difference.  When it works 20% of the time then timing your taunt means that you'll get aggro anywhere from right when you want it to about 30 seconds after you needed it.  <br>
<br>
I never taunt if I have aggro, I save it until I lose aggro.  If I fail 2 or 3 taunts in a row I use AE taunt.  Once AE taunt has been used if I fail 2 or 3 taunts in a row my only option is /shield.  It's not all doom and gloom.  Most of the time I DO get aggro within a few seconds due to either a successful taunt or an EB proc.  <br>
<br>
The arguement still stands that knights are more efficient tanks because of the huge importance of aggro control in PoP.  Our lack of aggro control used to be justified by vastly superior tanking ability.  That vastly superior tanking ability has shrunk to almost nothing unless we use defensive.  Because of that our lack of aggro control is no longer justified.<br>
<br>
Can any knight say they would honestly give up all their spells plus LoH/HT for a 20% melee DPS boost, an extra 700 hps, a 1.5% avoidance boost, and defensive?  Hell, let's make it even easier.  How many would agree to changing the aggro on all their spells to 0 in exchange for the above boost?  Not many I'd wager. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=472195">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I'm sorry, but I have to question either your motives or your intelligence for posting that, unless of course, it is just casuistry. Basically you are asking would a paladin/SK want to have all of the benefits of a warrior AND our spells with the only price being no aggro on our spells. If it weren't for class balance I would say hell yes. <br>
<br>
Like I said to Glatius earlier: exaggerate much?<br>
<br>
EDIT: and just to show how pathetic this whole argument is...I have played a handful of times in the past 5 months, and I have a ready made group waiting for me if I do decide to log in. The only reason I have played the few times I have is because my wife has whined that her group needed a tank and/or she informed me that there was someone on that I hadn't talked to in a long time. I have absolutely nothing to gain from this argument either way. It won't affect my chances of getting a group (which are, and will remain 100%), it won't affect my ability to act as tank for the groups my wife needs me to tank for. It MIGHT affect the ability of other knights to get a group. It MIGHT affect the overall health of the game. <br>
<br>
The fact that I'm bored at work and making these posts isn't a strong indication of my sanity, but oh well. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686">Graal MacBladefury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Up until that point knights were a joke when it came to DPS.  I mean 2h slashing and blunt just could not come close to keeping pace with two 1h slashers.  What did this mean?  More agro from constantly attacking the mob plus more agro from the increased DPS.<br>
<br>
And if a pally or SK switched to 1hander + shield ?  Well, even worse DPS.<br>
<br>
So let me ask you all this - if the pallies and SK's of today had to deal with the CRAPPY DPS of the old 2hander bonuses do you guys think they would be able to hold agro as well?  Also, would they be as desirable in groups ?  Would they EVER even be CONSIDERED for trials ?<br>
<br>
When 2h slashing was made DPS king, nothing was changed to avert the issue of taunting.  Now we have to either proc consistantly (which is theoretically impossible) OR we have to use a windblade like every knight in EQ.  When we use the Windblade we are attacking very slowly which means less attention from the mob based on how many times you attack it per second.  Additionally, we are now doing marginally higher DPS than the knight and therefore it is simple for him/her to draw agro with a high agro spell.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think when 2h damage bonuses were raised ridiculously high that was when the problems REALLY started for the warriors in the area of taunt and desirability.<br>
<br>
I'm sure this has probably been said on these boards many times in the past but I only recently (about a month ago) found these boards and haven't had a chance to look back.  Also, it has not been mentioned in this particular thread yet so I thought I would bring it up and see if all you warriors and hybrids would agree.<br>
