Force of Akilae is a grand total of 65 mana.  Casting it twice is 130 mana.  A so so geared Paladin at level 65 will have upwards of 2700 mana.  Without KIE at all a Paladin could cast 41 Force of Akilae before running OOM.  At two Force of Akilas per mob, that is 20 mobs that would go down if a so so geared Paladin used their mana for nothing but stuns.  With KEI, that number climbs dramatically.<br>
<br>
The only time a Paladin with KEI is liable to go oom is if they are casting significantly more than 2 stuns per mob or if they're using their mana for other things, such as heals.<br>
<br>
This mana thing you claim is such a restriction, isn't much of a restriction at all. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

No, but I do feel that I have a right to expain why I arrived at my opinion.  In my opinion, the problem is not as severe as some make it out to be.  I do not expect you to miraculously change your view, I only am trying to explain my view.<br>

Not going to quote your whole last paragraph, it is long.  You make some good points, and as I have said, I DO feel that there is a balance issue, and that it needs to be addressed.  My only point of contention is that I do also feel(and a number of others as well in this thread) that the problem is not as extreme, that while things are tougher for us, they are not impossible.  If you followed up a couple posts earlier, you will see me saying that I do hope for a change, and do feel it is neccessary.  6 pages to this thread now, I think I can see how you may have missed that.<br>

I shot off my mouth, and managed to generate a large amount of agro in a hurry.  I was angered at something some one said, that I felt ridiculed those of us who do not have the high end VT gear, and managed to stick my foot in my mouth.

Most Paladins I know, and Sks too for that matter, will be OOM after about 40 - 60 minutes of non-stop pulling....to suggest that 2 stuns will keep aggro in an xp group is a specious argument - one for the incoming, one after debuff and one after slow would be a minimum - not too mention pulling aggro off monk/rogue, over nukes, resists to slow/debuff, gating mobs, CH'ing mobs etc etc etc....I am sure that 2 stuns per fight DOES happen, but I suggest that it is not the norm.

<br>
I don't deny there have been times when I have wished I had a better method of attracting a mob's aggro than /taunt, /beg, /disarm and /pray for proc.....but there are work arounds to most situations.<br>
<br>
You need a plate melee class to take aggro and tank, and 3 fit the bill....I don't believe that Sk's and Paladins are so far superior to warriors in PoP that a group would rather sit and do nothing than grab the LFG Warrior.  <p><br>

<br>
Firstly, I guess you weren't aware of it, but paladins can't cast KEI. Yes, it is fairly ubiquitous, but you can't simply claim that all paladins will have it all the time.<br>
<br>
Secondly, yes it is much easier to get aggro as a paladin or shadow knight. Does that necessarily mean that there is an imbalance? No it does not. You can argue that it does and provide meaningful points supporting that argument, but it hasn't been made yet.<br>
<br>
As several people have said here, groups simply take the first tank that is available. There are exceptions, of course. The vast majority of those exceptions are to the benefit of warriors. I think I asked you a question once and you hemmed and hawwed without answering: Have you ever heard of an experience group say &quot;We can't do that, we don't have a (paladin/shadow knight)&quot;? Have you ever heard of a raid break up because there were no paladins or shadowknights there?<br>
<br>
At the very high levels fighting against very high damage output mobs, efficiency in tanking generally isn't as important as whether the tank can survive between heals. Anything that is borderline hard for a warrior without defensive is going to be undoable for a knight of the same level of gear. Add in defensive and there are many situations in which a knight simply can NOT do the tanking of a warrior with markedly inferior gear. Some of those situations are with normal experience groups...at least the ones that push the limit. Generally, you can't just take a lesser tank and just take a hit to efficiency...you simply can't do the task. I'd be happy if I could tank vindi with the same amount of clerics as a lesser equipped warrior and the only difference would be greater downtime afterward.<br>
<br>
Is the aggro advantage of knights too much of a counterbalance to warrior's tanking superiority? I don't know. I do know that warriors simply are NOT having problems getting groups relative to the other plate class tanks. That is an enormous fallacy. I KNOW what it is like to not be able to find groups. I remember many times seeing a group shouting for a tank, sending a tell &quot;level X paladin&quot; and getting told &quot;I said tank, not paladin&quot;. There is actual parity for once in tanking for xp groups. I'm sorry you guys aren't happy with that. Maybe things have changed drastically in the 2 and a half months since I last played, but I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Zone into PoV, /ooc camp check, take down the names that answer. Send a tell to one person from each group and ask who is tanking for them. I bet if you did that enough times you find a pretty evenly spread mix warrior, shadowknight, paladin. If an even spread isn't good enough for you, too damn bad.<br>

Chavr on PoN says he typically casts one or two stuns per battle.  And he also claims that allowing Warriors to have the equivalent of one stun's worth of aggro at the beginning of a fight would be completely impossible because it would doom Paladins to oblivion, never to be grouped again.<br>
<br>
Now, you're telling me Paladins are casting a lot more stuns per battle than Chavr claims, who insists that one stun's worth of aggro is far too much for Warriors.  How, preytell, to you balance that the effective aggro of one stun is too much when Paladins are casting more than two stuns per battle to maintain aggro?  Something doesn't jive here.<br>
<br>
You can't on the one hand say, oh Warriors can't have the aggro of one stun, because Paladins typically don't cast more than one or two stuns per battle and then say, oh Paladins are using a lot more mana per battle than two stuns and so we don't have anywhere near the mana you think we do.  These are contradicting points.  They can't both be true at the same time, now can they?  It's one or the other.<br>

It is your perception that the points haven't been made.  It is mine that they have, repeatedly.  Over and over again.  Until people are blue in the face.  You refuse to listen or believe?

Graal, you're an intelligent dorf, I'll give you that.  But do you realize how completely specious this arguement is?  There is a ten minute timer on defensive, I'm sure you know this.  Three minutes of effectiveness with 7 minutes of unavailability.  I find it hard to believe that anyone is doing an experience camp with the intention of only killing for 3 minutes out of every 10.  I've never hunted like this.  No one I know does an experience camp like this.  Most people would be horrified to even consider killing for 3 minutes out of every ten.  What are you thinking?  This makes no sense at all.<br>

Thanks for clearing up our misperceptions about not being able to find a group.  I thought my personal experiences might have some relevance, but now that you've explained it to me, Paladin to Warrior, that I'm not having any trouble finding a group, it's all much clearer now.

For instance, I was recently (at level 62 ogre war) in a group in PoS and we were at the bug/bee/treehouse/whatever you call it camp.  Of course this is next to that forest giant fort with the irmin inside.  Now, the irmin are all level 62 from what I con'd of them and I con'd many - all even con at 62.  My group was basically out there killing forlorn ents, frogs, and of course kovians and senvars (or whatever those bees are called).<br>
<br>
So we are happily exp'ing along with war, cle, shm, mon, rog, enc when we decide to split off an irmin and try him out.  Our monk was a great splitter so we peeled off one of the warrior irmins.  The first hit he did to me I mashed down hard on my DEFENSIVE key and proceeded to live through the encounter.<br>
<br>
We decided to do this a few more times as the night progressed we all got a giant head and nearly all of us got a sash WOOT !<br>
<br>
Keep in mind I was wearing a 40 AC tunic and 22 AC legs (I'm not a twink and I only have SS gloves and 2 SS bracers and SS arms - still in cobalt boots too).<br>
<br>
Find me one pally or SK that could have tanked one of those giants every 10 to 15 minutes without dying and IN CRAPPY GEAR <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and I'll show you someone that was chain runed and used the full 100% of the cleric's mana.<br>

*Disclaimer :  The preceeding situation was meant to illustrate the potential of a low 60's group with a 62 war to push themselves to the limit in a normal exp'ing situation.  At know time were any animals hurt during the production of this text.<br>
<br>
Now this is just one of hundreds of situations (both in exp groups and MOST DEFINITELY on raids) where a warrior can do what no paladin or SK can do - tank above his normal limits and do it with style, never dying, and saving the cleric mana in the process while allowing the group to achieve kills they never could have hoped to achieve without the warrior.<br>
<br>
NOTE :  Before you try to tell me that a paladin or SK could tank one of those irmin every 10 to 15 minutes and the group would still be able to kill 3 or 4 additional &quot;normal&quot; exp mobs between the downtime of the defensive disc.... let me remind you that the irmin warrior-type mobs double (and possibly triple, not sure) for 710 damage.  Please consider this if you have never actually played a level 62 knight at this camp or witnessed this happen.<br>
<br>
I'm betting it simply isn't possible - remember we pulled several (about 10) of these irmin that night and never had a party wipe.<br>
<br>
Food for thought - as always, your milage may vary.<br>
<br>
Warriors are tanks - that's all we can do.  We cannot heal the party or add to attack, AC, HP, mana.  If we are removed from our position as tanks that would be like making a rogue fight hand to hand only or taking the FD skill away from a monk.  We are tanks - so let us tank and stop trying to beat into our heads that we are broken.  We are not broken.<br>
<br>
If we are broken, then the pally's and SK's that cannot tank an irmin at level 62 are also broken.  Let's all go tell them how bad they suck cause they can't tank Vindi or push an exp group beyond its &quot;normal constraints&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Of course, you can be unlucky and fail a taunt roll 3 times in a row on a blue con, but it's pretty rare.<br>
What I find more annoying is the ridiculous success rate on red cons. Seriously, I could replace my taunt button in raid by sense heading, it would have the same effect.<br>

<br>
1. aggro really is a throwback to the lack of collisions in the game. therefore i don't really see it as skill, cuz if there were collisions, there wouldn't be skill. to those that don't know what I mean, if the game had collisions, mobs and players would actually take up physical space, and in order to get past the warrior, the mob would have to either go around him (which he could match space for space), or be forced to go through the warrior (by killing him, or maybe adding some type of grappling rules, i.e. bigger monsters would get bigger bonus's, might be able to knock down the  ). they ditched collisions because one, it requires some server cpu power (monsters making intelligent decisions on how to make pathing around players who may constantly be changing position), and two, it requires alot of bandwidth. so, I don't see aggro as a 'class worthy skill', cuz it's really stupid when you think about it that way. so open your gd eyes and see it what it is b4 u claim it as a 'skill'<br>
<br>
2. it's been mentioned before, but +100hp/mana items really screwed the pure melee classes BAD. sure, sk's/pal's are just 600hp behind, but they are also 5000 mana ahead. this wasn't a big deal when their spell list sucked, but when sk's are lining up half second dd's for 600-1200 that don't interrupt with their weapon delay, and paladins throwing around 600-1200hp heals, that 5000 is no joke. i am NOT suggesting that they get rid of good pal/sk spells or the like, i'm just saying every one of these +hp/mana items everyone gains 200+ points of stats except warriors, rogues, and monks only gained 100, and they had nothing to show for that lack of 100. they need to institute some way for warriors/rogues/monks to gain from +mana items, there are tons of ways of doing it (give them 10% of their mana for hp which you can already kinda see is how Raex is setup compared to like Grilors, have more mana actually shorten discipline reuse time, have mana increase discipline length) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glatius2>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 857<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/15/03 12:26:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ~</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now this is just one of hundreds of situations (both in exp groups and MOST DEFINITELY on raids) where a warrior can do what no paladin or SK can do - tank above his normal limits and do it with style, never dying, and saving the cleric mana in the process while allowing the group to achieve kills they never could have hoped to achieve without the warrior.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hundreds of situations where people are tanking a mob needing defensive every 10-15 minutes?  I don't think so.  You've metioned one situation.  Can you name 5 more?  That is, 5 more situations where defensive would be used every 10-15 minutes by a group to tank a mob that hits so hard a Knight couldn't do the job?<br>

Lets do some spellcasting 101 for our spellcasting-impaired warrior brethren.<br>
<br>
-Even the lowliest spell costs mana... or a considerable time to refresh in the case of &quot;abilities&quot; like Harmtouch and Layhands.<br>
<br>
-Both Paladins and Shadowknights very frequently run out of mana...  and anyone who says it &quot;not a limiting factor&quot; is just proving how stupid they are.<br>
<br>
-Paladins and Shadowknights can aggro very well...  but it costs mana...  so do our heals/lifetaps, buffs/grouptaps, and everything else we cast (excepting only Layhands and Harmtouch)<br>
<br>
-Mana regens at a rate of 1 point per tick(6sec) unbuffed and with no AA's standing and at a variable rate sitting depending on meditation skill...  but meditation is a pointless endeavor as Pal/SK never sit during combat, and rarely get to sit between pulls.  Spells such as KEI and similar spells increase mana regen... but no matter HOW much mana regen a Pal/SK gets from spells/AA, it has never allowed me to cast at will and play more than one role well or two roles less well...  I always have time when I must refrain from casting or have no reserve.<br>
<br>
-Knights use their spells to actually be more than nerfed warrior.  When the mana is gone, the knight is a warrior with lower skillcaps and terrible disciplines, and lesser equipment...  a class no one would want to play.<br>
<br>
-Knights with mana can do some very nice things, and for a short time can use their spells to exceed warriors in one or two areas.<br>
For example, as a shadowknight, I can:<br>
*Feign Death<br>
*Throw nukes/lifetaps between swings to exceed warrior melee damage.<br>
*Make myself a better tank by trying to channel a lifetap or defenisive spell through a mob beating on me (the likelyhood of channeling a spell through is not very good when large amounts of damage are being done to me....)<br>
*increase my party's damage output with ATK taps.<br>
*buff myself to some degree (most of my spells are overwritten by standard group fare however)<br>
*Garner aggro quickly<br>
*KEEP aggro despite other factor<br>
<br>
Note that spells like lifetaps do actually two things at once, both healing and increasing my damage...  but they also cost huge amounts of mana.<br>
<br>
Note, that I can only do a limited amount of those things, AND for a limited time before going OOM.<br>
<br>
I can do some of them at a less-efficient rate to try to keep some mana.. but then I am not going to be better than a warrior anywhere.<br>
<br>
-ALL spellcasters are limited to 8 spell slots at once...  Shadowknights must choose a set of spells to use for each party they are in...  usually chosen by role the group asks them to take.  Yes, we can sit and mem spells, but the fact that memming spells in combat is to say the least difficult... (especially for the SK who is usually puller or tank)<br>
<br>
-The tradeoff is that a warrior can do EVERYTHING they are all the time...  (with the exception of disciplines)  and the combo of more HP, easier attainable better equipment, and better skillcaps....<br>
<br>
<br>
-Lets try an example:<br>
I am tanking for a group, and I choose to go heavy on the taunt spells...  I can maintain aggro and even get it back should I lose it....  but I will be able to throw VERY little in the way of damage spells or lifetaps and actually have the mana to continue my lock on aggro...  IN most cases  most of my damage spells are passed over in favor of spells that do more aggro and less damage.  I load a few lifetaps, but know that throwing them will guarantee the fact I will be OOM in just a few of them. <br>
<br>
I am then asked to pull AND tank...  Due to the mana lost in Feign pulls and the absolute lack of ANY med time at all, I can no longer throw any spells designed for damaghe outside of my aggro spells, and in addition, I can no longer assure the fact aggro is locked anymore...  I CAN outaggro a warrior, but my mana is being stetched...  I am also doing less melee damage overall as I cannot maintain my ATK spells and pull and keep aggro...  If I throw any lifetaps at ALL, I will be OOM in short order...  we WILL have downtime.<br>
<br>
Then we grab a warrior... I am now pulling and can put away my aggro spells (except for voice which I cast on the warrior) I now take more damage spells that confer less aggro and that allow me to deal efficient damage/mana point....<br>
<br>
We get a monk,  and I ask him to pull...  I load up on damage and bardlike spells that aid the party with some bodyguard-like spells in order to grab aggro quickly (mana inefficient, but great for quick grabs)<br>
<br>
ALL of this was with VoQ and as many mana-regen spells as I could find.<br>
<br>
Mana IS a limiting factor....  if you don't know this, then you are VERY misinformed.<br>
<br>
Hybrids use their spells as an addition to their WHOLE...<br>
its not like warriors where every spell cast on you or that you cast yourself is a bonus...  our spells are an integral part of our balance...<br>
<br>
It seems many warriors are misled about mana... thinking its as infinite as their own abilities...  you couldn't be more wrong.<br>
<br>
The grass is not greener...  do some reading please...  nearly EVERY other class claims &quot;I cannot get groups&quot; and &quot;I am broken&quot; and its usually the 60th+ level newbies who are being turned down due to their obvious ebay-ness, (say for those of you who STILL don't know how taunt works) not due to their class weaknesses.<br>
<br>
Warriors DO have issues... this much I and most experienced hybrids will agree with... and aggro is one of them...  I would love to see warriors have some additional ability to add numerical hate that isnt linked to the taunt button. (say perhaps KICK)<br>
<br>
I would love to see experienced warrior and hybrids form a balanced solution...  a little work and some reality checks from both sides would be both fun and interesting...  and it wouldn't be the first time such suggestions were integrated into the game.<br>
<br>
End the exaggeration please...  end the stupid grass is greener...  learn a bit about hybrids before embarassing yourself please.<br>

<br>
Given the mana cost reductions due to AAXP and items and additional mana regen provided other spells such as KEI and the fact that more and more items have mana as one of their stats, mana is far from the limiting factor it once was.  To claim that a knight of any kind can't continue to provide substantially greater aggro control for a prolonged period without running oom is untrue.  If I have a Paladin telling me with authority that all he typically needs is two stuns per battle, are you seriously trying to convince me that every 10-15 minutes you have to be oom?<br>
<br>
Besides, if I can watch a Shadow Knight lock aggro through all the waves of the executioner's trial and still have mana at the end, while the Wizard and Cleric are both oom, it seems that the Knight's mana won't really be the issue.<br>
<br>
And on top of that, I've grouped with Knights who have tanked for hours and the only time they medded for any length of time was when someone needed an afk break or when someone else requested the break for mana.<br>
<br>
No, you can't dot your heart out.  No the Paladin can't heal two or three times every battle.  Yes, you have to use some common sense and hold back a reserve.  But no, you're not mana starved all the time.  Besides, even if you have to hold back on damage output to reserve mana while tanking, your group can open up more on their damage output.  You'll get more damage from 3 DPS classes going full bore than you will from just the damage you could do if you weren't tanking.  So that whole, well I lose DPS, arguement is extremely weak.  When tanking a knight's DPS is almost irrelevant as long as they hold aggro well enough to allow everyone else to do their damage at full or close to full potential.    <br>
<br>
Yes mana is a restriction.  No, mana isn't as big a restriction as it once was and some people would like us to continue to believe.  But hey, thanks for coming over to school us because we don't understand the game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Frankly, your arrogance and patronizing attitude just really piss me off.

Gee, after you go on and on about how unintelligent we are, how we don't understand the game, how we have a hard time even finding the taunt button and so on, you go right ahead and agree with our point.

Sounds very interesting, but I'm not quite sure what you're saying or what you mean by it.<br>
<br>
Please elaborate. Because I never gave mob intangibility much thought after about level 6 or so when one ran through me and I thought to myself &quot;That's not very realistic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Although every now and then I'll be in Luclin and I'll notice that 90 percent of the mob I'm fighting is intangible and it's so-called &quot;hit box&quot; is smaller than a pea. That stretches one's suspension of disbelief when it's a worm half the size of the hallway you're in.<br>

<br>
Ok. If you wanna play scenario, I'm game. Same scenario, low 60s group with a lvl 62 warrior or lvl 62 paladin/SK in equal gear. Let's say you're fighting in desert though. Mob pulled, goes to camp. Shaman attempts to slow. But, oh @#%$, he resists (this happends VERY often in desert. I won't take a shaman under lvl 63, or a chanter under 64 if ever doing desert). Slow gets resisted, guess who that mob is going after. Give you three guesses, and warrior is NOT one of them. That mob is ping-ponging over to the slower (or failed slower). <br>
<br>
Now, here you have a low 60s slower (you damn well better home it's a shaman so they have slightly more HP). But, even then, how long do you think that lvl 60s slower is going to last against a mob thats trippling for around 900 and hits very fast (the her giants are far harder)? I'll give them about 4 seconds. Now, you as a warrior can mash that taunt button, you can yell at it, you can offer hot anal sex for it to work, but it won't. That mob will tear your slower up. And guess what happends when the slower goes down, you better hope you have another one in the group. But, if you don't, then you have a very hard-hitting, and may I add unslowed mob on your ass. Now, it doesn't matter if you're a 62 warrior, or knight, or ranger; your group is dead. <br>

<br>
Actually, yes. I have seen 3 raids break up due to a lack of paladins and Shadowknights. Emperor Ssra and High Priest are two encounters that require add-tanks with the ability to sustain agro without dealing damage. As it so happens, Knights are far better at doing this than warriors, to the extent that warriors simply cannot do this job. Believe me, I've tried. Add-tanking without dealing damage means that the mob switched onto healing clerics constantly.<br>
<br>
Yes, I'll consent that warriors who serve as tanks for raids have a locked down role at a raid. However, warriors not tanking bring far less to a raid than a knight. So, yes, a certain amount of warriors have a set spot on a raid. however, a knight is a more usefull addition to a raid than a non-tanking warrior<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;At the very high levels fighting against very high damage output mobs, efficiency in tanking generally isn't as important as whether the tank can survive between heals. Anything that is borderline hard for a warrior without defensive is going to be undoable for a knight of the same level of gear. Add in defensive and there are many situations in which a knight simply can NOT do the tanking of a warrior with markedly inferior gear. Some of those situations are with normal experience groups...at least the ones that push the limit. Generally, you can't just take a lesser tank and just take a hit to efficiency...you simply can't do the task. I'd be happy if I could tank vindi with the same amount of clerics as a lesser equipped warrior and the only difference would be greater downtime afterward&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
/Disc defensive doesn't get used very often in XP group scenarios. MObs fought in XP groups generally don't require the ability. In an S-O-S scenario, it gets used, kind of like paladin LoH. Efficiency in tanking may not be important, but you damn well better believe that snap agro is.<br>

If you read carefully, you will see that this is the exact claim currently made by warriors in regards to balance. My personal idea is a separate taunt button on a 45 second refresh that give a certain amount of agro.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Wilhelmm D'averam<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Overlord of the Apocalypse</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

I am OOM quite often while uber-taunting... I am not a Paladin expert, but I know for certain that throwing a Darkness or even TWO does not lock aggro.... (especially when its resisted... or mob is immune to movement spells)  The type of aggro control you are taling about is good enough to hold a mob perhaps...  but not LOCK (meaning no matter WHAT is done outside of you...) <br>
<br>
A Shadowknight uses the taunt button very often in this case to grab aggro back just like a warrior should...  a warrior with EB weapons will garner the same aggro or greater aggro with only a moment's pause for the party....  (pre-aggro will never be the warrior's strong suit, as they have no method of garnering aggro at range save for bow damage) permanent LOCK on aggro is only acheived through correct and consistent timing of spells and taunt button useage.  oh, and just for your information, Shadowknights have NO mana cost reductions via AAXP.<br>
<br>
In comparison with a Paladin at my level and in similar gear, Stun and Dark aggro seems similar (neither of us has numbers as we have no way to compare except snap aggro)  Both stun and dark are sometime used against immune mobs...  both of them seem similar in aggro component when reisted or immune...  terror of Thule (100hate/cast less than EB) causes considerably more hate than a resisted/immune snare... and this would be comparable to stun....<br>
<br>
On top of this, everything knights are depend VERY heavily on mana...  note that while uber taunting, I am NOT dealing warrior-level damage (not even warrior from-the-front damage) and I am not as good at taking damage as a warrior and cannot lifetap much...  I am thus giving up everything to be able to taunt the best in the game...  this sounds balanced to me.<br>

Oh sweet.. we can use examples of what we have &quot;seen&quot;?  I have &quot;seen&quot; a warrior tank for 200+aaxp rangers/wizards/rogues and not ever lose aggro...  Yes, I was actually in the group.... and simply could not take aggro from him unless I was intentionally trying to do so.   If I was going by what I have &quot;seen&quot; then warriors need nothing...  this guy was a beast...  of course he also well equipped AAXP'd alongside the party he was fighting with.  The real problems for warriors are in the middle-game.... in endgame, warriors just plain rock.<br>

No, you can't dot your heart out. *snip*...<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
So you got the point that taunt takes mana... yet you have left out the fact that EVERYTHING we can do that warriors cant revolves around mana....  and that I can only do so much due to only 8 spellslots, limited mana, and limited TIME to cast those spells in.  That means we paid for our taunt ability (in this case) with lowered skillcaps, less HP, less available equipment, and near-worthless disciplines.  Its called a tradeoff... <br>
<br>
And yes....  even a Shadowknight with the absolute best equipment and the most FT and manaregen buffs in the game will go LoM in most groups now.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Yes mana is a restriction. No, mana isn't as big a restriction as it once was and some people would like us to continue to believe. But hey, thanks for coming over to school us because we don't understand the game.  <br>

Apparently, even with my attempts to raise you from your ignorance, you refuse to listen to anyone who doesnt agree with your &quot;knights are godly, and warriors are worthless&quot; mantra.  I am simply trying to enlighten you to the fact that the grass you think is greener doesn't exist...  but if you want to, you can stay in your own world and never come and join the game the rest of us play.  You will simply continue to sound like a noobie when you preach your &quot;mana is infinite&quot; school of thought.  I just hate leaving people in ignorance.... but if you want to be stubborn.. fine...  I'll just continue to shoot down your ignorance about hybrids.  It seems your own elders won't shoot down stupidity...  fine... I'll do it.  I am currently entertained.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Frankly, your arrogance and patronizing attitude just really piss me off. I've been playing for 3 years, my Warrior is level 64 and I probably know as much about my class and how it should be played as you know about your class and how it should be played, maybe more. So go shrink that ego man, it's crowding up the place.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
Excellent... I am glad you are moved... maybe you'll realize how rediculous you sound with this whole &quot;infinite mana&quot; theory...<br>
<br>
The sheer fact you aren't 65 yet proves beyond a doubt that you aren't exactly the most imformed warrior... or at least that your time investment is limited for this game.  I have a fiancee, a very busy job, and I just did a server transfer 1 month before PoP...  I was STILL 65 shortly after PoP release and I am raiding in elemental planes killing elemental gods with the guild of my choice...<br>
<br>
Due to your limited level and likely the fact that you ARENT raiding elemental planes due to the fact you don't meet most elemental plane raiding guilds' requirements, I think my long years of experience since BETA and my obviously larger time investment and multiple characters would make me a MUCH better source than your limited experience....   while you aren't a noobie, you are also not as informed or experienced as I am.<br>
<br>
End the dick comparison dude... you were trumped long before you even TRIED to play the card.<br>
<br>

*snip*Got to love people who enjoy listening themselves prattle on so much that even when they agree with the issue, they got to just whip it out and spray all over the place.<br>

<br>
Actually, I came to shoot down your misinformation about hybrids.  I agree with sane and intelligent posts about improving middle-game numerical hate production for warriors, I do not agree with making warriors into the ONLY choice for everything posts... and I'll come and shoot down every lie and overexaggeration that I am entertained to shoot down that is posted thank you...<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
Thanks for stopping by Brik, how about you go back to the SK board and play, k?<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
I will continue to monitor these exaggerations and lies here as it seems necessary... I am hoping that the warrior elders will one day hold in check their ebay/powerlevel-noobies and their uber exaggeration &quot;cheese and whine&quot; groupies by themselves.<br>

QUOTE<br>
I have read the sk boards, they seem to know less about the taunt button than warriors do. They seem to think that by pushing the button at the &quot;right time&quot; taunt will never fail, incredible to say the least.<br>
END QUOTE<br>
<br>
When I find one that says that.. I'll shoot him down.<br>
However, I think we both know this is a bit of &quot;creativity&quot; with someone else's words.  Taunt fails about 20-40% of the time depending on mob level and taunt skill....  and thats with the Shadow Knights lower skillcap.  When I tested it, (elemental PoP mobs) I was actually surprised how often it DOES work.  Shadowknights time spells and melee swings to enhance the effect of TAUNT.  I don't know anyone who claims that the taunt skill works every time.... I only know warriors who have posted suggestions that it work every time for warriors...<br>
<br>
The recent poll here shows that 50% of the people who responded &quot;mash&quot; taunt (meaning every time it comes up)  I, of course, meant those people...  being made 1 hate point ahead doesnt help when you are 300+ hate points ahead...  even if the taunt is never detremental in positional or numerical hate, the fact that you don't have the snap taunt available for when you need it is a big no-no.<br>
<br>
of course, we both know Varaho knew this already... he was just trying (and failing) to twist some words.<br>
<br>
stop the lies and over-exaggerations please...  lets talk about real solutions for the middle-game warrior numerical hate.<br>
<br>
I am thinking EB needs a solid nerf (200 hate or so) and allow the average warrior to add 100-200 hate irresistable(meaning the hate is added regardless of hit or miss) to their KICK button in addition to everything KICK does now.  Warriors would be able to steadily add hate with or without EB weapons...  EB weapons would be helpful, but not required.  Knights would STILL be better at snap-aggro, but due to the fact the warriors need spend NOTHING on this ability, warriors would be quite good at consistent numberical hate generation.<br>
<br>
The numbers for hate/kick would have to be tweaked to make a warrior about as good or slightly better than current warriors with EB weapons...  too much better would overpower warriors to the point of making knights pointless again.<br>
