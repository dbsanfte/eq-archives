<br>
What new evidence. What story changes? =) You are quite interesting -- a conspiracy theorist? Or simply a grumpy codger?<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Look at all those threads. Your being flamed in ALL of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
In fact, Fulorian, we are not being flamed across the board. A few quotes from those threads:<br>
<br>
&quot;The main class boards have some of the best players of the class there. Just by reading here for a while there are a lot of skilled players that post and visit here. Where else would someone go to find out all that they can about their favorite class other than the main class board/site.&quot; -- Cyon Fayte (Mage Board)<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a pity that you've decided to form this interesting guild on Stormhammer. I particularily like your application as it places emphasis on what you know as opposed to who's butt you kiss for membership entrance. Some things that impressed me were your ability to recognize that tactics and communication play a HUGE role in EQ. I cannot tell you how many raids I have been on where the simple process of buffing has taken 1-2 hours. Again a shame you've decided to form this guild on Stormhammer.&quot; -- Buggwin11 (EQ Diva)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Lol! Oh man I almost wanna plunk down the cash for Stormhammer just on the basis of your stick/ball/hole application question. Twistedly creative problem solving being a requirement is just plain attractive!&quot; -- Tsara (EQ Diva)<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, he's looking for Monks and came to the Monk board... seems obvious as reasonable enough to me.&quot; -- Carnagh (Monkly Business)<br>
<br>
&quot;I went and looked at the recruitment page, and they have some very creative requirements. Looks to me like the guild has the right ideas.&quot; -- Goldmund (Monkly Business)<br>
<br>
&quot;I come to this board more than anyother board there is some usefull information. So there is no point in flaming this post. I my self will not respond to it becuase im in a Great Guild already but there are monks out there that are not guilded and are just looking for that special one. This is a great Place to recruit as long as it is done in a good maner.. If you are intrested post other wise just read and move to next post..&quot; -- Dwarwin (Monkly Business)<br>
<br>
&quot;OK maybe it's just me, but I didn't really find the application all that bad. The required reading of &quot;The Art of War&quot; was a nice touch.&quot; -- Sandman (Castersrealm)<br>
<br>
&quot;Good luck on your new guild guys.&quot; -- (Druid's Grove)<br>
<br>
&quot;I gotta admit that's one of the most unique app forms I've ever seen. Damn fine one too. It's a shame so few see what they are trying to accomplish. Good luck with your guild guys.&quot; -- Posted by Raviel Darkfyre (Monkly Business)<br>
<br>
<br>
Hardly across the board flames as you seem to indicate. If you're going to flame, Fulorian, please be truthful at the very least. Also, I'm waiting for you to back this claim up: &quot;I'm afraid you guys just don't understand how things work, and attack me to protect your visions of grandeur.&quot;<br>
<br>
Please show me the attacks. I'm being incredibly patient defending myself against someone who seems quite hell-bent on flaming me. I'll leave you with one last bit of evidence proving your pyromanic tendencies:<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm asking logical questions on your guild anyways, and you take it as a personal attack.&quot; -- Posted by Fulorian on (4/7/02 10:16:54 am) to Steel Warrior Forums.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your cut and pasting your arguments frm the Steel Warrior forums here? Pathetic.&quot; -- Posted by Fulorian on (4/6/02 2:00:51 pm) to the Safehouse Forums.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's just me, but calling someone &quot;pathetic&quot; doesn't feel like a logical argument to me. Furthermore, calling someone pathetic (a flame) and then saying that you are not flaming a day after doing so sure smacks of dishonesty. <br>
<br>
I'm going to ask you to try to stick to the topic at hand. I have successfully rebutted every one of your attempts at &quot;logic&quot;, and now you are getting increasingly confrontational. I'm going to have to put you on /ignore if you continue to run us around in circles like this. <br>

<br>
Get 10-12 friends togetther and start a guild.  If your decent you will attract more.  If you stink you'll go the way of the other 10 guilds a week that die.<br>
<br>
Spamming all the boards just makes you look like a bunch of noobs/ebay commandos.

<br>
(1) We posted a SINGLE message to each class board. One message does not constitute spam. Thanks.<br>
<br>
(2) People DO care and we've gotten quite a bit of public and private feedback both positive and negative. If you don't care, as you allege, why post to this thread?<br>
<br>
(3) Nothing could be further from the truth on the &quot;ebay commando&quot; comment. There *are* many ebayed toons in this game now, and our application form is designed to keep them out.<br>
<br>
As a recent poster to Monkly-Business noted:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> All in all, I really cannot see why so many are getting their panties in a bunch. It is EQ related unlike many other topics I have seen.<br>

Anyhow, I think I am surprised to see that this is the first attempt at this sort of guild formation (talking about their requirements). If they get the attention and the people we might be hearing a lot of this 'future' guild.<br>

<br>
I hate spam.<br>
<br>
But, by the definition of spam:<br>
&quot;To send (a message) indiscriminately to multiple mailing lists, individuals, or newsgroups.&quot;<br>
<br>
The key word here is &quot;indiscriminately&quot;, not &quot;multiple&quot;.<br>
<br>
Spam is not cross, dupe, or multiposting.<br>
<br>
Cross, dupe or multiposting is evil in and of itself, however.  The evil it carries is +alot+ less than Spam.<br>
<br>
The reaction to it is generally overstrong, and based off the fact that the majority of cross/dupe/multiposts are indeed Spam.<br>
<br>
From what I can tell, this person actually looked for good class discussion forums.  Now, this person still sinned -- ey posted without becoming a regular (on at least 2 forums), and possibly did in the wrong subsection of the forum.  Such posts can and will clog up forums.<br>
<br>
Wierdly, on the surface, the guild posted looks like a decent attempt.  Probably over organized, if they aren't careful.  Important things that is missing is &quot;hours per night&quot; and &quot;timezone&quot; -- the timezone and time commitment of guilds has a massive effect on a guilds culture.<br>

It's one thread among many. Okay, maybe two or three threads among many, including the one(s) you yourself started relating to this topic. Not that big of a deal. <br>
<br>
If this was indeed a big problem, people would speak up, as they did with the, err, well, you-know-what shortly before mods were assigned. Let Xexys do his job - he'll keep this place in good order. <p><html><body>

Thanks guys. This *is* the premiere warrior forum -- I can't think of a better place to find the most knowledgeable warriors. If you were to read our server boards you'd know that they have got a LONG way to go before they're a viable means of recruiting the types that we need.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a quick response to an earlier poster: we do ask for time zone, but you're right that we don't ask for time played. That's pretty important actually and I'm trying to strike a balance between mandating a minimum number of hours per week (people kinda hate such mandates) and actually being able to field raids properly. Balance, balance.<br>

I don't know Ful and honestly, probably wouldn't even if I was from Xegony.  However, I do get marginally annoyed by threads like this.  On the whole, though, I don't care either way frankly since I live on Test and cannot be transferred anywhere.<br>
<br>
Yes, I think this is one big, pathetic infomercial.  I do believe, by definition it is spam, or at the very least, the poster has gone out of their way to spam us.  I also believe that the posters desire to elicit an argumentative stance lends discredit to his original post (i.e., even if I was in a position of considering a transfer, and I was so incompetent and desperate for a guild as to engage in thinking of this option, after watching the thread starter &quot;defend&quot; his ability to spam, I would no longer consider this a viable option.)<br>
<br>
Having said all that, I do agree with Isk that it is one in several hundred.  We've seen maybe two of these types in the last few months.  I think the general attitude of avoidance might discourage future posts and being from a server where the population polices itself, I don't think that any warriors objections are insignificant.  If we do not encourage these hacks, they will not persist.<br>
