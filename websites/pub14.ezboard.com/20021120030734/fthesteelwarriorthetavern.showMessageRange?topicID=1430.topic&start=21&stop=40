What do u t</span><hr size=1> Well, I'll start off by saying that I'm a pally (/cringe)...and here's my opinions:<br>
<br>
Damage mitigation:  Warriors should be on thier own dmg mitigation table, which is superior to pal/sk.  As far as undead, I don't really think that should affect mitigation, but certainly dps.  If at any time hybrids took less damage from mob_001 then warriors would have nothing to do but stand there hoping the CH chain doesn't break.  Warriors should tank better than any other class, all the time...period.  <br>
<br>
Aggro:  It's really fukkered.  All I have to do is cast a lvl 9 spell and a lvl 15 spell, and my job is pretty much done.  No matter how crappy my equipment may be.  Hell, I could probably outaggro the typical warrior, without ever hitting attack.  In normal xp groups, without high-end proccing weaps, warriors are quite often chasing mobs down, while thier casters are getting whacked.  Doesn't make much sense, and warriors dont have many options, but to lower thier dps to get proccing weaps.  (This is excluding the top 5% of warrior 1handers).  Either make taunt a hell of a lot more effective, or give warriors something unique.  I don't know many people who wouldn't rather have a knight as thier xp tank.<br>
<br>
Disciplines:   I'm expecting hybrids to flame me for this, but I don't think we should get any sort of mitigation discipline.  Holyforge (undead crits) and Sanctification (situational spell immunity), while rather useless, make sense, but pure melee should rule this department.  Disciplines should be on different time tables as well.  Like someone said on the PoN boards lately, warriors rarely use any of thier offensive desciplines due to the fact that they have long refresh times, and they just might need one of thier defensive discs.  It's the same way with our LoH, noone's going to use it as a heal, just because it's up...it's an oh @#%$ sorta thing.<br>
Summary:  Unlike most paladins (from what I read on PoN)  I'm perfectly happy with my character, and the experiences I have.  Do I wish I had a strong raid role?  of course.  Do I wish I could BS, MB, FD, and CH?  sure.  But I've got a hell of a lot more options than alot of classes, warriors especially.  <br>
I apologize if this topic has already been beaten into the ground, but I hate it when paladins whine. <p><font size = 4 color = cyan> Darkgecko Notgeico<BR> <font size = 2 color = black> 55 Knight of Karana<BR>Spawn of Veeshan<BR>Bristlebane Server<BR> <font size = 2 color = blue> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=396867">My Equipment</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ubalidin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balidin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/18/02 7:09:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://saedyan.freeservers.com/images/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tank balanceing from a old outdated paladin.

<br>
Paladins are not in a situation where they can never tank anything though, are they?  In fact, along with Shadow Knights, they are in fact the second best tank class in the game now?  Can you refute that?<br>
<br>
And can you refute that with stun it is possible for a Paladin to hold agro pretty securely, even with the recent stun changes?  Can you say in all truth and honesty (remember, you're a Paladin) that Paladins do not hold agro better than Warriors in those situations where stun does work?<br>
<br>
This is the real, valid comparison.  Warriors tank slightly better than Paladins, true.  Paladins hold agro slightly better than Warriors (some would argue significantly better, but recent stun changes make that debateable), true.  Warriors have slightly higher DPS than Paladins (somewhere between 5% to 20% better depending on a lot of variables), true.  Paladins have buffs and heals and some additional utility spells (root and flash of light do have their uses) that Warriors don't, true.<br>
<br>
What I see is two areas where Warriors have an edge over Paladins.  Damage absorptions (tanking) and damage dealing (DPS). <br>
<br>
I also see two areas where Paladins have an edge over Warriors.  Agro control (stuns)  and heals/buffs/spell utility.<br>
<br>
Asking Warriors to give up one of their areas of superiority in certain circumstances while not losing one of your areas of superiority in return is unreasonable.  Asking for additional upgrades and areas of superiority in addition borders on the asinine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 927<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/18/02 7:41:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tank balanceing from a old outdated paladin.

<br>
Yes. Basically. If you are still living in this notion that a paladin's only role is to tank, you sir are a moron. Let me explain something to paladins that keep trolling these boards screaming to have their raid role be defined as tanking:<br>
<br>
Hybrids are a class based on VERSATILITY. Versatility = no defined roles. What's a beastlord's role on a raid? A ranger's? Necro? Shadowknight? Paladin? Druids for that matter? Shaman on certain raids? <br>
<br>
Why do those classes not have defined raid roles? Because they are multi-purpose, they are &quot;renaissance&quot; classes. Each class can fulfill multiple purposes on a raid, and therefore are not restricted to any specific role. This is actually better in my opinion than having a very specific role on a raid. Example, if you have a raid with enough warriors tanking (which could actually mean only 1 or 2 warriors); the other warriors are basically dead weight with ensurance. If you have a raid with enough chanters to haste/kei; enchanters are basically dead weight.<br>
<br>
As to what roles paladins specifically hold on raids. Let me explain then:<br>
<br>
- If you don't believe in the effectiveness of paladin healing, then you've never fought a real AoE mob. If you have, you'd know that the two classes who make AoE raids (besides tank/cleric rotation that is) are Paladins (Wave of Prexuss) and SHamans (torpor). Understand this very clearly.<br>
- If you want further proof; if you've never fought a mob who hits for massive damage, with low delay and flurries, then you don't know the usefulness of paladin LoH. make no mistake; LoH is detremental when a tank first engages such a mob, when the rotation hasn't hit him yet.<br>
- If you don't believe in paladin DPS, then you have never been on a raid with a good paladin. Good paladins parse out sick damage; plain and simple. <br>
- If you don't believe paladins tank well, see above.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, your versatility more than compensates for your lack of being the best raid tank. It did before the HP % and damage % difference between warriors and knight was decreased. You damn well better believe it more than compensates for 700hp  and disc defensive, along with approximately 5% more damage output. <br>
<br>
P.S.; warriors want to get rid of /disc defensive only if we are put on separate damage mitigation tables where we mitigate about 15-20% better than any other classes. Otherwise, what are we but knight without the versatility and ability to gank agro, with 700 more HP. <p><center><p><font size = 3 colo = "blue"><b>Wilhelmm D'Averam<br>Warlord of the Apocalypse</b></font></p></center>

What do u t</span><hr size=1> First off, Dark just because you have a paly twink doesn't mean you're a paly and not a warrior.  I've never seen you over the PoN boards and this be your first post here.  Seems to me chances are you're a warrior with a paly twink.<br>
<br>
Second off as to the arrgo control issue?  Seems guilds don't routinely go on raids to out fit their paladins with the best arrgoing weapons in all of everquest.  Until recently we were ok with this because our spells could make up the difference.  <br>
<br>
What I like is how all the warriors here say that paladins own you in exp groups and how warriors want greater dps and for their weapons to do different things.<br>
<br>
I propose you warriors gaining desirability in 50-60% of the exp groups in trade for pal/sk getting roles in 35% of the raids and tanking in 20% of the raids in trade for making groups easier for you to get.  I'm told it's not enough for you.<br>
<br>
I propose you doing more damage and again I'm told it's not enough<br>
<br>
I propose you getting more utility from your weapons and again I'm told it's not enough.<br>
<br>
I'm surprised you don't ask for the following discipline <br>
Name True Warrior<br>
Duration 1 hours<br>
Reuse instant<br>
Effect.  Same as DA of paladins only it allows for warriors to attack while it's in effect.<br>
<br>
There, one simple discipline and warriors can finally get what they want. Oh and just to make it &quot;fair&quot; for all warriors it should be a innate dis like paladin's LH and start at first level.<br>
<br>

 <br>
Edit: Clerics AoE heal far better then paladins only we paladins can't stand being clerics and by the look of meleeing clerics neither can they.  Shaman no define raid role?  slow?  Necros summon corpses, Druids are the ones taxiing people to the raid cause they got sow and cross zone evacs.  many classes have roles and if vi makes paladins the best AoE healers then perhaps wearing my healing hat at raids would have me feel I'd better server the raid if I had a cleric twink.  Yes LH can save a raid but it doesn't stop the raid if no palies show. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/useventhsword.showPublicProfile?language=EN>seventhsword</A> at: 10/18/02 8:15:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ustrikingone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StrikingOne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/18/02 8:54:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tank balanceing from a old outdated paladin.

What do u t</span><hr size=1> This has been hashed out over and over and I think it's pretty pointless to discuss this yet again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Paladins have the ability to tank, but in no way should we ever be better then a warrior at it.  If there is a seperate mitigation table then knights should be included, but at a lower level then warriors.  Paladins have many useful abilities thanks to spells and I don't think we have to worry about a role as tank.  I don't think a boost to dps should be done, but I do think better wpns should be made available earlier.  I'm still sporting my epic because it's hard as heck to find telk up and alive by the time my guild is online in force to take him out.  Hopefully PoP will provide a way to up my dps though.  There is a large gap between epic and the next tier of wpns for paladins.  That is neither here nor there though.<br>
<br>
Basically the only thing I can think of that is troublesome for paladins is our selection of heals for PoP.  If we can get a satisfactory list of spells then I don't see any need to alter much about us at all.  Some usefull disc's would be good, but that is not a huge thing anyway. <p><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94313>Chavr Wyrmbane</a><br>

If they had facts they could demonstrate how letting three classes tank a bunch of stuff was &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;unfun&quot; or what ever the accusation is for not allowing it.   If they thought my post had not enough merit to even respond to then they'd simply ignore it.<br>

However trying to derail a thread with mindless jibber is the act of a coward who has no place to run.  <br>

Paladins are a holy breed that would be hurt by<br>
the forces of evil to a greater degree, even though<br>
they can do more damage to their evil foes.<br>
<br>
SKs would be less tainted by the blows of the undead,<br>
but would lack a holy nights ability to damage them.<br>
There spells should be of great harm to the living,<br>
not the undead.  They cannot master the undead for<br>
they themselves, live, and breed with the power that<br>
has mastered them.<br>
<br>
Warriors are the masters of tank, living or dead.<br>
Spells bounce off them, they do not wiggle their<br>
fingers in combat.  They slash, bash, and grind<br>
there way through the enemy.  They have no<br>
penalty to the foe they fight, nor reap in the<br>
spells they find lying on their victim.<br>
<br>
Paladins should be able to damage undead more with spell/melee combo.<br>
Paladins should damage living with normal melee.<br>
Paladins should take more damage from undead.<br>
Paladins should suffer slight less damage from living.<br>
<br>
SKs should be able to damage living more with spell/melee combo.<br>
SKs should damage undead with normal melee.<br>
SKs should take less damage from undead.<br>
SKs should take more damage from the living.<br>
<br>
Warriors should be able to do better melee damage on living and undead than either SK or Paladin, because we have no use for spells.<br>
Warriors should take little damage from undead.<br>
Warriors should take little damage from living. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udobbanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dobbanz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 305<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/18/02 12:54:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tank balanceing from a old outdated paladin. What do u t</span><hr size=1> Because you started this thread with mindess gibbering seventh. Paladins are supposed to be inferior tanks to warriors.  Remember that spell book you have? That is why you are supposed to be a worse tank when compared to warriors. Thats ALL the time btw, not 60%, not 20% ALL the time. You ARE supposed to be decent tanks though. The problem is that Verant overcompensated when they brought you back up in power from when hybrid classes sucked.<br>
As for pizza, I make my own so no idea whether chicago is better than new york. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
