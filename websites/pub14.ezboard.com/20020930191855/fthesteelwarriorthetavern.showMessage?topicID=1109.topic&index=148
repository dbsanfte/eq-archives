I do agree that fixing Warriors as a class is better than an item fix.<br>
<br>
I do think that using a shield may have possibilities, but  they would have to add some warrior only skills to make it good.<br>
<br>
I imagine that PoP will be different once again.  Every new expansion everybody changes.  Sometimes warriors get better, sometimes worse.  Here is hoping for better... <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20383">Hulanta</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uorcmauler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Orcmauler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/22/02 12:47:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=149>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   what about....</span><hr size=1> The non tall races, humans, dorfs, etc...

@#%$ at the moment mainhanding a frosty, I rarely am able to taunt off Sk's/Paladins/monks etc. w/o them either feigning or switching their attacks.  <br>
<br>
As much as I like the idea of introducing some &quot;flavor&quot; into the mix so that every warrior isnt dual wielding the taunt combo of the day, I think they need to do some serious looking into our dps, TAUNT, and damage mitigation before they introduce something into the game like this.<br>

In a few short weeks we'll all be heading into gameing stores to buy the next upgrade to this game we are all so engulfed by.<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to alot of things just as I did with each expansion before they hit the shelves. In the past VI was able to address alot of issues while creating a whole pot load of new ones, but one thing is for certain. They are still developing this game. That says alot considering the orignal release date of Everquest.<br>
<br>
Sure alot of negative things can be said about what has been done to what class and why, but in the end, and almost 4 years later, we have a much better game.<br>
<br>
Originally the &quot;knight&quot; class was supposed to be the most benefical melee class to play. Remember all of those early experience penalties for Knights? Remember all of the experience bonuses for Warriors? They were there for a reason. In high end game the knight class was supposed to have been superior to warriors, and they were prior to Kunark. The warrior class, and this comes straight from VI, was supposed to have been the &quot;quick&quot; class. A class that anyone could play and progress with but at higher levels would eventaully be something that fell short of those classes that required alot more progression time. <br>
<br>
The added bonus of having high HP and AC at lower levels meant that you were supposed to level fater and enjoy the game faster but end up with a sort of &quot;jack of all trades&quot; character that was unable to specialize in anything at higher levels, and that was true in early Everquest. After Kunark however the Knight class started falling short of being the more powerfull &quot;Tanking&quot; class. The Warriors ability to have significatly higher HP combined with the new Deffensive ability put Warriors at the top of the list for high end content tanking. Remember when the experience penalties were lifted? The developers realised that their original plan had been broken.<br>
<br>
The Knight class, although very fun and enjoyable, has never been the same since the release of Kunark. They were no longer considered the &quot;best&quot; main tank and the Warrior, who benefited from quick early game, became the better choice.<br>
<br>
Like I said... I'm looking forward to this expansion and all the changes that are bound to come with it.  If after 2 expansions the Knights finally become a little more desireable for main tanking than they already are kick ass.  What that will mean in the end is guilds will not &quot;need&quot; to have just one class at level 60 in order to raid high end content.  What that also means is that a guilds ability to experience higher end content will become alot easeir to achieve.  The game advances further and further with every expansion as older zones become easier due to enhanced character progression.  Almost a year after the SoL upgrade VT is a VIP parking place for one guild on most servers.  NToV was basically the same, and the AoW had almost a full expansion server life.  Today it's alot different thanks to the added character enhancements that came with SoL.<br>
<br>
These same arguments are being spat out by clerics btw after hearing about Druid and Shaman CH spells.  Those of us that are completely addicted to Everquest should be greatful that the game has not stagnated and continues to develop.<br>
