<br>
Anyways, we have tried since the patch and it seems to be arbitrarily resetting entirely on us and i've seen/heard conflicting stuff about it working or not working since the patch.<br>
<br>
In a nutshell I want to know if we're screwing up, or it's screwing up.  Sunday, we went around and cleared each side in sequence, relatively quickly.  We were halfway through the fortifications on the last side when they all despawned and the event reset (all mobs on the platform respawned).<br>
<br>
Previously the event never reset like that, and fortifications were permanently up until killed, even double or triple spawns, so we figured that maybe there was a time limit and even though we did it fast, we could do better.<br>
<br>
So we went again and this time, it was even faster, literally we're going to be done with all 4 sides before any respawn, but before it even gets there, during the third set of fortifications it reset again.<br>
<br>
I've seen posts indicating it's worked post patch but then one of our people talked with someone on another server who said the same thing happened to them.  Basically, I want to know if its working and we're screwing up or if its broken. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ainmer>Ainmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/03 11:49:36 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ainmer.homestead.com/files/roland.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Peregrin rockskull event..</span><hr size=1> My guild noticed wierdness in this event too this weekend.<br>
<br>
A monk was pulling the first two top of the tower mobs and got bard song linked and ended up pulling 4 of them.  We got on all 4 of them and killed one.  Then we started killing it's twin and the event totally reset.<br>
<br>
After that, it went normally for us.   Normal for us is pulling 2, killing the 10, then pulling the next pair, killing the 10, etc.<br>
<br>
It could be that the event resets if you are aggro on more than one pair or it's spawned mobs for some amount of time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coray>Coray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/03 8:16:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Peregrin rockskull event..</span><hr size=1> I don't think thats it exactly, I'm sure I didn't aggro more than I wanted when pulling, it just seemed to be random. <br>

Yes it can work.  It can also bug and reset.

<br>
We tried again, differently and it was atleast partially correct in that the event did not reset, but when we had cleared all yellow con side mobs, and all stone fortifications on all sides, nothing happened.  The entire platform was clear and stayed clear and nothing occured.<br>
<br>
What we did specifically was, we killed all 4 side mobs first, did not touch the fortifications.  Then we cleared fortifications.  We could tell it was atleast partially right because the sides we cleared, you could see the 2 side mobs spawn and then despawn.  <br>
<br>
But like I said, we did that all, and nothing occured.  I don't know the entire specifics of the triggers but it seemed like the perfected warder of earth event came up after that..<br>
<br>
Our best guess about that was that it just didn't come up after a patch like MW seems to, but maybe someone else has some insight. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coray>Coray</A> at: 4/14/03 7:39:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=parvvardt>Parv Vardt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/03 10:02:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Peregrin rockskull event..</span><hr size=1> The event randomly resets.  Talk to your trackers and they'll tell you this.  It's most likely a hack to keep the event from being blown by killing a couple of the fortification triggers and leaving.  It's annoying when it resets while in the middle of it, but if you pick it up from there and go you should be ok. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66788">Parv</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karthunk>Karthunk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 274<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/03 10:21:30 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Peregrin rockskull event..</span><hr size=1> It just resets sometimes, doesn't have to do with the order of the top mobs. <p><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=110313 target="_blank">Just another dead tank</a>

<br>
Before the most recent patch we had triggered it twice.  What we saw was that the outer yellow cons, would respawn regardless of if stone fortifications were up, and as a result you could get multiple sets of fortifications.<br>
<br>
None of that mattered since the event was moved to the next step not by clearing sides, but simply by clearing x number of fortifications.  Atleast one other earth event was exactly the same (rock beasts), where it kept track of only how many things had died, and didn't care when or from where they died.<br>
<br>
After the patch, it's been changed and it actually does reset.<br>
<br>
Because of the pathing issues we used to have we did it in sequence and moved around the outside, doing the lower ones, then the upper yellow and then fortifications.  It reset every time doing it that way.<br>
<br>
The last time, sunday I think, we did it and we were halfway through the fourth side, when it reset.  We had done it quickly we thought, but we could do it faster so we moved right in front, and we began to just destroy everything.  I pulled the front 2, then their fortifications, then the right two, and fortifications, left 2, and fortifications, and it reset partway through then.<br>
<br>
We did something else after that but today we tried it again.  Straight up clearing same way as we used to, moving around the outside, it reset on the third side.<br>
<br>
Someone suggested we spawn all fortifications first and since literally the event had reset on us like 5 times in a row trying it the sequenced way and we're pretty much experts on slaughtering it, I said whatever.<br>
<br>
So I pulled all 4 sets of top spawns and at that point, all fortifications were up.  We pulled and cleared two sides and then had to pause.  I literally watched the top 2 guards on the side we were at, spawn and despawn near instantly.  The other place I have seen this is on rock beast platform when the yellows come around to spawn, you can see them appear for a split second.<br>
<br>
As we were paused, the other two side sets of yellow guards, spawned, which caused their fortifications to despawn.  The event did not reset because when it does, the entire platform spawns, so I pulled all of the guards on top (4 of them), which caused the two sets of fortifications to spawn.<br>
<br>
We pulled both of those and killed them.  We were expecting the next phase of the event, but nothing occured.  None of the yellow guards respawned either while we were in the zone.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't know the specifics of the triggers involved but like I said, where the triumvirate is usually, had mobs spawn around the same time as we finished all of the platform fortification.  <br>
<br>
Parv are you saying that if you just restart from where it resets, it'll still go?  Basically, from what I've seen, doing it in sequence doesn't work, and it resets randomly when you do that.  Doing it in stages is the only thing lately that atleast gave us feedback that we were doing it right, even if it ended up seeming to not work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showPrevMessage?topicID=1957.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showNextMessage?topicID=1957.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.emailToFriend?topicID=1957.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.threadControl?topicID=1957.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1957.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1957.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield>The BattleField</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
