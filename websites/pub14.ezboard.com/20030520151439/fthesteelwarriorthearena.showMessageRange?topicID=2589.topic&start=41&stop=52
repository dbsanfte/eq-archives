As I said in earlier posts, it was my belief that the Rampage list somehow changed, as I would stop taking Rampage during the fight.<br>
<br>
Well, during this IV fight the same thing happened.  I was VERY careful not to move an INCH, so as to make sure that Range was not a factor.  When the fight starts I'm taking Rampage damage, then after 30 or 40 seconds I stop taking Rampage, just as I'd seen in earlier fights.  This time of course I was paying extremely close attention, and I noticed that the Rampage hits were pushing me very slightly each time I took a hit.  I waited a round or two and let someone else take Rampage, then I moved up closer to IV and sure enough, back I went to taking Rampage damage.<br>
<br>
The obvious conclusion is that the Rampage list did not change, I simply moved out of range (or technically was moved by IV).  As soon as I moved back into range I took Rampage again.  I hope folks here will accept my apologies for confusing this issue, but it sure as heck looked to me like the list was changing.  Obviously what I didn't factor in was that I'm usually casting from nearly max range on IV, and that it took only a small push to move me out of range of Rampage.<br>
<br>
FWIW, Shamans make great Rampage tanks for fights like this.  IV doesn't really hit that hard, and we can heal ourselves.  And it's not like there's a whole lot else for us to do during an IV fight once the mob has been debuffed. <p>Aesa D'Artegan<br>

Best explanation I have heard to date on that is the rampage list holes theory.<br>
<br>
Rampage list gets set<br>
1) warrior 1<br>
2) warrior 2<br>
3) Monk 1<br>
4) Rogue 1<br>
5) Cleric 1<br>
<br>
so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
Lets say warrior 1 is the MT. So warrior 2 eats rampage as long as he is in melee range.<br>
<br>
Warrior 2 dies. Now the rampage list looks like this<br>
1) warrior 1<br>
2) Open slot<br>
3) Monk 1<br>
4) Rogue 1<br>
5) Cleric 1<br>
<br>
Warrior 1 is still the MT, so Monk 1 starts eatting rampages.<br>
<br>
Warrior 2 gets rezzed and goes back in to fight.  When he attacks and gets on IVs hate list, he falls into the highest open slot, ie slot 2 so your back to:<br>
1) warrior 1<br>
2) warrior 2<br>
3) Monk 1<br>
4) Rogue 1<br>
5) Cleric 1<br>
<br>
If wizard 1 had joined the raid late, and started nuking just after warrior 2 died, the rampage list would look like this<br>
1) warrior 1<br>
2) wizard 1<br>
3) Monk 1<br>
4) Rogue 1<br>
5) Cleric 1<br>
6) warrior 1<br>
<br>
Monk 1 would still continue to eat rampage, unless wizard 1 got in melee range.<br>
<br>

All of the information I mention in this thread will pertain to PoS mini bosses, because my guild has been busy with those lately and they are my most recent experience with rampage.<br>
<br>
I'm a Shadowknight, and I usually pull and RT for my guild.<br>
<br>
FD vs Rampage; We're in the desert, and we're pulling the mini who stands by those rocks with basically no guards. This is easy, but at the time I need to be afk, so I pull it, have SK2 shoot an arrow at him in mid pull (To set him just below me on Rampage list), and I feign once in camp. I come back about halfway through the fight, and ask SK2 how the rampage swap worked, he said he has had rampage the entire fight. Since I've never really tested rampage for myself before, I decided to. I got up from FD, SK2 was still taking rampage, I was meleeing and definately close enough to be taking rampage on this particular mob. Mini happened to rampage 3 times quickly, and SK2 went down. After that, I was back on rampage.<br>
<br>
Camping/Zoning/Dying/etc vs Rampage; Ok, this time we're in the Ocean camp. Recently I've been trying to pull minis without the need to clear the rest of the giants first, for the particular mini we were pulling (Whoever the Strong) I was using a bard with the new Lull song. I've used bards before and its worked great, the duration on the song is nice and long, and I've rarely had troubles. This was the first time that the bard had attempted to use lull for this mini. He was having some troubles and we ended up pulling the first room anyway. (For any of you who haven't seen it, this house has 2 rooms in it, front and back, the back has the mini and 3 guards.)  While trying to lull the back room, the bard got agro, the mini was among the mobs he agroed. (Note: bard was the first agro on the mini.) We eventually get the giants dead or lulled, and I pull. I was taking Rampage just as normal, bard was meleeing and was definately in rampage range.<br>
<br>
Now just yesterday, someone in /raidsay made the mistake of asking how exactly rampage worked, and how we were always able to determine I would have it ahead of time. Me and the guild's MT started explaining, but our views as far as FD/camping/memblur/zoning/etc differed. He swears by the information from this site, and I base my opinions off of my own experiences. I'll take what he says as truth most of the time, but in this case about changing rampage list my experience goes against what he says.<br>
<br>
I tried to be very detailed with my situations, and I'll try and keep up with this thread in case you guys have some comments. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whulff>Whulff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/9/03 2:08:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2589.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Rampage</span><hr size=1> This info has answered a question i have had for a long time now .

<br>
- The rampage list can be reset with memblur similar spells, if the mob is at full HP and the spell is successfull in its checks (if not, then its just another added to the rampage list<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
- Monks can FD off a rampage list, if they are lucky and get a memblur check on their FD and the mob is at full HP.<br>
- You are removed from the memblur list, if you have been on the list for around 5 minutes and the mob has been on full HP during these period.<br>
- Rampage range seems to vary from mob to mob. I have seen ressed people go down due to rampage hits, eventhough they were far far far away from the battle (not sure if some mobs has a near zonewide rampage range or something like that).<br>

So in your scenario, there wouldn't be an empty 'slot 2', per se - Warrior 2's name would still be in there, but he would not be available as a target (due to a slight case of death) .. I thought this was proven by casting pets of the same name? <p>--<br>

<br>
I dont really understand the question.  Its slots filled with names.<br>
<br>
If you cast a pet, its rampage, and it dies. Now there is an empty slot. You cast another pet, it fills that slot, it dies. Etc.  If someone else enters the mobs hate list for the first time between pet casts, they fill the slot until they die.<br>
<br>
PS and also, as I said its just a theory <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Its not something I have proven to be true by any means. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solinarinnoruuk>Solinar Innoruuk</A> at: 4/4/03 7:37:26 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phantron>Phantron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/03 9:08:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2589.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rampage</span><hr size=1> I think it's named based in that slots don't get wiped.  For example if the following 10 entities engage the mobs in this order:<br>
<br>
Warrior 1 (tanking)<br>
Beastlord 1's pet<br>
Mage 1 (out of rampage range)<br>
Goner<br>
Cleric 1<br>
Cleric 2<br>
Cleric 3<br>
Shaman 1<br>
Warrior 2<br>
Warrior 3<br>
<br>
Now mob rampages and kill Beastlord 1's pet.  Beastlord 1's pet is still on the rampage list, but since it's dead, we skip it.  <br>
<br>
Now Beastlord recasts pet.  Since all BST pets are named 'XXX's Warder', it picks up its old place.<br>
<br>
Now assuming we keep going.  The list goes to Mage 1, who is out of rampage range.  So mob rampages and kills Goner.  Now when Mage 1 recasts the pet, the new pet might not be called Goner again so that's treated as a new entity.  Any pet caster that made a pet name Goner, however, will pick up the 4th slot on rampage.<br>
<br>
The reason why I don't think it's slot based because it's pretty obvious you can die and then immediately get back to rampage again after being rezzed.  Also Beastlord pets hold rampage extremely well to the point that a brand newly summoned one (even the level 9 ones) can immediately take a round of rampage, while other pets do not seem to grab rampage nearly as well.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solinarinnoruuk>Solinar Innoruuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 426<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/03 9:37:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2589.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rampage</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The reason why I don't think it's slot based because it's pretty obvious you can die and then immediately get back to rampage again after being rezzed<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Warrior 2 is eatting rampages and getting healed.<br>
<br>
Warrior 1 gets a rez and while looting the mob sees him as he is within the proximatey aggro range of the mob.  This puts him back on the hate list and into the highest open slot (his empty slot from before.<br>

So he starts eatting rampages beacuse he filled the empty rampage slot.  The empty slot theory is a direct result of trying to explain how people can die, get rezzed, and come back to be right on rampage again.<br>
<br>
Another reason the empty slot theory seems to work is because, the name theory doesnt explain people who join fights late, and mysteriously get rampage.  The empty slot theory does.  If someone joins a fight late, and there is an empty slot open up high, they fall into it as soon as they aggro the mob via proximatey or heals/nukes/debuffs and can take rampages before people who were present for the start of the fight. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solinarinnoruuk>Solinar Innoruuk</A> at: 4/4/03 9:39:40 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=2589.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=2589.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showPrevMessage?topicID=2589.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showNextMessage?topicID=2589.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2589.topic&index=52><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.emailToFriend?topicID=2589.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.threadControl?topicID=2589.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2589.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2589.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
