src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Re</span><hr size=1> Warriors, wizards, clerics... as stated before are the best at what they do.  What this translates to is that we're RAID classes.  In the high level raid game, warriors are key.  Someone posted that you can have too many warriors.  I'm not so sure about that, unless you are just going way out there.  A general high end raid guild can do just fine with 8 solid active warriors, many would LOVE to have this many.  My guild has been lacking warriors for months and have only recently been able to recruit enough that having more than myself (1 warrior) on a raid isn't a rare thing.  So in the high end raid area of things, warriors still have a solid place and still do some very good DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
The other area to talk about is 45-59ish small raid guilds and exp groups.  One major factor here is that taunt is still mostly 'broken' as designed from 50-59.  For all intents and purposes during those levels you really aren't a warrior.  There's things you can do if you try hard to kind of fake it.  But in reality you really aren't a real warrior until you hit level 60.  Then everything changes.  During this time and 2 hell levels there's a lot of frustration.  And guilds in this range find a lot of problems with controlling aggro and often find it best to have paladins and SK tank most mobs.  This is still even a problem for smaller guilds and exp groups for 60 warriors who don't have good taunt weapons.  It IS really the case that we are more reliant on the weapon in our hands than any other class.  Many warriors struggle or quit in this situation.  But once a warrior finally gets 60 and finally tracks down his epic, willsapper, Ichorflow, etc, they can finally appreciate being a warrior.  And at this point if you've still got pal/sks stealing aggro from you and tanking.  It's not a problem with you, it's a problem with them.<br>
<br>
It is a valid argument that hybrids, rogues, monks can do much better in exp groups than warriors.  But at the same time it all depends on what zone you are in and what classes are in the group.  With these new free exp zones (which IMFO ruin a lot of the game) like Velks, FG, etc.  A warrior can make one hell of a group.  Specially a troll with a fungi vest.  You just have to know what to do and how to do it.  Grab yourself a few of those detested hybrids and rogue/monks and goto town.  You can rake in exp with massive DPS and with your tanking skill and regen it only takes a ranger/paladin to heal you (if you need heals at all).  If anyone should be mad here, it should be clerics and druids.  Because in these 'free exp' zones shaman are great in groups and can keep up a solid DPS, plus buffs, and regen.  No melee group in their right minds would refuse a shaman.  But not many melee groups in these situations would want a druid or cleric.  Unless you think that Judgement has great DPS... druid's damage shield is helpful a bit, but you can just get that from click items or a ranger.<br>
<br>
In general, if you aren't happy with the warrior class then do these things:<br>
<br>
1) Get level 60. Don't @#%$ bitch about it either, it is SO EASY TO DO NOW!<br>
2) Get good aggro weapons.  Yes, you might have to @#%$ camp Sev, Vaniki, Grieg, etc.<br>
<br>
If you've done that and you still can't hold aggro or your guild won't let you tank then, join another guild.<br>
<br>
If you are in a guild and you actively tank stuff, and you are level 60 and have good aggro weapons and STILL think that warriors are screwed....<br>
<br>

I seriously don't think that the reason that you can't get a pickup group in Sebilis is because of the hordes of newly-uber paladins taking your spot.  If I get a paladin in my exp group it's to be the main healer.  If you have any other healer in your group, you're better off with a warrior tanking and doing more damage.  <br>
<br>
Gurgel is right, exp in luclin is so stupidly easy that the only requirement for an exp group is DPS, and the more the better.  If I put a cleric in my group in FG/ME/Akheva, it's because I'm doin em a favor, and they damn well better have all of their nukes loaded hehe.  <br>
<br>
Warriors are, and will remain, the best tanks in the game.  They are, and always have been, one of the least versatile classes in the game.  Get used to it if you want to play a warrior.  <br>
<br>
Incidentally, I'm having almost the exact same discussion over on the casters realm warrior board hehe.  The question I asked over there is, what did hybrids get that made them suddenly so overpowered in relation to warriors?  They got a DPS upgrade with better weapons and improvements to 2-handers (which also benefits warriors).  They got undead crits (nice, but very situational), and um...a free horse?  help me out here.  This stuff makes them a better tank than you, when they used to be nothing but a HT taker?  Hybrids have *always* been able to tank in exp groups.  Do you think that they shouldn't?  They have always been able to heal/stun/root and get more aggro than a warrior.<br>
<br>
How exactly did Verant &quot;go overboard&quot; improving hybrids and make them so much better than warriors?  The only thing I see was that they got a dps upgrade, with the intention of making them do 85% of the damage that warriors do. I suspect they do more than that with some uber 2-handers, but in general, sub-level 60 paladins do significantly less dps than warriors.<br>

We are by design the best tanks in the game and in 90% of the situations the mainline by which the other melee classes guage their own damage output.<br>
<br>
However, our selection of class abilities is very poor in comparison to some of the others. Yes, Summon Horse is not game breaking, but damn that is a nice one to have isn't it.<br>
<br>
What about you? After Area Taunt, what class abilities are really that good?<br>
<br>
Slay Undead makes a paladin unstoppable in the situations where undead mobs are pulled. Have you ever seen one in KC basement? My god. What do we have? Rampage? Ok maybe if we acquire an Earthshaker, that skill is pretty damn cool. It doesn't turn us into the soloing juggurnaut that the Slay Undead Paladin is.<br>
<br>
Flurry is extremely poor benefit vs. cost. Hopefully we get a few cool abilities with PoP out. I don't mean anything like Slay Undead... just... something better than War Cry!<br>
<br>
&quot;Increased Taunt&quot; (like the enchanter hate increaser, but not as powerful) or &quot;Crippling Kick&quot; (always critical on kicks) innate abilities for points of class AA would be something that I would very much look forward to. The taunt skill may be over the line, but one can hope.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm pleased that the Knights finally are in line with our overall gaming experience. I don't think the fundamentals of the warrior class needs to be changed. However, I strongly agree with the argument that we are shortchanged when it comes to the 60+ aa mark. <p><table border="0">

<br>
Well, it wasnt' almost overnight, it was a series of upgrades that started last year.   First was a manapool increase, which all agreed was a good thing.  Then was the increase in defense skill to the exact same as warriors.   Previously, there wasn't any question that pallys COULD outtaunt wariors, they just didnt' want to cause they'd get their asses whupped.   Then was the advent of the vastly superior weapons throught mid velious, along with that came the damage table increases which put them on the same damage tables as warriors (who were on a different, higher table), then came AA points, and All Melee armors, which have been historically class specific.   Any of these things by themselves isn't that big of a deal, but add them all up, and the difference intanking power of Paladins and SK's from before to now is INSANE.   Now, they've always had, as I said earlier the ability to outtaunt warriors, it was just stupid to do so.  Now it's different, warriors have nothing over them aside from being able to tank the big boys.  This is even true in melee combat, where warriors should, at least in MY vision, have a decided advantage both offensively AND defensively to compensate for not having the advantage of utility.<br>

<br>
2)  Defense skill upgrade.  This was an improvment, although I can't say I've ever seen the effect on improved Defense skill.  Defense skill improves your AC, does it do anything else?<br>
<br>
3) Damage upgrade.  I mentioned that.<br>
<br>
4) AA points...What about them?  They got undead crits, a free horse, and ??<br>
<br>
5) all-melee armor This only applies to uber types, most people are still wearing class specific armor.  And even if you compare uber guild players, warriors will have much more hps and AC than a paladin.  Compare Furor to Kreugen, or your server's top warrior to your top paladin.  Warriors with the same level of gear will have 5-800 more hps than a paladin.  Hardly a trivial difference.<br>
<br>
<br>
This just doesn't add up to an INSANE (omg solid caps!)difference in my eyes.  Obviously some people see it differently.<br>

<br>
Both Slay Undead 1,2,3 and Flurry 1,2,3 require 3 levels of Combat Fury.<br>
<br>
The difference is that SU is actually tremendously powerful against undead in practice. Flurry... is not as exciting.<br>

It's not the end-all, be-all of the AA world. But it *is* a data point. Look at monks with rapid feign and improved mend... our &quot;expensive badass skill&quot; which apparently is supposed to be Flurry given the pre-reqs and the class AA cost is just underwhelming in comparison. <p><table border="0">

So people will add one to a group willingly.  This may mean that a Warrior gets to sit around longer without a group where before it might have been the Paladin/Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
When a pick up group needs a tank these days, they'll grab what's available rather then insisting on waiting on a Warrior.  This is probably the way it should always have been.  And while its good for the Knights, its not so great for the Warriors still trying to level up.<br>
<br>
Warriors still have some advantages.  The Knights have more utility.  Both can tank for experience groups.  Yeah, its probably is a little tougher for up and coming Warriors.  Unfortunately the options are suck it up and overcome or pick another class.  Like a cleric or an enchanter, they rarely have troubles getting groups.<br>

<br>
and its not the AA skills as much as the hybrid utility but still are both a factor. hybrids have divine stun, circlet of shadows, 3 types of feign death, weapon mastery (archery), situational destruction discs, LoH, superior aggro, self healing through direct heals or drain, healing wave of prexus, ac/hp/atk buffs, root, snare, fear, DoT damage etc.<br>
<br>
the classes with these abilities have almost our hp, comparable dps and because of the cap, the same ac.<br>
<br>
you also mention SoD / hategiver etc. going to tanks but this is an irrelevant point to the 95% of warrior out there who will never see these weapons<br>
<br>
we need more hp, better aggro and upgraded defence. everything else is secondary. i am not saying we aren't a solid class because we are but that doesn't stop me wanting more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But I have played EQ for awhile. I read many class boards. Let me say this.<br>
<br>
Warriors went 2 years as being the hands down &quot;we can't do that without a warrior&quot; type class. Now for the first time you are playing second fiddle. Yes you do have valid points. Yes it is good that you post them. VI does read class boards. If you don't believe me then ask the druids. But it's not the end of the world like some of you are making it out to be. Those who stop playing a warrior because of this are making a big mistake. VI will sooner or later over balance it back out and put warriors back on top. It's a never ending cycle in this game. Balance one class, piss off three more classes, wash, rense, repeat.<br>

<br>
Do you actually know anyone with SU? Have you parsed it beyond seeing the ooh-ah crits?<br>
<br>
In a recently parsed AL fight (he's undead), a SU3 Pally with a Palladius axe and avatar only did 5dps more than the highest damaging warrior (using gauldreks, an inferior weapon). That's not too big a deal considering it only works against a specific type of mob and costs a buttload of AA points IMO.<br>
<br>
People see those huge crits and immediately assume that it's soooo overpowered. The truth of the matter is that the low offensive skills and attack of hybrid tanks is a big deal, and they really don't do much damage at all without those crits. Whoever said that hybrids outdamage us with things like the tunare 2hander have no idea what they're talking about. Even a warrior using a much worse weapon will outdamage a paldin with the most uber 2hander in the game handily (assuming non-undead mobs). <p><html>

Think about how long it would take you to get 500 hps in gear upgrades.  ND3 is considered one of our best AA abilities and it adds what, 200 hps, maybe 250 on a top end tank...I guess that's beyond trival huh?  If you've got 2 tanks and one of them has 500 more hps, all other things being equal, then the one with more hps should be tanking.  If your guild can't keep aggro on a MT warrior then you straight up suck and you should try another game.  Sure hybrids taunt better, but warriors taunt well enough.<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with suggesting some new features that you think should be given to the warrior class.  I think it would be great if we got some Defensive-oriented AA skills as well.  What I don't like to see is oh boo hoo paladins are better than me in every way and /flame VI because they won't make me uber.  Sorry if you can't handle not being a god class and clearly superior to hybrids in every way and in every situation.  Suck it up and go play your class...if you can't do that, then go roll a paladin and you too can be the uber god class that Paladins have obviously become. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6629>Brutul Vilesilencer</a><br>

Be specific.  Get stats and logs and show them side by side to prove whatever point you are making.<br>

Do not compare yourself to other classes.  Show where there is a significant lack of something reasonable (key word here) and be brief in outlining both the problem and a reasonable solution.<br>

VI (like every other company out there) is more likely to listen a well-presented, logistically rich, rational suggestion that includes workable and balanced solutions rather than a whining rant.<br>

<br>
it doesn't seem to be that crash hot when the average hit is 500+ these days<br>
<br>
&quot;Think about how long it would take you to get 500 hps in gear upgrades&quot;<br>
<br>
fooking ages<br>
<br>
&quot;ND3 is considered one of our best AA abilities and it adds what, 200 hps, maybe 250 on a top end tank...I guess that's beyond trival huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
almost everyone gets ND3<br>
<br>
&quot;If you've got 2 tanks and one of them has 500 more hps, all other things being equal, then the one with more hps should be tanking&quot;<br>
<br>
not necessarily. as 2A i have 500hp less than our guilds MA (he gets gear preference) but i still tank to gain experience or for defensive transition or if the MA can't log on.<br>
<br>
&quot;If your guild can't keep aggro on a MT warrior then you straight up suck and you should try another game&quot;<br>
<br>
sorry man i'll just go back to quake. lose the attitude man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure hybrids taunt better, but warriors taunt well enough&quot;<br>
<br>
i remember being SoL trying to tank my way thru HoT at levels 54 - 59. maybe spare a thought for our non-60 brothers and sisters who are doing the hard slog to 60 but are still relied on by their guild to do their job which is to keep aggro away from the dress wearers against mobs that are often of a higher con<br>
<br>
&quot;There's nothing wrong with suggesting some new features that you think should be given to the warrior class. I think it would be great if we got some Defensive-oriented AA skills as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
i'm glad we agree<br>
<br>
&quot;What I don't like to see is oh boo hoo paladins are better than me in every way and /flame VI because they won't make me uber&quot;<br>
<br>
eqnecro is over that way<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry if you can't handle not being a god class and clearly superior to hybrids in every way and in every situation&quot;<br>
<br>
i don't recall any calls for godliness in this thread. maybe some further utility or improvement to further refine our role in response to the upgraded knight class usurping our role in day to day situations, but hardly any requests to be overpowered. i am sorry but i do not accept warriors being irrelevant in day to day gameplay despite their necessity for the big mobs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Suck it up and go play your class...if you can't do that, then go roll a paladin and you too can be the uber god class that Paladins have obviously become&quot;<br>
