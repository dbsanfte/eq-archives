<br>
First I am not a warrior, I am a druid<br>
/bow<br>
<br>
I am looking for some information on the warrior epic.  A friend and guild mate of mine needs a scale off this big bad mofo.<br>
<br>
I am trying to help by getting all the information I can to help him out.<br>
<br>
Could anyone give us some advice that we would need to raid naggy?  We are a small guild and have never attepted a raid of this magnatude so we would appreciate all the help we can get.<br>
<br>
Would any of you like to share what tacticts you used to complete this step in the warrior epic?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

<br>
You can do naggy with 18-24 people np, max melee on him is 255.<br>
<br>
Get resist gear and lots of it.<br>
<br>
bascially<br>
tank, tank, cleric, cleric, cleric, and bard for the groups<br>
<br>
Assign a main tank and go to town.<br>
<br>
or with more of a pick up raid/no raid exp raiders use this post<br>

Decent fire resist is a must (something close to 100 before buffing).  If the majority of your tanks don't have good FR, expect a long unpleasant night of CR.  Caster's fire resist is also important, but not as much.  Magic resist should also be up there to resist the Fear attacks.<br>
<br>
He also dispells, so typically on the raids I have been on you start of with four crap buffs.  These are things like poison resist, see invis, resist disease, etc.  Then you buff the more important buffs, cleric HP &amp; AC buffs, Shammy STA &amp; HP buffs, and FR buffs.<br>
<br>
Its also to good to have 3 or 4 enchanters available to siphon his mana.  Basically the plan of attack goes something like this.  The main tank (usually the highest level with the most AC, HP, and resists) rushes Naggy and gets his attention, turning his tail toward the door.  The other melee follow in very soon after.  No one taunts but the main tank, unless he goes down.  The main tank needs to get solid agro.  As people get low on health, they dart back towards the door to the lair and get heals.  The casters sit in the safe room outside his lair and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Once Naggy is at half health, they get called in to start nuking.  You have to be within melee range for nukes to work on him, I believe.  If all has gone well to this point, he usually goes down fast.<br>
<br>
Now, this doesn't detail what needs to be done to kill all the Fire Giants on the way to Naggy's lair, or how to get the Fire Giants out of his lair before you rush him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/umorphiusthejeweller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorphiusTheJeweller</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/7/01 11:57:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Naggy Raid for the epic piece</span><hr size=1> Naggy doesn't have mana, so no need for an enchanter on raid except to buff.<br>

Here is the response I typed up.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Group setup is the first thing I will discuss. Being that groups vary depending on who and how many are available, I’ll assume we have four groups of the classes we desire. Using this type of strategy, Fraglak killed Nagafen with 3 groups with few deaths. I’m confident that if we did not level up that we would have been able to take out Nagafen with 2 groups.<br>
<br>
Melee Group 1<br>
Monk<br>
Monk<br>
Warrior<br>
Warrior<br>
Bard<br>
Cleric<br>
<br>
Melee Group 2<br>
Melee<br>

<br>
Heal Group<br>
Cleric<br>

Shaman<br>
Druid<br>
Bard<br>
Any<br>
<br>
Nuke Group<br>
Nuker<br>
Nuker<br>
Any<br>
Any<br>
Any<br>
Bard<br>
<br>
You’ll notice that we do NOT have balanced groups. This is because we’re not a single group, we are a single raid. For this reason you try to balance the groups as if they are actual classes, i.e. the melee groups, heal groups, nuke groups. You do however have to add some other classes into these groups in order to keep them alive and funcational.<br>
<br>
As you can see, I have placed a bard in every group. This is the biggest key to slaying Vox or Nagafen. I’ll review the buffs later, but in the end you’ll have a bard song as the first buff. This prevents the dragon from dispelling the buffs as bard songs refresh every tick. So in effect, the bard song is dispelled and then a tick later you have another buff in place to act as a buffer.<br>
<br>
The clerics in the melee groups should mainly worry about healing AoE damage from the dragon, the melee damage will be counteracted by the heal group. This means the cleric will need to use their best judgement and decide whether they should use Remedy or a group heal. Celestial Healing should not be used, they do not stack and require a buff slot to be available which may not exist since you can only have 15 buffs.<br>
<br>
All melee except for rogues much stay in front of the dragon so that the rogues can have a back to stab. Rogues are the highest damage class in the game, so getting their backstabs in will make a world of difference. Despite with the nuke group might think, they are not even needed.<br>
<br>
The Heal group will have an assist key made up that says “/assist lord”. All of the healers in the heal group will keep hitting this key, which will allow all of the healers to target whatever PC is taking melee damage from the dragon. Healers should NOT use complete heal, but rather quick heals like Remedy, Greater Healing and Superior Healing.<br>
<br>
When you charge in, the melee and heal group all go in together. This is important, as melees cannot do damage as they are running out to get heals, and a cleric running in will be wasting too much time. If everyone has the resistances, they will survive the AoE.<br>
<br>
At 50% heal, the raid leader(s) should shout NUKE several times. This is the call for the Nuke Group to enter the lair and start nuking. It is vital to make sure before EVERY raid that all nukers know they must stand under the dragon in order for spells to land. Always assume that this is everyone’s first raid. People do forget stuff, it is your job to remind them<br>
<br>
Bards must only play Guardian Rhythms (level 17 group MR song) and Psalm of Cooling (level 33 group FR song), they CANNOT melee and should use instruments. If they melee, they might get agro and die. If the bard dies, not only will the groups resistances fall because the songs are not playing, but their group will also get dispelled.<br>
<br>
Things to remind people to do:<br>
<br>
1) Groups must stay together. If groups get scattered, healers may end up out of range for heals and bards might be too far away for the songs to take effect.<br>
2) Remind nukers that they must be under the dragon for the spells to stick<br>
3) Remind all melees to stay on one side, rogues on the other.<br>
4) Have everyone turn off 3D Sky, Player Names, and all chat channels that are not needed (damage shields, hits, misses, bard songs, etc..) They /showspelleffect off, /serverfilter on. This will cut down on lag and allow people to see what’s going on better.<br>
5) No one is to put a damage shield on, this make end up taking the first buffs slot which will prevent the bard song from going their.<br>
6) Melees should NOT disarm, beg, instill doubt or pickpocket. It makes the heal groups job easier if the dragons target doesn’t change every 2 seconds.<br>
<br>
Buffs<br>
I’d recommend making a buff group and inviting people one at a time so that you make sure each person is properly buffed. We used to have everyone sit in a line against the wall, and call a person up one at a time. The raid leader would be grouped with a bard who had Alenia's Disenchanting Melody (level 22 song) going. Once this person was dispelled, they would disband and go to the buff group. The buffers would buff the person in order, disband them and tell them to camp. The buff group should be a Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Enchanter and Bard (mana song).<br>
<br>
For the most part, crap buffs first, then shaman buffs, then cleric buffs, then resistances, then enchanter buffs. Once everyone logs back from chat, they click off their first crap buff to make room for the bard song. <br>
<br>
If you want to get exact about the buffs, here are the “ideal” buffs and their order.<br>
1) Crap buff to be click off for bard song<br>
2) Crap buff (endure poison)<br>
3) Crap buff (endure cold)<br>
4) Crap buff (endure disease)<br>
5) Strength (Shaman)<br>
6) Stamina (Shaman)<br>
7) Talisman of Altuna (Shaman)<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Shield of Words (Cleric)<br>
9) Symbol of Naltron (Cleric)<br>
10) Heroism (Cleric)<br>
11) Circle of Winter (Druid)<br>
12) Group Magic Resist (Enchanter)<br>
13) Swift like the Wind (Enchanter) or Clarity (Enchanter)<br>
14) Empty - Saved for bard song<br>
15) Empty - dragon fear icon will go in this slot<br>
<br>
I think I’ve covered most of the bases, but could have forgotten a minor item here or there. Please let me know if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
Good luck on the slaying.<br>
