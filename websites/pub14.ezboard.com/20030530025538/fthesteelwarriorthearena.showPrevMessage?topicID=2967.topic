Keep in mind Im kinda tipsy atm and most of it is just what popped into my head as I typed, not formatted in any way or order. . .Here goes:<br>
<br>
Can I have a simple answer and your reasoning behind your answer to this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you Taunt every time your putton is refreshed?&quot;<br>
<br>
My answer, as with every other person that has any clue of controlling aggro in a group (group, not raid), is a resounding. . .NO<br>
<br>
Numerous Articles have been posted at steel warrior's, many of which I have added statistics and theory's to considering the topic of aggro control.<br>
<br>
I recently had a group in teh planes on a mates war. . .he has pretty decent equip for his level (57). . .BoC etc. First thing that happens while running to the camp is we get jumped by an add. . .no probs, F8 and taunt and start beating the royal @#%$ through it. Between now and the next fifteen seconds the chanted has a slow resist, tashed and slowed. . .and as a consequence of such massive aggro died a rather bloody death. Much to the &quot;WTF?!&quot; coming from my mouth as to why on gods earth someone would be so drastic to slow a yardtrash piece of crap.<br>
<br>
Considering I have played my own and other's high end enchanters, warriors and myriad's of other chars, I now full well the amount og aggro generated by both a war, versus that of a chanter chaincasting their highest hate building spells. Simple answer? No way on gods earth without AeT, bestow DA, or just a simple root, could I have saved the ENC. @#%$ happens.<br>
<br>
Now, something you learn amongst dealing with mobs that deal hundreds of damage per second in melee range, is a quick tip. . .Dont let them get in melee range. Thats why cod chanters get their pets snared, why people ghetto mez, and why I asked the druid to root park the first mob she saw if I said I was pulling 2 or more...<br>
<br>
No problem, root is simple enough, usually sticks without a drama and can allow the enc to easily tash and mez a mob that poses zero thret to him or herself. Why mez a mob in camp when you can mez it outside away from any danger of add's, and far enough that if mez broke the enc could cast another mez by the time it arrived to the group.<br>
<br>
So, this worked well once or twice, amongst my usually hasty group etiquette, of just pulling before the first mob dies (yes, chain pulling, Remember DL, n00bs?)...Great xp if you pull it off...Cudo's to my group as they tried hectically to keep up with the pace which was neither dangerous or boring if people kept their cool's and just remember'd their job and when to do it. Most that group with me know that im about 1 mob short of Sharnhorst style grouping on every pull...But also know the benefits of their dedication and work. (damm fine xp)<br>
<br>
So anyways, the enc, who really I didnt have one problem with as she was doing a good job and mezzing what needed to be mezzed, and only once got the wrong mob. Happens to everyone I guess heh. Well somehow found it amongst my simply request to keep me 'boon'd, and to mez anything that the druid root's, it a duty as to incline why she almost died on several pulls...Because your fu&lt;king tashing and slowing before I get a chance to do even close to an equal amount of hate via taunt and melee damage (BoC proc, yeah right like that ever happens when you need it).<br>
<br>
I tried to explain to her the fundamental's of how verant's aggro system works, which is really quite masterful actually...I tried to explain it all in a story of a group setting and a single mob. . . not to hard to catch the drift on.<br>
<br>
Basically if your curious, there are two definite points in the aggro system. . .Aggro, and nothing...at one point your getting butt raped, and at the other your standing there looking at a fire beetle and admiring the moon.<br>
<br>
The genious abut this system is that the person with aggro, has a definite CAP on the amount of aggro generated above the next highest person. So on and so forth. The cap is in relation to the aggro of the next person down the list.<br>
<br>
As an example, which is used a lot as just a base figour, nothing definite though, of a 1000 point aggro cap between two people, lets call them Ma and Sa. This means that in that given encounter, the Ma can taunt every time it refreshes for the next 5 hours along with doing hundreds of thousands of melee damage, and still remain only 1000 points of aggro ahead of the SA, who just kicked the mob for 1 and went afk.<br>
<br>
Now, considering your aggro a can only be reduced by spells like jolt, degression, khalshazar's defeat, and finally and most commonly, by the person below you ganing aggro points at a higher rate than you. It has brung almost every warrior with half a clue, to the conclusion that repetedly pressing taunt serves no purpose than to delay the gain of 200 aggro (a commonly accepted representation of what a hit of the taunt button generates upon success). . .this means that if I were meleeing a mob like a mother bish, and an enc slow's it (lets say 400 aggro for a resist), tashes (hmm. . .100?), and slows again (600 aggro if it lands [I'm just making these figours up btw]), and I have just depressed taunt I have to wait around 8 seconds before the skill is available, a lot can happen in 8 seconds, and I guarantee you it VERY rarely is a proc of EB, or enough melee damage to get ahead of the enc in the aggro list again. <br>
<br>
Hence, the skill taunt is commonly only used at the begnning of the fight, and then never again (in xp groups, not raids) until such time as the mob dies, or its attention is diverted elsewhere. his means it is available as an extra 200 hate at any time the warrior deems nessesary (when a mobs attention is not solely on him).<br>
<br>
Simple enough no?. . .thought so.<br>
<br>
So, my role in the group was Ma and puller. . .no probs, pulled singles 80% of the time and I would focus by fight with the mob like this..<br>
<br>
Pull with arrow or with proximity if it is in danger of aggroing another mob (yeah remember how we used to do that in sol b guys, think with me, think)...run back to camp in 3rd person makng sure no pops or roamer If so, I'd circle mobs around below camp until one stops moving, which means he is throwing up from running in circles, or more probably rooted by the dr00d.<br>
<br>
Mob would enter camp shortly after me, I'd engage with just BoC and gimpy offhand and taunt at the start as usual, and because I had requested boon, would usually get an EB proc or two within 30 seconds, which would llow me to change to 2hander to take less ripost damage (my group needed nothing but perfect efficiency, so this change of weaps usually from the mobs 80% hp mark down helped a lot according to my parser). Because I had allow'd for two EB proc's along with the substantial melee damage and offhand proc's and initial taunt, I knew I was well ahead of the 2nd person in the aggro list of said mob...<br>
<br>
I knew this, how? because it was hitting me and not him/her, and secondly because I have played well since beta and know the capabilities and aggro generating xpectancies of different classes at different times under different circumstances. Frankly, you just know.<br>
<br>
Now somethng pisses me off when I am blamed for the drds death because a rot broke early. . .There had been a couple of deaths thrugh th group, and nothing that could of been avoided taking into account if people just stayed cool and did their role.<br>
<br>
I was asked where I bought my chards on ebay and for how much no matter how I tried to explain what I did above. You will also obsrve this is a true fact do do with aggro, as it is the predominant reason that a warrior can easily build and take over aggro on a mob with jst an AET ( accepted as 500 hate) and a taunt while ma just doesnt taunt for a tick or two. It is also why it is indescribably easy to outaggro a duel EB war with a mid range 2handed weapon in just a couple of lucky proc's or a few taunts in a row.<br>
<br>
K im getting bored. but main thing is, im sick to death of the kunark express/velks/pop highway to 60+ that leads people through stupendously easy experience for little or no knowledge or game mechanics indulgence for lack of a better word.<br>
<br>
It really is a sad fact, that a the tag of being 65, or 60 is no longer something to respect, but merely just something to idly pass by and wonder how many hours they spent in PoV (/wave meg5 etc, retards).<br>
<br>
Im not in any cicrumstances proclaiming superiority over these people, although in some instances you might call it that, although its just a game. I am merely just bewildered as to how you could go to nearly 60 and not realise some easy and simple facts about aggro. I was questioned as yo why I asked someone to root the mezzed mob etc. . . because I DONT want to sit there mashing taunt 5 times before I break mez, I'd rather have proximity aggro and let my stand alone dps do the job for me, whilst diminishing the mob's hp at the same time. I ask you, would you rather build aggro, or build aggro and kill a mob at the same time? Easy to see what I'd chose.<br>
<br>
Mayb Im just used to a different style of play, where if you let a mob near you it will kill you in 2 rounds. Or maybe its time for some people to stpep back and realise that pulling slingle mobs with 1 minute med breaks and saying please and thankyou after every mez, heal and fart is just bullsh1t when some people put LFG up to join a group, not a fu&lt;king slumber party.<br>
<br>
So I ask you warriors, has 4 years of paying delicate and careful consideration into my actions and their reactions when it comes to game mechanics been totaly flawed by the simple fact that I can destroy all my equip and just click taunt all day and hope for the best.<br>
<br>
To spam taunt, or not to spam taunt, that is the question. My answer is no.<br>
<br>
That is all<br>

<br>
You don't lose any realistic damage since you're just building hate out of camp instead of in it, during a period when they shouldn't really be nuking, dotting, slowing etc anyway.<br>
<br>
If you have range damage dealers with a high chance of pulling taunt off you, mashing taunt can help too since due to your proximity they will often be above you on the hate list for a little while before the mob runs over to them (that's why you do it this way on raids).<br>
<br>

They have no concept how restricted our ability to generate aggro is, because any other class that was @#%$ up and broken as we are would have been having riots in the streets a la Monks.<br>
<br>
No, we're supposed to just suck it up, expansion after expansion, where they throw in little tweaks here and little tweaks there, claiming to be improving the situation, while designing the mobs to make the tweaks pretty much irrelevant.   We can cuss and curse at the stupidity of people who don't understand taunt and aggro control all day long, but the bottom line is there is NO class that requires such a detailed understanding of game mechanics just to do their @#%$ job.  Why should these people give a crap about how they have to do X or Y to help us do our jobs, when they can just get a Paladin or a Shadow Knight and forget about it?<br>

In my experience I would say the warrior is much easier overall due to more innate bonuses and less buttons to press and timing and rules to learn... (example: Shadowknights can both travel up and DOWN the hate list while warriors can only go UP save by dying, another example would be learning spellbased feign pulling... = art form) but when it comes to &quot;tanking&quot; the two are quite similar...  keep the mob beating on you and know the following points in order to do it.  Shadowknights have more tricks to keep hate....but it requires a much greater understanding of what you are doing to make it work to your benefit for very long.  Warriors have an easier time not dying/losing hate.<br>
<br>
The taunt button when pressed runs a check against the level differential between you and the mob and your taunt skill.  If successful, the taunt button moves you to the HIGHEST position in the mobs hate list and changes your numerical figure to be OLDHIGHEST+1... (there are now some who figure that its more than +1 now, but no one can really know for sure) That means if someone is 1000 points higher than you that you would gain 1001 hate with a single successful press. (success seems to be 60-80% depending on mob level for a 65 Shadowknight -this is without spellcasting)<br>
<br>
Now assuming you have attack on, and are closest to the mob, your melee damage potential will raise you higher in numerical value...  but note the rogue next to him is also building hate... and the Wizard behind him...  A warriors job is to stay higher on the positional list than those two...<br>
<br>
Now lets throw in yet another curve.... range seems to currently affect how much of that numerical hate is &quot;considered&quot; by a mob in order to place them on the positional hate list. (the mob usually beats on the top guy on the POSITIONAL list... and checks at some unknown time period for who it should be beating on)<br>
<br>
When the &quot;considered&quot; numerical value exceeds the value of the next highest, the positional value will change and the mob will begin hitting the new hate leader at the next hatelist check.<br>
<br>
Lets say warrior_01 has aggro at 3000 aggro, and wiz_01 nukes for 500 hate when he is at 3500aggro (2600 seen due to range), the wiz has a chance to take aggro because he is 100 points ahead... but if the &quot;listcheck&quot; doesn't come up before the warrior closes the hate gap, the mob won't change targets.  if the mob checks during this time, the mob will either summon or move towards the wizard...  <br>
<br>
lets say the mob moves closer to the wizard and makes it so that the range modifier is lessened now..  making the wizard's &quot;considered&quot; hate value 3700...  the warrior must succeed at TAUNT skill or the wizard is soon going to be 1000 points ahead and guaranteed to be beat on until low HP, and then frenzied on (+insane number of considered hate)  If TAUNT is successful, the warrior gains the CONSIDERED value +1....  but if the mob moves closer to the wiz again, he is going to have a chance to lose it once more!<br>
<br>
mashing taunt is dumb because of the TIMING of pressing it... it has a reuse time... and that 6 seconds of not begin able to press it means the mob gets away and makes a puddle out of the &quot;insert robed class here&quot; because of the limited range on TAUNT and the fact that the mob is remembering just how much he hates that robe.  Remember TAUNT skill has a maximum effective range, and when the mob quads for 1000, anyone without a CH cycle on them is dead in a hurry.<br>
<br>
there is NO skill or spell in the game better at generating snap-hate than TAUNT...  the problem is that most people don't understand it, and forget it has this problem about range and timing.<br>
<br>
Taunt is SO much better than 200 hate...  <br>
<br>
Shadowknights have spells that deal 600 hate irresistable...  Taunt is capable of SO much more.<br>
<br>
Slow is around 1000 hate (two casts of the 510pt SK hate spell pulls off of a slow)<br>
<br>
mez is around 500-600 ish<br>
<br>
Snare is around 1000ish (two casts of 510)<br>
<br>
Remember that spells such as EB and Terror are NUMERICAL hate.... not positional....  thus its only considered to raise you in the positional list if your numerical value is greater than someone else's.<br>
<br>
taunt is POSITIONAL and thus gives a variable amount of hate.<br>

Simple test, your assumption is wrong. Warriors can both travel up and down the hatelist, however both can be counter productive in different situations.<br>
<br>

Taunt adds a variable amount of hate...  not a fixed number...<br>
<br>
this is easy to test as well...<br>
<br>
spend the whole fight sitting on your butt...  then hit the taunt button...  oh look! a successful taunt means YOU are the target!<br>
<br>
I honestly hope the amount added above the positional leader is more than 1 hate point...  but no one knows for sure because no one can test it...  your experiment is flawed in the fact it assumes 1damage = 1 hate...<br>
We don't know that.  <br>
(someone write this down, Varaho and I agreed on something!)<br>
<br>
To say that it &quot;scales&quot; with level is true only in the fact that success rate has been linked to level difference by SOE.  The amount above the positional leader no one really knows.<br>
<br>
I honestly hope you are right....  but to say that I am wrong with no proof is just a tad presumptuous don't you think?<br>
<br>
In this case you are trying to argue numerical hate figures with a player who's main can actually add documented numerical values of hate when you cannot...<br>
<br>
once again...  a tad presumptuous.<br>
<br>
I honestly hope you have better than your flawed experiment or more information...<br>

Spear, he can pull agro from me. I was using a Lammy in main hand and FB in off hand. <br>
<br>
With a higher level monk (61), I can hold agro, but I have to hit taunt quite often, not repeatedly, but often. I hold off on taunt when about to get a major heal and hit taunt right after the health bar starts moving up. I use /shield to pull agro off the casters when taunt won't land or won't work on the mob.<br>
<br>
In addition I use disarm, kick and beg as often as I can without using taunt if I can....<br>
<br>
Another thing I have noticed.. is when I am assisting.. even with a pally as tank, and we are on a casting mob, /kick will pull agro pretty fast by itself. I would guess that is the caster gets mad when interupted, but I don't know.<br>
<br>
I don't mind when a pally wants to tank. Have little choice really... but it is frustrating when assigned a tanking role in a raid (SA in small ones) and a pally is in the mix, casting stuns happily along, wasting the groups mana, and sometimes I can wrestle agro back, but usually I change to higher damage weapons so the healers aren't going nuts.<br>
<br>
But at my level, 55, I can't hold agro half the time, even in a well behaved group, using relatively fast weapons, no uber procs, and all the agro gaining tools I know of, including distance and position without taunting often. I did recently start using a Scimitar of the Ykesha in place of a lammy and it does help when it procs, but I still can't just use  taunt once or twice and hold agro.<br>
<br>
Am I doing something wrong?<br>

I would agree with this.  Save TAUNT for when the mobs turns abruptly.  Pressing TAUNT when you have agro doesnt do anything except make the TAUNT button unavailible for when its needed.<br>
<br>
When I fight PoS giants I regularly turn ATK off while I am waiting for that heal so I dont take as many ripostes (using 2hs epic with PB1)  I leave the TAUNT key availible incase somone grabs agro while my ATK is off.  Side note, I never kick anymore, something sucks about getting a 600 dmg riposte from a kick.  <br>
<br>
I seldom if ever loose agro for more then one round of atk or a quick TAUNT press, mob turns, I ATK and TAUNT, mob back on me, I turn ATK off wait for heal, re ATK.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp. Im 62, im not uber but I group with some 65 monks, rogues, rangers and a pali with weapons far superior than my little 2hs epic and I rarely have any issues, even when those darn Ocean Giants proc Feighn Death on me. <p><center><IMG SRC="http://home.cfl.rr.com/bastionamici/Sigs/Faederya_Faedilenew.gif" WIDTH=490 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=0 USEMAP="#Faederya_Faedilenew.gif">

For a very long time I didn't know how taunt worked, and I thought it just added a set amount of agroe every time I pushed it (which was what I was taught).<br>
<br>
After reading this and NOT just blowing taunt every time it comes up, I hold agroe much better then before.<br>

As I stated the figours, were just made up, as a factor to make people understand the general idea.<br>
<br>
I can say though that taunt in my opinion, is an added aggro numeric value. Not a one way trip to the top of the hate list... Was playing around last night PLing a freind. <br>
Zone: Velks Lab<br>
Mobs: Random Junk<br>
Char/equip: 65war 190ish aa, blade of war 71% haste self buffed.<br>
<br>
I was pling a lower level war friend for 30 mins or so, and encountered this one tidbit. If I melee'd a mob for 20 seconds, down to 50% or so. . .The other war when I asked him, could not taunt it off me until he had pressed taunt an average of 8 times. . .<br>
<br>
Minimal amount of times he clicked it before gaining aggro was 4, max was 16 I beleive.<br>
<br>
Your not going to tell me that over about 15 mobs, he consecutivly failed taunt 7 times on average....Hence he was building aggro, towards myself and beyond...<br>
<br>
The same occured on the last few mobs if I only did about 20% damage before he started taunting (i was not taunting and he was not meleeing prior either), which leads me to the conclusion that there is also a hate cap. Something I have speculated for four years, and seen in practice almost every day.<br>
<br>
I dont know the figours and for the life of me, couldnt care less what they are. But I do know that in every small test I do no matter what the class, I get the same sort of results.<br>
<br>
I dont know how the above poste\r said he can succesfully taunt aggro away from someone after just sitting and watching them beat the crap through it. It just does not seem logical in the programming and in practice. If I am on a friends war, and want to turn AoW around on enrage so he kills everyone (its good for a laugh, trust me). In the now 20ish times I have done it, I have never goten aggro until at least the fifth or sixth taunt at least...Not rock solid, but if your trying to claim that your supposed taunt check fails THAT often, it would be more efficient to just save you energy and type rude emotes at the mob instead of clicking taunt because it only works 5% of the time.<br>
<br>
It just doesnt make sence. In summary, spamming Taunt sucks, and (in my opinion) taunt is not a one way trip to the top of the hate list. I know at times it can seem like this as you can be just below on the hate list than the person who has aggro, and as such, move up easily /shrug, seems to fit for me. <br>
<br>
Try this...<br>
<br>
Equip no weapons and just use your fists, and try to hold aggro over a 65 rogue with ifir. . .you can press taunt all you like, but not even for a split second wil the mob turn to you...<br>

I don't ask that to imply that being 60+ somehow makes a person a better player - only to point out that some things(like the taunt button) just plain work differently. Your arguments would seem reasonable if coming from a warrior without post-60 experience.<br>
<br>
I 2-box an enchanter(64) and a warrior(65) about 90% of the time. Ever since I hit 60(or maybe it starts working at 61 - someone here can correct me) on the war, I have been able to do the following.<br>
<br>
Pull a mob to camp (usually some random camp in PoV), cast (Howl of Tashan) immediately, then taunt the split second after it lands. As soon as the taunt button refreshes, cast (Forlorn Deeds), then taunt the split second after it lands. The mob turns nearly every taunt. And there is no way that I am overcoming tash-hate and slow-hate with whatever dps i'm putting out in those 6+ seconds between taunts. As an added bonus, I now have solid aggro due to acquiring tash+slow hate.<br>
<br>
So, 1) you are right, spamming taunt doesn't do much but 2) you are absolutely wrong in thinking taunt is numerical.<br>

I guess your lucky, cuz even when I keep taunt for after I cast tash, the mob almost always goes straight for the enchanter.<br>

What I do, is pull, engage the mob, then slow without tashing, since the resist rate at 65 are much lower, and start cheal.<br>
<br>
Playing the slower, and healer makes ya understand a lot about whats going on.<br>
<br>
If I get an early EB proc, I just tash/slow right away as I will not get the enchanter beaten to a pulp.<br>

With all the aa, and hp I've gotten recently, its just smart to take the time to build aggro before tashing/slowing.<br>

Sometimes the mobs react weirdly, I'll get 2 EB proc, and then tash, and the mob will run for the enchanter...<br>
<br>
My only firm conclusion on aggro, is to never take anything for granted. <p>Overlord of the brell server<br>
