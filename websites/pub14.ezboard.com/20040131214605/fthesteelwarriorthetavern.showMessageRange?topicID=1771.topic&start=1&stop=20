<br>
I have a pretty general question for all of you in higher end guilds.<br>
<br>
I am currently a proud member of a very friendly yet growing guild.  We pretty much have a NBG raid loot policy.  My question is what really defines NEED?  On a recent guild/ally raid in Kael, we had a corroded BP drop.   There were like 10-15 plate class raiders there.  Our MA was a lvl 60 warrior that still does not have Champions BP i believe, also had a 60 SK also.  A few others 55+ including me.  <br>
<br>
Of course every plate class who was a main got to roll. And a 51 cleric won.  The cleric winning is not why I am concerned, she is valuable ally and I congratulate her.  <br>
<br>
My question is should my guild perhaps start changing some of its loot policies so that we can better equp those that need upgrades, i.e I personally think the BP should have gone to the 60 Warrior or SK.<br>
<br>
Im not trying to be biased or anything, in fact I think a general NBG loot policy is perhaps the fairest, especiall for guild like mine.  Im just trying to learn how best to suggest changes that could benifit my guild as a whole?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>

<br>
if you are a growing guild, you should try to equip some key ppl that show to all raid(war, cleric, shammy and chanter). then you will be able to raid more easily and get more loot. on my side, i would have award to your warrior if he is always on cuz more AC/HP he got, better it is for your cleric. that mean less heal and easier to tank mobs.<br>

We started off farming Kael to equip everyone in that stuff, and I figured that soon we'd move on to ToV.  Weeks turned into months in kael, and moral started to decline, because BP's kept getting awarded to guests, level 51's and clerics with hate BP's.<br>
<br>
The main tank for that guild was an incredible man..he knew his stuff in every zone in the game at the time, he grinded XP constantly and he was a very capable raid leader...but he saw BP after BP go to people who had been in the guild a week or people it didn't benefit as much as the MT.  He left to join the server's uberguild, and the process of equipping a MT started all over again (I was playing my necro at the time).  I started saying that maybe we should look into officer awarded loot, because at the rate we were going we were NEVER going to get out of Kael.  Quite a few people agreed with me, but the guild leadership didn't.  I quit a couple days later, after telling them they'd spend the rest of their days farming Kael.<br>
<br>
Guild broke up 2 months after that, and most people quit EQ.  It was a goddamned shame because they were the best people I've ever played EQ with..ruined by random loot. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Marshall Haass Wolvesbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
My guild is in the exact same situation as yours in terms of raiding. The raid loot policy was a very very difficult one to decide upon. After much discussion among the officers and guild members, here is what we decided upon:<br>
<br>
Mostly NBG/ random but with reserved items in special need. Meaning the next plate BP that drops goes to the MT. After that, all other plate BP's will be rolled on by all plate classes present.<br>
<br>
As far as invites to raids are concerned, I think it is very wise to have a guild only loot policy unless you NEED the guests you are inviting. Let any guest know that they are there for faction only and will only get an armor drop if everyone passes. <br>
<br>
I am the guild MT and still have yet to get a BP drop since we went to this new loot policy (had two drop before the change). <br>
<br>
The officer awarded loot system will never work, too many people will feel slighted and too many people will feel that favorites will be played, whether real or not.<br>
<br>
DKP is the best way to go but it can be a very difficult transition. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=174524"> Keane Abrams </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It rewards effort unevenly and can give more rewards to lower contributors, sometimes continuosly.  If you're going to use random then the guild really needs to be a tight knit group of people who really look out for each other and are willing to make sacrifices if its in the best interest of the whole.  Its hard to find a large group of people willing to be that giving.<br>
<br>
Officer awarded loot can work, if the officers are fair and even handed.  If they know the membership well and know what the needs of the membership are.  However, many times officer awarded loot can degenerate into politics, which tends to undermine the faith of the membership in the fairness and even handedness of the awards.  Also, you'll sometimes have particularly selfish or self centered people make a huge fuss because they didn't get something they thought they had coming, which causes a lot of drama with in the guild.  It can work, but its hard to administer.<br>
<br>
Point systems work and tend to be the system the least open to challenges of unfairness or politics.  They also tend to really over load the people who attend raids the most with more loot than they need.  Rather than having gear spread out somewhat equally amongst the membership with perhaps a few of the choicest pieces on your strongest raid contributors, what can often happen is you'll get a core crew of raiders who get upgrade after upgrade while those with a lower attendance receive fewer upgrades and receive less desirable items.  Its fair, but not necessarily in the long term best interests of the guild in that the core raiders will consistantly receive small upgrades while those for whom it would have been a huge upgrade go without.  This is particularly true when the items involved are no drop.<br>

I personally believe that you should merit all loot.  Up to a point though.<br>
<br>
If you are on your first Kael Arena raid and a quest item drops, I think it's important to merit them so people get used to it.  Although the hard part is comming up with a way to value merit.<br>
<br>
At the same time, if your guild is clearing for vindicator, and some piece of quest armor drops, it's ok to random it, unless there is a real need for it.<br>
<br>
Or, there's always good ole DKP..../not touching that one with a 10' pole<br>
<br>
Loot is good because it's a reward for a challenge, and allows you the opertunity to improve and seek greater challenges.  At the same time, Like Haas points out, it can easily shred a guild to pieces.  But I do agree, full random, and officer decisions suck =/  <br>
<br>

<br>
I am in a guild which has recently moved from a merit based system (where loot was awared to ppl on a NBG basis by the officers) to a Point based system (where points are awarded for each raid u attend.<br>
<br>
It has made a major positive impact on the guild, Dramatically increased raid attendance, and we have moved on to much harder targets in a very short space of time.<br>
<br>
This is simply because our raid attendance has increased so much.<br>
<br>
I would definetly recommend you look into this option.<br>

Raids and pure /randoms do NOT mix!<br>
<br>
Sorry if I sound like a prick... but a cleric getting a velious bp before the main tank, when said tank is wearing something below PoH quality.. WTF?!  Sure, right click mark of karn is nice and all, and the stats are sweet for clerics.  But I believe the GUILD would have probably gotten more use out of that BP if they had given it to the main tank.  That is assuming that the tank is often around and there when he/she is NEEDED.  &quot;Merit&quot; systems are much less frustrating.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b><i><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75761>Kiyallmane Bloodcry</a></i></b><br>

<br>
It's where you see the same group of people (who go on ever raid mind you) get essentially every peice of worth while loot.<br>
<br>
Example - killing the CS dragon, CoCW drops, you have many melee there, quite a few who are wearing FBSS or equal level haste.  Several who have CoF (and don't want CoCW), and maybe one or two who already have equal haste, but want the cloak for the other stats.  Obviously the people who have FBSS level haste need it the most (it's the largest upgrade for them, and for guild, the people who already have equivalent level haste will not make a bit of diff to a raid if they have whatever cloak they have on now, or this other cloak with some extra +mana).  Yet, somehow, the cloak ends up going to the one person who already has similar level haste, and just wanted it for the stats.  Why?  Because they are in the magical &quot;top 10&quot; who much receive anything remotely good if they have any interest in it.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not trying to say that those who raid all the time should get the same amount or less then other people, who don't raid as much.  But say I've been raiding hard with the guild for 6 months, and someone else (same class) has been for 8 months (since guild start) and they are in the &quot;top 10&quot; because of those two months.  Sure, they deserve more loot them me over all (they had two months to get it also) but they don't deserve to get all of the best items for that class that drop, even when they are minor upgrades while I get nothing but scrap hand me downs.<br>
<br>
That's sorta where I see a well balanced DKP system comeing into play.  People who raid the most will get the items that they really need, but will not have enough points to gobble up everything that is a minor upgrade while the rest of the guild sits on their thumbs and rotates watching zone after zone go by with the same people getting everything (or most everything).<br>
<br>
DKP can also reinforce the &quot;top 10&quot; thing, if you give out lots of points for raids, and have relatively low item costs then those top 10 will get 90% of the loot, things that are minor upgrades to them but might be drastic upgrades to someone else, who has say, 5 less DKP or something.<br>
<br>
As soon as you lower the rewarded points for a raid, and/or up the item costs what you will start to see is that the top ten will start saving their points, they aren't going to spend points on some neck slot with +5 more HP if it means they might not get that really sweet weapon they have been wanting, so you get someone else who gets that item and it's +55 extra hp, 10 save all, whatever.  A substantial increase rather then a minor one.  You also have more people in general happy in the guild, and stick to the &quot;more put in = more you take out&quot;.<br>
<br>
Only thing with DKP is you need people who will keep the database updated, and you need to let everyone know when you start it that item costs and raid rewards might not be set in stone yet as you work out the kinks.<br>
<br>
As many have said (and mostly rightly so) pure /random really tends to blow.  Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't, and there are some people who always seem to win the randoms, and others who always seem to loose.  The one benefit to pure random is there is never an issue over who gets it, and if your guild members have patience you all can (eventually) get what you want, with no possible favortism other then by EQ's random number generator.<br>
<br>
An interesting idea for a loot system I have had runs basically like this:<br>
1) anyone can lead a raid, to anywhere, whenever they want.<br>
2) all loot will be assigned by the raid leader to anyone the raid leader sees fit (for any reason).<br>
3) raid attendance is not required.<br>
4) coercing people (or trying to) into joining a raid is not allowed.<br>
<br>
ideally what this would lead to would be people not attending raids (or leaving raids early) of someone who is a real dick about loot distro, there by weeding out the morons... sort of natural selection, in a raiding/loot distro world.  Also, if anyone is unhappy with the amount of loot they are getting, all they need to do is lead more raids, and assign loot fairly enough that people don't feel they are just hogging everything to themselves.<br>
<br>
However, what it would probably lead to is no one going to a raid untill it was lead by themselves or a &quot;buddy&quot; of theirs, lots of people whining that they can't lead a raid and aren't getting any loot if they don't, lots of greedy folk who try to lead raid after raid assigning only to their own personal &quot;top 10&quot; etc... but if you have a really friendly guild this idea might work, I've not had a possibility to test it out much.<br>
<br>
The other thing is mobs/raids that you just can't plan, because if someone spots it you need to rush or another guild will grab it.  On these it obviously would not do to have it be whoever first spotted it, you'd end up with 50 checkers all with hotkeys &quot;/gu Zlandi up, i called it, it's my raid!&quot; or whatever mobs you are fighting/spotting for.  So a rotation of sorts could work on these, people sign up for the mob to lead it.  a list of sorts... if someone gets poor attendance (not enough to kill it, so you lose to another guild) say 3 times then you can yank their privilidge to lead that raid for a month, or two, or something to keep guild from loseing it all time.  Again, if you have a reasonable guild then this shouldn't be too much of an issue.<br>
<br>
The other bit is people who would be fair at distro'ing loot but are lacking in leadership skills.  What you could do is allow anyone to &quot;claim loot distro right&quot; for a raid, but always have one of several people lead the raid.  That would help keep consistancy of leadership, while retaining the beneficial loot distro atmosphere.  Or allow sort of &quot;pinch raid leaders&quot; where the loot person can elect someone else to lead the raid, and then do loot but no leading themselves.<br>
<br>
Sorry the post is this long, but loot tends to be a huge problem in this game and I'm always interested in seeing what people think about diff systems, and wouldn't mind seeing what people say bout the little one i have here (I have never seen it implemented on a large scale for a guild, meaning more then just a couple raids like that, because no one really considors it seriously).  I have a feeling though that it is an idea that looks alright on paper, but would not be put into practice how it was intended (think true marxist social theory vs. the USSR, different to the point of being largely unrelated, but still catagorised by many people, rightly or wrongly, as being &quot;communism&quot; and thought of as being equal).  Sorry to bring RL political mentions into it, but it's the only example I could think of off the top of my head of something that was one way in theory, and got carried out completely differently.<br>
<br>
Anyway, hope your guild finds a system that keeps everyone happy, not a whole lot sucks more in EQ then loot issues ripping up a good guild.  and again sorry for lenght ^_^;; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=diedraxev>DiedraXev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/03 4:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1771.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Raid loot policies and guild progression</span><hr size=1> another thought upon rereading the origonal post.  &quot;Need&quot; tends to be defined in different ways by different people, which can lead to problems.<br>
<br>
Some people define &quot;need&quot; as &quot;what would help the guild the most&quot; and other people define &quot;need&quot; as &quot;who will this be the biggest upgrade for?&quot;<br>
<br>
I am going to assume that it is fairly obvious that a guild as a whole needs to have several things to get very far.  at least one cleric epic, on an active cleric, and at least one (if not several) well equipped tanks who are also active.  So, the one defination of &quot;need&quot; (guild-centric) would go for upgradeing the tanks first, and getting clerics their epics before others (at least until guild has one or more at their disposial).<br>
<br>
The other way people define &quot;need&quot; would be basically whoever has the crappiest stuff gets the best stuff.<br>
<br>
Sometimes people use sort of a hybrid defination where they want it to do as much help as it can to the guild but also be as large of an upgrade as possible.<br>
<br>
At anyrate, if your guild is having problems with what &quot;need&quot; means, I'd suggest hammering out what defination of &quot;need&quot; your guild wants to use with your guild, as it can validly mean several different things, includeing I am sure things I have not mentioned here.<br>

<br>
Random drops, but modify each person's random by the number of usable items they lost out on - subtract x number of items from the person's current tally when awarded an item.<br>
<br>
5 plate classes are on a raid and a plate item drops, they each random for it - however person 1 and 2 have seen 4 and 5 drops that they haven't won and they'd random like:<br>
<br>
1: /ran 40 140<br>
2: /ran 50 150<br>
3-5: /ran 100<br>
<br>
Simple system that rewards the people who show up continually, without getting too bogged down in the intricacies of a full blown DKP system. Could also just have the officers decide on loot though, that's what has worked for us since early Velious. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions ~ Team Headstart</a></i> <br>

Random is fun if you like taking chances. Sucks for the losers though; so random for the most part doesn't work.<br>
Merit is nice; but damn the workload that went along with it. I was part of the Loot Council in my old guild ( the one rolsdar is in now ); and before, during, after, during work, sitting at home at 3am checking the attendances and seeing who needed what, and more other things that led to the demise of myself and overall the entire LC merit system. It was just too time-consuming playing EQ the sam amount of time that you spent at work and doing the logs and legwork of making sure the guild grew progressively on the same playing field.<br>
Points system is where it's at for any guild who spends a majority of their time raiding. You have the player-base. You have the amount of raids per week to hit things up, you have an easy system of managing 60-80 people guilds with a simple flick of the screenshot button and some typing afterwards, and its most benefiting factor is awarding those people who put their time in and be rewarded as compared to the people who get carried along and do nothing to contribute to a greater cause. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://publish.hometown.aol.com/crushr85/myhomepage/max.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khumak>Khumak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 211<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/03 11:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1771.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Raid loot policies and guild progression</span><hr size=1> Open lotto on guild raids is just flat out retarded.  The distribution of loot in a system like that gives no regard whatsoever to fairness or merit.  Often you get situations like some of the above people mentioned where people who regularly show up for all the raids consistently lose all the lottos and just end up leaving in frustration.<br>
<br>
A pure merit system where the officers default everything to whoever they decide should get it can work but only if the officers are completely fair about it and everyone in the guild trusts their judgement.  That's pretty rare IMHO.  In most cases a system like that degenerates into a good old boy system where the core members get all the good stuff and everyone else gets leftovers.<br>
<br>
With a points based system the old timers do have first shot at everything, but new people that regularly attend raids and save up their points can get the good stuff too.  As other people mentioned a points system can also degrade into a state where the old timers get all the good stuff and everyone else gets scraps.  The way around this is to make the point values on items high enough that people who win small upgrades frequently end up spending so many points that they fall into the same point category as the new recruits.  That encourages people to spend points on big upgrades and forgoe the insignificant ones.<br>
<br>
As an example, my guild uses sort of a combination point/lotto system.  We have tiers based on points and when something drops anyone within 4 tiers of the highest to enter the lotto can roll on it.  The tiers are worth increasingly more points so the first tiers are easy to climb through and the final tiers are much harder.  So old timers who don't spend their points frivolously can lock people out of rolling on stuff they really want, but by the same token new recruits that save up their points can climb the tiers and eventually roll against the old timers.<br>
<br>
I am fairly new to my guild, but have resolved to only spend points on the stuff I really want.  Because of this out of a roster of about 12 warriors there are only 2 that I can't roll against after only being in the guild 2 months.  By the same token since I am still in a relatively low tier every upgrade I get knocks me back down significantly in tiers.  I won a BoC recently and it cost me half my points and dropped me 3 tiers.  That basically put me out of the running for anything else I wanted for about 3 weeks but I've saved my points and now I'm back in the running again uless the 2 old timers I can't roll against yet want it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=472195">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Random is a good way to start out a guild but once you start to raid you need to dump that. Merit works well for some but how do you do that without any bias? Points works best imo because you take something away at the end of the raid even if you didn't win something and it motivates people to attend more often.

<br>
True enough, but it can lead to overloading those working harder/more with significantly more loot than they need.  One idea that seems to work is to add a counter balance to it.  The guild I'm in uses a ratio.  The number of raids you've attended is divided by the number of loot items you've recieved.  You earn points for raid attendance as normal, however each item that drops is assigned a point value which will be deducted from your total points if you are allowed to loot.  If more than one person is interested in the item then the one with the highest ratio (that is the person with the fewest looted items for the number of raids they've attended) is given the opportunity to loot.<br>
<br>
Here is an example:  Jack has been to 10 raids and has looted 3 items.  Jill has been to 7 raids and has looted 1 item.  Jack's ratio is 3.  Jill's ratio is 7.  If a 4 point item drops and both Jack and Jill have at least 4 points accumulated and want the drop, Jill will get it before Jack because of her ratio.<br>
<br>
This encourages people to only bid on those upgrades they find particularly desireable since they may not have a high enough ratio, even if they have the points, for something they really want the next raid.  Fewer loots overall increases the chances you'll get what you really want when it drops.<br>
<br>
Yes, sometimes people with more accumulated points won't get their heart's desire because someone with fewer points has a higher ratio.  But more points will still lead to more loot in the long run.  <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>
