Losing a pet costs about 700 mana fully buffed. With SCM3 I could probably turn 700 mana with horse to 4 SoFBs, or about 4400 dmg with immaculate resist conditions. <br>

I would wager that most warriors DO NOT wait for a red wall of spam to notice &quot;hey, this mob has enraged.&quot;  Doing that leads to our deaths.  Once you die a few times you begin to notice things like &quot;Hey, mobs enrage at 10% health&quot; and when to anticipate it.<br>
<br>
Maybe after losing your 700 mana pet a few times, you'd learn to notice it too.  It's not the same as being at your bind point, but it should still give you time to think about it during that 15 second cast time eh?<br>
<br>
Take responsibility for your own crap.  I don't blame clerics when I die to an enrage, and I don't expect to be blamed because you can't hit a hotkey. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Marshall Haass Wolvesbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

(and that's assuming each proc only hits for 2/3 dmg) <br>
<br>
i'm the puller in my grp in HoH half the time, pull with mala and the shammy can slow as soon as the mob is in camp. i leave camp to pull before the mob enrages. i don't see when enrage hits and if i back my pet off before i leave that's alot of dmg that the grp is losing.  the tank in the grp generally works with me so i don't lose my pet to every mob and i love this situation.  when he doesn't work with me, i stop pulling until the mob enrages and i back off my pet and then pull.  but they don't like it when there is a lull in camp so they ask me to pull faster. and then i explain why i'm pulling slower than usual, and then the tank tries to work with me. its not that hard to turn a mob, takes all of 2 seconds, i'm not asking you to move it across the room, i'm  just asking you to turn it just a little bit.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=99608">Daetien</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khumak>Khumak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/02 11:23:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2557.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: enrage</span><hr size=1> You make a good point Daetien.  I don't think most tanks are used to grouping with pet casters much and just never think about it.  Other than to laugh when all the pets die every time the mobs enrage.  I always make an effort to keep the pets behind the mob but I tend to get lazy about it when I'm getting tired.<br>
<br>
My biggest complaint is trying to pull a mob into position when there's a pet on it.  Do most pet casters tell their pets not to taunt when grouped and it's just the pet dps that keeps the mob stuck on it?  I have a hell of a time moving a mob that has a pet on it.<br>
<br>
Then there's the issue of slow.  Doesn't matter how good I have the mob positioned, as soon as someone casts slow it's on the slower.  If they're a good slower they're standing right next to me when they do it but most people I've grouped with don't.  Which means the mob ping pongs from me to the slower, to the healer before I can get it repositioned. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85547">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Well, it's a noble sentiment, but unfortunately, the VAST majority of pet classes, warriors and EQ players in general do not read these boards.  If you want to get some cooperation going, you have to do it on a one by one basis with everyone you group with, there's no other way to do it.<br>
<br>
You're preaching to the choir here.  The regular messageboard posters are for the most part experienced and knowledgable players, and if they're not, they're at least quick learning and easy to reason with.  We, of course, are not the people you're grouping with every nite.  The people you are grouping with are in science class right now :P<br>
<br>
Oh, and when I was playing my necro, I knew when the stuff was going to enrage, and I planned for it.  If I was casting a spell near the time, I had /pet back off typed in just waiting to hit the enter key the second that enrage message hit.  I know hotkeys don't work when you're casting, so plan for it.  In a pickup environment, things rarely go as smoothly as we'd like, and after awhile, I just stop trying.  People slow from across the room, casting run around like little girls, clerics heal the MT after his first swing on the mob...that crap happens, and your warrior has little to no recourse to change any of it.  Often times it takes 5 taunts for me to turn the mob back on me, to say nothing of repositioning said mob.<br>
<br>
If you want the mobs positioned a certain way, educate your group.  You will find yourself educating every damned group you're in for awhile, but after your groups start recycling and you see the same people over and over again, you'll be better off for it.  This is very much the same thing intelligent people of all classes do.  After seeing my cleric CH me at half life in an easy xp camp all nite, and then slow us down due to low mana, i'm not going to sit idly by and not let them know that I have 6500hp and i'm perfectly fine to start the CH after I go berserk.  If you've got a problem with your group, tell your group.  This board won't fix your problems. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Marshall Haass Wolvesbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
Mobs do give out a really nifty message when they are enraged: Mob_01 has become ENRAGED! this usually happens at 10% health (I have seen it happen at other times on one or two mobs) and its default color is bright red. <br>
<br>
If a pet caster can't pay enough attention to a fight to notice that message, then it really is time to find a replacement for them. I don't feel sympathy for a pet killed to enrage. It is not my job to keep that pet alive.<br>
<br>
It is my job to make sure the mob is paying attention to me and not the cleric, shaman, or enchanter and to put the mob into a place where the group can get behind it if need be and where we wont get adds. <br>
<br>
If that means the person playing a pet class has to do more than hit one button per fight before going back to watching tv or the auction channel, then so be it. <br>
<br>
The MT should not be the only person haveing to pay attention to what they are doing. If a group member doesn't want to pay attention to the combat, it is time for that group member to take a hike. <p>Aveen Lucenthawk<br>

<br>
I think what you're misunderstanding is a couple of things.  1, warriors do not position mobs well.  Our taunt is usually defined as a button, which works ~20% of the time.   This is not enough aggro to position a mob.  Couple that fact with retard casters running around, people slowing and moving mobs, and general melee pushing, and it's not as easy as you'd like to believe.<br>
<br>
Second, we've already got our hands full keeping tabs on things we need to keep tabs on.  You hit /pet attack and you nuke.  We're not here to control your pets, that's your job.  Silveflank belt + typing /pet attack during the cast is a surefire way to get your pet where you want him, when you want him.<br>

I am sorry, I had a good laugh at this. I think that is 'ok' to have that opinion, and it puts you into the realm of the more 'average' warrior rather than the Synergetic warriors I happen to be used to. Belittleing a pet class 'for hitting a button' is really rather silly, it is not as if you are a playing a Bard on Fiber Optics twisting 5 songs now is it ?<br>
<br>
As a tank as well as a cleric and a Mage, I can tell you the best groups are the ones that plays on each others strengths, and sometimes the position of a mob to a pet/party is greater achieved by the MT rather than the Mage/BL/Necro. Heck the really good tanks I know control the entire position of the fight so that all pets are behind the mob, not just the rogue pets ... clearly however that is not you. <br>

When this happens the pets, monks, rogues and rangers attacking from the back of the mob just keep on grinding out damage and agro.  This frequently causes even well positioned mobs to flip around when enraged so that pets die if they aren't quickly backed off.  In general I like pet casters to back off pets when the mob is at 10% life regardless if the pet is behind the mob or in front of it.  When mobs enrage and people have to turn off auto attack all sorts of strange things can happen.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=179608">Gartuff</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> &lt;Ex Tempore&gt;<br>

This comes down to multiple classes helping each other in a group. I know most of what H0g wrote is well known to many tanks, but I think it was meant mostly as an educational tool. I can tell you, when a Warrior goes the extra mile, I remember his/her name, if they do not ... no big deal, he/she gets remembered as another nameless/faceless person in the grand scheme of Everquest :P )<br>

(and yes, i am used to grping with very very well equipped warriors, ssra/vt equipped, and now pop equipped to some degree)  i don't really care where the mob is standing, all i'm asking is to spend the extra second turning the mob around a bit.<br>
<br>
picking on pet classes for being lazy /pet attack and walk away from keyboard is kinda silly.... how many tanks simply turn on auto attack and wander off? i've seen it MANY times.  pet classes in general have to pay a fair amount of attention to everything their pet does, especially indoors.  pets tend to push mobs, as you have noticed, and it may be necessary to back that pet off at any time to avoid pushing a mob off a ledge, or into aggro range of another mob. any decent pet caster knows where his pet is in relation to other mobs at all times.   i'm constantly doing things other than sending my pet in and nuking.  i ds, debuff, give out focus stuff (and yes, people will still ask for focus stuff hours after they have been grped with me), summon t rods, etc.  warriors do stuff during battle too. the great warriors are the ones who know where other mobs are in relation to the one they are on, keep track of mezzed mobs, turn the mob so pets attack from behind, keep aggro, avoids enrage, etc.  <br>
there is always a difference between a great player at his class and a decent player at his class.  a well played warrior is a joy for mages and other pet classes, as a well played mage should be a nice addition to any grp. mages and other pet classes do far more than some people realize, just like warriors do far more than some realize.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=99608">Daetien</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glatius2>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 606<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/02 4:48:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2557.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: enrage</span><hr size=1> Typically if I as the MT am trying to position the mob, the pets are my biggest hindrance.

<br>
Pet classes know that their pets hold agro pretty well don't they?  And sometimes this works against the MT.  Frequently I find that when I am with in combat range of a mob it will hit me.

<br>
1. Attack On.<br>
2. Taunt.<br>
3. Kick/Slam<br>
4. repeat 1 - 3 again.<br>
<br>
then you might want to seriously consider switching classes before you get everyone in your group killed.<br>
<br>
The game is slowly evolving into a game of tactics/strategies. Gone are the days of mindless zerging [aka. early Naggy/Vox raids].<br>
<br>
Positioning can often times make/break raids, xp-grinding. <br>
<br>
There are  2 ways to position a mob initially. Either:<br>
a) Engage the mob and have the pet-caster position pet and himself behind the mob, or<br>
b) Engage the mob and strafe to position the mob in between you and the pet.<br>
<br>
IMO, because you are the initial contact with the mob, you are in a much better and efficient position to position the mob. It's much faster, and you are more in control. If the pet pushes more than you do, then you are supposed to position yourself to keep mob in between you and pet. Pets are dumb. They don't off attack unless told to do so. It's up to you to maintain the position. It's much easier than getting the pet-caster to /pet attack off, then move pet, then /pet attack on.<br>
<br>
In the event that I try to move the mob somewhere else, but the pet has aggro, while I'm standing at another spot, I simply just SIT DOWN. More often than not, the mob comes for me. I just wait for it, then STAND, and engage again. The best part is that now the pet is behind the mob, where I want it. Easy.<br>
<br>
I've grouped extensively with pet-casters and hardly ever do the pets die [even to Enrage]. Times when pets die are often when we are killing the last mob, and the pet-caster just lets the pet die to Enrage.<br>
<br>
Of course, positioning is not just our responsiblity. I believe everyone plays a part in it, be it big or small.<br>
<br>
In my perma-group is always Monk, Cleric, Enchanter, and Warrior [me].<br>
<br>
When the Monk pulls, he runs directly past me, I tag the mob. He FDs once, and joins in the fight, immediately placing himself behind the mob. Because he pushes the mob more than me, I often turn the mob around, and he follows suit, constantly behind. If he steals aggro, he FDs immediately and I Taunt immediately. He stands and engages again. But what impresses me most is when the mob ENRAGES, my group Monk immediately FDs before engaging the mob again [this way, he resets his aggro level cos I'm not engaging while mob Enrages]. If the mob does enage on him, I immediately attack and Taunt, then off attack]<br>
<br>
My Cleric who gains aggro knows not to move around screaming her head off like a headless chicken. She stands her ground while we taunt it off her, or she immediately Divine Auras herself, removing aggro. Same goes for the Enchanter.<br>
<br>
It's a group effort IMO to maintain aggro. As for positioning, the MT [you in many cases], should be ready to take on the role to ensure the mob is placed properly for pet-casters to conveniently send their pets. It should also be the MT responsibility to ensure mob enrage on them and them alone. The other players should also have enough common sense not to be in front of the mob when it enrages.<br>
<br>
A lot of work? Yes. <br>
Does it make the encounter safer? Yes.<br>
Will your group live longer? Yes.<br>
Will it reduce downtime? Yes.<br>
Will you level faster? Yes.<br>
Is that good? Yes.<br>

<br>
My main's a shaman, in exp groups it's my job to slow, heal, and pull. If I have a pet up, and I'm out somewhere chain pulling, I would *hope* the tank can have enough sense to at least turn the mob before enrage if he/she couldn't manage to position before this point.<br>
<br>
It's not really difficult to position a pet, it takes 2 secs to straif around and back up 2 steps to let all pets, regardless of orginal positioning, to beat on the mob from the back. Don't want the mob pushed around? Fine, let pets attack from any angle you want... just make sure you position the mob before enrage.<br>
<br>
My biggest beef isn't even with pets -- my pet's damage is not an essential part of my role in an exp group. However, I'd really wish all melees would know by now that mobs tend to enrage at around 10% health. It's REALLY annoying having to root/dot 2 mobs as well as draging the dead melees' corpses to the nearest cleric for a res.<br>
<br>
One final point to end my bitching. Tier2+ mobs hit hard, therefore repostes from them are also hard, and one may conclude that taking less repostes = good. This, of course, means 2h weapons are preferable over DW (as long as you have similar quality weapons) in most cases. It's common sense, but there are wars out there who'd not give up DW for anything, and incidentally these are the same ones who manage to die to enrage every other mob.<br>
<br>
It's a good thing for them that res sticks are in the game, and it's a good thing for a group that they don't have to stop pulling while the war gets his 12th rez of the day. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=boinshar>Boinshar</A> at: 12/3/02 11:11:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glatius2>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 607<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/02 11:33:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2557.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: enrage</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This, of course, means 2h weapons are preferable over DW (as long as you have similar quality weapons) in most cases.

Its not that I am one against mob positioning agree very important. What I had tried to convey is you have about 2 percent of the warriors out there with HIGH HIGH taunt weapons that can actually drag a mob around while its enraged with attack off. <br>
<br>
Rest of us are you average maby have lucked out went to HoT and have decent AC and stats off said armor but ?? weapons. NO NO NO Hot does not = weapons. That being said when war cannot be first to engage mob as in pull means play catch up on agro. Then you have someone cast high agro across the room hoping as mob turns on them the war can hit taunt key and IT WORKS before mob is out of range. Both for weapons and for taunt button ( Yes TAUNT is a range factor) cant back away from mob and hit taunt.<br>
<br>
Pets unfortunatly have great ablity to follow a mob as it ping pongs most melee will admit we cant --- lag + distance of weapon range or taunt range ---.<br>
<br>
Other part is then mage pet shammy pet necro pet hum they are all on 3 different sides pushing mob into a corner only way to turn mob would be if you could run thru corner. As this is common seams then also is fact that the taunter then can NOT get enough agro to pull mob out of the corner since every time you back up OUT of range you add no agro. <br>
<br>
Mobs tend to stay stuck in corners ---<br>
<br>
I am definatly always trying to position mob best can under any set up but sometime 20 min. of chase mob strafe strafe mob and chase again means 1hr. break find new group do over . <br>
<br>
<br>
Well if I added more confusion to my first post actually not trying to.<br>

I play with a monk a lot, and this 1 monk inparticular moves mobs SO FREAKIN MUCH. It looks like we are dancing, I will pull, give him and the rogue the back and the mob will quickly start moving. So I spin, and they switch sides and we push the mob the other way. He does it so bad, that when we pulled Zelnithak, he told our group (2 groups, other group had MT) that he planned to spin Zelnithak 360 degrees. Now, I figured he would move Zelnithak, but no way in hell did I actually except what I saw as he spun that ugly thing 360 degrees around the MT. It got to the point where the MT just shouted out &quot;WTF?&quot;. <br>
<br>
Repositioning in EQ is lame because it is like the only movement you actually have to do in combat. If the combat was action oriented, I wouldn't mind repositioning, if we had to manually dodge each swing and make sure ours hit/etc, it would be awesome.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I always thought mages should have had a spell where they can temporarily take control of their pet. Like cast sight, but it allows you to move the pet anywhere you want. Of course, that would cause some problems at this point in the game, but earlier on it would have been awesome (pre-pet changes).<br>
<br>
When I position a mob, I position it knowing that the direction the rogue is facing, is the way the mob will be moving. If that is the side with the mage pet then fine, if it isn't then oh well. Where the mob moves to &gt; whether the pet has an ass. Of course this doesn't really matter in outdoor zones like most of the new planes. Plus, everytime you have to reposition, you lose DPS. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=2557.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=2557.topic&start=41&stop=59>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showPrevMessage?topicID=2557.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showNextMessage?topicID=2557.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2557.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.emailToFriend?topicID=2557.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.threadControl?topicID=2557.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2557.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2557.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
