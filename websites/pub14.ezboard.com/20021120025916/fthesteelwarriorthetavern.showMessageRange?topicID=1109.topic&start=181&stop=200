<br>
That's 24/22 vs. 12/17. Quite a difference eh?<br>
<br>
And that's not even the real issue; current warrior one handers were balanced assuming there would be something else offhand. Current Paladin/SK one handers were balanced assuming you do NOT have something offhand. If they force warriors to go without an offhander, then obviously our relative damage output is going be different than what was originally intended.<br>
<br>
BUT it may be the case that they have something in the pipeline to balance this out. As others have pointed out, we don't see the whole picture yet so arguing about it is futile. I'm in wait-and-see mode... except when I see ridiculous arguments hailed as a good job. <p><html>

<br>
I've been holding on since kunark while you or other members of the VI staff have blown sunshine up our arses about having everyone's best interest at heart. I'm sorry...but I just don't believe you any more nor do I have any faith whatsoever that you will put things right.<br>
<br>
Your changes have continually erroded the playability of the warrior character. I currently play my warrior because I'm too damn stubborn to quit after 59 levels and because my guildleader seems to think we need another lvl 60 warrior. So I continue to work on it. We won't need any more lvl 60 warriors once these shields go live.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, I can no longer find pickup groups pretty much at all during the day time on prexus. Even with guildmembers, it's difficult to do while most are at work/school. I can find them in the evening but usually only after waiting for an hour or more.  I'm sure that doesn't seem like a long time for those knights and other classes who used to or still do have to wait for hours for a group. I don't have that luxury...i can usually only play for an hour or two at a time.  As it stands now, I've been reduced to soloing, which I'm only able to do at all because I can two box with my 46 shaman.<br>
<br>
When this shield change goes live, and I say when becuase I feel fairly confident that it will, unless there are major warrior changes in the same patch, I'm done. So are alot of other warriors. I'm done in that I'll close the account my warrior is on and work on my 56 rogue. Others will do the same, play another character, or just slog it out out of sheer stubborness.<br>
<br>
Even if these shields are made to generate insane amounts of agro for warriors,  we will still lose at least 1/3 of our dps output. I'm sorry...but I made a warrior because I wanted to dish out damage as much as I took damage. I wanted to be able to stand there toe to toe with the badguy, spit in his eye and dare him to try to get past me. I gave up any ability to move rapidly or to heal myself and agreed to be totally dependent upon group members to get any experience for the privilege of being able to take this damage, stand there and smile, and give it right back. No matter how good these shields are for warriors, they will still have to be obtained unless the shields we have are retrofitted...oh, wait...we don't have shields. So every warrior who aspires to ever be an mt will be scrambling for the limited amount of shields that every melee will now want. The few decent shields that will be available will only be obtained from mobs I will never encounter and will be camped 24/7 by manaburn teams if they're dropable and uber guilds if they are not. Thus, my character, along with the thousands of other warriors not in a tier1 guild will all be done.<br>
<br>
By the way...I'm sorry Naubi, but you are either completely full of crap or the most clueless Sk I've ever met. I have never, against Any sk, been able to take agro from them unless the either died, feigned or outright Allowed me to. You also may be &quot;end game&quot; but most of us are not. I will never see most of the &quot;right clicky&quot; items you mentioned because manaburn teams won't allow me to, and I don't have the plat to buy them. I will never see SoD or BoC or any of those other little nifty items the tier1 people have been talking about. This is because I don't have time for the commitment necessary to be in a guild capable of getting them, nor do I want to be associtated with the type of loot whore dickheads that tend to find their way into those guilds (and this is no knock on the guilds themselves...they usually are mostly full of great people...but the selfish do tend gravitate towards them like moth's to a flame). Those &quot;little spells&quot; you have that you find so little utility in are the reason you are an sk and Not a warrior. No spells, Warrior...with spells, Hybrid. I'm really sick of the hybrid classes bitching about not being able to tank like warriors. You are not warriors...you have a price for admission...that price is that you lose tanking ability to be able to cast. You want to tank, lose the spells, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
The addition of shields as they are now on test will just further blur the line between knights and warriors in terms of tanking ability and place them even further above warriors as being more desireable both in xp groups and in raid situations.<br>

But I personally think its silly that if a warrior wields a (NTOV weapon) 12/17 and a 14/24 (Red epic) , He will do the SAME dps as a Paladin/SK wielding a (NTOV) 24/22 1hander.  What does this mean ? Sure the hybrid is going to be down a bit on DPS compared to a 2handed weapon, but heck he is going to have the benefit of a shield and still do the same dps as a dual wielding warrior.<br>
<br>
   A Paladin before did mention that with a 1hs their damage bonus is much smaller compared to a 2hs and that really hurts vs luclin high ac mobs, now imagine using a secondary weapon without a damage bonus ?  You slash SOandSO for 1 point of damage!<br>
<br>
<br>
   So, post kunark most plate classes now get the same AC and Hp from their items, with Luclin and AA's everyones hp jumps up making the HP percentage gap even slimmer.<br>
<br>
Please chime in if this needs reordering, but this is what i currenly think the melee DPS rankings are.<br>
<br>
1st Rogue<br>
2nd Archery Master Rangers<br>
3rd Monks<br>
4th 3 way tie between Warriors,Pals/SKs<br>
5th BL w/o pet<br>
6th Bard w/o pet<br>
<br>
Makes sense that 2 of the top 3 are pure melee, but as it is now Warriors are struggling on the DPS front compared to classes that have tons of innate utility and many situational advantages ( ie. the ability to hold aggro quickly / Self-tank adds that can quickly wipe a raid).<br>

You know, wanting/needing 3 of one class is pretty nice, how many necros you take on avg? rangers? sks? palies?bst?druids? There are 15 classes in EQ, 3x15 is 45. But we all know you need more clerics then anything. How many uber or even smaller guilds suffer cause of the way the game revoles around ch in raids?

What if warriors used dual weild and only switched in the new shields to bash with?  If bash recieves a upgrade in taunting similiar to 1bash=1stunliketaunt.<br>
<br>
Then warriors taunt have just greatly been upgraded while their damage and their def stays basicaly as is.  I've yet to see any warrior here look at that imbalance?  Warriors could very well be getting a upgrade that allows their taunting to rival that of the hybrids.  If that turns to be true then wouldn't it be allowable for hybrids to receive a taking upgrade?<br>
<br>
I'm just suggesting we've yet to know the following<br>
What vi will implement<br>
How it will at the end of the day effect tanks.<br>
<br>
Every tank should be concerned when ever vi makes a change.   Vi's past record is scary.   <br>
<br>
This shield thing could destroy tank balance in a few different ways just like it could be a boon.<br>
<br>
As for paladins haveing the healing role option in groups.  The new limited CH of druids and shaman may well be endangering that option.<br>
<br>
All in all I think vi is bringing change too fast now and with PoP to be released soon I'm very concerned for 15 classes.  I wonder if vi looks at the total picture when class balanceing or just the 1-3 classes it immidiately effects and their usual sister classes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usinark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sinark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/23/02 9:00:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=187>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shield changes</span><hr size=1> seventhsword, why are you addressing that to me?

<br>
At any rate, you're arguing about changes that do not exist. Nowhere have I seen an official mention of bash getting an aggro upgrade. Currently, the only shield change that has been acknowledged is the addition of block and damage mitigation when shields are equipped. If you have a link to this increased bash aggro discussion, please post it. I'm very interested. <p><html>

If a dev asked me to parse the damage of holding a shield, I would do it because I play on Test and accept that responsibility.<br>

Having said that, I will most certainly be physically ill if a shield is considered for anything more than &quot;fluff&quot;, let along a major fix needed for class balance and parity.<br>

*Then warriors taunt have just greatly been upgraded while their damage and their def stays basicaly as is. I've yet to see any warrior here look at that imbalance? Warriors could very well be getting a upgrade that allows their taunting to rival that of the hybrids. If that turns to be true then wouldn't it be allowable for hybrids to receive a taking upgrade?*<br>
<br>
sure that makes sense.  while keeping warrior taunt ~the same (assumming the new stun taunt isnt overpowering), lets cut warrior damage down to 2/3 and make hybrids tank better.  oh yea, did we mention this new stun taunt is going to make hybrids taunt even better?<br>
<br>
that what you were trying to say?<br>
im sorry, but you are a moron.<br>
<br>
no matter how they do any shield upgrade, it still cuts warrior damage down by 1/3... more for the ones with ambidex.  it would make warriors tank better, but it would make all hybrids tank better.  hybrids with their 1h weapons that were designed to be used without an offhand lose mabye 10% of their damage and almost none of their taunt.  now if bash taunts more warriors would gain some taunt, but so would hybrids.<br>
<br>
now, if hybrids can tank ok before the 'fix', then they can tank even better after the fix... probly as good as warriors ever could before.<br>
<br>
heres the question..<br>
if hybrids can tank just fine, while losing less damage/taunt, while keeping their agro/heal/feign spells, WHY EVEN BOTHER BRINGING WARRIORS TO THE RAID?<br>
<br>
warriors are becoming the single weakest class, and any shield upgrade would lower our strength in relation to all other meelee classes that have shields.  no matter how it is done, that would be the result<br>

There are 15 classes in EQ, 3x15 is 45. But we all know you need more clerics then anything. How many uber or even smaller guilds suffer cause of the way the game revoles around ch in raids? Point is others will be able to tank, rather it be palie/sk or even a monk. Should the best choice be a warrior? Sure. Should they be the only choice? No.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can answer that Xzander. We only have a few necro's in our guild, but we take them and any others that may want to come if they want to come. I take every ranger I can that's of the proper level because almost all of our 55+ rangers have at least half of their epic and do quite a bit of damage that's usually 6 to 7 rangers we have available. We have one high level beastlord, and she comes on every raid she can along with the 4 high level mages we have. I take every pally i can so that i have at least one or two per group for the LH ability, their spells, and their high damage output...on average that's 6 to 9 pallies...and 3 to 5 sk's to go with them, 2 of which often do much of our pulling. I take all the druids I can get for nuking, buffing where needed, porting abilities and light healing...that's usually in the neighborhood of 4 to 6. I take as many wizzies as would like to go for unparalleled raw nuke ability to bring the bad guy down...usually between 1 and 4. We only have 3 rogues and only 1 that is high enough to raid the upper level raids, and I play him when we don't need me as a ST or TT.<br>
<br>
Now...it's pretty obvious by my statements that we take just about anyone when we go on a raid, within our guild and within our 5 (or maybe it's 6 now) guild alliance, that wants to go. We are not a tier1 or even a tier2 guild really. We go to have fun...loot is a very minor issue, and Taking down the mob is the concern, not how Few people we can take the mob down with. We merit to non guild members if they deserve it (we only merit bp's and robes) and we random everything else within the classes that can and will use it, regardless of guild/nonguild affiliation.<br>
<br>
I personally feel that this is the way it's done most of the time by most people on most of the servers. The End Game stuff everyone was been talking about really only applies to a very small percentage of people who can and are willing to join top tier raiding guilds, and who have the time to play for many many hours to grind out the xp's necessary for scads of AA pts. These people's concerns are just as valid as anyone elses, but aren't representative of the concerns of most of the rest of the server population, which is why I and many others don't want to see AA or equipment for warrior problems, but fundamental changes to the class itself. Fixing items or adding AA skills is only going to effect the small percentage of people that can get these ultra rare/difficult to obtain items or who have the time to grind out the xp's for the aa's.<br>

Add the shield thing to hybrids if you like, with a reduced block and damage mitigation factor. Everyone goes home happy. <p><html>

This would make Ambidexterity a must get AA. <br>
<br>
If warriors wanted to do more damage with a 2hander, they would loose the bonus of blocking with offhand.  Same as knights with shields<br>
<br>
Of course this would not apply to monks since they already are masters of blocking and their kicks dont need more damn aggro. But it would benefit warriors, rogues, rangers just like the shield will benefit the original shield classes.<br>

<br>
Are all paladins this thickheaded?  Do you understand that DPS means nothing for the MT?  Maintaining aggro and positioning the mob correctly is all that an MT has to do.<br>
<br>
With the shield changes on Test, paladins will  tank even better and still maintain aggro just fine because they generate aggro using spells; warriors have to rely on a proc and will be gimped even further by having to give up a EB proc weapon to equip a shield.  <br>
<br>
Given the fact that hp difference is minimal, there is no AC difference and even now warriors don't have to use defensive on most end game fights, by instituting this shield change, all you're doing is making paladins the MT of choice and making warriors irrelevant.<br>
