If a guild requires you to get a VT key, they must be expecting you to buy the pieces from Legends Server or something.  'Cause if you are in a guild that can kill Emperor Ssra and get you a VT key, I don't think there is any reason to leave that guild and join another...  I'm sure any guild that is capable of killing emp is on their way to VT.  I mean... I don't think there are &quot;special&quot; guilds who &quot;specialize&quot; in killing Emperor Ssra so you can get a VT key to join another guild who &quot;specializes&quot; in raiding VT.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
ANY guild that requires you to have a VT key is unreasonable.  If they are farming VT 24-7 and don't really care about killing in Ssra, then they are probably not recruiting anyways and that requirement of having a VT key is just some nice way of saying: &quot;We are currently not recruiting, but are in the stage of farming in VT.&quot;  Requiring a VP key is not so unreasonable.  It's not so bad questing for it, just a big timesink.  And there are rumors that it is being revamped soon.  Requiring an ST key is just ridiculous, because guilds don't raid there in force anymore, and the only reason to go is to get prismatic weapons.  Any guild that wants you to have an ST key is like saying, &quot;We want to help you farm for prismatic weapons!&quot; and that is probably a blatant lie. <p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/dakkan2001/xsigtest1.gif">

After all, thats one less time sink for them to walk you through if you have the rest of the quest completed. Hell, ive gotten the dsp and me shards already just from exp hunting. Im sure if I really wanted to I could find out where the others drop and set up a group for there. As for the vp key come on, there are open Trak raids often and the rest of the drops are single group types of things so its more a matter of time than anything else. Theres no need to &quot;screw&quot; over your guild to get these things because its not like it takes a guild raid to get these items. <br>
Basically, all these requirements are just put in there to make sure that you are a serious player because after all, if you havent even bothered to get your hs key yet how can they consider you to be a hardcore player?<br>

<br>
While some guilds pride themselves on dropping Servitor or the Arch, we make huge posts on our message boards grats-ing eachother about our recent break into HoT ToV. I do not suggest moving to a high level guild. They have too much power over the servers as it is. Make your guild strong so you can experience ALL of the achievements, right from the bottom to the high-level, high-end mobs. =) <p><table width="32%" border="1" align="center" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" background="http://www.guild-legerdemain.com/texture2.gif">

<br>
Isn't the point to have fun? You have the most fun when you're up against challenging situations. And you can take pride in doing it yourself - developing the tactics, gearing up your teammates, supporting each other, and generally having a good time.<br>
<br>
I really think the desire to join uber guilds is generally greed. What's the different between a Kael raid and a VT raid? It's all a matter of scale. They drop grear appropriate to your capability, and allow people to get better. You have to work together as a team and you get rewards. <br>
<br>
Participate, lead raids, support your friends and have fun. I think you'll find that to be way more entertaining than being a cog in a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
If you level to 60 in Velks and then tag on 150 AA points, just so you can join a raiding guild, I really think you're completely missing the point of the *GAME*.<br>

When i joined, we were juts scratching at NToV; we had only killed Aary once and that was with many deaths. In fact, the 3rd raid that I was on was the 2nd time we killed him. We've matured since then; at what I believe to be a quite nice pace to the point that we have killed AL/AoW/XTC with relative ease and are ready to try the harder things in Ssra. <br>
<br>
Personally, I loved the move. Yes, I have a problem with quite a few of my guild members, and I don't know another few at all. But it doesn't really bother me. I mean, I was in a family guild for 1 year until it folded and turned into a beginning raid guild; which also folded. I had started to raid, and I realized that I really liked it. So, when the second guild folded; I wanted to join a raiding guild, preferably one at the high-end so I could finally kill the mobs that drop the stuff I drooled over when posted on Alla. <br>
<br>
Do whatever makes you happy. Just understand that in a large raiding guild; you will not have the same chemistry and bondage between peopel as a whole that you would see in a family guild. Depending on the type of person you are, you will butt heads with a few of them; and I doubt you will get along with everyone all the time. If this does not bother you; if you don't care about who they are as long as they both do their jobs on a raid; then this fact won't matter. Joining an uber guild will often isolate you from your friends, from others, and will likely change your out-look on EQ; but if this is what you want then more power to you.<br>
<br>
One thing about *class desireablility* for a guild is that is isn't as well-defined as people would think. Clerics are not always the top head honcho for the classes raid guilds recruit. You'd be suprized, but I would say, in certain cases, the latter may be a more fitting description of the *desired classes* in that order:<br>
<br>
1) Mage<br>
2) Cleric<br>
T-2) Bard<br>
4) Beastlord (if your guild doens't have one that is lvl 60 yet and active)<br>
5) Warrior (MT calibur)<br>
6) Wiz<br>
7) ranger/rogue/monk<br>
<br>
Now, obviously the only thing that really concerns us is that 5-spot (since I'm assuming you're applying under your warrior as main). As so many others have mentioned, few guilds will turn down a warrior that has all of his AA in-tact. THat said, there are a few things.<br>
<br>
First; despite what others may tell you, it is NOT bad to level intensely in Velks/FG. HOWEVER, the big thing to remember is that there is a world load of difference between tanking and velks tanking. You must remember that getting lvl 60 with 50 AA does not mean you know everything there is to know about warriors, nor that you already know what you need to about high-end tanking. If you realize this and learn the other things on your own, then it doesn't matter where you hunt. <br>
<br>
Second; raid and raid often. Make yourself a nuisance to the officers; send them tells, find out when raids are, and if you can get on them and such. Make sure that if you are on, and you have time to commit to a raid; then you are there.<br>
<br>
third; if you are tanking, remember this. For this raid, the clerics and the other healers/curers that are in charge of healing you are the ABSOLUTE WORST members of their class that exist in Norrath. They are horrible, terrible, and you trust them as far as you can throw 'em. And for all intensive purposes; when you are tanking; EXPECT to die, plan to die, hell, even prepare your tells to your rezzers/buffers. This way, you won't be pissed off when you die over and over; and when you miraculously manage to live, you'll be taht much happier.  <p><center><p><font size = 3 colo = "blue"><b>Wilhelmm D'Averam<br>Warlord of the Apocalypse</b></font></p></center>

<br>
I dunno if its a Morell Thule only thing, but on our server, there are many guild alliances.  There is even a guild alliance that consists of 3 or 4 guilds or something (GoB).  Sometimes, if u can pull the 55+s from multiple guilds, you realize you can raid some pretty big things.<br>
<br>
As for looking for high end guilds, i know it is difficult.  Everyone said the same thing to me.  &quot;We are only looking for 60's&quot;  Being a lowly 56, this was heart breaking, especially since this happened right after my old guild broke.  So, my advice to you...get 60.<br>
<br>
Then again, im currently unguilded, and not 60.  My advice is pretty much moot, since i have not experienced any of it first hand.  Just trying to throw around a few more ideas in the pot tho.<br>
