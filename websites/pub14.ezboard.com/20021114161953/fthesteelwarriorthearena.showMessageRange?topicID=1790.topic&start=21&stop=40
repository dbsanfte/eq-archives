Nexus instant gate is a 9aa skill. To have it and manaburn you would need to have a minimum of 32aa. Since most wizzies go for crits first, that hikes the number up to 44aa. Like I said before, most wizzies that have the gear and the aas are busy.<br>
<br>
Nuke robes have a 15 sec cast time if you have a good one. Pretty hard to finish casting when your dead.<br>
<br>
Glatius - I know you are entitled to your opinion just as much as anyone else, but at least call it like it is. I pointed out flaws in an arguement that's basically not true. How can you base your opinion on something that isn't true?<br>
<br>
Remf - you are right on most counts. MB is a 6 second cast that can be interupted and it is subject to the PvP 66% rule. Still enough to kill most toons in 1 shot but 6 seconds is a long time to get interupted. Invis potions are no good because familiars also give see invis. The good news is that even if you get waxed, recast is 144 minutes so you have plenty of time to hunt the nuker down and hack him up.<br>
<br>
Besides, PvP is owned by EQ+AM3 rangers anyway. Tough to compete with 200+ DPS on the run.<br>

Today when discussing it with a guildmate, he said &quot;you wouldn't be against it if our wizards had it (referring to our two level 60 wizards who don't have enough AA for manaburn yet)&quot;. I still would; it's the principle - not whether it benefits or hurts me.<br>
<br>
I don't think it fits into class balance; 5-6 wizards being able kill something that a full balanced group cannot (or cannot as reliably) is not my definition of class balance. I don't think it fits risk versus reward. Even if a lone balanced group was to take down a mob that 5-6 wizards are manaburning, they would still spend much more time porting around, buffing, and medding. All the wizards would have to do is port in, med, and get the timing of manaburn right. Sure they could fail, only if they screw up their timing though, or if they have lag/LD issues (but that can happen to anyone). Risk? Worst case scenario? Die once after maybe 20 minutes tops of porting, prepping, and pressing the click button. This is not a huge risk IMO.<br>
<br>
As with what I said before; it's the principle. I don't need Kunark dragons anymore, so I'm going to see MB wizards stealing dragon scales or haste items from me, but just because something doesn't affect you, it doesn't make it automatically ok.<br>

No, let's nerf Wizard's manaburn because a few bad apples didn't sell me a scale for my epic from TWO FUKING (expansions) YEARS AGO. GET OVER IT.<br>

Wizards have been dogged down upon for so long. Finally, they get a skill that they can all shoot for - a goal to create some class definition. Wizards are finally and afterall, the masters of the BOOM. <br>

The fact of the matter is that many top tier guilds on all servers can come in with minimal people and smack down these mobs with minimal effort. Crying that 6 wizards can do it won't change the fact that if a top tier guild wants to swoop in and pick off Sev or any other kunark dragon to sell the scale or haste item for pp isn't a valid argument.<br>

I play both a 60 warrior and a 57 wizard so I'm on both sides of the argument. Quite frankly it's nothing that couldn't be done before by 6 smart 60 wizards with Sunstrike, just now they can do it a little faster.

Its unfortunate my opinion interferes with your personal agenda.  But attempting to belittle my perspective by characterizing it as crying will not change my perspective.  Nor is it liable to further your agenda.<br>
<br>
Its nice that some people are so superior in gear and abilities that these minor dragons are of no relevance to them.  I'm happy for them.  However they really represent about 5% of the server population, if that.<br>
<br>
Yes a top tier guild could pretty much perma camp these dragons with little or no effort.  And before Velious, they pretty much did, didn't they?  However, now they have moved on to greener pastures leaving the door open for other guilds to take on content they have out grown.  Oh, hold on, thats not true, because now team MB perma camps this content.<br>
<br>
My guild doesn't hunt these dragons.  We're off doing NToV most nights.  Because the other top tier guilds on my server have moved on to Ssra.  Would I appreciate it if the content my guild can take on was being wiped as it spawned by a hand full of a specific class who where using an ability only available to them?  I sure wouldn't.<br>

Actually, warriors had and still have the ability to do *200K* or so dmg in one round (with rampage and earthshaker + a 60ish mob AE pull and lucky procs...) AND we can do it every 10 minutes.  It's a situational use skill tho, not QUITE as generic as a big BOOM, but still in the same genre.  For a few weeks, warriors with that setup could rampage NONSTOP if they cared to abuse a bug (kudos for the lucky folks who could but didn't for reporting it Verant and getting it fixed, wonder why they haven't fixed chaincasting normally recast delayed spells that use the same bug after so many years...).<br>
<br>
We also get &quot;finishing blow&quot;, which while apparently level capped, does let us do 32k in one swat (like rogues/assassinate, tho they can to it to full health mobs...).  Several classes also have instant-poof abilities vs certain types of mobs (clerics vs. undead, or the unreal crits pallies with the AA get vs. them, etc.).<br>

MB *IS* argueably superior to those in PVP, but I'd still bet on the ranger with AM3, a pre-nerf bow of doom, trueshot and 14 damage arrows/endless quiver.  With 2k+ crits very possible AND 400ish range, rangers are the absolute bane of non horse-riding PVPers.<br>
<br>
Is it broken?  Yah, a bit, but most &quot;cool&quot; abilities are (almost by definition).  Is it unbalancing in PVP?  Yah, it'd suck to be MBed right off the bat (tho better than the damned rapture enchanters get imho).  Can it be used in unusual situations that weren't necessarily intended?  Yep, we got 10 or so MB wizzies now, I'm quite sure most kunark boss mobs were supposed to live more than 3 seconds.  <br>
<br>
But what the heck, in the end it's just a Big Nuke; back in the day, so was icecomet (which would kill most level 50's in one shot when it came out).  Not something to cry nerf about methinks.  The only real concern I have is that it'll deter/affect &quot;good&quot; small group encounters in PoPo (pronouced &quot;PooPoo&quot; btw, until proven different <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) by setting a minimum hp for decent loot mobs to 100k or so+.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts anyway.  It's a cool ability, would hate to see the wizzies lose it, cause if I was one I'd want it too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Hrm... maybe verant will put in a &quot;health burn&quot; effect for warriors... at 8k+ hp for the well-geared, that'd be pretty impressive. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

For instance, Abashi FINALLY fully nerfed pumice/golem rods recently, after several years of effort apparently, by adding in the recast delay (= nearly unuseable for no-channeling warriors when it's &quot;really needed&quot;).

You get the so and so is casting a spell on you. And then &quot;loading, please wait&quot;. Invising yourself with a potion won't help because on a PVP server every caster that has 1/2 a brain will always have see invis cast on themselves.<br>
<br>
Heck one time I was AFK sitting on top of a wizzy spire prong<br>
(Levitate will let you do that...) waiting for a port up to the nexus. And some twit from pandemonium mana burned me.<br>
<br>
The wizzy spires are often camped by caster PvPers because they know us melee types often use the nexus to ghetto port around.<br>
<br>
So. I guess the best advice on PvP servers is. <br>
<br>
a. Always travel in groups if you can.<br>
b. Keep the MR maxxed.<br>
<br>
Remember on a PvP server its mostly not honorable dueling... it more like ambush/bushwack. A wizzy isn't likely to manaburn someone in a large strong group. Usually they pick off the strays. <br>
<br>
tash is not your friend........<br>
<br>
Oh.. and Remf... the ring war is very hard to do on a PvP server. Imagine you got the ring war started, you are fighting giants and such... and then 20 peeps 55plus show up to start helping the giants and ruining your fun. I've seen this happen (and been on the recieving end of it) a couple of times. Makes accomplishing that quest all the more special because its got that added element to deal with. It is very hard to stealth complete the ring quest because it takes so many people to complete and its obvious what is going to happen based on who is in the GD zone.<br>
<br>
The one time I participated in it and it was successful, basically the uber guild that finished it had a killer team at the EW zone in, a killer team at the Druid Ring, and killer team at the wizzy spire all to keep rival guilds from coming to spoil the fun. Then you need the actual people to do the ring war. I would say on our server only the top 2 or 3 guild can pull this off. Anyone else gets party crashers to their war. Woot.......<br>
<br>
But to get back to the subject at hand... Manaburn needs to be nerfed. Curiously... don't necros have the same sort of skill? Lifeburn? The damage cap for it is limited by the max number of HPs a necro has so I guess its not as nasty.<br>

Ok so since you hate your class you want to nerf someone elses? Get over it, 4 rangers a warrior and a cleric can just as reliably kill any kunark dragon with ease. If you're worried about transportation, replace the cleric with a druid and you even have a free ride to the dragon. And yes a top end druid can keep a top end warrior healed long enough for top end rangers to wax a gimp, 2 expansion old, 32khp n00b killer.<br>
<br>
You make is sound like every MB wizard just sits around in the bazaar waiting for gimp mobs to spawn. Surprise surprise! Most MB wizards are raiding NToV and Ssra and could care less if a kunark dragon lives more than 3 seconds.<br>
<br>
Terris Thule has a pretty active MB crew with probably 10-15 members and we get maybe 30% of the normal MB targets on a good week. The only reason we even get that many is because most of them are up for hours before anyone even bothers to kill them.<br>
<br>
You know who benefits the most from MB?? The mid 50s people who are actively camping &lt;32khp epic mobs that call in a bunch of MB wizards to help them kill their mob that just popped. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 12:05:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> Fine.
