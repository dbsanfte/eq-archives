With EXACTLY the same AC in gear, Monks will have a HIGHER AC than a Warrior.  Our only AC advantage was our gear gave us more AC.  Except that isn't true any more.  And it doesn't even matter because beyond the soft cap, its kind of pointless unless you can exceed it by a wide margin (how wide, no one is sure).<br>
<br>
Even if they fixed the mitigation issue, Monks would STILL have more AC than Warriors, given high end gear.  Even in the mid game Monks are running neck and neck with Warriors in AC. <br>
<br>
Now you're trying to say that not only are Monks intended to EXCEED Warrior AC in the high end game, they are also intended to close the HP gap by a considerable margin.  This is working as intended.  So while Monks keep their normal advantages of FD, mend, higher avoidance, and SUBSTANTIALLY higher damage,  they get to exceed Warriors AC AND have 82% of their HP as well.  Talk about wanting your cake and eating it too.  Next you'll probably want Manaburn for giggles.<br>
<br>
Well at least you're willing to let us keep defensive, for our three minutes of glory.<br>

When naked we have twice the ac almost, when geared up we dont. In this post it talked about how warriors have lost their hp% advantage over monks by compairing naked stats. See warriors depend on their gear to close that gap and monks depend on thiers to close the hp% gap.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's our equipment that makes warriors who we are, &quot;and historically it's ALWAYS been better than yours&quot;<br>
 <br>
And with that, monks have always been close to warrior's ac if not over it, problem is we got our in presov though leveling, couldn't level in sov so we needed better gear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Even in the mid game Monks are running neck and neck with Warriors in AC.&quot;<br>
always been like that.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you're trying to say that not only are Monks intended to EXCEED Warrior AC in the high end game, they are also intended to close the HP gap by a considerable margin&quot;<br>
No actully Im saying if you want to compair naked stats and say that % adavtange should be used when geared up. Then aslo, use that logic for ac when geared up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Monks keep their normal advantages of&quot;<br>
<br>
lets got though these<br>
<br>
&quot; FD&quot;<br>
Very nice but useless if certian changes are made(think: why is this useful? for pulling, now think: what ever you will be tanking, we'll be pulling and we dont get a ch order to heal us... So what ever changes you get the furture mobs will be designed around it, if you get to much grats on pulling:P)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; mend&quot;<br>
As much as most of you want to sit there and down play def(cause of the 7min down time) you sure do hold mend on monks, guess that one min is what the difference is(I bet def/eva saves you more hps then mend/stonestance)<br>
<br>
&quot; higher avoidance&quot;<br>
yea, but our main role(lets face it we do some damage but if thats your only role you might as well play a rogue) Id give wars same avoidance if monks can get immune from stuns from behind<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;and SUBSTANTIALLY higher damage&quot;<br>
I wouldnt mind warriors getting more damage.But i really dont think the difference is as wide as you want people to think. Just like at first it was monks are almost as good, then it was slightly less, then even, then better, then monks could tank 100 times better then a warrior. It keeps going up.<br>
<br>
&quot;they get to exceed Warriors AC&quot;<br>
ac is useless past a point remmber? and I can hit that number(the one tossed out there) before u get into ntov. <br>
<br>
&quot;AND have 82% of their HP as well&quot;<br>
why not? we had 85% of theirs at level 1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways do I think wars need some &quot;tinkering&quot;? yes, I don't think they should be only choice for a tank in exp or raids<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is my ideas<br>
1. give warriors some way to way to get argo with out haveing to get procing weapons.<br>
2. up thier damage, maybe to slightly less then a monks while dwing<br>
3, when useing a shield they become even better tanks(what they are doing on test) from this you make bash a very strong taunt(see number one)<br>
<br>
<br>
This was just a few ideas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvikoz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vikoz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/25/02 2:17:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=130>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Haha</span><hr size=1> I like #1. Those warriors that cannot get EB type weapons would be thankful. Improvement to taunt without trivializing the game.<br>
<br>
Number #2, Not sure about that one. An increase in DPS would help some, but not that high.<br>
<br>
As for number #3  Large races with Slam could benefit nicely of the aggro increase in bash. But would have to drop the offhand weapon to tank better.  Lets face it. We are a DW class. Trading the need to get aggro procing weapons over a shield to tank and taunt better is no different. Another piece of gear we need to get to do what should be an innate ability.<br>
<br>
Adding aggro to bash/slam/kick and the blocking modifier as an innate ability(like offhand) would have been MUCH better and beneficial to warriors(rangers, bards and rogues). The shield improvements were aimed at the shield based classes(knights, priests and casters). <br>
<br>
Once a warrior gets Dual Wield he stops using a shield(IF he ever used one)<br>

Now I know some ppl cycle a shield in to bash while dual wielding but I just never had the manual dexterity to do so on a regular basis (thats why I dont play a Bard). So my bash skill sits at 20... thats alot of work to make this a viable solution. Now if there was some way to apply that additional hate to kick (only while wielding a shield) I might be ok. I honestly think that VI's idea of helping warriors with aggro generation while wielding a shield is to give other classes aggro increasing buffs (making us more dependant on other classes  i.e. the new SK spells and the change to the chanter &quot;visage&quot; line) <p><div align="center"><embed width="468" height="148" src="http://www.ameritech.net/users/amplified/SWSig.swf"></div><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/25/02 7:34:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=132>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Haha</span><hr size=1> &quot;The problem with your &quot;logic&quot; is that you still DO have a similar naked ac difference as warriors at level 60. &quot;<br>

Funny, Vi disagrees with your logic entirely, when they said &quot;Warriors have the highest AC and Hitpoints&quot; which was true at the time.<br>

They also disagree with you that your AC is supposed to be higher, actually, the DESIGN of the monk class before all/all gear SCREWED it up was that armor was supposed to be lightweight and have very low AC.   This is evidenced with Monk specific gear THROUGHOUT THE GAME.   They didn't envision you having an AC advantage, it's just that your class benefitted th most from all/all high AC/HP gear.<br>

Granted, Warriors have an advantage in some slots, if you get the best items in the game for them.  But over all, the differences are in no way scaled along similar lines as they were previously.<br>
<br>
So yeah, you're right, Warriors have a few items that are head and shoulders above what Monks get in the same slots, if you're doing Ssra.  Of course this would mean more if AC above 1300 meant something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugraalthedorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Graal the Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/26/02 11:57:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=137>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Haha</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ok, lets compair a naked monk to naked warrior's AC, Monk has a huge % advantage but loses this with gear........<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You do realise that these are 2 different types of AC? The warrior has lower avoidance AC than the monk (which is the naked AC number) but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have much higher mitigation AC (total AC-naked AC). That isn't the case nowadays, simply because mitigation AC above a certain point is essentially meaningless. Coincidentally, there is nothing analagous to the AC softcap for avoidance AC. How would you like it if your last 50 points of defense skill did nothing for you?<br>

<br>
Sorry, this is just laughable. Monks were designed originally to not need gear. They were also designed to have very poor mitigation AC. Why do you think that historically, all MNK only armor had very low raw AC on it? MNK only gear never had an abundance of hp either. It is a relatively new condition for MNK gear to have high AC and high hp. <br>
<br>
The difference has always been that monks don't need gear to be effective, whereas warriors did. The benefit to that situation was that if a warrior aquired the very best gear in the game, he would be the unquestioned king of tanking.<br>
<br>
Here is the ultimate display of lack of understanding:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;they get to exceed Warriors AC&quot;<br>
ac is useless past a point remmber? and I can hit that number(the one tossed out there) before u get into ntov. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Let me explain the problem to you. AC is made up of 2 components: avoidance and mitigation. Avoidance AC is what is used to determine whether you get hit or not. Mitigation is what is used to determine how much damage you take when you do get hit. The AC that is displayed is a composite of those 2 types of AC. There isn't a cap on composite AC, there is effectively a cap on mitigation AC. What this means is that a monk can end up with the same effective mitigation AC as anyone else and yet have higher avoidance AC. There isn't a magic number unless you isolate avoidance and mitigation AC.<br>
<br>
Just out of curiousity, can you name the 2 highest AC legs in the game? They also both happen to have 100hp. Neither is wearable by a warrior (or other plate class tank). <br>

And that ended when RoK came out, so get with the times. Monks are just in need of their gear as any other melee.<br>
<br>

Not true, very poor is an overstatement, less then warriors yes,(and it is if there wasnt a soft cap it would be).<br>
<br>
&quot;Why do you think that historically, all MNK only armor had very low raw AC on it?&quot;<br>
cause we got most of our ac though leveling, thats why you never saw a monk twink prerok compaired to ither classes.<br>

&quot;MNK only gear never had an abundance of hp either. It is a relatively new condition for MNK gear to have high AC and high hps&quot;<br>
and cobalt had how much hps on it?50?<br>
monk bp of that time robe of the whistling fist had 50hp.<br>

You obviously didn't pay attention to what you read. That quote you took out of my post was directly in regard to monk <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> mitigation</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Let me spell it out for you:<br>

<br>
Again, you didn't pay attention to (or simply can't understand) the distinction between avoidance and mitigation AC. Monks pre ROK had about the same mitigation AC as druids, often less. 200 mitigation AC on a monk was pretty damn good back then. The raw AC available from items for monks back then simply didn't allow monks to get much mitigation AC without losing a large part of their avoidance AC benefit.<br>
<br>
Are you starting to understand that AC is made up of 2 very different things yet? That pretty number on your screen is not a single thing, it is a composite. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>
