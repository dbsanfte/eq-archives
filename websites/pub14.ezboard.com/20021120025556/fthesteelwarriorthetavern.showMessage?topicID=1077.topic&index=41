<br>
Well, lookie here...I sees I missed all o' the fightin' and yellin'. Guess that's whut I gits fer not checkin' the forum every single day. But then that's why we gots the moderators -- ta makes up fer me inability ta see and hear everythin'.<br>
<br>
Just likes sum o' ye other old geezers, I been around since Beta and the first day o' release that gave birth ta the ever-expandin' lands o' Norrath.  Tis been years now o' adventurin', and I ain't runnin' around like the crazed pup I used ta be.  And as the popularity o' the forums grew and grew, it wuz obvious that certain individuals wuz needed ta help keeps things...not just organized and purty-lookin'...but even more importantly -- ta maintain the reputation o' comraderie, honor, and integrity that be the Steel Warrior code.<br>
<br>
While I'm yackin' likes I give a damn, lemme gits a few things straight.<br>
<br>
First o' all, I seen alot o' whisperin' that questions me Honor that, if suggested by any other class in any other forum in any other plane o' existence, would have been cut short by me blade firmly planted in their skull.  I am tryin' very very hard not ta go inta a berzerker frenzy, followed by a bloody masacre that ends with this tavern bein' burned ta the ground.  I must only assume that ye don't know me. And ye don't know that Honor be possibly more important ta me than anythin'.  I have made many sacrafices and challenged death itself inna name o' Honor and whut is right.  Ta even consider questionin' me Honor in any way makes me spirit boil with a rage that is only held back by the fact that I know I ain't around enough fer everybudy here ta know whut I'm about.<br>
<br>
I says whut I mean, and I mean whut I says.<br>
<br>
I gots no need fer riggin' competitions, showin' favoritism, lyin', cheatin', or whutever else might be creatively suggested.  Me words and actions are that o' a Warrior.  Ye can takes 'em at face value.  Ye ain't gonna find no hidden meanin's or subtle manueverin's or secret agendas with me.<br>
<br>
That bein' said, I didn't know all me moderators were Half-Elves until they wuz already moderators.  I don't wanna hears no talk about this racial favoritism crap ever again. Tis insultin'.<br>
<br>
Yer basically tellin' me that ta me, bein' a good moderator, is bein' a Half-Elf.  If ye thinks I would use such logic, yer either accusin' me o' bein' an idiot or simply not carin' about whut's good fer the forum.  Either implication be offensive ta me ears.<br>
<br>
That's whut I gots ta say about that.<br>
<br>
As fer the way things wuz decided regardin' the Bunker moderator...all three finalists were competent and capable people from whut I could see.  All three were experienced adventurers. All three have posted words in the past that have expressed wisdom, a willingness to help their fellow warrior, and a loyalty to the community.  And all three seemed ta care enough ta make the forums a better place.  Now I coulda spent the followin' coupla weeks tryin' ta gits ta know each person better, findin' out their specific play times, how many people is in their guild, whut pieces o' equipment they own, their views on twinkin', and whether this ink blot looks like a butterfly or their mum...<br>
<br>
...bah. These forums gits way too many posts per hour every day ta let things slide fer just a coupla weeks while I tries ta ponder who's the best qualified outta the three.  Any one o' the three would work just fine.  They wuz good people.  So's I made a decision that would not only resolve the issue immediately and efficiently, but it would be reflective o' the game we played as well as express me feelin's o' tryin' ta keep things fair.  I had three people who could do the job equally well, and everybudy would know it wuzn't a matter o' race, gender, or makin' a donation ta any particular political party.  It wuz simply a roll o' the dice.<br>
<br>
Whut I didn't take inta account wuz that sumbody would actually think that I would be dishonest regardin' the predetermined number I chose.<br>
<br>
Well, screw ye fer thinkin' that.<br>
<br>
But I ain't too angry. Like I said before, I'm sure if I wuz around more so's people could gits ta know me, there wouldn't be issues like that. So I'm half ta blame.<br>
<br>
Regardin' Shikarii specifically, truth be told, I wuz scared he would win. Cuz I knew whut everyone would say. People would think whut they thinks now. That I put on sum big show with smoke and mirrors just so's I could rig the whole thing ta gits another Half-Elf on-board.  That be crazy.  I'd haveta be insane ta go through the trouble.  If havin' a Half-Elf wuz that important ta me, I wouldn't have even started the application thread inna first place. I would just handed the reigns ta Shikarii and said congrats.  I dunno whut goes through sum o' ye people's heads.  In fact, if it wuz in me nature ta rig sumthin', then I woulda done it the OTHER way.  I woulda given the moderator powers ta sumbody else even though Shikarii rolled closest, just so's I wouldn't haveta deal with the headaches and accusations.<br>
<br>
But the bottom line is...he did win.  And he won legitimately. And I sure as hell ain't gonna takes that away from him.  So say whut ye will.  But know that here and now, I declare ta all that Shikarii has me full support.  Not cuz he happens ta have mixed blood like meself...but cuz he is loyal, true and honorable ta the Warrior code and this community.  Let nuthin' be said ta the contrary.<br>
<br>
Finally, let's speak about moderatin'.  All the moderators o' the Steel Warrior forums contact me if there is an especially  volatile or delicate issue or situation.  But fer the most part, I knows I can trust 'em ta act in a way that is appropriate.  Whut does that mean?  Well, lemme tell ye.<br>
<br>
Cuz I'll tells ye right now...this be a Warrior forum. Nay, I takes that back. This be a Steel Warrior forum. And fer those who ain't aware...Steel Warrior ain't just a cool-soundin' name that is bein' used fer kicks.  NAY!  Tis a badge o' Honor and Pride and Excellence and Discipline and Courage and Gettin' the job done.  The Steel Warriors are those legendary fighters that have built a reputation o' bein' the best o' the best from Qeynos to Freeport to every dark and dangerous place in the world.<br>
<br>
Why does this matter? Cuz this ain't no normal forum and these here ain't normal moderators.  The normal rules do not apply.<br>
<br>
Sure, moderators are responsible for unclutterin' and organizin' and sticky-notin' and removin' spam or perversion.  But a Steel Warrior moderator is also responsible for maintainin' a certain level o' morale, integrity, honor, and respect (between fellow Warriors - other classes suck) among the fighters that inhabit their respective Houses.<br>
<br>
These forums have a well-founded reputation for bein' one o' the most informative, mature, and good-natured communities in existence.  Although everybudy has a right ta speak their mind and feel secure in knowin' their posts won't be edited unless absolutely necessary (ungodly forum-distorting sig, etc), there must be an understandin' that the Steel Warrior code must be upheld.<br>
<br>
I expect all moderators ta warn people when things are gettin' outta hand.  Atta same time, I expect all posters ta respect the decisions o' the moderators.  Fer instance, the application thread I wuz gonna delete. Shikarii got ta deletin' it before I did.  So whut?  We ain't bards here, people. We ain't gotta keeps every scrap o' writin' about every little thing fer posterity sake.  If sumthin' has no bearin' on nuthin', and the post or thread has no reason fer existin' other than ta be cause for potential grief...carve it out and chuck it, I say.<br>
<br>
I find that very very few things be deleted. Tis actually very rare.  Outta the hundreds o' posts made every day o' every week, ye'd find that only a tiny handful at most(ye could probably count 'em on one hand) are actually tossed in one week's time.  If ye find sumthin' missin', more often than not, tis been moved ta a more appropriate forum. Tis not gone -- just put where it shoulda been posted inna first place.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I'm glad ta see that this discussion now involves beer and a general feelin' o' respect fer one another.  Tis me sincerest hope that nobudy finds reason ta leave and never come back.  I knows that Five is a respected and valued member o' this community.  I hopes ye can stick it out, woman.  I'm sure we'd be the better fer it.<br>
<br>
As fer the rest o' ye...<br>
<br>
...Carry on.<br>

Even Jaikar got here before me!<br>
<br>
&quot;the best mods are the ones that read what is in their forums and respond to what people say there&quot;<br>
<br>
We can read other forums too! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
anyway,<br>
<br>
If there were more forums 6 months ago (or whenever Jaikar gave in to the need for moderation) then I'm willing to bet 50 plats and a star ruby that Shikarii would have been modding ever since then just like Adex, Xexys, Izend, Talic and myself. I remember when we found out *together* that all the mods were half-elven... I thought Izendgard was a wood elf for the longest time (because I couldn't tell from his drawing) and Adex seemed more human than superior for a bit :P<br>
<br>
Superiority and fate are a good mix =D<br>
<br>
Keep in mind all mighty warriors are superior to just about everyone be they half elf or not. It's really the posession of MIGHTYTALK that sets us apart... of course half elves have a base of 2000 hps upon creation, a sickening rate of regeneration, no frontal stun I believe and the attributes ta boot... but that's all just icing on the cake.....................<br>
