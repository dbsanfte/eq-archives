<br>
 So poor Joe ( the Warrior ) has joined an uber guild, that no longer values doing Sev in EJ. Joe is very sad for a short time then is handed a Blade of Carnage and soon forgets he even wanted a Warrior Epic. Later as Joe has become more powerful and made friends in the uber guild he then calls a raid when he saw Sev up in EJ with his alt on the 2nd puter. After rounding up 11 other they head off to EJ, with no fears that a small MB Team is going to take it and kill Sev. Joe is given the Green Scale due to its his main and the rest items are considered plat or twink loot.<br>
<br>
<br>
 So poor Joe ( the bard ) has joined an uber guild, that no longer values killing Gore in Dreadlands. Joe is very sad but works hard in his new uber guild to show them he is here for the guild and not for a quick grab of his epic. Later the guild knows how rare and hard it is to find a good 60 bard rewards Joe with a Gore kill and a quick visit to the Undead Bard to pop Trak to keep Joe happy. In this instance the guild made Joe happy and knows how much the Bard Epic helps the guild not so much the individual and ensures that Joe will more then likely feel obligated to work even harder for the guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Now poor Ubakilla, Phatlewt, Gotmilk, and Gweedyho  the old Manaburn team find that their old cash cows are no longer doable due to the nerf. So no more CoF for all thier alts, no more phat plat spells to sell in the bazaar, no more green scale that they hold hostage over other warriors or twink their own, no more white scale to tease the bards with or sell as a Wizy Focus item.<br>
<br>
<br>
Interestingly way before Manaburn ever came out, I bought a CoF for 80k in the Commons and later after getting GoDS I sold it again in the Commons for 80k. Now fastforward to the present after MB has been out almost a year, CoF are still sold for 80k and the so called &quot; MB helps everyone acquire stuff they normally couldnt get on their own &quot;, notice that the price hasn't changed since the Dragons die as soon as they spawn by Team MB.<br>
<br>
Now Wizards kick ass for what they do in guild raids and even solo but they need help in XP groups due to they are restricted by mana. I know I love having 8+ Wizards when we set out to do AoW, BP, Seru, Cursed.. etc etc because of how fast they can move the targets life. Maybe with the new raid xp feature they are adding it will allow for more then 6 man groups in areas, IE lets say you wanted to do 4C with 12 people and they all shared XP thus allowing for more variety of classes. <br>
<br>
The nerf to MB does nothing to the wizards class on what they still do solo, or what they provide to a  group, or what they provide to a guild. It only prevents them from hoarding the easy kill sub 100k mobs for quick outlet of plat. MB in raids was only good with the way Mod Rod 2 worked, MB quick then mod up and unload your nukes. Now it will be unload your nukes and med with the occasional hit off the rod every minute. Now if SoL encounted stayed the same Wizards would suck BUT they are being tuned way down which means they will more then likely be like AoW in length, thus making the Hard Hitting Nukes of a Wizzy very highly valued.<br>
<br>
<br>
Though for all the Wizards that defend that MB is needed and that you are providing a service to other on the server by selling off the mobs goods..... Your greed has truely blinded you and you use this as a petty excuse to avoid the attention of what needed to be nerfed from day 1. I would love to take  every MB farmer and display all their items from all their alt toons for the people of these boards to view or the plat sold on Ebay to show people how silly MB was and whats it gained the few. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/umithrull.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithrull</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.home.net/efitch70/usflag.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 8:25:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=182>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
LMAO. Do you really believe this?? 3 groups of people with equipment similar in level to your average mana burn wizard could easily take out anything in Kunark (MB prime targets) with ease. Get a full raid force of people equipped this well and you can take out anything in Velious too. And have a pretty good shot at most SoL mob. There is exactly 1 mob - Sontalak - that requires any kind of a raid force and this is the exception to the MB rule.<br>
<br>
To put it into warrior terms, a wizard capable of 8k manaburns would be like a warrior with around 4800hp unbuffed, 1400AC, with better than epic weapons. Not your run of the mill warrior. A wizard capable of consistent 9-10k burns would be like a warrior with over 5khp, easily over 1400AC, and a couple of EB weapons.<br>

Keep in mind that generally we are talking about mobs that a single group Velious equiped toons could take down. For the most part, this is 2 year old content, it's SUPPOSED to be trivial.<br>

And with some of the stunts magicians have been pulling lately, I would be entirely unsurprised if 6 magicians could kill Gore as well.<br>
<br>
Add druids, clerics, paladins, and SKs to the list of classes for which it is theoretically plausible to 1 class 1 group Gorenaire (am I missing any others?)... and wizards <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> remain</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on that list, despite the MB nerf.<br>

Okay. Show me how 6 wizards with pre-nerf manaburn have the healing power, the tanking power, the pulling power, et cetera of a full balanced raid force. 6 pre-nerf manaburn wizards only have the DPS power of a raid (and then only for a short time).<br>
<br>
A group of 6 clerics has the healing power of a full balanced raid, 6 monks have the pulling power of a full raid, and 6 warriors have the tanking power of a full raid. Do those classes need nerfed too?<br>

However those mixed class groups have a greater chance of failure than a MB team and take longer to assemble than a MB team.<br>
<br>
The old 6 person MB team could (in theory) assemble from anywhere (except PoS or VP) within 10-15 seconds of being informed of the presence of Sev or Gore.  From the time each team wizard recieved a tell, mem the appropriate port, and then ported in, under 30 seconds.  Pop the sow potion, run to the dragon, group up, flip the kill switches, loot, port out.  Head to MM later to rebuild RoS faction before the next patch.<br>
<br>
A new 6 person kill squad will not be individually self-mobile and won't be able to run up and flip the switch for a 3 second kill.  They will actually incur risk...<br>
<br>
I checked the wizard boards and they are pissed about this.  Almost every wizard pointed their fingers at VI and/or the MB teams.  One of the reasons VI did this was the MB teams, because they are a bunch (to put it mildly) jerks.  Check the wizard boards, even the wizards know who is to blame for MB getting nerfed and it would be the MB teams.<br>
<br>
Just because MB got nerfed doesn't mean that all the greedy loot whores will disappear from the game, but they'll have to work harder for it.  That might give the rest of us a better chance to get our epic pieces. <p>Hyardgune Varangian <BR> 58 Ogre Myrmidon of Gathered Might <BR> Solusek Ro</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utrayvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trayvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 1:41:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=190>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Quote:<br>

He confirmed no such thing.  This was before manaburn, which means that it was definately before the resist change patch.  I've seen entire guilds feared by this dragon.  Level 60, 345MR, 240CR on myself before in fact, and feared 100% of the time.  There is absolutely nothing a player can do in that situation but &quot;pray&quot; that fear doesn't stick.  &quot;Hope&quot; that they resist it.  They have the max level you can get, they more MR than you really need or use, yet there was still the possiblilty of being feared the entire battle.  Doesn't prove they were gimp, it only proves that they lost a random roll of chance.<br>
<br>

They won their random roll of chance.  Fear didn't stick.  The other guild wasn't as lucky.  Means absolutely nothing when looking at all of these players &quot;skill&quot;.  &quot;skill&quot; has nothing to do with resisting or not resisting spells.  It's a random chance decided by the software.  All one can do is try and wiegh the outcome in one direction with increased resist gear.  And when that resist gear puts you at the max, exactly what else can you possible do about it?... nothing at all, it's out of your hands, and not subject to one's level of &quot;skill&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uyarlin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yarlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/12/02 8:08:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=191>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> Wandor says<br>

Haha... you too funny!<br>
<br>
Which is more likely, 12 level 60 non-NToV players successfully killing Gore, or 26 players with full ToV armor wiping to Gore?<br>
<br>
Like what Trayvar is saying.  If his AE fear sticks on the key classes.. it's all over.  Sounds like your only encounter with Gore is thru MB to know what you are talking about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uarlinastarbright.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arlina Starbright</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/12/02 1:54:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=192>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They won their random roll of chance.

Don't need a random roll of chance anymore, just a good MR.<br>

Apparently you have never heard of MR buffs or resist gear. Sounds like you have never fought Gore as a level 60 with decent gear either. I would expect 12 full ToV armor toons to have epic or better and if the people running the toons are not complete idiots I would also expevt them to handle Gore easily. The only thing that makes Gore any harder than the other RoS dragons is that she cheals and any monkey that has played this game longer than a week knows how to beat the cheal.<br>
<br>
Get over it, Gore is a soon to be 3 expansion old encounter that has been trivialized by levels, equipment, and AAs. <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial"><img src="http://www.bfdesigns.net/eq/wandor_sig.jpg"><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6102" target="_blank"><b>Moordian</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=353608" target="_blank"><b>Wandorfu</b></a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.exarch.net/"><b>Fusion of Flame</b></a></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 888<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/13/02 4:25:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=194>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Team Manaburn...blessing or Curse?</span><hr size=1> AA Exp is the devil in more ways than one,<br>
