SK's!</span><hr size=1> Warning: This is a bit of a rant...<br>
<br>
This weekend made me really just not understand shadowknights at all.<br>
<br>
Sure, it seemd to be that mostly it was two people and they coulda just been dumb, but it also seems to be a growing trend.<br>
<br>
Shadowknights who do not want to help the main tank keep agro.<br>
<br>
Two situations came up. The first was at a raid. The MT (not me I was SA) was having some problems keeping agro on the mobs we were clearing. So I asked our highest level shadow knight to give him his best hate/agro spell. The shadow knight refused saying he didn't want to cause of the recast time. Note that the spell in the voice line lasts 10 minutes and has a 9 minute recast time and it is damn effective.<br>
<br>
We had 2 CR's cause of a mob ping ponging to the casters cause of this. Eventually, the MA got down hard on that SK and got the buff and things were ok after that.<br>
<br>
My second experience was last night in the plane of storms. <br>
My group (war, cleric, shaman, paladin, mage then later ranger, and the sk) decided that since I had some 700 more hps and 100 more ac I should be the MT in the group since we had 3 tanks. I asked the SK for the voice line, he refused saying he didn't want to switch out one of his other spells.<br>
<br>
Now this guy had other problems like pulling when the cleric says not to and not FD'ing stuff off so he could live. <br>
We were fighting some tough yellow con mobs and the guy said he would just tank since I couldn't pull agro off him.<br>
<br>
He ended up dying several times due to not managing his agro. (Paladin didn't have a problem letting me have agro and they can out agro me any day of the week). All he needed to do was to FD (yeah I know it is a spell with a cast time) or give me the voice line and he would have lived. Instead he accused the cleric and shaman of being incompetant for not healing him. I would have been happy letting him tank if he had comparable hit points and ac fully buffed. But he didn't and the group wanted me to tank because of it. I eventually told my friends in tells and say (when he died) that this guy was no good and left after our second CR due to him(it was bedtime anyhow).<br>
<br>
I have met some really great sk's who know what they are doing and who watch their agro if they aren't supposed to be tanking. <br>
<br>
But I leave this as a bit of a warning. Be wary of SK's who refuse to cast the voice line on the MT, be it you or them or anyone else. They may result in CR's and exp loss.<br>

The biggest pain about the Voice line for SK's is that darned refresh time; and admittedly I mumble to myself when I have to load it too.  There's also a bug or timing issue with the Voice line where it 'ungreys' but it's still uncastable.<br>
<br>
However, it is effective and does make aggro management easier (IMO).  I get mad at myself when I don't think of memming it in time (say before a raid/encounter) or if I get asked late to cast it on someone (I rarely use it on myself) and it's not memmed yet.<br>
<br>
If I'm not MA, I generally don't mind memming it at all (after my initial mumbles, that is) because I won't need whatever spell which was in the slot that is now occupied by the Voice spell.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't go as far myself to say those were 'bad' SK's; but would venture to say that they may not have done what was best for the group. <p><p>[64 Grave Lord] Duke <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170915 ">Klotar</A> (Dark Elf)<BR>

SKs have been given the cold shoulder for a long time when it comes to &quot;useful&quot; pre-combat spells for the group...<br>
<br>
note, once you start playing a SK, due to not having many useful buffs, you kinda forget you CAN pre-combat buff something useful finally!<br>
<br>
The spell is annoying to load, but I usually plop it on the MT whether they want it or not....  I usually kid in gsay &quot;warrior_01 is now scary&quot;...<br>
<br>
all of a sudden mr warrior has a lot larger margin for error.<br>
Voice line has a noticeable effect on the non-uber... and adds a nice margin of error for even the well equipped.<br>
<br>
most of the time, the warrior says nothing... and I am just as happy if we just keel stuff...  but every so often it is nice to hear &quot;got that aggro buff?&quot; from a warrior.<br>
<br>
If I can't tank it... then I'll do my best to make sure someone else can... Its the same thing I have been doin for three years, but voice makes it easier.<br>
<br>
Now if I can train a few less uber warriors how taunt works and why the SK uber aggroing and then the warrior TAUNTing is a good thing. (hail an ignored chanter_01)  Voice isnt the only way SK can give warriors aggro.<br>
<br>
You met some disgruntled SK... insist on voice...  ask in gsay and REMIND him in gsay.  The point ya want to get across is the value to the GROUP of voice.  Aggro is ALWAYS a team goal... voice makes the team's job easier.<br>
<br>
P.S. <br>
Please cut my less experienced SK brethren some slack... for the first time since release, SK actually have to make a choice for their spell slots...  they are quite valuable now, where before the SK always had the same spells memmed more often than not. Voice now has a large cost that most Warriors might not ever understand.<br>
Emphasize the value to the group and most SK will see the light.  Being useful to a group directly through buffs is a little weird for some Shadowknights.  They will come around.<br>

<br>
I'm a paladin...I don't have buffs that will give a warrior aggro. Even so, I can essentially give them all the aggro they need for a fight. If I stun the mob twice as its coming in and during initial engagement, I gain a ton of aggro. Any successful taunt by the warrior gives him my aggro+1. He now has solid aggro for the rest of the fight. A caster has to be a complete bonehead to steal aggro from the warrior after that.<br>
<br>
Very few warriors I have grouped with understand that concept. Whenever I stun at initial engagement, or when the mob turns to the slower, etc. they think I am showboating or trying to steal aggro from them. <br>
<br>
Would be nice if more warriors understood how to take advantage of high aggro hybrids+taunt. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686">Graal MacBladefury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Hybrids and other Melee need to understand that it only puts whoever taunted at the highest level   ( such a small amount that you can get aggro back before the taunt button refreshes  ).

If a group member is being stupid and/or is not being useful to your group, dump it and get a new one. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://pages.infinit.net/kerosene/sigfinal.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
Episode of note, Factory PoI. ... Me (60 war), 61 cleric, 61 shammy, 62chanter, 60 pally, 63monk<br>
Had a gung ho pally in the group, lvl 60, but still with just a tad under 1k less HP than me buffed at the time.  Im no uber warrior, i break just over 6150 buffed, which means the pally had my HP about 5 levels ago.  He had a habit of going nuts with spells every time a pull came in.  He ended up dying about 5 times before he finally listend.  Pallys arnt meant to take the kind of beating we are, but he never thought of that.<br>
<br>
Finnally the cleric of the group got on his ass bout letting me keep aggro, i felt sorry for the cleric for a while, he was burning about 5+ CHs a fight on the pally.  <br>
<br>
When it comes down to it, have the cleric tell the aggro junkies to lay off taunt and let you have aggro, they usually listen.  Sometimes Hybrids/Monks dont understand that warriors innate aggro is inferior to everyone else, yet our superior HP makes us the best choice.. Usually they listen when the cleric says he/she gonna let em die if they keep pulling aggro.<br>
<br>
I love it when a shammy Malo/Slows durring the pull, means when i taunt, i have solid aggro for most of the fight.  Sometimes the monks and rogues tend to turn the mob for a round or 2, but thats about it, Ill admit, monks in some of the Teir 2 places of PoP tend to understand that double 450s or harder hitting mobs are better left hitting me.  Its the hybrids who dont quite understand it yet.<br>

<br>
<br>
I think perhaps this warrior didn't understand.<br>
<br>
Both SK and Paladin HAVE a taunt button.. and a lower cap.  We are well aware of how the taunt button works... (or in some cases doesn't) we are also quite aware of the margin for error.<br>
<br>
SK can give and lose aggro on command (mana allowing).  Paladins taunt on command.  Both classes when they have experienced players behind them are head and shoulders above most warrior's understanding of taunt because we understand and practice both the melee(taunt button) and the spell casting half of aggro.  <br>
<br>
In addition, SK are among the game's best pullers and most of the older ones understand a great deal about mob interaction due to their involvement in high end pull teams their whole EQ life.  I agree that there are twits playing all classes... but for the most part knight required playstyles teach their players much more about aggro than a warrior (who only plays a warrior 60+) might ever understand.<br>
<br>
We all know ebay is bad.  This is why there is this little button called &quot;disband&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
The point being made here is that a Shadowknight(or Paladin) and a warrior working TOGETHER to give the warrior aggro means the warrior will have an immense advantage.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
SK_01 pulls mob_01 with Terror of Terris (510 hate unresistable)<br>
SK_01 brings back to camp and casts a Darkness spell (damage+snare) on the mob.<br>
Warrior_01 presses the Taunt button and gets the SK's hate +1<br>
SK_01 feigns death<br>
Warrior_01 is now 1000+ hate over everyone..  the SK falls below the warrior by being down...  The SK stands up and manages aggro.<br>
<br>
Paladins can do the same thing by passing aggro with distance modifiers and intelligent aggro management on both parts.<br>
<br>
Now, if only I could get more warriors to grab onto this!<br>
<br>
<br>
I usually politely ask other tanks in the party their HP/AC and let the cleric decide...  There are parties where the warrior should be tank all the time...  and then there are parties where the warrior should never hit the taunt button.<br>
<br>
A good player knows when these times are, and knows when and where to offer their support.<br>
<br>
Example #1<br>
Warrior_01 decides they will be main tank and the party goes along with it.. despite the fact I am 2 levels higher and have the same HP and AC as he does.  I give him voice and carefully avoid aggro until the chanter and cleric are respectively getting chapped.  I uber taunt BOTH mobs on to me and call for ASSIST.  The cleric heals me and we survive.  I am elected MT.  The warrior pitches a fit, but the cleric (and chanter) try to convince him that this is best.  Warrior_01 quits the group despite the fact no one asked him to leave (and we really didn't want to look for another melee.)<br>
<br>
Example #2<br>
Warrior_02 is elected MT.  He has more HP and 3 levels on me.  He gets voice and I pull.  I feign and he tags.. works good until we meet Named_01 who the warrior just cant seem to stick to him.  We wipe (partially due to incoming mini-train gifted to us)  I recommend that I tank the named as I will be able to glue it to me.  I was pleasantly surprised when the warrior yanks out his 2H and backs me up saying &quot;bah it doesn't hit that hard&quot; despite some of the other party member's misgivings.  I am elected to try it... if I die the warrior will take over.  The mob is glued to me... never looks at the chanter or cleric, and it and its guards die easily.<br>
<br>
Warriors and Knights are brothers... we have different strengths... recoginize them and give each other their due.  The game is a lot more fun that way.<br>

<br>
Sure if there is no rogues in the group it can probably work fine because in that case it doesnt matter if the SK/Pally is tanking some of the time, but with a rogue its important that the back is always pointed towards the rogue, or they get cranky when they cant backstab.<br>
<br>
For instance the other day I had the &quot;worst case&quot; scenario group. 1 SK+me(war)+1(obnoxious <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )rogue.<br>
<br>
Was wielding BoC+getting voice from the SK, but even then I would instantly lose agro whenever he snared the mob with Festering Darkness(we were in lower rats in CoD, so needed the snare).<br>
<br>
Of course you could argue that the SK and me should just stand side by side, but thats really a kind of awkard and uncomfortable way to fight in an exp group for hours on end.<br>
<br>
So what usually would happen is I would tank the mob, try to bring it to a wall, then tank it with my own shoulder to the wall. The SK would be attacking facing the mob/wall, and whenever he stole agro, we would hear loud complaints from the rogue because he couldnt backstab.<br>
<br>
In the end it all worked out, because once the rogue left, we didnt really had to position the mob in any particular manner, so with the enchanter that took the rogues place + his DC'ed pet we ended up kicking ass instead, and with alot less hassle of trying to position the mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=broddathep>Brodda Thep</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/27/02 9:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2497.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: taunt</span><hr size=1> I would rather have a pally/sk tank in PoP 90% of the time over a warrior.  <br>
<br>
I group with pet classes a lot so positioning of the mob is important since it is nice if mellee + pet can attack through enrage.  Pallies/SKs can keep agro far better through enrage than a warrior.<br>
<br>
Pallies/SKs tend to use two handers.  If you are dual wielding and tanking a slowed mob you are probably taking fully 30% more damage just from repostes. (I parsed that 60% of the total damage taken over a nights fight when tanking slowed mobs with my monk was from repostes.)  This makes fast weapons crap for taking damage.<br>
<br>
Lucklily, you guys get an awesome AA to hit through repostes and the like.  Unfortunately, not many warriors have this AA yet.<br>
<br>
Also if you are engaging on pull and the mobs can't be rooted it is nice if the tank can build up massive agro before I try to slow with my shaman.  IF I get a resist and the mob comes after me I don't want to hear &quot;Sorry, dude.  Taunt failed will be up in another 5 seconds.&quot;  (or whatever the time on taunt is.)<br>
<br>
In most cases it is better for the hybrid to be tanking in the group.  There are probably exceptions but I would think that an SK would be able to do more damage with spells and what not if he was able to tank, the pally could stun more if he was able to tank and use his healing spells.   And the warrior could also do more damage from behind the mob and even use offensive if he wanted for even more damage.<br>
<br>
Of course if the SK/Pally is just unable to tank the mob then that should be addressed.  But too many times a group will have to reduce their effectiveness in order to allow the warrior to tank when there is a pally/sk in the group.<br>
<br>
Just use whoever would be best for the group to tank.  Don't just think that warriors MUST tank.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leod>Leod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/27/02 11:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2497.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: taunt</span><hr size=1> I agree with Brik.<br>
<br>
It's the PERSON not the toon that your dealing with. I almost never have a problem getting agro off any pally or SK I hunt with. When I do have a problem, it's because the SK or Pally wants to tank, and CAN tank. I trust my main SKs enough to make that choice, and if they wanna tank a couple, thats' cool. But that's only in groups, and the SKs I hunt with could tank PoV critters. Heck, half the time when in ToV and breaking the hallway I'll have a SK or Pally tank the add. <br>
<br>
<br>
If your having trouble with certain classes, remember - your dealing with a person behind that toon, not the toon ;-) Pick yer groups more careuflly (or have a stick cleric in the group!).<br>
<br>
Oh, one way to get around a silly Pally or SK is to not buff them after you've rezzed em 2-4 times. See if he still wants to tank those PoS mobs without Aego, focus and STA!  <p>&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=141811&quot;&gt;Zantaer<br>
