<br>
I am looking for some serious advice on doing the Kael Plate House cycle.  Here's where we are at:<br>
<br>
We go in and clear the throne room as fast as possible then trigger the dwarf.  We hit him and begin the cycle.  We get the first 2 mobs and double tank, no problem keeping aggro.  They die and we get the next wave of 2 and double tank again no issue.  We get the next single who's fairly high and spank him where he stands.  Then, we get the 6th and final guy who is 60 or over (red to 57).  This is where the problems begin.<br>
<br>
Out 55 enchanter magic debuffs him and cannot cast anything else on him.  Our 55 druid cannot snare or dot.  Both of our clerics have plenty of mana, so we pummel away on this guy without slow or anything else on him.  The issue is when he hits 9% health, he turns and runs.<br>
<br>
This causes him to head outside and the next room over has a healer, so he gets healed and then chain summons us.  Do we need to keep the prior rooms cleared?  They are easy enough to do, but would still be a pain in the butt, considering the time crunch doing this cycle.<br>
<br>
I had read a group of 2 x 55 war, 60clr, 52clr and 60 shaman could do this for 3 cycles before they got wiped out.  My question is how do you do this last guy if you cannot snare him?  He has so many hp that he's going to make it a ways before you can down him.<br>
<br>
We had:<br>
<br>
57 war (me) frostbringer &amp; wrapped entropy for aggro<br>
2 x 53 war<br>
2 x 51 war<br>
52 monk<br>
55 enc<br>
55 dru<br>
56 clr<br>
52 clr<br>
<br>
Our clerics were about 70% mana each, so no issues there.  Anyone have any tips for us?  I thought about having us fight in the throne room (we fight in the room before it, near the table in the corner) to give us more leadway before he hits the other rooms, but I seriously doubt we can down him before he aggros more mobs.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Cant slow or snare him.<br>
<br>
Just kill the stuff in the hall and kill the lvl 60 last guy as near the throne as possible so he has alot of room to walk out the stair way.<br>
<br>
When we do it we charm a giant since they hit so much harder then we do... easy kill as he's walking away. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101135>Faederya's Litter Box</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faederya>Faederya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/30/02 7:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=647.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: kael plate house (aka ice house) - we're stuck</span><hr size=1> Ahh.. <br>
<br>
Yes fight IN the throne room<br>
<br>
can easily clear one and possbily two cycles before room pop.<br>
<br>
So yes, fight "in the throne room" have the casters back at bottom of stairs and STANDING right before the new ones pop.<br>
<br>
Kill the new spawned giants as near the throne as possible. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101135>Faederya's Litter Box</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kiyallmanebloodcry>KiyallmaneBloodcry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 303<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/30/02 11:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=647.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~bass72/_uimages/1C.gif hieght=140 width=113></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: kael plate house (aka ice house) - we're stuck</span><hr size=1> /agree Faederya<br>
<br>
Keep the throne room and hallway clear and you won't have problems.  2 cycles can EASILY fit between room clearings.  Just be careful for the Lord who spawns on the throne, who is a 2 hr spawn.  Track his spawn time or he'll pop when you're busy with other things (such as the lvl 60 at the end of the cycle *coff*).  <p><b><i><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75761>Kiyallmane Bloodcry</a></i></b><br>

Was with my guild 2-3 group there... one giant in the cycle was charmed to help with dmg and after the last giant was killed, it started all over again. Thing though was, we were so into the fights that we didn't even notice untill the 2nd to the last giant spawned again, i just happened to remember the name of the mob and then did a &quot;/2 oh crap&quot;. Just about that time all hell started to break loose, mobs behind us and in the TR began to repop. It was fun though, i think a BP dropped that night.<br>

One other thing you might try is actually fighting up close to the throne that is the generally accepted area to fight all the times i was in chanter house  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cyrz>Cyrz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/30/02 4:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=647.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: kael plate house (aka ice house) - we're stuck</span><hr size=1> I've done this cycle many many times... and unless it's changed recently (By recently I probably mean in last 3 months or more)... I really, really never remembered a problem with anyone running. In fact... the last giant enrages. Maybe I just had enough DPS with me (Never remember going with less then 2 groups, and usually 3) that he never survived the enrage w/ enough HP to run fast, but some of these raids were with a lot of lower levels, so...<br>
<br>
However, just so I'm not saying I've never had this problem... if clerics have plenty of mana, maybe pull a lower level giant from outside and stick your off-tank on that halfthough through the battle... Most mobs won't run if they have a 2nd one in assist range.<br>
<br>
Bodar- Icehouse, Chanterhouse, Iceshard House, Plate House, all the same thing. Part of the Coldain Ring 9 Quest is in this area. There is a chair, and when you say the phrase &quot;The Dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain&quot; (Or something similiar, it's been months since I've done it) at this chair, a coldain traitor appears and a cycle of giants appear to defend him.<br>
<br>
This place is called the Icehouse or Iceshard House because of some of the mobs having the last name Iceshard. It's called Chanter house because a lot of the mobs have the title &quot;Chanter&quot;. It's called Plate House because, during this triggered cycle, Plate quest items for Thurg armor drop. It used to be VERY common drops there, now it seems (to me) to only be a bit more common then Arena, and it's ONLY plate. I'd personally rather take the Tormax Ramp for Thurg Armor.<br>
<br>
I don't know the loc... But if you zone in from EW, follow the left wall like you are going to WL. You pass a pool just before the bank area- It's the first place you can choose which path you take. Bank/WL is straight ahead, something else is right, and a pool and Tuak the Fisherman is left. Turn left, Passed Tauk is a building. Inside this building, are some stairs. Go down them, and you see a stage or platform with a chair on it. This is also known as the &quot;Throne&quot;, and you stand right in right of the chair to trigger the spawns.<br>
<br>
Looking at a map, from EW, Plate house should look like first left, and Tormax ramp should look like 2nd left.<br>
<br>
Ok, I give up, it's location 11 on EQAtlas's site.<br>
<br>
Maybe the immune to snare thing is new? I won't swear to it, but I always thought the Druid Epic Snare landed on him, back when the Druid Epic would Snare. <p>&lt;a href = http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17853&gt;<br>

MT tanks 1st, all assist MT.<br>

<br>
say words, kill dorf<br>
<br>
2 giants spawn Grondon and Kromzog Zekkin. get bard to charm Grondon and kill Kromzog. now another giant will spawn keel him then break charm. another giant. kill him, now we have Valorankt. Val has alot of hps, enrages, hits quite fast, can't be slowed or snared. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that you keep him on the MT at ALL times during enrage. if he turns around while enraged and people forget to turn off attack they're dead very quickly unless using 2h or not having double attack. its easy to either keep the next room clear or have that first giant DCed by the chanter. that giant will put out alot of dps and save you the bother of having to kill him, but for pure damage either of the Iceshards are great (triple for 193, 20khp)<br>
<br>
hope that helped. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brokkah>Brokkah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/4/02 9:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=647.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: kael plate house (aka ice house) - we're stuck</span><hr size=1> There's a nice pathing 'feature' in that room that prevents mobs from running, position your mobs correctly and they will run on the spot. Hint: there are at least 2 different spots in the main room where this works.<br>
<br>

It is pretty scarey how small some of the groups clearing the spot are.  I think we took about 30 minutes to clear the whole cycle (lvl 60 mob ran then).<br>
<br>
I wish our enc could DC, that would definately help out a lot.  I guess if our enc or dru were 60 we'd have better luck, but we got what we got <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Our DPS isn't all that great, I guess.  We have no rog/shm/wiz/rng types and only one monk.  It looks like we do about 8-10K a minute, so the fights are semi-long.  We're plenty solid and can keep up the fights, we're just not a wham-bam-thankya-mam kinda guild ;(<br>
<br>
Brokkah - thanks for the hint, dunno why I didn't think of the two little pits on either side of the stairs in the throne room, those will probably keep the mob from running.<br>

<br>
Many critters are socially brave - if there's another critter of the same type nearby they will not break and run.<br>
<br>
If you're going to be fighting something nasty and unsnarable and you can't afford it to run - drag a greenie in for that fight.  Put someone on it with instructions not to kill it by accident, and your real target will stand and fight to the death.<br>

<br>
Do the first few giants drop armor?  Or is it the later ones in the cycle?  If the first few drop, this sounds more like a &quot;good&quot; thing to me.  Constantly restarting the script with the easiest of the giants over and over would net you more armor faster, with less downtime. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=647.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=647.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=647.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=647.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.threadControl?topicID=647.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=647.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=647.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6>The Keep</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
