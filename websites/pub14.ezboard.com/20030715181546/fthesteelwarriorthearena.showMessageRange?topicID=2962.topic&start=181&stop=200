Another figure?  90%?   Is 9 and 0 the only two numbers on your keyboard?    <br>
<br>
let's look at the salient points:<br>
<br>
1. You cannot verify the percentage of taunt successes in PoP because of a lack of a feedback mechanism on a successful taunt:   FACT, sorry, no opinion here... wanna rebut it?  Tell me exactly how you can measure on non-speaking mobs that taunt was successful, as opposed to simply you being at the top of the hate list.<br>
<br>
If you're going to throw utter BS numbers out, you damn well better be prepared to defend those numbers, and if you can't, then you are simply blowing smoke up peoples' rears.   <br>
<br>
2. Every class board has a thread on warrior taunt suckage... sorry, there' no &quot;equal opinions&quot; here, it's either right or wrong, want the list?<br>
<br>
#'s 3 and 5 are opinion: What would and wouldn't balance the game, and that an elitist snob such as yourself has no clue about lower tier grouping dynamics... although this borders on fact since you so condescendingly told everyone to run out and grab a BBB, that anyone can.   <br>
<br>
2 out of 5 is hardly &quot;90%&quot;... but since you say taunt works &quot;90% of the time&quot;, I'd expect that kind of number from you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=graalthedorf>Graal the Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/19/03 12:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: testing.... is this thing on ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2.

Welcome to the world of message board communities. People want something to talk about. When druidX or wizardZ reads a few threads from warriors (or anyone else) about how warrior taunt sucks, they do the message board equivalent of nodding their head wisely and agreeing. A few people making assertions loud enough can cause whole communities to go through a domino effect of agreement.<br>
<br>
Ask anyone who remembers the &quot;common knowledge&quot; of the day that stats such as STR, DEX, and AGI were the most important things for items to have. Anyone remember when the serpentine band was considered uber? That &quot;common knowledge&quot; started from the assertions of a few vocal people - I stress the word few - on whineplay, which then got parroted by many others, until it became accepted as gospel. <br>
<br>
When someone reads a post (hears a speech, etc.) from someone who seems to be intelligent and seems to have a valid new insight and/or just seems to pwnzor n00bs, it is a natural response for many people to agree vocally, thereby showing their own good judgement/intelligence/whatever for agreeing with this obviously intelligent/powerful person. It's called the bandwagon effect, and you will find it in any community. Look at current events for parallels.<br>
<br>
That's why I've said before that whining about an issue (by whining I mean exaggerating an effect or situation to bolster a position) is a self defeating exercise in a game like EQ where group desireability is all about perception. Do you want to know why there are often such large swings in class balance? Why rogues go from arguably the least balanced class in the game before Kunark to without a doubt the most powerful during late Kunark-early Velious? VI (SOE) can't just raise a class's abilities up to the point where they have parity, they have to raise their abilities up to the point where it is obvious to other players who might consider asking them to group. They have to break that ingrained perception created by the earlier imbalance.<br>
<br>
My wife still thinks rangers suck, because she hasn't really played with a ranger much since kunark. Ask rangers about reaping what you sew.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I just remembered a saying one of my Jesuit teachers used as one of the arguments for the existence of God: &quot;A million Frenchmen can't all be wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes they can. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686">Graal MacBladefury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

You cannot verify that I'm wrong can you? Sorry, but I don't press my taunt key when a mob is on me unless I see a spell cast message on the mob (ie xx Yawns) that would pull it off me. The percent of times the mob has turned from me and doesn't turn right back around to me, after I press taunt, is actually less then 10-15 percent. Am I going to sit down with a notepad and write down the numbers of times the mob doesn't turn back to me when I press taunt? No. I have no desire to put that much effort in finding out the exact figure to be just to prove it for a galling person such as yourself.<br>

<br>
Bullshit .. real bullshit.<br>
<br>
The problem of the warrior in Pick Ups in PoV and some other mid zones is not TAUNT.<br>
<br>
Taunt is ok its great in Pop .. multiple times better than it was before.<br>
<br>
The problem is the initialaggro ( hope I spelled it right ).<br>
<br>
The mob comes in. The Tank engages. The slower slows or tashed and slows . The snarer snares .. ...<br>
<br>
Here is the point. At this point the Paladins and Sks are way way better in Gaining aggro and holding it for some seconds.<br>
At this point ... and most of you have written it ... At this point the warrior is loosing his aggro except he is lucky with a nice proc or some nice hits.<br>
<br>
Maybe we all as tanks would not notice that in a way .. .but all others hate it ... yeah they hate it beeing the target of the mob and beeing hit.<br>
<br>
So when the tank looses aggro they have several possibilities<br>
1. Paladin ... cast a fast stun ... chance for aggro is very very high maybe stun nr 2 .. chance is ultimate high for regainig aggro .. Time cost max 4 seconds.<br>
2. Sk some possibilities maybe not so good as the ones of the Palli but in around 4 to 6 seconds he should be able to 100 % regain aggro<br>
3. Warrior... hit taunt ... when no success ... wait for 6 seconds for another taunt making direktly after taunt a /shield ( 3 min refresh ) so the damage taken to the XX is maybe halved. After 6 seconds try another taunt ... ... .. <br>
<br>
So now we come to the harder part. The warrior will have to do this part more often than the Sk and the Palli cause they throw their high aggro spells out when mob is incomming. <br>
<br>
I always start a fight with a kick/disarm and try to start hitting at the same time so that I have hit kick disarm as a aggrostarter ... Then I wait for the message of landing spells and try to time Taunt if its nessessary ...<br>
<br>
So next question .. which ppl. are looking for a tank ... Non tanks <br>
<br>
What is the thing non tanks want in a normal exp grinding time.<br>
<br>
No risk<br>
No death<br>
lots of exp.<br>
<br>
So except of the time when zones are so overcrowded that the puller can't find a mob all of this 3 part can be totally filled by a Paladin or an Sk but not really with a warrior. There is a momentum of risk to die when taunt failes when the proc is not comming when the cleric is dreaming a bit and the Mob has 2 lucky rounds  you know all the bullshit that can happen in the worst case szenario . And so the slower ... dies maybe one time in 5 hours .<br>
<br>
And you can discuss it or not .. Sony/Verant .. knows that problem well. Its the only reason they brought out /shield as a form of nice utility but also an eyecandy to make this problem not so fast visible.<br>

Interestingly enough a level 65 warrior in my guild assures me that from his experience, level 65 garners a noticeable increase in 'tauntability' - if we assume his own observations are accurate then perhaps both karthunk and glatius et al are partially corrrect. <br>
<br>
Karthunk then states however...<br>
<br>
I said &quot;level up to 65, get your guild to level up and fricken kill stuff&quot;. <br>
<br>
My question is, Why should level 65 and a guild capable of taking down seru be a neccessary requirement for a warrior to perform his class function with an acceptable level of efficiency? What is every warrior supposed to do before level 65? Grin and bear an imbalance?<br>
<br>
Yes I'm over stating the case to illustrate a point, but as Graal says..<br>
<br>
&quot;...they have to raise their abilities up to the point where it is obvious to other players who might consider asking them to group.&quot;<br>
<br>
I still say the gulf in INITIAL aggro generation is too wide...Maybe it doesn't kill the group but then again it's a pain in the arse if you're not the tank and just quietly grinding, one the group doesn't need to put up with...and possibly more important, a source of frustration to me personally, when the RNG lets me down. In that respect the 'push button aggro' of a knight or SK cannot be underestimated for quality of play experience - getting just under 30 AA's so i can finally do that once in 10 mins or so doesn't compare favourably....<br>

1. You cannot verify the percentage of taunt successes in PoP because of a lack of a feedback mechanism on a successful taunt: FACT, sorry, no opinion here... wanna rebut it?

<br>
You cannot verify that I'm wrong can you? Sorry, but I don't press my taunt key when a mob is on me unless I see a spell cast message on the mob (ie xx Yawns) that would pull it off me. The percent of times the mob has turned from me and doesn't turn right back around to me, after I press taunt, is actually less then 10-15 percent. Am I going to sit down with a notepad and write down the numbers of times the mob doesn't turn back to me when I press taunt?

I don't have to &quot;disprove&quot; your numbers, if you make a specific number claim, the burden of proof is on YOU to provide evidence for it.   Since you cannot, I can legitmately say &quot;Your number is bunk&quot;.

No, it's called the nature of evidence.  If you want your claim of 90% to be accepted, then provide evidence to back it up other than your &quot;feel&quot; because &quot;feels&quot; dont' work.   It's funny how the whole thing turns full circle.   Graal, in arguing against the &quot;everyone sees it&quot; argument, mentioned peoples' insistence on stat enhancing items as superior to AC/HP, yet the reality is, people made that claim based on the &quot;feel&quot; principle.  In other words, someone thought it helped them, yet when the evidence fell, the reality was that they didn't help nearly as much as originally thought.   People were arguing anecdotally, similarly to what you're doing... &quot;Str makes me hit harder&quot;... &quot;Prove it&quot;... &quot;I'm telling you, my experience is when I add Str, I hit harder&quot;... &quot;Prove it&quot;... the most common response was something along the lines of....<br>

<br>
That's a legitimate guess, but interestingly, let's see what the trends were, I followed this issue pretty closely.   <br>
<br>
The initial &quot;woe is me&quot; threads started with MY thread on the tavern entitled &quot;The state of warriors in EQ&quot;.   This was well before PoP and the issues that have been brought up since (i.e. mana costs of Sup Remedy, Sup Elixir, and Sup Light vs. Complete heal, and how they play out in terms of aggro vs. tanking efficiency) are different than what was in those, although there's some significant overlapping.  No, I'd venture to say that most warriors (myself included) gave PoP a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach, and generally looked positively upon the expansion at the beginning.  It wasn't until some of these issues began to show up that you started seeing the &quot;Aggro generation vs. Damage mitigation ratio&quot; arguments become apparent, and I'd ALSO venture to say that it was in response to other classes' perceptions of us, rather than us creating the perceptions.   If you'll note:  Most of the issues during the first couple of months of PoP that warriors were concerned about had little to do with this dynamic, but had to do with itemization, and caster/melee drop balance.   Threads that were popular discussed itemization and rolling on spectral parchments, not the aggro/durability ratio, that didn't appear until later.   <br>

<br>
Graal, <br>
Perhaps you just aren't well read or you only just started reading these boards. But the discussion about warrior taunt and our issues with the knights didn't start here. <br>
<br>
They started two weeks after the PoP release on the CLERIC boards with a thread that had a title along the lines of &quot;what tank do you prefer?&quot;. In that thread, the  clerics decided that the knights made better exp group tanks in pop. From there, the SHAMANS picked up a very similar titled thread. Then the PALADINS picked up the thread. <br>
<br>
After those threads had been floating around for a couple of weeks, the warriors cought on that the clerics had decided we weren't all that needed or wanted in an exp group and the shamans were feeling the same. <br>
<br>
So, before you spout off that this is just warrior ranting, go do your homework on the history of this gripe. <br>
<br>
Up until that initial thread on the cleric board, warriors were content to discuss the nuances of getting agro and why it seemed like we couldn't and tactics to dealing with it. <br>
<br>
But the Ever Quest community decided that we were now the subpar experience group tanks. <br>

The posts about knights being preferd as exp group tanks did not start here until after the threads at the cleric and shaman boards were at least a week old and they didn't start until about two weeks after the release of pop. <br>
<br>
Warriors have always discussed these issues and our preveious &quot;gipe&quot; session was the &quot;state of warriors&quot; thread last July and it did not touch on the issues being argued in the community today.<br>
<br>
Warriors were unhappy with what they got or rather didn't get in SoL and PoP. What sparked the inferno that is this argument was that thread on the cleric message board. <br>
<br>
At that time, warriors weren't going around saying we weren't wanted or that we were sub-par tanks. We were griping about not being able to generate enough agro to keep the slower from dying right away. We were griping about the casters getting all the drops because all the drops were parchments.<br>
<br>
Warriors had issues before this, but as usuall, after an initial flare up over one thread that died a month later, we went back to discussing if breast plate a was better than b and does beg really generate agro.<br>
<br>
We did not start this particular argument. Infact, when the warriors vs knights argument first came about, many, including myself were quick to deny that knights had a significant advantage over warriors in exp group tanking. However, through a lot of parsing on this board, the paladin board and even the monk board, and through a lot of &quot;don't tank, we want the sk to tank today&quot; a lot of warriors fully opened their eyes to the condition they were relegated to by the community and by soe.<br>
<br>
So before anyone goes off and says that warriors are just b1thching again, read up on the history of why we are complaining. <br>
<br>
Agro is half of what makes a tank a tank. If you aren't getting hit you aren't tanking. Initial agro in  PoP is a serious problem since slowers and healers prefer to have someone who can ensure agro group with them. <br>
<br>
Yes there will always be exceptions to the rule, but this what slowers and healers have decided. <br>
<br>
<br>
I admire Frodlin and Glatius they have stood up for the warrior class from day one. Frodlin has produced much evidence from parsing and presented it to knights on the Paladins of Norrath board. Anyone who has contested his numbers, then done the parsin he has, has come up with similar numbers. <br>
<br>
If you want to contest Frodlin's numbers, or his calling your numbers BS, go parse. Otherwise you are a  BS'ing fool who will get no respect here.<br>
<br>
If you want to tell me that warriors are just fine today, you had better damn well provide the data to back it up. Annecdotal evidence is nice to have since it gives the perception of the situation. However, if you are going to pull numbers from that evidence, please hose the bull sh1t from those numbers first. <br>
<br>
Lastly, DO NOT TELL US WARRIORS TO GO GET SOME PIECE OF CRUTCH EQUIPMENT! That argument is the weakest of all. VI posted that the majority of toons were between level 46 and 55 across all servers (see the EQ Live-Fippy's Facts section). Until those pieces of equipment can be purchased by all for 50 pp each in the plane of knowledge or some other place, that argument is bunk. <br>
<br>
but most importantly, if you are going to argue a point, then argue the poing and provide real evidence for it. Don't argue the person.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=broddathep>Brodda Thep</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/19/03 12:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ..</span><hr size=1> ON a side note, I agree that seru is a push over.... if you use a knight to tank him.  =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=graalthedorf>Graal the Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/19/03 12:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Graal, <br>

Actually, there were threads here about lack of taunt. I wasn't saying that was the cause of all those threads that were mentioned on the other boards...I read most of those threads myself and commented on some of them, agreeing on some, disagreeing on others.

Close. There were several vocal people who made that claim based on &quot;feel&quot;...and then many people assumed that the vocal few must be right. It made many of those who read those threads then &quot;feel&quot; they were doing more damage because their DEX was higher, and they reinforced that impression to others. <br>
<br>
I wasn't arguing the point about anecdotal evidence, I was arguing the point about people very often being sheep, about how people's impressions are very often colored by what they expect to see, and those people expected to see what someone else who seems &quot;smart&quot; asserts.<br>
<br>
That cleric thread that was mentioned was started by a warrior who also played a cleric, if memory serves me correctly. The responses for &quot;what is your favorite tank&quot; were pretty evenly spread between the 3 plate classes too, for the original couple of pages. Then it essentially got hijacked by other classes (warriors, paladin, SKs).<br>
<br>
I wasn't saying that those threads don't have anything valid to say, and I'm not saying that those people can't think for themselves, or that they only saw a difference in warrior-knight taunt after seeing those threads. I am saying that it suddenly seemed to be a much bigger problem after seeing that same sort of thread on different class boards...quite possibly making it appear to be a larger issue than it is. The next time your grouping with someone who doesn't read message boards and only plays causally, ask them who the best tank is for a an xp group. I'm guessing you'll get all sorts of responses, but those responses certainly won't be limited to the knight classes.<br>

&quot;So when the tank looses aggro they have several possibilities<br>
1. Paladin ... cast a fast stun ... chance for aggro is very very high maybe stun nr 2 .. chance is ultimate high for regainig aggro .. Time cost max 4 seconds.<br>
2. Sk some possibilities maybe not so good as the ones of the Palli but in around 4 to 6 seconds he should be able to 100 % regain agro&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I do have to be honest...<br>
<br>
The SK can regain agro very quickly and has several options at his disposal.<br>
<br>
While I have no proof but my own observations (and I have two good PLD friends that I group with often), festering darkness and stun are about equivalent in regards to how much agro they generate.  Fest darkness is a 4 sec cast snare and generates more agro then probably any other spell I have.<br>
<br>
Terror of Thule also works very well, and, with a 1.5 sec cast time, I use it often and frequently in conjunction with Fest. Darkness.  Its agro is NOT as good as Fest, but it IS very good nonetheless.<br>
<br>
A mob smacked with these 2 spells with almost assure me of agro and, if I lose agro, it generally takes only one of these to get it back.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
&quot;So now we come to the harder part. The warrior will have to do this part more often than the Sk and the Palli cause they throw their high aggro spells out when mob is incoming&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Is that the problem though?  If a warrior is playing the MT part, should the slower being before the mob reaches camp?  Hell, last night in CoD, my chanter buddy gained agro off of me (an SK) by tashing the mob before it reached camp.  This was a mob that I pulled with Fest darkness, which, as stated above, is probably the best agro spell Ive got.  Granted, he knows that I can get agro back fast as an SK, but if someone was doing that with a warrior as MT, then I think they are probably making a mistake.<br>
<br>
I guess my view on this is pretty simple--just let the warrior smash the mob a little more, in a manner similar to when tanking a *boss* mob.  Let the warrior set up a hotkey saying--ATTACK SLACKERS! when he feels that he has the agro established to not cause the group any problems.  So what if he takes a little more abuse on the front end--perhaps that is one of the drawbacks of being a class that can take the biggest beating.  The warrior CHs, in theory, should be more efficient than with a knight class tanking, so perhaps that is where the drawback is--on the front end, slowers should wait a little bit before debuffing / slowing.<br>

Sorry--I call BS.  I mean, I dont know if something is *broken* or not, but I do know that warriors make great exp group tanks.<br>

Yes, this would seem to make sense.  The problem lies in the fact that against an unslowed mob our better HP just don't last long enough make it work, unless of course you're talking some extremely well equipped Warrior who is nudging up against 9k or better buffed.  The 1k average difference in HP between Warriors and Knights will last perhaps an additional round or two against an unslowed mob.  In one round, if I'm using a 2hs weapon, I have a chance to triple swing, more likely I'll double swing, I might even single swing, and I have no assurance I'll hit at all.  If I'm dual wielding, and sucking up more ripostes as a result, I'll have more swings, but I'll hit for a lot less.  Which means that without a lucky proc, that one round of engagement does very little to my position on the aggro list, if anything.  Even if I get an additional round, because the mob got a bad round on attacks, I'll only be a little better off, barring some lucky hits.  After that, I've lost all my HP advantage if not even more.  I'm basically melting in front of the cleric's eyes.  And if against a slowed mob, the cleric needs to start casting at half health to land, they'll need to start right at contact to land against an unslowed mob.<br>
<br>
This is kind of risky.  It's risky for me, because it won't take much for the cleric's timing to be off.  It's risky for the cleric, because if slow hasn't landed by the time their CH goes off, they're almost bound to draw unslowed mob aggro.  It's risky for the slower, because he knows the cleric is going to be focused on healing the Warrior, so if he still draws aggro anyway, which he very likely will, the cleric may be mid way through a CH and unwilling to interrupt.<br>
<br>
One of the major things you need to remember is, that unlike tanking a boss mob, we don't have a bank of 3-9 clerics standing nearby doing a CH cycle.  Letting an unslowed PoP mob beat for a prolonged period on your average warrior, unless defensive, usually means bad things for someone. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>
