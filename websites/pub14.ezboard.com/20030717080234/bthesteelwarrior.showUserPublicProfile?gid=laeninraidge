I grew up in NY and moved to my new location (wouldn't you like to know)after 22 years.  I now live with my fiance and am soon to be breaking up with my rock group, Metallica.  They want me to stay, but I just cant agree with them on this Napster situation. Even the "poor" people who own computers should be able to hear our music, since a computer is cheaper than a stereo and all. 

I began playing video games before I started talking. I learned to read and speak by trying to figure out what the scores in games meant. All I was saying the first few years of my life was Level 1, or You Scored!!! (I dont hear the second much anymore). 

I'm into long walks off of short piers and drinking from broken fountains. 

I like anything that has to do with strategy, but most likely will lose interest in it because of a severe and blistering case of ADD (though I was gonna say something else, didn'cha). 

You might at times find me doing anything from playing chess, to bikeriding, to playing hockey, anything to take my mind off the fact I most likely will be working the next day. 

The thing I do most for fun is play everquest with my guild, Realm Powers. It's an extremely cool game which if it ever dies, I might wind up following with it. (To those who dont play, imagine your life without TV or books, divide your entertainment lvl by 30, and that would be my entertainment lvl without EQ).

Well, that's me. Find out more about me at my web page. There's not much yet because this addictive game I play never lets me do anything else. </span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">AOL - joeygates</span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="http://cs.hofstra.edu/~jercole1" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 		 		<span class="privatevalue">private</span>						</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
