An warrior worth his or her weight will do whatever it takes to gain that extra edge on aggro management; and keeping a mob's attention. None of this attempted fail attempt fail attempt OK got it lost it to someone else attempt again bullshit. Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to chase some damn mob around who you are attacking because some people decide they will do whatever to it? How about the whole &quot; aggro management is a groups focus&quot; arguement. Roll that up and smoke it. Know where the warrior fits in that equation as this time in EQ? The poor person with the mop bucket. Basically it boils down to &quot; let the warrior hit it for a while all by themself and if it moves turn attack off and lose DPS because the warrior is waiting on a proc or whatever &quot;. What a frickin timesink. <br>
<br>
Who wants a nerf? I sure as hell don't. I just want that damn button we've had for 57-odd levels to actually do something; no level restraints or chances for it not to work.<br>

Little tricks are fine.  And sometimes they can help a lot.  But really, you just shouldn't have to rely on little tricks like blind potions or snare potions to get things done.  Do Wizards rely on potions or tricks?  Do Clerics?  Does any class but Warriors really have to look far beyond the abilities they have innately from the game?<br>
<br>
We hear all the time about how the Warrior couldn't do his/her job.  And we all know what utter bunk that is, because for the most part the game is designed to make it as difficult as possible for us to do our job unless everyone cooperates.  Yet we still hear it.  Go over to Monkly business and you'll hear see Monk's pissing and moaning about how the group Warrior couldn't hold agro.  You'll here the same in the Safe House from the Rogues.  It gets old after a while.<br>
<br>
I recently joined a guild.  And at one of the raids I was SAing.  I was using a Wavecrasher primary hand and an ornate blade of the General off hand.  Neither of these are great, but neither are horrible either.  And eventually I got bumped from what I was doing for a Warrior who had a Willsapper and something else.  Mainly because I didn't have the 'snap' agro they wanted.   Can't say I blame them for wanting the best possible agro control.  But it sucks that its so difficult for the Warrriors.<br>
<br>
It would be nice if it depended more on your skill as a player and less on what you happened to aquire for your main hand and the random number generator. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/02 12:00:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://questing-ranger.com/images/mboards/archer-2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fixing the warriors in PoP and addressing taunt concerns</span><hr size=1> I really do not care about what warriors, paladins and shadow knights do in relation to each other but please keep us other classes out of this nonsense.<br>
<br>
As a ranger, I am crunchy enough in milk as it is thank you. I do not need to take even more damage than I already do when hit. My maxed out defensive stats are lower than all other melee and hybrid classes. When you add in the low hit points and low AC, I tank plenty of damage as it is and can drop very fast.<br>
<br>
Anyone who thinks that rangers need to take even more damage than they already do, truely does not understand the nature of the class. We are not so much tanks as a master of agro control. On one hand we have ways to gain agro quickly, while on the other we can ditch unwanted agro fast. While I can melee well, many a day I would rather just stand back and rain deadly arrows down on my foe. I have this taunt skill, but I really do not like having things beating me and trying to kill me. A ranger has enough problems as it is and is often times at odds with himself.<br>
<br>
Should you find a ranger tanking, it is usually because a more beefy tanking class wasn't around to do the job or the beefy tank was very poorly equipted. [Sorry, I believe that I should be able to out tank a warrior in crafted wielding Wurmslayer and some other sucky weapon with no haste.] I so rarely tank by choice. If I do, it is probably because I am soloing while LFG.<br>

While rather long winded, my reply was mostly in response to the comment to the following comments:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> If ranger/rogue +25 points of damage per hit.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
While it is true that Verant may not have intended for rangers to outdo warriors in damage, considering that we sit at the low end of the tanking pole and really should be viewed as a damage-dealing class... there really is no harm to anyone that we surpass the warrior on damage. [Most likely that is because we're senseable enough to let them take a beating for us.]<br>

What becomes a concern is when their damage not only comes close to equaling Warrior's, and in several cases surpassing by a wide wide margin, but they also come close to matching or surpassing our defense abilities.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to have someplace to shine other than having a 500 to 1000 more HP than most other melee and defensive.  Masters of offense?  No, I don't think so.  Masters of defense?

Verant has changed you to a cross between rogues and druids.  You are no longer a tank class.  You are a dps class.  <br>
My increase to damage wasn't to affect any place other then PoP where we could get class roles back into a controlable postition so every class would be desired in groups.  <br>
<br>
As for the warriors who say classes don't rely on equipment to much.  last I looked the mages and clerics still wanted their epics as did the shaman and a couple of others besides the warriors of younger guilds.<br>
<br>
Cheap tricks are a SOP for many folks.   I call getting extended range items so healers canstand back out of AoE ange a cheap trick.   There are far more &quot;cheap&quot; tricks that require aquasition of special items.  If this bothers the warrior class who knew from day one they were equipment dependent then perhaps the warriors should make new charecters.  If you are post 50 and just now finding out you relie on equipment then there's no hope for you.<br>
<br>
Please guys don't play me.  When I see in my groups a previously compentent warrior messing up and useing the same tactics he's always used then I'll reconsider taunt being broken.  Til then there's more class envy posted in reply to me then there is honesty.<br>
<br>
p.s. Sorry I'm not silent when your floating ideas that are potentialy class breaking to other classes. <br>
<br>
 What really bugs me is how much PoN have vetoed any paladin asking for def disc because PoN realizes how much this ability defines warriors.  They've also knocked down paladins who want other class envy things.  Why the warriors here aren't standing up and agreeing pal/sk should retain there taunt advantage is beyond me.  <br>
<br>
RoK boosted warriors taunt with both disc and new weapons<br>
SoV boosted warriors taunt with new weapons<br>
SoL boosted warriors taunt with new weapons and new aa points.<br>
<br>
I can see warriors getting a AoE taunt.  What is puzzleing to me is why pal/sk aren't higher in AoE taunting spells then we currently are.  This is setting a bad president  for future knights and warriors.  I have yet to see you game balance concerned warriors endorseing Sk's to regain their disease cloud or for ToK to be a AoE stun for paladins.  After debates here of late I've seen most warriors ask for nothing more then to be the undisputed kings of tanking and a pretty dang good dps to boot with a taunting skill that makes knights obsolete for anything other then misfit groups that no warrior wants in he first place.<br>
<br>
As for the gdmf 2handed dps envy most of you have.  GET A GDMF 2HANDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  God dang on raids it works wonders cause your dps goes up and your aggro goes down and since 90% of you aren't MT/ST what the heck is wrong with increaseing dps?  <br>
<br>
p.s. incase you haven't noticed many paladins lose there shield and 1hs despite the extra ac/hp it gives us.  Why because we want dps when we tank.  This means we're even less effective to heal then usual.  I grouped with a 2hander warrior the other day.  Odd he could keep aggro.  I'll bet he's useing a cheat program to do it.  ppfftt  whatever.<br>
<br>
/walks away shakeing his head mumbleing &quot;I was in support of eliminateing non traditional tanks in PoP and a small taunt increase when I came here yet the flames from warriors saying they'd need even more was dumb.  <br>
<br>

This from the person that wants...<br>
<br>
1. To tank as well as a warrior<br>
2. Have very similar damage output<br>
3. Be able to hold aggro WAY better than a warrior<br>
4. Have utility buffs and heals as well<br>
<br>
Who has the superman image now?  Maybee we should give Pally's 1000 hp nukes as well. I still dont understand why some people cant get the concept of the warrior being the best tank in the game. In case you didnt read any of the preceding posts I'll sum it up for you.<br>
<br>
Taunt- only really needs addressing in the aspect of taunt not working AT ALL against even con or higher mobs untill lvl 60. There should be a chance for it to work. I'm not talking about neck snapping instant aggro, but a chance.<br>
<br>
Mitigation- Warriors should be the masters of damage mitigation, followed by Knights... with the AC softcap and the High AC items that are all/all or Melee/all this allows many classes to reach the softcap thus negating most of a warriors mitigation advantage. Warriors should be on a seperate defensive/mitigation table (yes Knights as well but to a lesser degree) to put enough seperation between us and other classes so as to retain our class definition.<br>
<br>
The knight classes dont seem to want to pay the penalty for thier casting abilities.. you should be less proficiant than your parent classes in thier respective abilities, but when taken as a whole be considered a viable class in and of yourself. <p><div align="center"><embed width="468" height="148" src="http://www.ameritech.net/users/amplified/SWSig.swf"></div><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/02 8:25:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fixing the warriors in PoP and addressing taunt concerns</span><hr size=1> Taiil,<br>

If you would be so kind as to read most of Seventhswords posts, he very clearly supports warriors tanking better than paladins and Shadowknights, he just doesn't want the difference to be as much as most warriors here want it to be.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, let me share a hypothetical group with you.<br>
<br>
Shaman<br>
Paladin<br>
Rogue<br>
Rogue<br>
Monk<br>
Wizard<br>
<br>
Nice group at 60, right?  They do lots of damage (four DPS classes) and have a tank (paladin) and a healer (shaman) plus the Paladin can backup heal and/or downtime heal.<br>
<br>
What if the paladin were an inefficient tank?  By that I mean he ended up at 2bubbles of health at the end of every fight and the shaman was spending 2 bubbles of mana or more healing him, and he was constantly oom from healing himself?<br>
<br>
Well, then you would want a warrior, right?<br>
<br>
But then where would the paladin fit into a group?  He could do the healing role **IF** he invested a lot of AAXP into getting healing skills and if he had some good focus gear.  But if he was a tank oriented paladin (I call that a crusader), or if he wasn't level 60 and didn't have Celestial Cleansing? Even if he WAS 60 with good AA skills, he wouldn't have the buffs that the shaman could offer the group.<br>
<br>
The point a lot of paladins want all of you to understand (and it's NOT that we are weak anymore or underpowered) is that paladins have a lot of utility, yes.  BUT all that utility mimics some other classes abilities.  AND they can do it better than we can.<br>
<br>
If you drop a tank because he's inefficient, why would you want to get a healer/buffer who is inefficient?  You wouldn't, you'd take a shaman at level 56 over a level 60 paladin, IF the paladin couldn't tank efficiently.  In the end, there are only so many roles that can be filled in an xp group, and the only one that paladins can fit into well is the role of tank.  Not DPS, not healer.  If warriors become the recognizably best tanks around, paladins will end up without xp groups.  Again.<br>
<br>
While we desperately want to avoid that, high end paladins as a whole DO NOT want to see the paladin class get Defensive.  They recognize that this would effectively remove the need for warriors.  Many high-end paladins now recognize that there is an issue with warriors in xp groups at the high end, and are advocating changes to taunt OR to mitigation.<br>
<br>
Again, remember, Seventhsword has advocated and will support changes to mitigation to improve warriors, shadowknights and paladins.  He just wants to ensure that warriors are not so far ahead of shadowknights and paladins as to make the &quot;lesser&quot; two classes undesired in xp groups.  That has happened in the past, and paladins who were there at the time are passionate about seeing that it doesn't happen again.<br>

1) at the BEGINNING OF THIS THREAD, seventhsword lists a mitigation example he is willing to support.  Go read it.  He put warriors ahead of paladins.  You already have more hp, he's suggesting that you should mitigate better than us ALL THE TIME.<br>

2) In the post that you just responded to, Seventhsword tells you how to increase your DPS:  GET A HIGH END 2HANDER!<br>
<br>
3) Read the first post in this thread AGAIN.  ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  Seventhsword supports an INCREASE to warrior taunt.  That's (by the reasoning on this board) a RELATIVE DECREASE IN PALADIN aggro over a warrior.  He's suggesting a way of reducing the difference between warriors and paladins, making it so we don't quite taunt &quot;WAY better than a warrior.&quot;<br>
<br>
4) If your suggestion for balancing paladins, now that we can actually be useful in xp groups, is to take away all our spells and special abilities, I don't think you understand class balance.<br>

Hi low level warrior here just wanted to ask you a question. So from your post with your group you put togther there nice group by the way you want to be able to take as little damage as a warrior be able to root the mob heal yourself so the shaman can haste and slow. So where does the warrior fit in at all if pally=almost as good tank and can root and heal himself? <br>

See here is where we have a fundamental misunderstanding because of differences in class and how they operate.  You're talking about things in that paragraph that are NICE to have.  Yes people want them.  But NO they don't need them to perform the barest function of their jobs.  You really really don't understand.  Taunt is a temporary effect, it will turn a mob towards you momentarily, however if anyone does anything that moves them higher on the agro list it bounces right back to them.<br>
<br>
A Warrior doesnt keep agro with taunt.  He keeps it with agro procs, haste, and fast weapons.  Without them his taunt button is really USELESS.<br>
<br>
It is completely obvious to me that you have never played a 50+ Warrior or this wouldn't be so difficult to understand.  Taunt is only really good for pulling a mob back off someone who has STOPPED doing anything more to piss it off or who is working to reduce their place on the hate list.  <br>
<br>
Don't patronize us by explaining the obvious, that all classes WANT gear enhancements.  Because we aren't so ignorant as to not understand that.  But a cleric can still rezz and heal without an epic.  A shamen can still buff and slow without an epic.  A mage can still have a pet and cast nukes without an epic.  A warrior CAN NOT hold agro without haste, procs, and fast weapons.  Let me say that again, in case you aren't hearing me.  A warrior CAN NOT hold agro without haste, procs, and fast weapons.<br>
<br>
We don't get agro in a can!  It just doesn't work like that for us!  Believe it!<br>
<br>
You put a Warrior without these things in a group with a Monk with any amount of haste and a Rogue with any amount of haste and the healer will be healing them both all night long, or they will be shedding agro so much their DPS will drop through the floor.  You put a Warrior up against a boss mob without these things and you have a wiped raid.  FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT HERE.<br>
<br>
And you know what, many of us here have been playing a bleeping Warrior for a bleeping long time.  We don't need you to educate us on how its played, because we know.  So why don't you take your condesending attitude back to PoN?  If you're not willing to at least listen with an open mind, we really don't need your input.<br>

When MT'ing a 2hs is not a viable option for aggro for most warriors, so that is a moot point. WRT 7's proposal for mitigation, 10 points per hit in the 50+ game is approx 7% or less (doing rough numbers in my head) difference in mitigation. In my opinion that just isnt enough of a difference. that 7% coupled with slightly higher hp's (greater in some cases and less in others) does not make up for all the other utility and ability of the knight class. I agree that the balance point is a fine line, I dont want to make the knight classes useless again, I happen to like having them around. However I do want to be able to do the one thing I can do, and that is tank. Warriors should be the top choice for a tank in most situations (70-80%) with knight classes being the top choice in the other 20-30% and a viable alternative for the rest. There just has to be some sort of melee penalty to compensate for your spellcasting ability.. thats the only way to be balanced. <p><div align="center"><embed width="468" height="148" src="http://www.ameritech.net/users/amplified/SWSig.swf"></div><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/02 11:48:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=57>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://questing-ranger.com/images/mboards/archer-2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fixing the warriors in PoP and addressing taunt concerns</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If we are broken let us who are warriors decide, if we need aid let the brotherhood decide the need.

<br>
While I agree that warriors should decide what is best for warriors. They are not necessarily best equipted to decide what is best for other classes in terms of the amount of damage we take.<br>
<br>
For example, casters are very fragile as it is and I do not believe that they need to take an extra 75 points of damage per hit to convince them not to tank. [Many rangers go the archer route through advancement skills and thusly cannot tank while shooting arrows.]<br>
<br>
With the exception of the two knight classes, the other classes do not even have the same defensive skill levels of warriors. Therefore I believe that any imbalance lies solely between warriors and the two knight classes.<br>

Who has the superman image now? Maybee we should give Pally's 1000 hp nukes as well. I still dont understand why some people cant get the concept of the warrior being the best tank in the game.

I tend to agree with your perception of our paladin friend here. Paladins should be viewed as paladins, not as some warrior/cleric hybrid thing that needs the full power of both of thoes classes to be viable. They shouldn't be able to out tank warriors and approach the damage levels of the classes that are supposed to be specialized in that area.<br>

There must be a problem with my posts.  I can see that there are people who are not seeing what I am writing, maybe my font color is off or something.  Let me repeat myself so you understand.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Where we seem to have a sticking point with the posters on the Steelwarrior website is in the degree of separation.  We (paladins) do not think that warriors should be superior to the other tank classes by enough that paladins and shadowknights are unneeded or unwanted in an xp group.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical group that I mentioned is a good group.  At level 30, for example, they would be as good a group as level 60.  But at level 30 the paladin DEFINITELY could not take the place of the shaman, not by any stretch.  My point in showing you that group was to point out that SOMETIMES a paladin can take the place of the shaman, but that in a really picky/highly efficient xp group, the paladin can only fill one of those roles satisfactorily.  And that is the role of tank.  <br>
<br>
Like it or not, paladins and warriors contend for the same spot in the highly theoretical, maximum efficiency xp group.  And if warriors become &quot;the clear choice for tanking!&quot; as so many of the warriors here seem to want to be (again), then that will mean a return to the &quot;Slough of Despond&quot; when many paladins left the game, or created clerics or rogues, because our class was so little desired.<br>
<br>
And to specifically answer this part of your question &quot;where does the warrior fit in at all if paladin=almost as good tank and can root and heal himself&quot;  The warrior fits in to the group that already has someone to root and heal, and instead of wanting a backup for that role, wants the maximum efficient tank (assuming lower levels, as you mentioned that you were).<br>
<br>
I said it before, let me point it out again:  paladin utility is nice, true.  But it's not really useful when you group with a shaman or druid.  They can do pretty much all the &quot;utility&quot; stuff that we can, and they can do it better than we can when we're all the same level.<br>
<br>
Haste - paladins can do it for themselves, shamans can do it for everyone in the group.<br>
healing - paladins can do it some, but all the priest classes can do more healing sooner.<br>
root - all the priest classes can root before paladins can.  Druids can snare, which is really handy.<br>
<br>
I admit, it took me a long time to understand the real issues, back when I started playing (in the post Kunark &quot;Age of Despair&quot;).  But after enough explanations, I caught on that, while paladins can tank, we weren't the first choice, and if people wanted to maximize efficiency, they would choose a warrior.<br>
<br>
Now, when you have a group that consists of the following<br>
<br>
shaman<br>
monk<br>
rogue<br>
rogue<br>
wizard<br>
<br>
then they want a paladin.<br>
<br>
But if you had this group:<br>
<br>
cleric<br>
monk<br>
rogue<br>
wizard<br>
enchanter<br>
<br>
They might want a warrior.<br>
<br>
I'm probably rambling by now, because I didn't have my coffee this morning.  But I hope at least someone understood the crucial points I'm trying to make.<br>

I would agree with you that this is true, until the Warrior and Paladin are both level 60 and have substantial NToV gear.  At that point it really becomes a different story.  The Warrior and Paladin are both going to have more than enough HP to do the job.  Since both have equal mitigation and the Warrior's higher avoidance doesn't seem to be that much more substantial, what would end up happening is that the Paladin would be selected for both groups because of his solid and quick ability to generate agro.<br>
<br>
Defensive and evasive are useless most of the time in groups.  No advantage there.  So, if you had a choice between a tank that would lose 1 bubble of health per mob and one that would lose 1 and a half bubbles of health per mob but could stun, heal, root, LoH, etc, who would you pick?<br>
<br>
Seriously, think about it.  The healing really isn't an issue. Either the Shamen or the Cleric is going to be able to keep up just fine under most experience scenarios given tanks of that calibre.  Either class can tank more than acceptably.  So why go with the Warrior?  The Paladin can even heal himself at the end of most battles and not even lose much time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usurlok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Surlok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/02 7:49:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fixing the warriors in PoP and addressing taunt concerns</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> RoK boosted warriors taunt with both disc and new weapons<br>

I don't know who you are but you ignored me last time so I will say it again.<br>
<br>
Again you list things available to warriors in the 50 plus game.This does not correct the problems warriors below 50 plus have.It is not in verants interest to have level 15 warriors with Frostbringers.<br>
<br>
You have established that warriors 50+ have all sorts of tools avaiable to them for obtaing and keeping aggro.So be it.<br>
<br>
When a level 10 warrior completes his Newbie quest and sits down next to a rogue who has just finished his, and compares stats, he will find that the rogue has near the same AC as him ..at level 10.That is wrong.<br>
<br>
When Paladins are running around with Bind,Stun Heals and Yaulp at level 9 and SK's have Disease cloud,Lifetap and a pet warriors are fighting to get to level 10 so they can get a new defensive skill that both the other classes will get soon enough..<br>
<br>
Stop argueing about how defensive and AA's make a warrior ...all your doing is proving that the class is completely broken until such a time when it is able to train in these abilitys,and I am sure that is not your goal.When a Warrior shines at his ability at level 9..then you can start talking about his ability at level 60. <p>The Champion - <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=282318>Surlok Soulbain</a> -
