I haven't seen any sort of this discussion here at this board, and I decided to stimulate some or make people more aware of the problems.<br>
<br>

<br>
The AE-style attacks of higher end encounters really hurts the ability for melee to move in and attack.  As MT for my guild most of the time this doesn't concern me personally, but I know that all our melee spend time trying to joust around the AE's or using ranged attacks to do damage.  With the persistance of AE rampage going off frequently though, this renders jousting into a risk since they can easily be killed in one rampage round.  Unless you can sustain high DPS in these kinds of fights with ranged attacks, then you're useless.  I know warriors and rogues have higher archery caps to do some decent damage but still this pales in comparison to their melee, and for other melee aside from rangers ranged attacks aren't viable.<br>
<br>
The only solution I can think offhand is to do something like reduce the range of AE rampage to just shy of the max melee range to allow people to melee, or reduce the frequency or damage of the rampage.  Increase any AE's to compensate.  This way, melee can do their thing without fear of dying in one round of rampage.  I still want these fights hard, but the current state of AE Rampage is stupid unless you intend to send waves of melee in to get cut down instantly by it.<br>

<br>
There have always been fights where it was preferential to have melee stand off, from Kunark to Pop, but the isssue now is the sheer number of fights where it's just far more practical to not have melee really even participate.<br>
<br>
AE rampage needs to be redone first of all.  The ideal solution is instead of removing it, to simply make the rampage hits for LESS than their main target hits.  I'd say (AE) rampage hits for around 10-20% of their max but tunable per fight.<br>
<br>
So something could hit the MT for 2k, but would only AE rampage for in the 200s, which even when quaded is something that would be manageable.<br>
<br>
As far as AOEs go, they need to alter a lot of them.  They changed the resist system around before pop, and yet because of what they did, it's still all but useless and doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
They need to alter the AOEs to not all be, all or nothing.  The damage you take should scale with your resists because even at 500 in a resist, you can just not resist an aoe or two and you're dead.  A 3k AOE wouldn't be terribly bad IF, you could partially resist damage because of your resist levels.  <br>
<br>
The saddest part is, that as they jack the numbers up, AE rampaging for 1k+, huge AOEs, the difficulty generally goes down since less people generally participate and it comes down to one single thing, keeping the MT alive.  A 3k AOE landing on a MT that's being healed by 10+ healers is just a tiny blip on the radar and means nothing.  AE rampage means jack when no one else is even around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkhosis>Darkhosis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/03 7:07 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.cox-internet.com/hosis/dingo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Decline of melee in PoP</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>AE rampage needs to be redone first of all.

Well, the way I look at it.. why have changes that limit close combat melees, but not casters and/or ranged melees?  There's no balance here, there's nothing going on that's owning those wizards at r 200 or those rangers at r 200+.<br>
<br>
If AE rampage did such a miniscule amount of damage, it'd be trivial.  If it does too much, it unfairly penalizes melees.   If you're in a cleric shortage situation, most melees have to just sit back and use ranged weapons.  But AE rampage fights pale in comparison to some of the AEs, like Blazzax has an AE that's so damaging that the cleric will likely run out of mana or die from having to cast WoR a couple times a minute if you're in a melee group that has to charge to do tangible damage.  Some people would suggest having an AE &quot;caller&quot; but it simply isn't feasible.. you can't hide behind walls anymore.  For a 30 second recast AE you'd spend a good 50% of your time running back and forth and waiting for AE calls, that's 50% less damage.. and instead of being outdamaged 1.5 or 2x by ranged combatants, you're being outdamaged 3 or 4x.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>AE rampage means jack when no one else is even around. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It reduces DPS by the guild as a whole and makes melees that rely on being in close pissed off.  Could just remove it and increase mob HP to compensate.  But then you'd still have the problem with the high % of mobs that have an AE that devastates close combatants, but does nothing to anyone else.  Like I said in other post, not really any easy (good) solutions.  You'd have to rework nearly every encounter to properly &quot;balance&quot; things.  Could just increase every melee's ranged damage to be nearly on par with rangers, but that wouldn't make much sense. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=407925">Zevus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

You just cant have melees attack a mob that ae rampages for 3k quad each round or casts a 3k 100 range ae every 10 seconds. I have throwing and archery maxed now...had 0 before. Verant took the easiest way to create harder encounters by adding AE dmg that cannot be healed effectively instead of thinking of new mob abilities (not the get it wrong, most PoP encounters are well designed, especially the scripts are fun..i love the RZ script).<br>
<br>
The only thing verant could do is changing the ae and ae rampage ranges to 5-10 feet less then the mob radius, so people can hit it and if they move a bit to close get hit. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2699">Eichelbogubk</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://mc.pemocom.com">Magna Charta</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=surlok>Surlok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/03 8:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Decline of melee in PoP</span><hr size=1> I am not in any of these zones so maybe no right to comment...<br>

Would a Rampage list that held say five people and blurred itself every rampage and started with a new five people work?<br>
<br>
You would still have the danger of being a melee but it would not hit all of them just 5 and then the next round five different guys and so on..forcing you to have healers focus on these rampage targets and switching about ..It still doesn't affect casters in any way I know, but Casters being unaffected by AE is not really something new with PoP so I don't see them changing that now...<br>
<br>
I saw someone toss the idea of Improving Melee Range Attacks outside of Rangers....<br>
<br>
This change would likely result in altering other changes that are in/may have gone in for certain melee....<br>

With no ridiculous AE these mobs would be fun and hard as you have to deal with the area spell and cant get out of range. Of course you cant add Blazzax AE then, hehe.<br>
<br>
Just an idee for verant to make mobs hard but not boring for melees. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2699">Eichelbogubk</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://mc.pemocom.com">Magna Charta</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tamria>Tamria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/18/03 2:25 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I dream of dancing eggplant.</span><hr size=1> It's pretty hard to design encounters that are fun for everyone and not either too easy or zergable.

<br>
Whoever designed the TZ encounter should get kudos though - they should use similar ideas on other fights. For example in PoFire have something lobbing PB AE 4-5k fireballs (random direction every 30 secs or something), make the wizzes at least have to run about or get fried :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rani>rani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/18/03 3:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re:</span><hr size=1> Yeah atm there seem to be many advantages to ranged attacks and pretty much no downsides.<br>

As long as you have the basic requirements/strats for a raid, there is no DPS problem that an additional 10 wizards couldnt solve better than any other class(save perhaps enchanter, until charm is nerfed). <br>

They are also easier to bot as well. I dont know about you guys, but I am getting a tad tired running around a mass of melee, trying to get my pitifull DPS in, and at the end of the day when you parse it you find out it is insignificant compared to other classes DPS.

I'd have to disagree, at least for the non-RZ ring TZ.  This is the guy that lobs arrows that snare, teleports around the arena, does splash AE ownership, etc.  In short, this makes it much, much harder for melees to do damage than casters.  It also means that since melees will be more clustered together, the chance of them eating one of those splash arrows is a lot higher, especially if you're near a warrior.  It's one of the most unbalanced encounters in the game melee vs caster, in terms of ability to inflict damage.<br>
<br>
Is it well designed?  Sure, it's pretty cool.  But for every TZ, there needs to be a mob where casters are ineffective.  Maybe mobs need to actually start resisting some spells again, laf.<br>

Nod, nearly all PoP fights I've seen so far would be trivially easy with 10 wizards. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=407925">Zevus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If they did a similar encounter without the shadow step it would be cool, possibly give the mob a high riposte skill so although he was primarily using ranged attacks against casters there would still be a cost for melees otherwise it would be too easy to exploit.<br>

They should also give some mobs a chance to deflect spells back on the caster <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bingor>Bingor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/19/03 6:24 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~timharron/Bingor.jpg width=140 heighth=160></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I dream of dancing eggplant.</span><hr size=1> Make those mass damage AEs resistable with 400+ resists.
