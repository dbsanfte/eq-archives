What do u think</span><hr size=1> Hello all. I've come here to ask for your opinions on the following post.  Please keep in mind this is written from my point of view and I'm honestly trying to be considerate to the topic and the classes envolved while still makeing some tough choices.  Please enjoy the read and help me smooth this out to a workable product instead of a burnt thread.  Thanks<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The first change needs to be every class save the paladin, warrior, shadowknight has a 15% chance per tic of being swapped on the hate list with the lowest character on the mob's hate list. This will allow monks and rangers to continue their soloing careers. THIS SHOULD ONLY BE ON NEW POP CONTENT AND ANY OTHER NEW CONTENT. <br>
<br>
--------------- <br>
Simplisticaly vi should make 3 types of mobs. <br>
<br>
One type that Warriors tank best but Paladins and Shadowknights can tank too. 25% of the new mobs. <br>
How? code in mobs to register as type 1. All warriors should get a 15% damage reduction from mobs of type 1. <br>
<br>
One type that Shadowknights tank best but Warriors and Paladins can tank too. 20% of the new mobs. <br>
How? code in mobs to register as type 2. All shadowknights should get a 15% damage reduction from mobs of type 2. <br>
<br>
One type that Paladins tank best but Shadowknights and Warriors can tank too. 20% of the new mobs. <br>
How? code in mobs to register as type 3. All paladins should get a 15% damage reduction from mobs of type 3. <br>
<br>
<br>
Then vi should mix 35% of the zones with a equal sprinkleing of type 1-3 mobs. This allows for groups to be more benificial when useing 2-3 tanks of different classes. This would finaly allow tanking to stack in exp groups and make all three tank classes desireable on raids in these zones. <br>
<br>
Leave old content as is, so that monks, rangers and bards don't lose anything they've already done. <br>
<br>
------------- <br>
As for direct fixes to paladins? <br>
ToK <br>
Mana 200 <br>
Cast time 2 secs <br>
Recast 10 seconds <br>
Durration 3 tics <br>
Effect AoE Cold based Stun over time. The mob would check once each of the four tics to resist. The Stuns would be instent, just enough to interupt casting. The spell would have lure line resitability. The aggro should be high. <br>
<br>
Divine stun should be a once per 10 minute auto stun which lasts for .1 seconds and works on any mob up to level 72. <br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
Shields should reduce damage taken by a percentage. The better the shield the better the percentage. This should be true only for Paladins, Warriors, Shadowknights. Warriors should have shields that when bashed successfuly against a mob generate some nice hate to make up for lost dps hate. <br>
<br>
Warriors should lose def disc. <br>
Warriors should generate 10% more hate with dps then normal when useing a shield. &lt;-- All things accounted for this should make up for the lost hate of dual wielding while going def disc. <br>
Since discipline were added to give pure melees more depth as to allow for tactics to be developed I'd like to add this to the warriors' arsenals. <br>
In place of def disc warriors combat disc should function as follows and use the same timer as def disc did. <br>
<br>
It would be called combat tactic. It would operate depending on how the warrior was equiped and would lock the warrior into that weapon selection til he died or the disc ended. <br>
<br>
Warrior equiped with a shield and 1 handed weapon while useing the discipline would reduce taunt grey out by 20% there by allowing him to taunt more often. <br>
<br>
Warriors duel wielding with a primary of a slashing would get a 1% accumtive chance per tic to have a mob snared. The snare durration would be 60 seconds. The % chance would reset after the effect took hold. <br>
<br>
Warriors duel wielding with a blunt in primary would get a 1% accumitive chance per tic to slow a mob by 15%. The durration would be 60 seconds. The % chance would reset after the effect took hold. <br>
<br>
Warriors duel wielding with a piercer would have a 1% accumitive chance of dotting a mob. The dot would last 45 seconds and do damager per tic equal to the warrior's level. The % chance would reset after the effect took hold. <br>
<br>
A warrior with a 2 handed weapon would do 20% more damage per hit/crit. <br>
<br>
Lastly since def disc was originaly given to warriors so they could escape death and make it to the zone I'd like warriors to gain a discipline called Spirint. Sprint would give warriors once every 72 minutes a running speed equal to wolf form speed for 1 minute. <br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
Heals. <br>
Druids should get a 3k comeplete heal casting time of 7 instent recast. Mana cost 300 lvl 57 <br>
Shaman should get a 2k complete heal casting time of 7 instent recast. Mana cost 300 lvl 58 <br>
Paladins should get a 1.5k heal with a casting time of 2 recast 5 seconds. Mana cost 300 lvl 59 <br>
So in a 15 second spread a druid could heal 6k, a shaman could heal 4k and a paladin could heal 4.5k with the druid shaman spending 600 mana and the paladin spending 900. <br>
<br>
--------------------- <br>
Paladin role defined. <br>
Paladins would be the best tank for 20% of the new content. The paladins would have a role in raids and tough exp grinds as a combat medic. <br>
<br>
-------- <br>
A word about the shields reduction in damage. <br>
Shields like the sbs should be 15% reduction in damage. The harder the shield is to get the better the reduction % should be. Working up to a max of 30%. The old world boss mobs should be classified as primarily type 1 with a few casters being type 3 and a few bizare aggros being type 2. This allows younger guilds to still do these mobs as long as they use the right tank and a sbs shield instead of the def war or the stunning paly or the aggro generateing sk/monk. <br>
<br>
The limit to damage reduction should be set at 45%. With no shields in pre PoP being above 25% and none in PoP being above 35%. <br>
<br>
------------ <br>
I know that all of the above is alot of codeing and work for vi but it would fix the following things <br>
1 tanking balance <br>
2 healing balance <br>
3 the paladin class. <br>
Sorry for not knowing what current things other classes have that are broken and not being fixed. All I can judge is my class and how I compare to others in places that our skills over lap.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
p.s. I realize the paladins and shadowknights would return to a place in game balance that was given for a time to your class.  I also realize that of late many classes have stepped on this same ground. What I'm trying to do is stack tanking of different classes and reduce the number of tanking classes to 3 in new content.  <br>
If I could get enough support for this thread I honestly believe SU3 could be seriously nerfed in compensation.  It is currently the only true kick arse ability of the paladin class.  SU3 may seem great or minor to you all but to us paladins the few undead taged mobs we have with this skill is our biggest piece of glory despite it's relitive uselessness in almost all raids and most zones.<br>
<br>

Trolling the boards again. Very good. I think 5 times people have told you the same thing and each time you've stoutly refused to listen. YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THE BETTER TANK! This is something that (at least in theory, far from practice) you sacrifice in exchange for having spell-casting ability. <br>
<br>
So, let me get this straight. YOu want to be the better tank in 20% of game encounters (irregardless of XP groups apparently; because you are already better XP tanks than warriors). You also want an AOE stun that works in lvl 60+ mobs. YOu also want a 1.5k cheal with a small cast time. For all of this, what do you wish to sacrifice? Apparently nothing since you are parading like a chicken with it's head cut off about how paladins do not have a defined raid role.<br>
<br>
Now, you also want warriors to lose disc defensive. Keep in mind now, you are still on the same mitigation tables as we are. You want us to generate 10% more agro, which would still be far less than you can, with a shield; considering we have no good shields, and using 1-handers with damage/delay ratios far worse than yours. This, you justifiy is equal to losing /disc defensive.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know if you're just that stupid or troll for the fun of it. But get this through your head. you CANNOT tank as well as warriors, and get brand spanking new spells without giving up your class versatility and spell casting. Get this through your head, warriors are good for exactly one thing; tanking. THat all we do, this is what we give up spell-casting, good damage output and versatility to do. Now, you wanna do the same, without giving up and of your versatility, and having even more spell-casting? Sorry junior, don't work that way. You seriously need to stop trolling warrior boards.<br>

What do u t</span><hr size=1> Ok so I missed some of your current problems.  Like I've said I'm trying to hammer things out.<br>
<br>
Lets start with the where.  I'm suggesting alterations for PoP and any other new content.  Not what's currently on the game.  Why?  because I'm not looking to berf people on current content.<br>
<br>
Ok you admit currently that paladins and sk's own you in exp groups. <br>
<br>
I say I want you to own both paladins and sk's hands down in 25 % of any new exp mobs while paladins and sk's can only own you on 20% of the mobs each.  This according to you is wrong because why?  Because currently paladins and sk's own you in all exp groups?  I'm sorry you don't want the increase in power.<br>
<br>
I then say I want tanking with different classes to stack in groups.  This would give all three classes the ability to join the same group and be a welcome addition.  Yet apparently you don't want this because it'd make you wanted in an addition 35% of the exp groups.  So let me understand this.  You currently say paladins and sk's own you in all the exp groups.  I come here and offer you a solution where you'd be wanted in 60% of all exp groups in new content and you dislike this idea because it doesn't make you over powerd like you were in RoK?  Sorry I'm not for RoK 2.0<br>
<br>
I also say I want your secondary ability as a dps class to be upgraded and in exchange for that You'd share 40% of the new content boss mobs and be required for tanking on 60% of the raids.  Yet this is wrong because right now pal/sk can tank all boss mobs below their guilds which is roughly 60% of all your raids.  Ok so I'm basicaly asking for my tanking to be lowerd in respects to yours but for it to be locked in at a minimal amount and you have a problem with this because why?  <br>
<br>
I also ask for your duel wield to get new abilities so you can actualy do some importent roles in groups when the primary classes for it aren't there.  and again this is wrong because why? hmmm I've hear other warriors here ask for similiar things so you dislike it why?  Because I said it?<br>
<br>
I also ask for vi to make it so monks/rangers and any other non heavy tank can't tank despite getting ac/hp/abilities that are close enough to our equal.  Yet this is wrong why?<br>
<br>
In short I offer you an chance to support improvements to your class that are better then the ones to my own class and you reject it out of hand because I didn't ask vi to nerf my tanking back to that of a rangers?  being the best tank doesn't mean you tank everything the best.  It means most of the time you tank the best.  I'd realy have expected more agreements with me on these things since they are some of the things I've seen asked for here.<br>
<br>
I've also seen respected warriors here ask for def disc to be nerfed so that you guys could evolve and grow in your raid role.  Yet I offer the very same thing and I get flamed?<br>
<br>
I admit I over looked the 1handed/shield problem of damage.  if def disc was given up and the shield portion implemented I'd be all for supporting warriors getting their 1 handed weapons damage being improved maybe by moveing it to the 2 handed damage table?  Unsure if that make it about right or not but you get the idea.<br>
<br>
You will never be the best tank in 90% of all eq encounters and it's about time we learn to work together for improvements instead of at odds with each other.   Please take a look at my opening remarks again and think about it.  <br>
<br>
I'm willing to put SU3 on the table and bring you far more into the exp groups then you are now.   Doesn't that atleast require some honest discussion of this thread instead of a flame war and misrepresenting what I've said?<br>
<br>

At least be creative when picking apart his ideas, and say why they may or may not be good.<br>
<br>
Also, I agree that we should be the first choice for tanking.. but give the pallies and SKs at least something. My own suggestion would be undead. Paladins and SKs would have *slightly* better mitigation than they normally do against undead. The RP reasonings for this would be Paladins and their zelaous crusades against these unholy beings and SKs just having an intemate knowledge of death and undeath, these being what they deal with on a daily basis. I wouldn't make these kick in till high level, and yes, possibly only in PoP.<br>
<br>
This is just an off the top of my head idea. We still tank better, but they get close enough to be a very viable alternative. (Which I have NO problems with, personally)<br>

<br>
- First, your &quot;Content Sharing&quot;. Yeah, great. You know you already have that with the undeads. But warrior are the ones who train to fight EVERYTHING (except magic stuff, perhaps). There is no <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;oh, Gargoyles, I will not learn to fight gargoyles, for reason X or Y&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Our only goal is to tank, and to tank everything. We do not have utility and that's our gift in exchange of the Main tank role.<br>
<br>
- About your &quot;New discipline&quot; with warrior snaring, doting, etc... THAT'S NOT OUR ROLE. You will remove desirability for necros, shaman, rangers... This is the opening to &quot;Warrior team&quot;. Remember team manaburn ?<br>
<br>
and HOW can say stuff like that ?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Lastly since def disc was originaly given to warriors so they could escape death and make it to the zone I'd like warriors to gain a discipline called Spirint.

Ohhh Yes we are. When it's only related to tanking, we are. When you need Knight stuff (snare, backheal, summon water), we are not. This is all about game balance : We can tank. You can tank + utility (but not as good as tanking).<br>

Absorbing damage<br>
Holding arrgo<br>
Regaining aggro when lost.<br>
<br>
Please stop deluding your selves.  The only thing You've owned since RoK unbalanced eq is the absorption angle &lt;-- unless we count monks, bard/rangers def disc <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Paladins and shadowknights have always owned the arrgoing aspects and we always will.  You want someone to absorb blows the best you get a warrior.  You want someone to hold aggro like crazy glue you get a sk/pal &lt;-- sk's hold it the best currently.  So please stop it with your pretended sacrifice of only wanting to absorb and taunt the best.  You can't have it all for 2 reasons<br>
1 you want to always be a great dps class.<br>
2 if you held arrgo the best the game wouldn't be challenging cause the only challenge would be making sure the CH cycle wasn't broken.<br>
<br>
Really guys you need to try honesty once in a while.<br>
<br>
p.s. I started out as a tank pre RoK and pre 9th lvl.  I have always been a great group tank and I'll be damn to heck if I'd ever support warriors being the best group tank in 100 frigging % of the game.  My offer's on the table.  <br>
<br>
<br>
One last remark to the people dising me.<br>
No one ever said you were to be the best tank.  I received my spells so in combination with my lower natural abilities I could rise above that of a mundane warrior as long as I could master the tougher level of game I played, since I chose a class harder then easy.<br>
<br>
How you can ignore logic and reason is beyond me but dang you're doing it very well.  <br>
<br>
My apologies to the readers here but I tend to be only as polite as those who respond to me are polite.  <br>

What do u t</span><hr size=1> The only situation, if I had any say in the matter, that I'd accept either flavor of Knight being a better choices for main tank is with undead...it is afterall the specialty of both Paladins (holy knights with the blessing of their god) and anti-paladins, or shadowknights (fallen paladins that forsook their patron diety for power and were cursed by them to a necromantic half-life). Knights should take reduced damage and deal more damage against these foes, but should be markedly behind warriors against any other foe. This is the price for weilding magic because the game does not impose the normal penalties these classes would suffer for displeasing their patron diety.<br>
<br>
In other words, nice try, but within the bounds of this game, knights should never be a preferable choice for tank unless a warrior is unavailable and your other choice is a monk, rogue or ranger, or you are facing undead.<br>
