The worst, and best, part of this post is that it's really common sense information and tactics that every everquest player should understand without having it spelled out for them.  This isn't a very hard game but yet we often find ourselves bogged down with bad players who can't seem to grasp the simple mechanics of everquest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udumeshuhlbelk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dumesh UhlBelk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 1:02:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=589.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Main tank process - very very long</span><hr size=1> Well written.  This is a great description of the duties of the MA, main assist.  It would be beneficial for us to all agree on some common terminology.  As I said what you have described is the role of the main assist.  A main tank, MT, is the tank against a single large mob when the strategy is to concetrate all of that mobs melee dmg (non-rampage) on one character.  MT'ing is very different from MA'ing.<br>
<br>
Frankly in most situations a SK is the best MA.  They can tank any mob that doesn't require defensive just as well as we can and they can control aggro better than anyone.  Another tactic that I performed very often on PoG raids when I played my 52 SK was to select the next target and break all the mezzes.  I would hold aggro for about 6-10 seconds and then release it to our highest warrior who had time to build his aggro.  This way our shammies/chanters never got beat on.<br>
<br>
We are warriors, we take damage like no others.  MTing is far and away our strength.  In most cases though, MAing is best done by SKs.<br>

<br>
While I enjoy helpful input, I'll most likely ask for it. Though if the monk is getting the mobs to camp. PLEAS PLEASE don't try and tell them how to pull. I have raided with a MT that every other pull I got 'Uhh..do this. NO! go the other way! its faster'.....I got a TL out very quickly. <br>
<br>
Now..If the monk is having a hard time, the best way to go about it is be very nice.<br>

<br>
Greevous<br>
<br>
Warriors / MT <br>
--------------- <br>
First the MT, because that's easier to describe.<br>
<br>
The job of the Main Tank (MT)/Main Assist (MA) is as follow.<br>
<br>
1) Keep the mob's focus on him so that no one else gets hit.<br>
<br>
That's it. Nothing more. Warriors are not Damage Dealers,<br>
we are Meat shields. If you made a warrior to be the end all mob waxer, then you made a mistake, if you want that, make a rogue or a wizard.<br>
<br>
All of an MT's abilities should be focused to that goal.<br>
<br>
So the MT should have:<br>
1) The best haste he can get.<br>
2) The highest set of stacking Damage Shields that can be provided.<br>
3) The best weapons he can get (2 weapons are a must!)<br>
a) Best weapons are interpreted as follow.<br>
Speed &gt; Damage/delay unless Damage is very low.<br>
De-buff proc &gt; DD proc &gt; DoT proc &gt; no proc.<br>
4) The MT must Taunt, Beg, Disarm, kick or bash (large races only) and anything else he can to keep that mob's attention focused on him. <br>
5) The MT requires the best AC/HP buffs he can get. AC is important to minimize the damage he takes so that he is more efficient on mana for the clerics. HP is also about mana conservation.<br>
6) The MT should be as close to the Mob as he can get. Range has a factor is taunting/agro control, which means that everyone else needs to be behind the mob and as far back as possible while still being able to hit the mob.<br>
<br>
Now for the MT method.<br>
<br>
On your standard high end mob.<br>
1) The MT will tag the mob that the Monks bring him.<br>
2) In guild chat/raid channel, Announce INC mob, with warning not to attack. Eg. INCOMING &lt;&lt;&lt; %T &gt;&gt;&gt; ASSIST BUT DO NOT ATTACK.<br>
3) Get agro off of the monks.<br>
4) Hold Agro while Casters, Debuff, and Slow. (NOTE TO CASTERS: All Castings of Debuffs, and slows etc. must be announced in Guild Chat/Raid Channel/etc.).<br>
5) Re-establish Agro from casters if necessary. (Debuffs of any type will put the caster on top of the hate list instantly).<br>
6) Hold agro for 10 sec. (you will know you have agro because the mob will be pounding on you. if you are not taking damage, you do not have agro).<br>
7) In Guild Chat/Raid Channel call Tanks in. Eg. TANKS IN NOW.<br>
8) Activate Defensive.<br>
9) Keep agro for the remainder of the fight. Ok this requires more explanation.<br>
a) MT should be as close to the mob as he can get.<br>
b) All other damage dealers should be behind the mob.<br>
c) All other damage dealers should back away from the mob as far as they can while still being able to hit the mob.<br>
d) NO ONE but the MT should have high agro weapons. That means if you have a willsapper or a frostbringer, and you are not MT, you should replace that weapon with a non-procing weapon or a weapon with a lesser proc.<br>
e) IF you get agro and you are not MT, stop attacking IMMEDIATELY.<br>
10) The MT should make sure that he moves the mob where he wants it to be, which means keeping it away from walls so that the rogues can BS, etc.<br>
11) When the mob Enrages the MT needs to turn off Auto Attack BUT keep taunting, so that you retain agro.<br>
<br>
On a Mob that requires more than 1 MT.<br>
<br>
First if your second MT does not have the AA ability of Area taunt make this hotkey.<br>
<br>
/disc defensive<br>
/pause 1200,/gu TANK 2 IN NOW. STOP ATTACKING<br>
<br>
If your second MT does have the AA ability of Area taunt make this hotkey.<br>
<br>
/disc defensive<br>
/pause 1800,/gu TANK 2 IN NOW<br>
<br>
On your standard high end mob.<br>
1) The MT will tag the mob that the Monks bring him.<br>
2) In guild chat/raid channel, Announce INC mob, with warning not to attack. Eg. INCOMING &lt;&lt;&lt; %T &gt;&gt;&gt; ASSIST BUT DO NOT ATTACK.<br>
3) Get agro off of the monks.<br>
4) Hold Agro while Casters, Debuff, and Slow. (NOTE TO CASTERS: All Castings of Debuffs, and slows etc. must be announced in Guild Chat/Raid Channel/etc.).<br>
5) Re-establish Agro from casters if necessary. (Debuffs of any type will put the caster on top of the hate list instantly).<br>
6) Hold agro for 10 sec. (you will know you have agro because the mob will be pounding on you. if you are not taking damage, you do not have agro).<br>
7) In Guild Chat/Raid Channel call Tanks in. Eg. TANKS IN NOW.<br>
8) Activate Defensive.<br>
9) Keep agro for the remainder of the fight. Ok this requires more explanation.<br>
a) MT should be as close to the mob as he can get.<br>
b) All other damage dealers should be behind the mob.<br>
c) All other damage dealers should back away from the mob as far as they can while still being able to hit the mob.<br>
d) NO ONE but the MT should have high agro weapons. That means if you have a willsapper or a frostbringer, and you are not MT, you should replace that weapon with a non-procing weapon or a weapon with a lesser proc.<br>
e) IF you get agro and you are not MT, stop attacking IMMEDIATELY.<br>
10) The MT should make sure that he moves the mob where he wants it to be, which means keeping it away from walls so that the rogues can BS, etc.<br>
<br>
11) When &quot;TANK 2 IN NOW. STOP ATTACKING&quot; message appears, it means that you are ready to switch to the second MT. Since the second tank does not have the AA ability of Area taunt, you switch weapons to non-agro inducing ones, and stop taunting etc. but keep fighting. Also all other combatants should stop attacking until the Second MT has established Agro and call &quot;Tanks in&quot;. At this point you go around back and join the others while the new MT is in control.<br>
<br>
11a) When &quot;TANK 2 IN NOW.&quot; message appears, it means that you are ready to switch to the second MT and that MT has Area Taunt. Area taunt will put the new MT automatically on top of the Hate list and he will be able to immediately pick up where you left off. So you need to stop taunting etc., and switch to non-agro weapons. Then go around back to fight along side the others.<br>
<br>
12) IF the mob requires more than 2 MT’s then you repeat Step 11 as needed.<br>
<br>
13) When the mob Enrages you need to turn off Auto Attack BUT keep taunting, so that you retain agro.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now some important things:<br>
1) Begging and how to train it up.<br>
Begging, just like disarm is a taunt and therefore helps you keep a little agro.<br>
<br>
Make a Begging hot key to use in combat exclusively.<br>
/attack off<br>
/doability # where # is the Beg ability slot under abilities.<br>
/attack<br>
<br>
This hot key will let us beg in combat. Its also the best way to train begging up.<br>
<br>
On a similar note, if you make a hot key for taunt and sense heading you can train that up too.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Warrior in a group.<br>
<br>
Once again the Warrior in a non-raid group is the meat shield between the mob(s) and the other group members. It is your mission to keep the others from getting beat on. If that means dieing so that the<br>
others can get away, then you die. Remember a warrior cannot rezz and if the cleric goes down first then you delay things a lot before getting xp again, while if you die and the cleric etc get away, it will be an easier CR and you'll be back to bashing mobs to regain XP very soon.<br>
<br>
Once again things that applied to the Raid Warrior apply to the Group warrior.<br>
1) Taunt, beg, disarm, kick or slam.<br>
2) Everyone but you and the casters should be on the other side of the mob when you fight. The exception is if you have a rogue in your group, in which case only the rogue should be behind the mob. Why you might ask? well when someone attacks from behind a mob they hit more often because the mob cannot dodge or repost etc.<br>
3) Again use the best weapons available. This is important for other reasons in a group as compared to a raid. In a group you are a damage dealer too, and the more Damage Per Second you can deliver, the better the group does.<br>
<br>
Pulling:<br>
There are three ways you can pull if you are a warrior.<br>
1) Go out and bash the mob, this has the greatest chance for adds, both indoors and outdoors.<br>
2) Shoot the mob with an Arrow or a thrown weapon. This is a far better method to pull because there is a higher chance of getting single pulls and it gives you time to get back to the group before the mob starts hitting you (especially if you do not have SoW/ Run speed/ Jboots/ etc.)<br>
3) Get close to the mob you want to pull. As you slowly approach it, hit the sit/stand button constantly. This should pull a single mob. Not always but it does work.<br>
<br>
Warrior Chain Pulling (outdoors only &lt;at least I've never tried it indoors&gt;)<br>
<br>
ok to do warrior Chain pulling you do not need an enchanter or a bard. That's right no mezzers required.<br>
<br>
Your group needs 3 tanks of any type, a healer of some sort and a SoW'er but not strictly necessary. I've even had a group with 5 tanks which worked amazingly well together.<br>
<br>
Ok this is what you need to do:<br>
1) 1 tank is the puller, he goes out and tags a mob and brings it to the group.<br>
2) Everyone fights that mob until it has 1/4 of it hit points left.<br>
3) The Puller disengages and goes to get a new mob.<br>
4) If, when he gets back the old mob is still up, he needs to tank the new mob until the others are done with the old one.<br>
5) Repeat this a couple of time to get a feel for how well your group is doing, then if you feel confident that the group can handle it, start leaving earlier and earlier to get new mobs, but do it slowly to see how your group does.<br>
6) In the end the puller will probably just pull and drop off the mob for the other tanks. In extreme cases (This happened to me once in DL) the puller will need to Multi-chain pull to keep the rest of the group supplied with mobs.<br>
<br>
Note: if you have an enchanter or bard in the group it will make this easier, but they are not necessary for chain pulling.<br>
<br>
Well that's my guide to being a Warrior. If I think anything else up I'll edit and add it to the post.<br>
