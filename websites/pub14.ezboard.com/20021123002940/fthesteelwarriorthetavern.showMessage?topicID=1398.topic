I had to see what kinda comments were really being tossed around I'm surpriseed. I have a question for the warriors that are happy to see monks get nerfed. How did it hurt a warriors place in the game to have monks be on rampage list, or step up for a few seconds while the next Defensive warrior with 7khp gained agro cause the first one died? I dont understand the feeling of satisfaction. Monks are prolly the ones who got the mob to you in the first place so you could have a chance to get your piece of the pie. <br>
<br>
The people that play monks at the FOH/AL level of the game are the ones who should have been nerfed. Contrary to what some people might believe, monks are not all equipped with 1500ac and 4500hp unbuffed. Broadstroking the class into that category is stupid. <br>
<br>
My point is do some investigation on your own before you subscribe blindly to some parsing that the warrior god has blessed you all with. Use your own eyes. Ask how many monks on your server would be willing to tank Vindi/AOW any of the uber unslowable mobs and youll see exactly what kinda tanks we are. They will most likely laugh at you. Monks are not tanks and never will be. We dont have the discs or HP for it. Stepping up for a few seconds is one thing, tanking from beginning to end is a whole different ballgame. We dont play that game.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ushikariiapoccalypse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shikarii Apoccalypse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>All in the reflexes</BR>Guardian of the Bunker</BR>STEEL WARRIOR Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1967<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/11/02 7:16:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1398.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.wingkong.net/Images/minijak.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just one question</span><hr size=1> And the Capital of Nebraska is Lincoln.<br>

I dont think had anything to do with warriors asking for it. I have not seen a post of that nature from anyone really. I will admit though some posts from monks on this board that I read made one heck of a case for a good nerf. <br>
  Warriors asked to be fixed no more no less. We asked for better mitigation, dps and to fix taunt. I dont think our concerns have even been addressed to be honest. I guess the reason monks think warriors are behind the nerf is cause we asked to be looked at and in doing so VI noticed that monks are over powered and not working as intended. <br>
  I am surprised VI took this course of action and do not enjoy anyones nerf, but no monk can sit there with a straight face and say &quot; Oh wait we really wernt as good as we said we were..umm we were just kidding...you guys are better tanks...really you are&quot; <p><BR>

Yes, I was a little upset when the monks in my guild owned me in every way in exp groups. I didn't think it was balanced, not at all. But never did I call for monks to be nerfed.<br>

Do not stereotype all of us without knowing firsthand where everyone is coming from. Yes, I think the taunting from warriors at Monkly Business is puerile and asinine; don't assume every warrior thinks that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 881<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/12/02 7:16:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1398.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just one question</span><hr size=1> Who are worse, the warriors that laugh at people nerfed, or the monks that want to hurt people in real life over things that happen in a game? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uiskandaralazeem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iskandar Alazeem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of the Battlefield</BR>STEEL WARRIOR Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 875<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/12/02 7:19:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1398.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just one question</span><hr size=1> Either way, both are Very Bad Things.

1) Upgrade warriors (This is what people wanted. Make no mistake, NO ONE on the boards was calling for a nerf to monks)<br>
2) Nerf everyone else (in the spirit of completely tearing down and redoing game mechanics, this is the option VI opted for)<br>

Are warriors happy? Not in particular, we wanted better mitigation. However, we are finally content, to a certain extent that we have better mitigation than monks; something we were supposed to have all along. <p><center><p><font size = 3 colo = "blue"><b>Wilhelmm D'Averam<br>Warlord of the Apocalypse</b></font></p></center>

Which of course, the people at VI will translate as an excuse to just nerf whatever the heck they want to! DUH!<br>

Does this mean I am happy about the nerf? I don't even know what the nerf will do, and to be quite honest, I don't believe taking away the steak from a kid to make the starving kid happier is the way to fix world hunger. <br>
<br>
Should they nerf monks? Hard to say, I'd prefer to be fixed.<br>

The nerf might or might not affect us as warrior, it might do nothing as far as I know, bottom line, I will not rejoice at seeing anyone losing thing because I am lacking it. <p>Warlord of the brell server

Yeah, SOME of them were.  I don't think this was the best way to change monks though.  The problem wasn't necessarily monk mitigation, although it is more than a bit absurd that some fool in silk can mitigate a sword thrust as well as someone encased in metal.  The problem was the number of all/all 0.1 weight uber ac items.  That's where I think the adjustment needed to be made, some sort of weight penalties there.  The changes will probably have no appreciable effect on the uber monks but could really screw the non-ubers who don't have access to all the all/all gear.<br>
<br>
Outside of the small, vocal, brainless minority, I don't think warriors are all that thrilled about monks being nerfed.  If the monk community wants to view it that way, it's their business, but warriors don't write the game's code...<br>
