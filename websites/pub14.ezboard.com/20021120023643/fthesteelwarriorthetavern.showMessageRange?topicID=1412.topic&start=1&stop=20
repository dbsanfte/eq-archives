Guilds moving on.</span><hr size=1> People say that with more content in  PoP  other guilds will move on. Opening content for those of  us  who are about a year behind, but would like to kill them. They said that about Luclin too. I have only played EQ  for  a year and a half. SO of course i started behind.  How often does a guild really move on? In my experience, Never. How many uber guilds in VT out there would  hesitate to wack Yelinak or  Dain or  King T with  a seconds notice? Just to twink.<br>
<br>
The problem, as i see it, is with guilds 1-2, 3-4-5-6, 7-8-9, and  so on. (btw all 9 guilds in this example are  90 percent or  more all level 60's the top 6 being  all 60+aa)<br>
<br>
Like say guild 1-2  are in VT,  guilds 3-4-5-6 can easily kill Velious ubers and many Luclin  up to SSra. <br>
<br>
Guild 7-8-9 can just  do velious ubers/NToV/lower luclin named, but never get the chance becuase  all of the above guilds never move on.  They continue to kill  the new stuff and old too. Only they kill it faster.  On The Nameless even the Top guilds still wack King T or Dain or AoW,  if they are up. Along with the rest of the top 6 guilds on the serever that can kill easily.  Shoot Everything of  worth usually  dies  on patch day within hours. (Minutes of the mob spawning)<br>
<br>
This has forced many, that are not in the top, to become frustrated and leave EQ. Something i am considering. People say well join other guild_001 or guild_002, well that is not possible as their membership requirements are geared to people who have played for ever, or were Powerlelveled/Twinked by their friends in these guilds. <br>
<br>
This is just   the way I see things  at the High End  game  a place where you can not rise to any more. You have to  be in &quot;the club&quot; or  have  freinds in &quot;the club&quot; to invite you into &quot;the club&quot; to move on. You have to get all you can. Then join a guild already there or rarely  have the opertunity to advance any farther.<br>
<br>
I may be one of the  first people  to buy EQ2  simply to be there  for the long haul. <p><center>

Guilds moving on.</span><hr size=1> Well may be on other servers people move on,  but on the Nameless they are not moving on they are killing as much as they can, that others can also  kill. Then move on to their higher end things. <br>
<br>
For instance, a while back Legacy of Steel was selling rights to loot NToV loot. Most of their guild and Twinks had all they could use  so they offered to sell it. Then CoH you in for you to loot. They may have finally moved out of NToV  but still cleared  as much as they could right up until moving into VT.<br>
<br>
Maybe it is  just the Nameless, that has this problem but there is a guild on about 24/7 which can wipe  out NToV, AoW, and Tunare.  Either European-Remedy , or TW-Kylin Eyes or US-LoS, Euphoria, Crimson Tempest. <br>
<br>
Even when they do not need the items   or they use ony to twink characters or sell dropables.<br>
<br>
I know i may seem to be  whining a bit,  to many of you that have played awhile. But hey  this is just Norath as I  have seen it.   I mostly posting to  blow off frustration. After all I am  so addicted I play 7 days a week and love raiding. If i had started from the early days, or had  contacts in top guilds when i began playing.  i would probably be in the  High end game now.  <p><center>

Guilds moving on.</span><hr size=1> I can see where you are coming from Yaldatin. This is one of the reoccuring problems with EQ; the placement of certain key items on certain mobs, making them quite contested. let me explain:<br>
<br>
- Dain: <br>
Dain is, at least on our server, up quite oftenly. Now, Dain's loot table, from my perspective is complete and utter trash for the most part. The Hammer is a fun solo toy, but nothing beyond that. His loot it garbage for me, except one piece. The problem is, his head which drops 100% of the time, is used to make arguably the best warrior/melee belt in the game. Short of perhaps Girdle of Thorns for warriors (which is actually worse than dain's belt after casting the effect), Belt of Dwarf Slaying is the best belt in the game for melee classes and some casters as well. <br>
<br>
- Yelinak:<br>
Same case as above. HOwever, his head is also used to make 75hp/75 mana 41% haste gloves, good for both melee and caster classes once again. He also drops a talisman used to make an ST key. <br>
<br>
- Tormax:<br>
This I fear is the worst mob of them all. Tormax wields one of the best loot tables I've seen in the game, better than every other velious mob except AoW from my perspective; and even better than quite a few luclin mobs. <br>
a ) Boots of the Storm are the 3rd best plate melee boots in the game. <br>
b) His head is used to make 85hp/110 mana boots with FT-2. Very few casters I've met have better<br>
c) His crown is a 100hp item with saves to all and 35ac. The crown is also an all/all item with only 1.0 weight; a perfect item for many classes<br>
d) His head can also be used to make a 100hp all/all droppable helm.<br>
e) 75mana ring (I think 75hp on it as well)<br>
f) ST key. <br>
<br>
The loot table above shows why Tormax would be so popular<br>
<br>
- NToV:<br>
For the most part, the drops are not very good. However, Blackstar, Cloak of Thorns, Wyvern-hide greaves, are a couple of the very attractive items that drop in this zone. They are once again mixed in with some other poor drops.<br>
<br>
- AoW:<br>
His loot table is awesome (for me at least). True, some of the ubers have no more use for a BoC, or War bow of rallos or monk greaves. However, they have uses for the rare helm or rallos zek, and BELIEVE me, they all have use for the Ring of Destruction. <br>
<br>
<br>
The reason you are seeing this pattern going on is because certain amazing items have been placed on the loot table of easy, lower-tier mobs. The loot is heavily sought, and make these mobs attractive to higher-end guilds. The fact that more guilds go for them makes them all the more competitive. The guilds go for 1 or 2 items and sell the rest. after all, cash is somethng all uber guilds could use considering the necessity for lots of peridots and the like. <br>
<br>
It's not very fair; but this is unfortunately how these things work. <p><center><p><font size = 3 colo = "blue"><b>Wilhelmm D'Averam<br>Warlord of the Apocalypse</b></font></p></center>

One of the things mentioned about it that I like is the fact that there will be some content that spawns a separate area for any group that triggers it.  So you can have 40 groups all doing the same content without conflicting with each other.  I hope they do that with most of the quest stuff. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85547>Khumak</a><br>

The main issue, of course, is that even though they have been killing much of that content for a long, long time, there are still many members who could use the drops.<br>
<br>
I can't remember the last time anyone went to Thurg for the Dain.  Sure the belt is still great but it certainly is not a big enough draw to bring everyone over (and fewer people have the faction or desire to camp out in Kael waiting for KT for the turn-in).  KT is another matter, that is a pretty good loot pool still and a ST key never hurts.  AoW is another again, a fun fight and a great loot pool.  Yelli has those gloves and a key and would certainly die if found up.<br>
<br>
None of those are first targets for guilds that can kill stronger though.  On patch day the desire is to log on, figure out what Remedy didn't kill that is still up and go from there (while also finding out where LoS is).  In terms of priority it is definitely anything in Ssra first, perhaps Shei after that.  Burrower if there or even CT if nothing else is around.  First Brood Dragons are worth heading for also and ST would be a target on occasion also I am sure.  Seru isn't being contested much as far as I know, so he can wait.<br>
<br>
I see the way things are as more of a comment on the slowness of loot dropping.  With 50+ members showing up for raids, a guild needs to do a huge number of Mob X kills to outfit the members in the loot that he drops.  In some cases (Cursed, HP, AL etc) there are so many strong rare drops that no guild will be 'done' with them anytime soon.  PoP will change priorities of course but upper-tier guilds will still head back to earlier Mobs to some degree of course, for ST keys if nothing else. <p><center><b><font color=RED><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78504>Celeris Tujimson</a><br>Assassin of The Nameless<br>

It will have some bugs, but if they can figure it out, it will really enhance the level of fun.

Ill agree the namleless is bad, there is alot of competition here.  Id be willing to wager alot more than any other server.  I dont think there are many that have asian, euro, and usa guilds that raid daily.  That being said you need to pick your target and get there FAST as soon as you can.  Because it will be dead later on that night.<br>
<br>
For us our priorities are ssra and VT, if there is something up and no one on their way to it we will get it.  Same feeling for Legacy and KE id say.  <br>
<br>
Once pop comes out im sure there will be new things to explore so there should be more targets just as there is in SoV now.  Is just a matter of time =) <p><br><i><u><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=172247>Ghworg</a></b></u></i></br>

On Bertox we have 10+ guilds that are all competing for the same mobs, one guild that is a tad above the pack, one guild that is way ahead of everyone else, and one guild that is not far behind them.  The only guild I've seen move on mostly in the last few months is our very top guild.  Its funny when people ask me, what does your guild kill, my response is, anything that is up.  Heh, can't be picky because most things worthwhile are dead within hours, sometimes minutes, of popping.  I just don't worry about it and go back to xp grinding or go do something else if nothing is up.   <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127089">Dracillion of Qeynos</a>

I think whenthey raise the levels its gonna be hell on the samller guilds. Get a full group of level 65's and see how bad they own mobs on previous expansions. Maybe its just me but this expansion seems to be geared heavily towards the high end power gamers, i think you might see alot of casual players call it quits just for the simple fact that they are always playing catch up. I am gonna wait and see what happens when the expansion comes out but i think raising the level cap will eventually be everquests downfall. Maybe i have incorrect info but like i said i will have to wait and see. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukirle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kirle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/15/02 2:40:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1412.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Thats because PooP (tm) was geared for the higher lvls.

You see this process is nothing new, if anything it will be better for the smaller guilds because of the way the encounters are designed. <p>Kirle Koward

They need you to be 60,(only real exception might be cleric) have your class aa title, the keys to EVERY keyed zone but acryllia and vt and as many peices as you can possibly get for each of THOSE! Even then the most you should expect is maybe getting invited to raid with them on occaisions for awhile while they decide if you have the right skills and temperment to be a member which can sometimes take a couple months. No thank you for me. Ive been with my guild since it was raiding CRUSHBONE for gear and im still with it now that we have started trying Vindi. The way I see it, its taken me about the same amount of time THIS way as it has if I had tried to join an uber guild lol.<br>
<br>
The one advantage I see with pop is the sheer number of new high end encounters. With so many new mobs to fight they wont be ABLE to monopolize all the good stuff with just one guild. There will just be too may uber mobs to kill to bother with Velious or even most of Luclin. At least, thats what I HOPE will happen.<br>

&quot;GOD I hope there will just be too many mobs to allow just one guild or even two to hold everything hostage. We had a situation on my server where the uber guild threatened to kill EVERYTHING from vox to AOW, (pre Luclin lol) just to prove they COULD.&quot;<br>

The problem in EQ is that for anything that spawns longer than a couple hours, you have to compete for it; And the more you 'win' that content, it makes it easier for you to 'win' it next time.<br>
<br>
What really needs to be done for all 'long spawn' content - is to give every guild the ability to spawn their own version once per week.  Yes, in the long run that might mean you have 5-10 front running guilds, but that really doesn't matter since they're no longer competing for content.<br>
<br>
PoP is supposed to have virtual spaces that hopefully address this, but they've only mentioned them slightly offhanded a couple times.  We'll see in a week or so if they implement them correctly or not.  (Of course if you don't fully apply virtual spaces to all content, you only make the competition for those non-virtual'd things even worse) <p>---<BR>

That a lot cheaper than hiring dozens of GMs just to handle petitions from contested spawns. <p>Zaboo Krusher<BR>

We aren't &quot;uber&quot;, but we managed to take out Zlandicar, Yelinak and Severilous all in 1 day. Heck, we've done even more than that after a patch day before.<br>
<br>
How? We have people ready to move, we have porters who don't whine and scream about having to pick up people from random places. They know their job for setting up a raid. For first broods? CoH is your friend! Non-kos mages speed things along. By the time people are arriving you should have your CoH group set up or the mage on the way to room. <br>
<br>
Is this wrong? I don't think so. It's not really our fault if a guild takes an hour to get to a place and we take 15 min. If you are really desperate for a mob that spawns after patch, set it up before hand for everyone to camp there and be ready to log in right after patch.<br>
<br>
Going to knock over Vindi after Severilous for the heck of it.. monk in SS, suddenly we're told Yelinak is up, but 3 other guilds had atleast 1 member in zone. We showed up with 30 within 10 min and they left.<br>
<br>
Sad as it is.. most problems for mid-level guilds getting mobs is they aren't fast.  Talk to your wizards and druids, explain to them they are a key part of getting the force there. Most times, it IS their fault (waits for screaming porter to flame in forum) because they don't speak up and say &quot;who needs to be picked up and from where?&quot;. Unless you have everyone willing to drop what they are doing for a big mob at a moment's notice, you are never going to get those mobs. They don't sit up and tell other guilds &quot;We're waiting for guild_01 to come kill us, please go away!&quot;.<br>
