The deal is we are talking class issues it doesn't matter if we are talking about a Ssra equipped pally and a Kael equipped warrior. So yes there is going to be generalizations, you are so worried about pally / war 1hs bottom line in general pally 1hs are better as well they should be your a shield carrying class so it makes sense.<br>
<br>
Pallys signed up to be the knights in shining armor, SK the black knight of evil. Compare those two classes is fair but to compare those classes with a warrior you must use a generalization because they ain't even supposed to be close. Knights are supposed to be 75% war 25% cleric/necro, we all know that it doesn't add up that way. Knights are so close to warriors now days they should almost reduce your mana pool. No warrior is asking for there to be a nerf of knights that I have seen but with the paranoia from some of the knights you would think that the case. All we want is to be made whole again and don't tell us our whole defining ability is a discipline.<br>
<br>
Madrone I really don't mind knights or any class coming to our boards, personally think its great. Some of the &quot;go back to your own board&quot; thing came from one of your brother Pallys. He came here and made a post telling us what he would accept like we are supposed to care, but it set a tone that has carried thru a lot of these threads. <p><BR>

I think they should be 100% PAL/SK, and this is where VI partially failed.<br>
Now they seem (in my warrior's point of vue) to reconsider these classes by giving them new *unique* spells/abilities for knights.<br>
Honestly, this is fine to me and to many others warriors. Like stated *many times* before in this very thread, we're *happy* to what happen to you, guys. Really.<br>
<br>
Hell, we will even be *happy* of seeing you tanking *IF*, and only *IF*, we, on the other hand, had something &quot;special&quot;, a warrior's thing, that would balance this fact.<br>
Actually, our only role is tanking. Seeing monks or knights do this with around the same success, *WITH* a much better aggro control, that my friends is bothering us.<br>
<br>
Moreover, our only eye-candy thingie, critical hits, has been removed to us. <br>
Giving this to wizards I agree, they are the specialized mana warriors, as we are the specialized melee warriors. Giving this to everyone else was a mistake.<br>
This was not even very useful, but this at least was our only class-specific thing (no, don't speak me about defensive, I would give it for free if I could).<br>
<br>
I think we should stop arguing over and over about PAL/WAR comparisons, and let's trying together to find a good solution, *AND* to submit it to VI (if they are willing to understand us, and I doubt it seeing Absor's posts).<br>
Stop coming here just to say we, warriors, should be happy with what we have, this is not true.<br>
<br>
To summarize, actual problems are :<br>
- We're no longer masters of tanking, considering the fact that aggro-control (and, to a larger extent, raid DPS) is to be considered at. <br>
This is due to : <br>
* almost-infinite mana for casters, especially clerics (KEI, ManaRod2, Bards, FT, ...). <br>
* AC-Softcap that almost every melee can reach with little efforts (cultural trade skills, no more WAR&gt;PAL/SK&gt;All AC-Gear graduation, and so on)<br>
* AAXP, for those able to reach the third page (we, warriors, have no AA to help in our job, apart from AE Taunt).<br>
* the amount of 100HP ALL/ALL items, reducing even further the HP gap between warriors and others class.<br>
<br>
- Other problem is our DPS, that no longer is way ahead from knights. Seeing monks, rangers and rogue do a lot more than us isn't a problem, and I feel even happy for rangers that AT LAST get something to do with their bows.<br>
Knights and Warriors might be equals in OVERALL DPS, by this I mean Melee + Spells, but there should be a noticeable gap between melee-only DPS. So, Knights should do 80% Warrior's DPS + 20% by spells to fill the gap.<br>
There is something to do here, and I see these possible improvements :<br>
* Increase Warriors DPS by, say, giving a bonus for offhand weapon. I don't know if this shock only me, but dual wield should do overall better damage than 2Handers, this makes sense ! This will profit to all dual-wielding classes.<br>
* In the same time, give something to PAL/SK to do the DPS they miss by spells. In cleric's manner for PAL, in a necromancer's manner for SK (maybe for these two add a lure-dot, to help them landing something on boss mobs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
* This idea is not mine but it is so far the best I saw here : increase mitigation for plate class, respecting the : WAR&gt;PAL/SK&gt;All in mitigation. With this improvement, knights would be better at tanking BUT warriors will be even better, the gap is preserved, and *NOT* with this crap shield idea.<br>
* Look at not no-drop items +100HP All/All, and make them class specific, or change them. Not no drop, because changing no-drop item would be not fair at all.  <p><img src="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/mcduck/images/signature.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugazzaztsmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GazzazTSMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/29/02 5:25:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=325>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hybrid Niche?</span><hr size=1> Gamdwin,<br>

You couldn't have proven my point more completely, with your Kunark-Era comment.  Velious was the Great Equalizer.  The Great Whine Silencer.  VI made an error here, they should have stuck with their Vision.  This game is dynamic across the board.  YOu cannot tweak one class without it affecting another.  Warriors have been indirectly nerfed by the upgrades to the Hybrid Melee.  So far the only folks told to 'live with your choice or make a different class character' have been Warriors.  You can't empathize, cause you aren't in the same boat as us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/29/02 6:22:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=326>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   In summary?</span><hr size=1> I want to see if I can summarize everything I've learned here.<br>
<br>
-Warriors taunt is screwy from 50-60, in that anything that cons higher level cannot be taunted.  I agree that this should definitely be fixed.  In fact, even mobs higher than level 60 should be tauntable.  Maybe Verant should code specific mobs that aren't tauntable, though.  After all, you have to figure some critters out there are smart enough to ignore the warrior poking it with a couple puny weapons, and focus on the wizard blasting it with magical fireballs instead.  Taunt should work on most creatures, regardless of level.<br>
<br>
-Knights with lots of AAXP (and Monks, to a lesser(?) extent), with (very) high end gear are able to encroach on the warrior main tank nicheas regards both hp and AC.  I can certainly understand why this would be an issue for warriors (especially the monks!), although I think I understand that it only happens at the very highest levels of the game.  This might not need a fix if it only affects the top .1% of the game, but it should be examined closely.  Broken is broken, after all.  Lots of good ideas here on how to fix it, so I won't delve any deeper into that.<br>
<br>
-Warriors can't fill any other role on a raid/in an xp group other than tank effectively, because their damage output rates about the same as or a bit better than a knight class similarly equipped (and they don't have the spells or abilities the Knights or Monks have).  I would suggest requesting that your offensive disciplines be improved DRAMATICALLY.  I won't make up numbers, because I don't know exactly how much more DPS output you need, nor do I know how much DPS each offensive discipline adds.  I'm just suggesting this as one way to make warriors a viable DPS class if they aren't needed to be MT.<br>
<br>
Have I identified all the major issues?  I agree that the shield changes don't look like they will really be all that stellar for Warriors, although I can imagine a few tweaks that Verant might make that could really change that.  If I've left something out, it was done honestly, I didn't intentionally fail to list anything.<br>
<br>

<br>
PS:  I think Verant has moved beyond the &quot;there are only 3 major roles in the game&quot; concept that was prevalent in Kunark, when the Holy Trinity ruled.  My honest impression is that now, Verant legitimately wants all classes to have a role in raids and other end-game activities.  Thus their differentiation of the various Hybrid classes and the introduction of the nicer class-specific spells and AAXP skills such as Archery mastery, Healing Wave of Prexus, and the Vah Shir Warcry songs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 303<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/29/02 6:43:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=327>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: In summary?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This might not need a fix if it only affects the top .1% of the game, but it should be examined closely.

<br>
I would debate that it only affects the top .1% of the game.  It may only truly be noticeable to the top .1% but it really starts in Velious.  And what is .1% of the players today, will be 10% a few months from now and 50% within a year. <br>

<br>
And well they should.  However, wanting all classes to have a role in raids and other end-game activities shouldn't be at the expense of a role for others.  Each class should have unique things to add, not just slightly watered down versions of what another class already adds.  By making several melee 'Warrior like' you reduce the value of Warriors.  Just as if you made several melee 'Rogue like' and increased their DPS to 95% of a Rogue's.  Suddenly what a Rogue brings to the party wouldn't be as desirable and people might start doing away with Rogues altogether.<br>
<br>
Give each class a clearly defined unique role which allows them to contribute without removing the need for another class in the process, or reducing that need to only once in a great while on very select mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uelmoricq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elmoricq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.multimania.com/mcduck/images/eq/ninja.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/29/02 6:47:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=328>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.multimania.com/mcduck/eq/elmo_title.jpg width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: In summary?</span><hr size=1> IMHO, you're right on most of the points you stated, but :<br>

<br>
I agree with the conclusion, though I disagree with the &quot;percentage&quot; of knights able to fit the role you describe.<br>
<br>
Because there are 2 main problems :<br>
- AC Softcap + no-more AC gear scaled on WAR &gt; PAL/SK &gt; All. <br>
This leads to a lot of melee able to reach this cap.<br>
For instance, I have 1200 AC unbuff, with most of Thurgadin Armor, and a bit of Skyshrine. With the same equipment, a paladin in my guild has 1256 AC, including shield (I can't remember exactly how much without, but you get the idea it should be around 1200 either), with the same level of equipment + Trade-skills (he's a mith marr smither).<br>
As you can see, we're both not-über at all, but cleric-buffed we already exceed the softcap.<br>
<br>
So, the only thing he need to be better than me is more HPs.<br>
<br>
- That leads to the second problem, that CryzB identified in this very well-done post : <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessage?topicID=1153.topic">pub14.ezboard.com/ftheste...1153.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

Hopefully between these threads and our discussions at PON, paladins will be able to come up with something we can suggest that won't infringe on the role of warriors, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
Also, regarding the highest end stuff trickling down, I'm sure that's true to a degree.  However, based on my experience, a lot of people are still TRYING to get into TOV, so end-game issues don't affect 99.9% of the people I know.  I don't know if I know a representative cross-section of the EQ population or not, but I doubt very heartily that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I'll</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ever see a monk main- or even Rampage-tanking.  So, while I agree that it's an issue that should be looked at, I think it should be balanced at that end of the game, possibly with items, rather than balanced by changing the classes across the entire spectrum of levels (where most classes aren't broken or even out-of-whack at the moment).<br>

Mine was about the not-so-end game : I am in a guild of people who work everyday, so we log only each evening, and eventually during the week-end (not all of our guildmates, though). We're all 57+, but less than 30 players... err... friends, wanting to do crazy things with this number <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, as you can see, we're also a sort of casual players, and I, from this point of vue, still begins to see the problem happen (AA is only an option for us, not a necessity like in most of truly high-end guilds).<br>
<br>
So, I just want to increase your percentage or, better, don't want to minimize too much the problem <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
