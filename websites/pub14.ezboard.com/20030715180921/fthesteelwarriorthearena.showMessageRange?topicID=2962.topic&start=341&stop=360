How they do this without screwing up current encounters I have no idea, but it should have been obvious that warriors should tank better from the beginning. Somehow that fact was missed by the development team at the time, and as sucky as it is, is not something simple to repair.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If I understand you correctly you basically concede in the above that Warriors don't have noticeably better mitigation, without using a discipline.  And that to make that happen would impact encounters pretty much game wide.  Going back and fixing it probably isn't an option, would you agree?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As for those that believe warriors should get improved agro, I simply cannot agree. No class should get the best of both worlds. Make holding a MOBs attention equal some amount of work is fine and in my mind welcome, but the reward for that needs to be a superior ability to deal with that attention. I am in the group of people that could care less if knights can grab agro at will, just need to make sure warriors bring something to the table to make them a viable choice in tanks.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yet here, if I understand you, you're saying that giving Warriors improved aggro would be the best of both worlds.  You already pointed out that without a discipline a Warrior's mitigation isn't noticeably better than a Knights.  Yet a Knight's aggro control is noticeably better than a Warrior's.  How would narrowing the gap between Knight and Warrior aggro control be the best of both worlds when the mitigation difference, as you've already indicated and I agree, isn't noticeably different between the two?<br>
<br>
I would argue that currently the Knights have the best of both worlds.  They have mitigation which is not noticeably worse than a Warrior's and aggro control which puts a Warrior to shame.  If this would be broken on a Warrior, it is as equally broken on a Knight.  Either Warrior mitigation needs a boost, unlikely to happen, Warrior aggro control needs a boost, which is possible, or Knight mitigation needs to be dropped, unlikely to happen, or Knight aggro control needs to drop, also unlikely to happen.  There really is only one course of action which, to me, appears viable.<br>

My opinion is warriors need to tank better than everyone else.<br>
<br>
How they do that I am not really sure. I have no way of testing any ideas I can think of, nor the time to sit and brainstorm an idea =p<br>
<br>
I still do not see how adding great agro to warriors is a fix. Knights will still be the better XP group choice. Warriors need to bring superior tanking skills to the table, or they will lose to knights, regardless of how much agro they can produce, because if tanking is almost equal, agro is almost equal.. the knight still brings a plethora of additional abilities.<br>
<br>
What I was really trying to say is that this whole issue is not as simple as adding 10% (some arbitrary number I just made up) mitigation to warriors. There will be repercusions throughtout the game by making that change, and I think many warriors do not really appreciate the impact it may have. Sometimes we get caught up in class balance, without even thinking about game balance.<br>
<br>
Point is, in my opinion the best route is to revamp warriors defensive abilities, while trying not to instantly trivialize numerous encounters. It wont be easy, and it wont be fast, but they get paid to do it not me.<br>

And I'm not sure what you're supposed to illustrate with the 70% thing.  I have a good chance of taking aggro from a Paladn chain stunning a mob and not attacking until it's 10% using the taunt button alone.  Unless your group has some warped preception that they do more damage chain casting Strike of Solusek aggro hardly matters after the first 10% of mob's health <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brikbludgaard>Brik Bludgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/15/03 11:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   grass is greener fun</span><hr size=1> <br>
Almost the whole thread is a bunch of bazaar equipped &lt;65 warriors wondering why they arent as desireable in a group as a 65 Knight with 100+ AAXP and NO DROP PoP gear.<br>
<br>
Most of the warriors are claiming what they have &quot;seen&quot; a knight do and haven't posted a single parse or set of numbers to prove their point...  not one of them has addressed the fact that I have &quot;seen&quot; a warrior hold aggro with 200+ AAXP damage dealing classes in the group...<br>
<br>
Warriors DO make better tanks...  they mitigate better through avoidance (skill caps) as well as 1000hp... thats 10% more HP for the math-impaired.  The avoidance is NOT that much better without disc in the long run, that much is true.<br>
<br>
When the avoid benefits start showing themselves is when you have less than 20% health left and that mob misses at the right time...  dying = downtime... ESPECIALLY for a knight.<br>
<br>
Warriors real issue here is aggro... and most importantly aggro when they aren't wielding EB items...  warrior mitigation is actually quite good.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warriors who say they are only there to &quot;take&quot; damage are full of it...  you are there to kill things and gain XP.  Faster dead things = better...  faster ded things with no cost to the party = wonderful.  Warriors with a Blade of War are monstrously wonderful tanks AND damage dealers.<br>
<br>
That ONE drop closes the aggro gap quite nicely...<br>
<br>
It takes me 5-6 100+ Hp items over what the warrior has to TOUCH their HP...<br>
<br>
P.S.  I choose not to use the &quot;quote&quot; feature for a reason...  not everyone here is using windblows for their primary browser...  and I tend to hate EZ-codes with a passion.<br>

<br>
That's a bunch of bullshit and you know it.  There's a significant number of warriors that are level 65 with a decent number of AA and an EB weapon or two that still see the problem.  There are also similar threads on every other class board stating how knights are the preferred tank in xp groups because of aggro.  The only boards that dispute that claim are the paladin board and the SK board.  And even then the general consensus on the Paladin board is that there is in fact a problem, there just isn't widespread agreement about the solution.<br>
<br>
&quot;Warriors real issue here is aggro... and most importantly aggro when they aren't wielding EB items... warrior mitigation is actually quite good.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's an issue even with EB.  EB improves the situation greatly but I can tell you from experience that 1 EB weapon (shy of the Blade of War anyway) does not eliminate the problem.  Yes warrior mitigation is quite good, and paladin/sk is identical.  Avoidance is almost identical as well.  Despite this, paladins/SKs have a HUGE aggro advantage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Warriors with a Blade of War are monstrously wonderful tanks AND damage dealers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Probably true.  Paladins buy there aggro tools from vendors for 10pp or so each.  When I can buy the equivalent from a vendor I'll shut up.  I seriously doubt you'll find more than 30 warriors on any server with a Blade of War right now. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=472195">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
<br>
This wording is very shaky.  While dealing damage plays a role to a tank class, the primary function of a warrior, hands down, as well as a SK/PLD, is to ABSORB damage, NOT DEAL damage.  You want a damage dealer and you picked a warrior, you picked the wrong class.<br>

<br>
Is aggro generation supposed to be hard or is it supposed to be easy?  If you're a Warrior, it's supposed to be hard.  If you're a Knight, it's supposed to be easy.  Why would it be different between the two?  The Warriors have defensive?  Naw, not much use in an experience group.  The Warriors have better mitigation?  Hardly universally true and extremely open to debate.  Warriors have more HP?  Usually true, but in PoP of much less value than previously.  The Warriors do more damage?  Only when compared to a Paladin, and otherwise pretty laughable compared to other classes that specialize in damage.<br>
<br>
All other things being as equal as they are, and I think everyone knows that they're much closer to being completely equal between the Knights and the Warriors than ever before, the difference in aggro generation is the one huge glaring difference.<br>
<br>
Whether you think Warrior aggro generation is too little or Knight aggro generation is too much, if you're a rational human being, you have to admit that the difference between the two is too dramatic given the much smaller differences between the them in other ways.<br>
<br>
If you can't see that, either you're intentionally clouding the subject, because it is to your benefit to do so, or you struggle with some pretty basic logical concepts. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

Please.  If I counted up the number of people who play Knights who expressed their contempt for me, either personally or just because of my point of view, the list would be far longer than this thread.  If I didn't care whether or not they respected my perceptions, why do you think you would be any different?<br>
<br>
If you don't play a Warrior, you can't really begin to understand much of what I speak of.  You may kid yourself that you do, but you don't.  Even if you play a high end Warrior with the best gear the game offers, you'll have a hard time understanding.  It just doesn't impact you quite as much and it's probably easier to ignore it or pretend it doesn't exist.  But if you go to the Cleric/Druid/Shaman/Enchanter boards, you'll see they understand it.<br>
<br>
Now, please take your disrespect for my perspective and go away.  Thanks for your input.  You've not really added anything that hasn't been said a dozen different ways by twice as many people before you.  No new insight.  No new arguements.  And if they all failed to 'prove' to us what we know to be untrue, you have little or no hope of it.   <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

Starting with ad hominem (attack the debators rather than their points) is a great way to bust out the truth stick.... <br>
<br>
Now, let me ask you, which 65 warrior with 100+ AAXP can easily outaggro a 64 knight?   Is there a single one?  Nope?  Then what's the relevance?   A naked 55 SK or Paladin can outaggro a 65 warrior with 100+ AAXP and NO DROP PoP gear.  Why should you EVER be able to outtank an equally levelled and AA'd warrior based on gear, if the inverse is not true, that an equally levelled and AA'd warrior can outaggro you based on gear?   <br>
<br>
The obvious answer is... the one you won't say is... <br>
<br>
&quot;Because it's not balanced, because I have an advantage that I won't admit to or be willing to give up&quot;<br>

<br>
You keep spouting this BS line without EVER dealing with the fact that there's an &quot;aggro cap&quot; with warriors, the fact that your aggro generation increases other party members' DPS to a MUCH larger extent than the difference between warrior and knight.   Then add to that in the SK's case, his Melee damage is augmented with his spells and group DPS *exceeds* the warrior contribution.    <br>
<br>

<br>
That's BS... while it's a great weapon, enraging blow does NOT do what warriors are complaining about, which is establishing aggro.   Holding a blade of war in your hands doesn't make mobs automatically hate you, you STILL have to contribute melee damage and taunt STILL has to work, and you STILL have to proc.   <br>
<br>
So, to sum up your arguments, and the counters to them:<br>
<br>
1. Warriors are better tanks than Knights from a mitigation perspective<br>
<br>
Counter:  Not by enough to justify the aggro discrepancy<br>
<br>
2. Warriors do more DPS so gimped aggro is acceptable<br>
<br>
Counter:  Knights enable a group, through reliable aggro generation to acheive higher DPS than the difference between the warrior and the Knight, so argument = false.<br>
<br>
3. Blade of war is cool so don't bitch<br>
<br>
Counter:  it is cool, but even the premier weapon for a warrior.. the BEST sword found to date for a warrior won't do what we're complaining about, which is to lower the aggro GENERATION gap at the onsets of fights to be more in line with the mitigation difference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varaho1>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 1501<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/03 3:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: haha</span><hr size=1> BoW is knight and ranger usable IIRC. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dwelfnvhal>DwelfnVhal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/03 11:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: haha</span><hr size=1> Hahahaaa, love it ! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Much of this thread IS grass is greener and absolute lack of knowledge about knights...  as is most of the other boards...  the &quot;I saw&quot; phenomenon is becoming rediculous... mostly because people who have never played a knight past 50 are claiming they know more about knights than a player who has played a knight for 4 years...<br>
<br>
let me clarify for the sensitive types...<br>
<br>
Anyone who claims &quot;I cant get a group, all the Knights are getting them&quot; is using unfair comparisons.  If you are &lt;64 and wonder why a 65 knight is getting the groups when you are not, then you really have no right to say anything.  If everything was PERFECTLY balanced, a level 64 warrior should be inferior to a 65 Knight for XP groups in nearly every case.<br>
<br>
Anyone who claims that &quot;knights get all the XP groups, and knights are prefered in all cases&quot; is making a generalization that I see countered nearly every evening.  Warriors and Knights are interchangeable as tanks in common XP zones.<br>
In elemental planes, warriors are preferred tanks for their less likelyhood of death, and lower recovery time upon death.<br>
<br>
If you are one of those two groups, then I have absolutely no pity for your feelings being hurt by my previous statements.  You are just plain wrong, I have both exmaples and much experience that say otherwise.<br>
<br>
Warriors with a Blade of War pretty much close the gap between Knights and Warriors for standard hatred generation.  This is easily reproduceable.<br>
<br>
A warrior replaced me in a Fire Castle group the other day...  the party didn't seem to slow down at all.  The number of kills/time was around the same in my parse as before as well.  (He replaced a paladin, and I switched to damage dealing -well trying hehe)  Note, to be fair, we were clearing the castle... and continued to at about the same rate...<br>
<br>
Was I better at hate generation?  Yes, but not noticeably...  similar to the mitigation difference between knights and Warriors.<br>
<br>
That one drop (BoW) closed the gap for hate generation for that warrior quite nicely.<br>
<br>
Show me where I can purchase 1000HP worth (over that of the standard warrior) of equipment for 18PP please.<br>
<br>
The warrior spent 75DKP on his Blade of War.  5-6 100HP items will cost me a great deal more than 75DKP.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, Knights and rangers can use the BoW, but the weapon benefits a Warrior more than any other class.  Rangers view the proc as a curse...  Knights will gain in hate generation efficiency, but not gain anywhere near as much as warriors, as their spells do that...  and indeed the knights do not gain as much from the weapon's damage as the warriors do either.<br>
<br>
Unofficially, the Blade of War might as well be WAR only until your guild has equipped <br>
<br>
every warrior with one. (even in a DKP system, I don't know many Knights or Rangers who would bid over a warrior for a Blade of War)<br>
<br>
<br>
Warriors get my level of ranged hate generation when I get warrior-level /defensive thank you.<br>
<br>
This is one area that we both know will remain the domain of knights.  I wouldnt mind warriors being better at archery, (and thus mundane hate generation) but you have to leave the knights SOME overall advantage or they become as they were in Kunark.<br>
<br>
Upon thinking about it, I actually don't mind the idea of an arrow that does +hate.  Just <br>
<br>
make it have its limits, and cost plat. (similar to rogues and poison)<br>
<br>
<br>
The &quot;problem&quot; is warriors without EB weapons.. and warriors dependance on EB.  This is unbalanced.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I use terror all the time... and actually said that earlier.<br>
Darkness causes major hate when the spell is not resisted...(immune seems to count as resisted)  <br>
I know that resisted Darkness spells cause very little hate in comparison to Terror of Thule. (+610 hate)<br>
Terror at melee range causes much more hate than a resisted dark.  (terror is actually currently bugged, seemingly only causing its full +hate at melee range)<br>
Spells SHOULD cause hate...  when they don't you don't have a clue how broken you will make <br>
Damage casters...<br>
<br>
No one can argue that needing EB items blows goats, but the sheer amount of misinformation about knights and about agro and group placement bugs me to no end.<br>
<br>
In the end, someone will claim I am only saying such things to keep myself at &quot;x&quot; power <br>
level...  that same person is in danger of being accused of wanting to return knights to their &quot;not worth the lag they cause&quot; role.  The wash will not solve anything.<br>
<br>
I encourage active discussion about &quot;solutions&quot; and why they would help.  Be reasonable... you might be surprised what we find.<br>
<br>
Brik<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
Agreed, itemization in PoP is very bad...  for nearly every class.<br>
Variety and uniqueness have given way to &quot;everyone of X class will be using Y item or be considerably less that optimal&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glatius2>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 926<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/03 11:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Much of this thread IS grass is greener and absolute lack of knowledge about knights... as is most of the other boards... the &quot;I saw&quot; phenomenon is becoming rediculous... mostly because people who have never played a knight past 50 are claiming they know more about knights than a player who has played a knight for 4 years...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Yet you know more about Warriors than those of us who have been playing them for years, because you've leveled to 65 and seen more high end content.  I'm sorry, but how exactly does that suddenly give you divine insight into a character class you don't play?  Yet those of us who have not leveled to 65 and seen all this high end content, but have still played our toon day in and day out in exactly the areas we're talking about there being a problem know nothing about the Knights?<br>
<br>
Does SOE transmit instant character knowledge superior to all others over the net once you zone into the plane of fire or something?<br>
<br>
We don't know crap about Knights?  Then you don't know crap about Warriors.  Oh, you claim to have knowledge about Warriors?  Great, we can just as validly claim to have knowledge about Knights.  <br>

Now, I didn't bother reading the rest of your egotistical, self-aggrandizing, self serving ramblings because I've recognized that's basically all they are.  You're uber.  You've gained level 65.  You've got lots of AAXP.  You've seen lots of PoP content.  Therefore you're smarter, more knowledgeable, and are better informed about a class you don't even play than those players who do play it in the very places they claim to have a problem.  Gotcha.
