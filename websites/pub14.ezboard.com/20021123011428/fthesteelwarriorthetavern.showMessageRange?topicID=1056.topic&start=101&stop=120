<br>
Your class xp penalty is gone so that's no longer an issue.  As many others have stated before (including Graal, a paladin) AC/HP gap has narrowed to the point it's no longer an issue.<br>
<br>
Defensive you say?  We get to use it 3 times a fight for a total of 9min in a 30min fight (lots of end game fights last at least this long).  That's if we even bother.  Plenty of fights where our so called class defining disc isn't even used because CH rot with mod rod 2 can keep up the heals, np<br>
<br>
If the shield change goes live, warriors are completely marginalized.  That sound like balance to you?<br>

Say you are in a seb group and need a healer. Pure healing, other skills are covered. Do you pick the 60 cleric, the 60 shaman, or the 60 druid? Remember, this is just to fill pure healing. Cleric right? Does that make shaman and druids worthless healers? No it is how the classes are meant to be balanced, clerics make better healers as it should be.<br>
Now say you want a nuker. Again all other class roles are filled, all you want is a pure nuking damage dealer. Do you pick the 60 wizard, the 60 druid, or the 60 mage? Right, you pick the wizard, because a wizard is the best nuker in the game, as it is meant to be. Does that mean a mage isnt a good nuker? No, it just mean that there is a class that is supposed to be better at it.<br>
Now for tank, Your group needs someone to hold agro and absorb the hits, who do you choose? 60 warrior, 60 paladin, or 60 monk? Chances are pretty good you will take the pally. That is NOT what was intended from the very beggining. Warriors are supposed to be the best tanks period, end of discussion. But wait, with aa skills, all/all gear, and huge agro generating spells now in the game, warriors are no longer considered to be the best tanks. Does making warriors into better tanks than paladins make pallys BAD tanks? No, paladins can tank very well, its just that warriors should be better. There is no excuse for paladins and sks to be as good as warriors when it comes to tanking.You are supposed to be warrior HYBRIDS. NOT as good at tanking as a warrior and not as good at healing as a cleric and not as good at dotting as a necro. Your abilities COMBINED make you a decent all around class because of the healing and dotting that makes up for the deficit that is SUPPOSED to exist with your tanking ability. That deficit effectivly, no longer exists.<br>
In closing I have to say AGAIN that warriors are suppose to be the best tank pure and simple. Paladins and sks are doing just fine right now and now its time for the WARRIORS to finally get a much needed upgrade.<br>

And, Thoric, the issue is that you and I disagree regarding the degree to which the paladin class spells and abilities should penalize us in our tanking ability.  That's okay.

<br>
Hi all; <br>
<br>
Take a minute and analyze a &quot;normal&quot; melee centric boss mob fight, from a melee point of view, with everybody doing as much damage as they can w/o taking aggro from the MT. <br>
<br>
Relevant characteristics: <br>
Main tank: stands in front of mob, as close as possible, maintains aggro via taunt, procs/effects, and proximity. Does very low melee damage due to mob's avoidance skills (dodge parry block riposte), but can do substantial damage if well damage sheilded. Primary characteristic is high hp, high taunt weapons, ability to control mob direction. Optional secondary characteristic: immunity to frontal stun from melee. <br>
<br>
Rogues: stand directly behind mob at max melee range, mash backstab key and evade. DPS output limited only by quality of weapons, haste, ATK, and short interruptions due to evade. <br>
<br>
Monks: stand directly behind mob at max melee range, mash special attack key, FD periodically to clear all aggro. DPS output limited only by quality of weapons, haste, ATK, and short interruptions due to FD. <br>
<br>
All Other Melee (rangers = archery, not melee for this exercise): stand directly behind mob at max melee range. Primary DPS output limiter is the need to avoid stealing aggro from MT, so use of sub-optimal weapons and/or cycling attack on and off is necessary. <br>
<br>
So what does this suggest? <br>
-increasing a warrior MTs DPS and/or net taunt ability would allow less frequent evades/FDs by monks/rogues and less cycling by other melee. Relatively large increase in melee aggregate DPS from this, from extra DPS on non-MT warriors, reduced need for aggro reduction by monk/rog, less cycling by knight classes. Since DPS is much higher for rog/monk, they end up doing even MORE damage than other melee anyay... i.e. same extra attack time + higher dps = more dmg. Somewhat counterintuitive. <br>
<br>
-decreasing warrior DPS and/or net taunt ability, including going from dual wield to 1h + non-taunt shield, would reduce the aggregate DPS of melee classes (for the same reason mentioned above), and potentially other DD types. This would serve to better &quot;balance&quot; the melee classes effective DPS output, but with other, more unpleasant side effects... Would greatly increase the viability of knights and/or monks as warrior replacements as MTs, and generally trivialize the warrior class. <br>
<br>
-increasing a warrior MTs mitigation and/or HP would make fights more predictable, and increase/cement their selection as MT. Reduces the healing load, perhaps allowing other priest classes into the CH chain with clerics. Does nothing for non-MT warriors in pure melee fights; improves them for rampage tanking and/or AE DD/DoT situations. <br>
<br>
-decreasing a warrior MTs mitigation and/or HP... don't wanna think about this one, outcome fairly obvious. <br>
<br>
-increasing a warrior MTs avoidance ability (via block, skill caps, etc) would allow longer or less deep CH chains WITH an increase in risk of MT loss; can decrease the healing load with an increase in uncertainty, marginally increases the need for non-MT warriors as &quot;backups&quot;. Increases which affect other classes (like adding block + mitigation to all shields useable by monks/knights) while also improving warriors would make them even more desireable was MT replacements, due to their superiour ability to generate aggro + newly improved reduction in net damage taken. <br>
<br>
-decreasing a warrior MTs avoidance... ibid, mitigation. <br>
<br>
Doesn't look all that straightforward. :/ Some other possibilities for improving warrior viability, that may/may not have similar drawbacks and/or severe nerf factors: <br>
<br>
-increase non-damage-dealing &quot;downtime&quot; incurred by evade/FD; reduces effective disparity in melee DPS directly. <br>
<br>
-remove/reduce taunt factor of SK and paladin spells; reduces their viability as MTs relative to warriors. <br>
<br>
-add significant taunt to slam/bash/kick; allows warriors to generate aggro on par with hybrid classes, but will increase disparity in effective DPS as noted above. <br>
<br>
-reduce effectiveness of mob avoidance skills vs. warriors; promising, would enhance warriors as MTs, may suffer from enhanced taunt issue however. <br>
<br>
-decrease proximity component in mob hate, or increase hate due to melee damage... could be ugly.  <br>
<br>
Hrm... need more time to ponder. A &quot;GOOD&quot; fix for warriors doesn't seem all that straightforward/trivial... just thought I'd toss in some thoughts and observations. <br>

<br>
I'm stumped at the moment, but still thinking about it.  Probably best to make a list of the actual, and preceived, issues with the warrior class, and see if there's any game balance neutral changes that can address them adequately.  <br>
<br>
My personal desire would be to see that a warriors &quot;natural&quot; strength (tanking) be enhanced without nerfing other classes (monk/rog DPS + aggro reduction, monk HP + damage avoidance, hybrid taunt spells, etc.) or seriously imbalancing the game/existing encounters...<br>
<br>
Gonna be a trick, and I'm pretty sure extra warrior DPS isn't the answer.  Don't know what will be tho, hope Verant doesn't botch it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I agree that non-warrior classes have capability to serve as MT which I feel conradicts why I made a warrior. I think perhaps a few simple small changes that may serve not only the warrior community directly but ALL classes indirectly. These would be: <br>
1) a significantly greater number of hp's based on base stam minus gear. This would put the warrior right up front where he/she SHOULD be.  This change alone could generate a change in the behavior of hybrids during melee as it would allow for much more efficient mana use in CH form.  Clerics would certainly begin asking non-MT's to do what it took to lessen their aggro. <br>
2) Similarly raise AC from base stats, in order to allow for more damage absorbtion. Afterall, that is really our main purpose.<br>
3) Incorporate some more Warrior only weapons that may have similar stats to current weapons but with lots of taunt capability.<br>
<br>
Just a few thoughts offered in a friendly fashion from a simple guy who loves playing his Warrior.<br>

There is this fallacy that still exists today that 2 handers don't taunt well. They do. Damage output is consistent, steady aggro, ask a monk.<br>
<br>
OTOH, I think that all high end 2 handers should be WAR, PAL, SHD usable. Let the skill differences drive damage output differences between the classes, that's why we have different offensive skills in the first place.<br>

<br>
What <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be the added incentive is DPS, and a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   slight</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> increase in tanking ability. DPS is just screwed all to hell right now. If it actually worked out at 80/100/120/140 there wouldn't be nearly as big of a problem. To be honest, I don't feel the problem is the gap between knight and warrior DPS, I think that the problem is that damage dealing melees are just head and shoulders above everyone else. Why would you want to pick a second tank for your group when you could instead get a second monk/rogue who does twice as much damage?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Monks start out with 67% of the HP of a Warrior with maxed stamina at level 60. With both fully max geared and AAXPed the Monk now has 85% of the Warrior's HP. The gap is narrowed by 18%.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Actually, the gap has closed by much more than 18%. Monks start out with 66.666~% of a warriors hp, which means that the warrior has 50% more hp than a monk naturally. Add up all the buffs, AA, and +hp items and the warrior now has 17% greater hp instead of 50%. That is not a trivial difference.<br>
<br>
Here's my take on the things that need to be done to balance <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  the game</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, not just a specific class.<br>
<br>
1.) Either have +hp items scale the effecitve hp a class recieves based on the STA multipier, or just don't make stupid @#%$ ALL/ALL items with +125 hp them. Go back and retro change all items (yea right) to fix this.<br>
<br>
2.) Fix the DPS heirarchy to something sane. 80/100/120/140 would be nice. 85/100/160/200 is just @#%$ stupid. Have they not realised by now that offensive power is the single greatest ability in the game?<br>
<br>
3.) Fix mitigation AC, and do so based on armor type. A cleric(plate) should take less damage per hit than a ranger (chain) but get hit more often. <br>
<br>
4.) Realise the relative merits of offensive and defensive abilities.<br>
<br>
Here's a thought to leave you with.<br>
<br>
There are 2 groups of people attempting to kill a kunark dragon. Which of these 2 groups will kill it easier and with fewer deaths?<br>
<br>
6 manaburn wizards.<br>
12 clerics with a 1 second cast, 100 mana cost CH<br>
<br>
Seems stupid in that context doesn't it?<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: to reconcile the DPS differences amongst the melee classes, I really think they need to LOWER monk and rogue DPS instead of raising everyone else's melee DPS. That would further seperate the melees from the damage dealing casters, would trivialize more content, and would cause more long term problems.<br>

<br>
Another, perhaps more balanced way to reduce the dps disparity between monks/rogues and other melee would be to reduce the effectiveness of their aggro reduction/elimination.  That's what really allows them to open up and do their massive damage.  Reducing the effect of their aggro reduction would require them to throttle back damage or overaggro the way other melee classes (less rangers with jolt) do now.  Just adding DPS or taunt to a MT would actually just allow monk/rog to do even MORE damage, since they'd be able to feign/evade that much less...<br>
<br>
Putting in a longer delay-before-resuming-attack in after evade/fd would do the same thing- reduced their effective DPS.  You could also reduce the &quot;range&quot; on their weapons to increase the effect of proximity aggro, but that'd be somewhat difficult to implement maybe...<br>
<br>
Hrm.  More thinking needed.<br>

As things stand right now, at 60 id rather have the pally over the warrior since your agro is a LOT more solid than a warriors. Let me tell you something interesting that happened to me in seb. I was in a guild group in disco with a 60 warrior weilding that 2hs axe from dain and a 54 warrior whos weapons I dont know off hand. I was 51 and at the time was weilding a wus trance stick and kd combo. The 60 warrior was pulling and main tanking the mobs and usually everything went normal, he held the agro fine. <br>
The weirdest thing though, at least a dozen times over the course of the night, I, a 52 monk with sub par for my level weapons, would steal agro from the warlord weilding the dain axe! Not only that but I would usually have to fd for at least 10 seconds until I could stand back up and turn my attack back on! I am certain that if it had been a 60 PALADIN in equivalent gear, I wouldnt have ever been hit by more than a ds or aoe spell. <br>

Monks start out with 66.666~% of a warriors hp, which means that the warrior has 50% more hp than a monk naturally. Add up all the buffs, AA, and +hp items and the warrior now has 17% greater hp instead of 50%. That is not a trivial difference.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, lets compair a naked monk to naked warrior's AC, Monk has a huge % advantage but loses this with gear........<br>
<br>
&quot;3.) Fix mitigation AC, and do so based on armor type. A cleric(plate) should take less damage per hit than a ranger (chain) but get hit more often. &quot;<br>
disagree but lets look at why. First when naked or in non plate would this still be? How would they find that the class is wearing plate? Second some people can train them selfs to &quot;take a hit&quot; . <br>
