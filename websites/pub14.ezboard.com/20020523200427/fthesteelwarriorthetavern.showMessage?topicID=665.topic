I had been randomly getting the pieces, the gobbie heart and Permafrost block, advising some youngins a long time ago on how to kill Lady Vox.<br><br>Picked up a Hand of the Maestro a long time ago in Hate.  A monacle was given to me by a friend.  The Golem ball about 8 months ago on a Golem raid with my old guild.  The hilts when I fell off the boat in Timorous Deep, and another on a run to Renux for a rogue.<br><br>The rebreathers were made by a friend, and I picked up the jewels along the way.  Talendor dropped my red scale (the first one I had was given to a bard friend long ago).  <br><br>But still, I hadn't given it too much effort.  My guild is long past the day when Severilious was considered a prime target.  These days, he gets whacked by us, when there's just nothing left to do and some people are being charitable to our warriors.  Maybe 5 times in the last 8 months, and out of those times we've only had 3 greens.  Then one day, one of the guild warriors says he saw some guy auctioning a green scale and had talked to him for me.  Scales on ARo go for about 120-150k still.  However, he told me he had talked the guy into the 50k range.<br><br>I had a Wavecrasher and 18k...so I sold that WC and got 48 k and made an offer.  Looked at the scale in the trade window and it was indeed real...I couldn't believe my luck.  And bought it.  I mean worst case, I could resell and likely double my investment.<br><br>However, now the epic blood was in me.  I hadn't gone around and handed a damn thing in yet, just had all the crap sitting in the bank.  So now, I feverishly start the hand ins.  <br><br>I hadn't in my travels picked up a Wingblade, but the last time My guild went, they farmed some extras...and a guildie had one.<br><br>We went to hand in the stuff to Kargek...she advised me that she had loaded the wingblade.  What she thought, was that the timing had to be the same time as my hand in...and had just put it in the trade window.  I took it to be she had given it, and gave him my mark of the Sword.<br><br>&quot;Oh @#%$&quot; I said as the scabbard didn't appear.  <br><br>&quot;What?&quot; she asked, then the awful truth came to light.  I was just out of my scales etc...and was very sick for a moment....till I realized that one of the other warriors did have his scales, just hadn't gotten around to handing things in yet because he lacked the Golem ball.<br><br>I sent him a /tell and said get your ass to Freeport with your Wingblade so he could get my scabbard, and I in turn could grab his scales etc.<br><br>He got it...and a few days later, we went and had to MQ all the non drops for the scabbard, my heart racing the whole time.<br><br>I get the gal back a few days after that and we agree to do the wingblade again, this time, my instructions quite firm.  ANd lo and behold, I end up with my scabbard!<br><br>Life is good, now I all lack is my Queen blade.  Last night, after a long day raiding IV in Ahkeva, and some First brood dragons, we head on down.<br><br>I'm an old school player, having played since release...was doing Naggy and Vox back in late 99.  I was the GM and Raid leader of my previous guild for two years.  I left that guild due to changes etc, and went to my new one.  I wanted no part of raid leading simply because I was burnt out.  However, it's my epic piece, and the current guild leadership want me to step up and take it (I don't think they remember that I do have a lot of experience doing this).  We head down...the monk pulling is one that doesn't get to do it often (we have 6 monks, and 10 warriors).  <br><br>He's got a bit of an attitude, something to prove I suppose, and isn't listening.  Really resistant to moving us up etc...and as I learn, doesn't tell me good times to take his pulls (hard for me to see where the others have gone.).<br><br>So we're having a crazy night, with 5-6 Sarnaks etc on each pull, but we're doing well.  We clear to the Herbalist room and set up and he begins pulling the King.  I want him to give me some warning prior to the King showing up, so I can make sure we're all ready...but he pulls that bastard in there.  We kill it with no warning (we're a pretty resilient bunch) and I chew his ass on the pull team chat.  We clear the King room and move on in.  <br><br>Now it's time for the Queen, we have 30 peeps or so there, and a lot of nuking power, and a non KOS person.  I want to pull her just inside the room with us in the pit and have the lizard hail her.  Then we just send a pally to eat the first wave and beat her down in about 10 seconds there in the King room (especially with my psychotic puller).<br><br>My GM is also at this raid, and he's a great guy, good leader etc.  But damn he's hard headed and hops into pull chat and dresses me down telling me this is a nutty plan that can't succeed and basically pulls rank on me.<br><br>So we begin to split it, and what do ya know but the damn monk pulls Queenie on in the first pull...we get her to 5% and she gates and the rest of the room wipes out most of us.  Most, except for a pair of clerics who somehow got out.  We frantically wait till the mobs start moving out (having 5 mins or so before repop of the king room).  And begin battle rezzing and fighting the repop.  Our <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> enchanter gets battle rezzed and somehow manages to keep the situation under control.   ANd we get back on our feet.  I'm still being told in pull chat how stupid the idea of pulling her to the Queen room is, and that the last attempt shows it due to the gate she did.<br><br>But one of our regular raid leaders and officers believes in my plan and as we proceed to pull the room again...he tells me he's going to bring her alone, and we split bringing just her. <br><br>We nuke her hard core, in the King room.  Felt damn good to get it and my epics down there.  Also felt good to know that my plan did work, even if the GM was going nuts about it.<br><br>We stayed and got another king for our cleric, and a queen blade for the warrior who had MQed everything for me, after getting my scabbard (he wasn't on, I logged him on and ran him there).<br><br>Best damn night of my life, and certainly the most exciting...the royals are still a challenge even for a hard raid guild.<br><br>Also got two incarndine BPs! :P  I didn't have one, so now I have invis.  Plus my Jagged Blade o' War.<br><br>Sorry for the length of the post, but it's a damn good feeling and a crazy ass epic...as my friend put it, that's the most insane epic story i heard. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p>Regards,<br><br>Halagar Skullcleaver<br>Warlord of the North<br><a href="http://www.guildrip.com"><b>Rest in Peace</b></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufuloriancavestomper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FulorianCavestomper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/con's RED</span><br>  Posts: 323<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/02 10:40:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=665.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Story of my epic! </span><hr size=1> Congratulations! <p>Veteran Fulorian Cavestomper <BR>60th Warlord of Xegony<BR>Val'Kori</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uthehavocblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheHavocblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/02 11:15:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=665.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.guardianalliance.org/cgi-bin/upload/thakezboard.jpg h=40 w=30></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Story of my epic! </span><hr size=1> Congrats <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>In a little over an hour and a half, I'll be leading my first royals raid.

Spent two or three days running around finishing up the other parts of the quest, waited until both myself and the MQ'ing person were free at the same moment and then we finally headed to EFP.

Luckily after several bashes at this, I managed to tag onto a Vox raid who helped with the Block of Permafrost.  <br><br>Then we decided to take a trip upto PoH to go and kill Innothule ... we lost, but we managed to have the Maestro part with his hand.  <br><br>And at the weekend it was a PoA trip to farm spiroc blades.  Started at 7pm in the evening .... finished 10am the following morning ...

After that, we send in a DA cleric or paladin, then everybody charges and uses offensive discs (I use fellstrike personally), while the chanters mez the guards and everybody full out nukes.
