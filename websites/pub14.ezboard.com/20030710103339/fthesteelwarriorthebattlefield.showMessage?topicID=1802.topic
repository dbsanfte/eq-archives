<br>
Why Do It?<br>
===============<br>
I am a 65 warrior playing on the Terris-Thule server and I was max KOS to giants.  After a raid I was rewarded with Dain's head that I need to turn in.  The Dain's Head is a quest for the Belt Of Dwarf Slaying and you need to be ally with King Tormax to do the turn in.<br>
<br>
Overall I don't like farming (because I have to do so much as it is, welcome to blacksmithing Kassan) and so wanted a really quick and easy guide to get to Ally in the shortest time possible.<br>
<br>
Also after searching the Net many times I just couldn't find a easy guide so here is one.<br>
<br>
Shut up Kassan - Tell us how you did it?<br>
==============================<br>
The easy way to do this is farm Coldain Heads, this can be done many ways from the Coldain Wolfmasters to goos in the mines in Thurgadin or simply buy them from bazaar (on TT the average price of these heads are about 150pp).<br>
<br>
The first step is to get about 30-40 of these heads.  In Great Divide there is a Coldain mine in the corner of the zone, if you follow the left wall from East Waste zone line you will find it (it is past the giants so invis here helps loads to start with).<br>
<br>
As you enter the mines you will come across two guards (these conned light blue to me at level 65) which don't see through invis.  As you past the first set of guards there is a room on your left with 2 velium miners and 1 coldain miner.  Kill them, they con green to me at 65.  They run so make sure you snare them or pull them into the far corner of the room and kill them there as when they run the get confused and end up running in a circle.<br>
<br>
Once you have killed those 3 miners, invis up again and head left out of the room and follow the left wall.  This will take you into another room which has 1 coldain miner, 1 velium miner and 1 guard.  Run over to the bottom of the room and range attack the coldain miner he will come solo.  Again kill him making sure he does run.  The velium miner is a pain as when you attack her the guard will jump in.  You have two options here though, leave the guard (I have a 65 alt so I used option two) or lull/harmony the guard and pull the Velium miner.<br>
<br>
Once you have done those two invis up again.  Head out of the room and take the first left (just follow the left wall).  This will take you into a room with 6 miners in, I think you have 2 velium miners, 3 coldain miners and a named miner called Reloik (something like that, he didn't drop anything whilst I was there).  There are two exists within this room both have 2 guards each side which means you have 4 light blue guards watching you.  Use range attacks and take out all the miners making sure you pull them to the back of the room.<br>
<br>
Then invis back up and run back to the first room, the mines are very spacious with many rooms in but after investigation the mentioned mobs are the only people in there.<br>
<br>
All the miners, inc the named con green to me and didn't cause me much problems.  Respawn time on these mobs where 6 mins.<br>
<br>
The guards are pains in the arses if they aggro.  On my own I could take one out but would be very close so normally I would run to the zone line if I aggro a guard and my cleric is not with me.<br>
<br>
The mines drop heads quite regularly.  I managed to get 40 heads in about 2-3 hours on a good day of farming there.<br>
<br>
So you have your heads, what now.  Well to start with you need to get a friend who can invis you (you CAN NOT self invis for this stage as it will not work).<br>
<br>
Take yourself and your friend to Kael from East Wastes, the first mob you run into in Kael is a kromrif recruiter.  This will con green and also scrowl at you but he will not attack you unless you attack him first.<br>
<br>
Walk up to him and bring up the trade window with him by OFFERING him a head (DO NOT press the give button).  Once you have the trade window up ask you friend for an invis.  Once you are invised press the give button and say hello to some faction.  Drop invis and repeat the stage again.  After about 5 heads con the recruiter to see what your faction standing is.  Note : Some people say that giving him 4 heads gives you more faction but I have no prove, I done it a head at a time.  It took me about 15-20 heads to go to dubious on Kromrif and Kromzek.  The recruiter only gives positive faction on these and negative on CoV, possible Coldain and Dain but I didn't really care about this as I want to raise giant faction.<br>
<br>
Once you con dubious head to the bank in Kael.  I recommend you take it slowly and try and con as much as possible as the first set of giants are on Kromrif but bank area has Kromzek giants about.  If you head into the bank and don't get attacked that is a good sign.  If you do, call train and zone the mobs.  Then head back to the recruiter (with your friend) and give some more heads to him.  Do not give loads of heads to the recruiter as his faction hits are quite poor you just need dubious faction to Kromzek for the next phase.<br>
<br>
If you can enter the bank and giants don't attack you then well done you are on the final run.  Hopefully in the bank there will be Captain Bvellos.  If there is a Kael Militia Captain (something like that) then sorry leave and come back later or get the bank group (if there is one) to kill him as he is the PH for Captian Bvellos.  If nothing is there then head towards King Tormax area (remember KT and Kromzek faction around this area so move slowly and con giants as you go).  Captain Bvellos is sometimes in the throne room, if he is not there then he is probably dead but have a run around Arena as sometimes he goes up there to see his friends.  DO NOT go into the temple, where Vindi, Statue live (see later).<br>
<br>
If Captain is up then give me a head, you don't need invis for this stage just give him a head and you will receive Kromrif, Kromzek and KT faction negative on CoV faction.  Repeat this stage until you run out of heads.  I had to turn in about 60 heads on this to get to Ally on Kromrif, Kromzek and KT.<br>
<br>
So there you have it ... max ally, it took me about a month to find out all this stuff but about 6 hours of farming to be ally.<br>
<br>
I am Ally What Now<br>
===============<br>
There are loads of quests in Kael that can be done for some really nice stuff.  You can run around the whole of Kael and talk to every giant quite amusing whilst people are running around the zone with 6-8 giants on them you can run behind them hailing them :-) ....<br>
<br>
If you are in a guild then you can do the scouting for them in Kael to see if KT is up or Vindi/Statue.<br>
<br>
WARNING<br>
The temple that houses Vindi and the Statue are on a different faction (been told it is temple faction) and this faction is very hard impossible to raise (this needs to be confirmed) so if you have Vindi/Statue then you will be KOS to them.<br>
<br>
If you are ally to Kromzek and a monkey then you can pull Vindi from the temple to WL zone line without getting adds (I read this on monkey business don't know if they changed it but still pretty cool)<br>
<br>
Well that is it .... hope it helps people out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showPrevMessage?topicID=1802.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showNextMessage?topicID=1802.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.emailToFriend?topicID=1802.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.threadControl?topicID=1802.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1802.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1802.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield>The BattleField</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
