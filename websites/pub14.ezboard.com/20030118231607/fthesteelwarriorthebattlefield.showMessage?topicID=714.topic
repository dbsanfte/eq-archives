<br>
The levels of faction are as such, from lowest faction to highest faction:<br>
<br>
scowling -&gt; glares threateningly -&gt; glowers dubiously -&gt; apprehensive -&gt; indifferent -&gt; amiably -&gt; kindly -&gt; warmly -&gt; ally<br>
<br>
Basically, the lower your faction is with a mob, the less likely he or she will deal with you. The other side of the coin is that a mob who regards you warmly or as an ally may potentially open up quests and rewards not feasible with a lower faction, such as the Hero Bracer quest.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       Scowling</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is kill on sight, or KOS. Wander within the invisible perimeter of the mob's detection area, known as its <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       aggro radius</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and it will most likely attack you.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       Glaring</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is a delayed KOS - as long as you're not within aggro radius for too long, you may be able to sneak past. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>           Glowering</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is not a KOS status, but the mob most likely will not deal with you. Certain NPCs will, such as Fordel bankers in Shadowhaven. Most merchants, bankers, and guildmasters will deal with you at <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       apprehensive</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and up; some may do so at glowering. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       Ally</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is the highest faction and is required for many high-level quests.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       Is there any significance to the order in which faction messages are displayed?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes. Faction hits that are higher up than others are heavier hits. For instance, upon killing a Coldain Wolfmaster, note that the positive Kromrif hit is higher than the positive Kromzek hit; you'll get a bigger boost to Kromrif faction than to Kromzek faction. The same also applies to negative hits, although in the opposite direction - you'll receive a bigger hit to Coldain faction than to Dain Frostreaver IV faction.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       What are the dynamics of faction in Velious, and how do I go about changing them?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There are three main factions in Velious - the Coldain, the Kromzek, and the Claws of Veeshan. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. <br>
<br>
Thurgadin is abundant in trade skill resources and is generally the easiest city to start out of, as almost every race/class/deity combination is initially non-KOS. Champion's Armor is basically on par with Cobalt and PoG armor. I believe it requires kindly status to quest for. It's also the easiest of the three quested Velious armors to get. The Coldain Ring quests are also very, very rewarding. The two factions of the Coldain are Coldain and Dain Frostreaver IV (the faction of the Dain and his royal guards and advisors).<br>
<br>
Kael Drakkal is much more spartan than Thurgadin, but rightfully so - the Kromzek are singularly devoted to war and strife.. In any case, Kael is centrally located in Velious, making it a decent hub for the frozen continent. Warlord's Armor requires ally faction with the Kromzek, but it is very rewarding - highest AC and high stats. It requires Ally faction with Kromzek. Also, there are many rewards to be had in the form of other quests - Belt of Dwarf Slaying, Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying, Collar of the Storm - and so on. The three factions of Kael are Kromrif (frost giants - these guys wear plate mail and usually have beards), Kromzek (storm giants - these guys wear darkish plate mail and are clean-shaven), and King Tormax (Tormax himself, his golden armor-wearing guards, and a couple others scattered in the zone).<br>
<br>
Skyshrine is a very large zone, comrpised of libraries, mazes, and various quarters. While Myrmidon's Armor doesn't have as much AC or stamina as Warlord's overall, it has higher raw HPs and resists (it requires ally faction with Claws of Veeshan). Also, Lord Yelinak himself offers a quest which requires the head of King Tormax - a rather nice (if you believe that HP &gt; AC) helm can be had from this quest. Plus, the Benevolence quest can net you some fine bracers. Additionally, while traversing through Western Wastes, you will find your journey much less perilous, as most of the mobs in the zone are on Skyshrine factoin. Two factions exist in Skyshrine - the Claws of Veeshan and Lord Yelinak.<br>
<br>
Now, how do you go about boosting each one?<br>
<br>
Dwarf - I've been told that a very effective method to raise Coldain faction is killing giants at the Riff manor in Kael. Also, if you save <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=937">frost giant toes</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=978">Kromrif heads</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, you can boost your Coldain faction more quickly. Derakor the Vindicator also carries a rather sizeable faction hit to Coldain. As for Dain faction, check <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=204">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. Killing Tormax nets a rather decent hit to Dain faction.<br>
<br>
Giant - Killing almost anything coldain will raise your Kromrif faction, while killing almost anything dragon, especially in Skyshrine, will boost your Kromzek faction. Coldain wolfmasters in Great Divide, which are around level 35, rarely drop Coldain heads. Turn these in to the kromriff recruiter, located in Kael at the zone line to Eastern Wastes, to boost your Kromrif and Kromzek factions. Once your Kromzek faction is at dubious, you can turn heads into Captain Bvellos, located at the bank in central Kael, for a larger Zek hit and a minor positive hit to King Tormax. Killing Dain, Yelinak, and Velketor will help you raise your Tormax faction more quickly.<br>
<br>
Dragon - One of the best ways to raise your CoV faction is by joining an arena raid in Kael. Most of the giants here will boost your CoV faction. Even the Statue and Idol of Rallos Zek, along with the Avatar of War, will boost your CoV faction. Additionally, dropped <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=982">giant helmets</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> can net some decent CoV and Yelinak hits. Killing Tormax or his personal guards will  boost your Yelinak faction, as will <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=200">several quests</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
There is no *best* faction, really - each has its pros and cons and difficult fights. Note that if you wish to foray into North Temple of Veeshan, where much of the best loot pre-Luclin drops, you should probably not be on dragon faction, unless you feel like doing a lot of faction work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       What are some online resources for faction, foes, and zones?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com">Illia's</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is mainly a database on mobs (and a very good one at that);<br>
however, there's also <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/factionlist.html">a list of factions</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> at Illia's that is very detailed and lengthy. I don't know of a better single, more organized resource for faction on the net.<br>
<br>
There's a decent listing of zones at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Norrath.htm">Allakhazam's</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  Also, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/">EQ Maps</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> has a variety of resources for each zone. You might also want to check out <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/indexe.html">Questor of Norrath</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - this site has some <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       very</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> high quality maps for your perusal.<br>
<br>
Also, yes, I know rogues are dirty little money-pinching bastards, but <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> boasts some of the best information about individual factions, foes, and zones around. It's worth a look, too.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       What are rampage and flurry?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Rampage is an extra attack from a mob that strikes those high on the hate list. Sometimes rampage seems to attack many people at once, but this isn't always the case. Sometimes rampage is confined to one target.<br>
<br>
Flurry is a free melee round on one single target. This is especially debilitating in the hands of a mob who can quad attack.<br>
<br>
Dexterity seems to have an effect on rampage and flurry; Cripple is handy against this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         What mobs drop talismans used for Sleeper's Tomb keys?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Klandicar (Western Wastes, near the Dragon Necropolis zone)<br>
Zlandicar (Dragon Necropolis)<br>
Lord Yelinak (Skyshrine)<br>
Sontalak (Western Wastes, guarding the entrance to the Temple of Veeshan)<br>
Lendinaria the Keeper (Temple of Veeshan, far West Wing)<br>
King Tormax (Kael Drakkel, throne room)<br>
Derakor the Vindicator (Kael Drakkel, Temple of Rallos Zek)<br>
Statue of Rallos Zek (Kael Drakkel, Temple of Rallos Zek)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Where can I find discussion on various high-end zones, mobs, and ubermobs?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Right here. I recommend using the Search function before asking any questions, as most every single mob in the game has been discussed ad nauseum on this very board. Of course, if you can't find what you're looking for, feel free to fire away questions.<br>
