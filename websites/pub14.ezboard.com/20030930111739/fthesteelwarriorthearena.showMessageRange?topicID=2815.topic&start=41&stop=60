I will never outdamage our Guildpallis by 40 Dps. They use Eqal or better Weapons and some skill progressing armor so theirs 2h Skill is nearly equal to mine.<br>
<br>
See this profile <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94012">Pallis Gear</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
Look at his gaunts. 10 % mod 2h blunt.<br>
Look at the Hp differenz between him an me.<br>
Look at his weapon its equal to mine.<br>
<br>
When I make 100 dps with that ( but think its more around 90 to 95 ) do you warrior real think that he does only around 60 dps with his gear? From what are you dreaming at night?<br>
<br>
When we speak about equal equipped Paladins / Warriors / Shadowknight then we have a real small differenz in Damage. <br>
<br>
Some times ago there were Parsings from some higher guild about damage.<br>
When I remember right it goes like<br>
warrior 100 %<br>
Paladin 96 to 104 % ( gear and Weapon )<br>
Shadowknight 88 to 94 % without Spells.<br>
Tanks out of one guild. All hitting from behind.<br>
<br>
When I then hear that a warrior said that he outdamaged his equal equipped Palli from the front while the palli takes the back ... thats laughable and only a dream just a dream.<br>

I need more hitpoints still it seems :P<br>
<br>
The root cause of this problem is that there was never a clear role for the hybrid tanks.  Thiey used to tank less well, and do less damage, but had spells to make up for that.  The spells however didn't make up anything in a group situation.  They provided a nice bonus to soloing power, but nothing to the group.  Then the Shadowknights and Paladins had their melee skills beefed up and got more individual spells that were desireable while grouping.  <br>
<br>
The core problem still remains, there are three flavors of tank and you only need one.  The one you need is the one that can hold the monster.  I almost never use defensive, as I would rather the monster hit me while non-defensive than hit the rogue or the druid or the wizard, etc.  I would gladly have my damage reduced to half for a x4 aggro modifier (net gain of double aggro), as my dps is laughably insignificant to my usual group (Me: 60-80 dps, Rogue: 105-130 dps, DC pet: 100-110 dps, Chanter: ~20 dps, Cleric ~20 dps, Wizard: alot :P). <br>
<br>
Bottom line:  All tanks must be able to direct the monster's attention at themselves.  Good tanks must be able handle the punishment the mob puts out.  I hold aggro pretty well in my normal group, as they know my limits, but have been passed over for knights or put in a non-tanking position by pickup groups.  <br>
<br>
I see no reason why knights should taunt better than warriors now.  We do similar damage, and tank pretty much the same on xp mobs.  We do have a decided advantage on raid mobs, but I personally use that as little as possible (my guild is small and more accustomed to group aggro than raid aggro).  Knights are better at soloing and duoing than warriors due to their spells.  I think ALL tanks should be allowed to demand aggro, use damage taken, damage delt, and utility as balancing factors.<br>
<br>
Changes I would like to see made to the warrior class:<br>
<br>
1) Improve Aggro Production:  Put us on equal footing with knights for aggro production, both instant, and long term.  Remove Enraging Blow and it's cousins from the game.<br>
<br>
2) Permanent Mitigation Bonus:  Give us a permanent mitigation bonus of 20% (maxhit = DB + 16 DI) so that we never get hit as hard as another class.  In return take defensive away, or hell all the disciplines as far as I care.  <br>
<br>
3) Soloability:  Yeah I know, it isn't a solo game.  Most classes have a much greater proficiency at it however, and we should be able to make some xp on our own when we dont have time to commit to a group.  We need to improve our soloability without increasing group effectiveness.  Do this by making us virtually immune to damage from green and light blue mobs.  This will allow us to chain kill light blue mobs for a steady stream of low grade xp.  It isn't glorious, but would be a great fit for those times when you have half an hour to play.<br>
<br>
Wow, I gotta stop going afk while I am posting ... I have rambled on a bit too long.<br>

I find this hard to believe.  All I would expect an arrow to do is put you on the hate list, because Warriors do no significant damage with arrows.  If the Monk is FDing near the group and you've tagged previously with an arrow, I would certainly expect it to make a beeline for you, since you're already on the hate list.  I have seen nothing that indicates nor do I believe barring evidence to the contrary that firing an arrow gives you a significant amount of hate. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
What is ridiculous about Caen's Bo Staff?  Life taps don't draw aggro.<br>
<br>
Personally, I find the RZ sword ridiculous.  A warrior in my guild has one and puts out damn near the same damage I do when I use my Rune Etched Bamboo Bo and he is tanking the mob and I'm behind it.  Same ratio, but the damage bonus is much higher on the RZ weapon.  <br>
<br>
This warrior doesn't even have flurry maxed, nor critical hits maxed, nor PB maxed and he still out damages every monk in our guild except me and one other monk with a REBB.  All this from the front of the mob while the monks is on the rear.<br>
<br>
The 'monk damage' table is nothing more than slightly higher max damage for the same weapon damage compared to a warrior.  The end result is a warrior with decent offensive AA's can do monk damage with the RZ sword.<br>
<br>
Concerning taunt, I agree that warriors definitely need better taunt.  But concerning DPS, you guys are just fine unless you plan on lobbying for more monk and rogue DPS. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=494844" target="new">Rjey</a><br>

At least up through Tier2 PoP, agro control seems to be the limiting factor when it comes to how much damage a lot of the classes deal. <br>
<br>
From a shaman's perspective, I much prefer to have a mob malo'd by the time it gets to camp and slow it immediately. A good SK will never loose agro, a warrior will. Not that taking a hit or two is a big deal, I'm much prefer to have a slowed mob beating on me for a few seconds than an unslowed mob on the MT but it does show the agro differences and with a warrior it can get hairy with a resisted slow and a missed taunt right after. <br>
<br>
**hugs shield and warriors that know how to use it** <br>
<br>
Especially in a non-ideal group (druid/shaman healing for example) were the margin of error isn't that big, having a warrior for MT is a pretty major disadvantage. Honestly though, I sometimes get the feeling that it's often due to warriors that don't know when to hit the taunt button. Some warriors just seem to taunt well while others don't and from what I've seen it doesn't seem to be gear dependent. <br>
<br>
Having said that, the only reason I'm reading this board atm is because I'm gearing up a warrior alt, not a knight, but taunt really is broken at the high end. At least the difference in taunt between warrior and knights, I guess you could debate whether knights taunt too well or warriors don't taunt well enough.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bergum>Bergum</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/28/03 1:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2815.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> Shaman here,<br>

I haven't really noticed an agro problem in PoP.  I have always been one to cast Malo and Slow as soon as the MoB is in range.  In doing that I know that I will get beat on, beat alot if slow is resisted.<br>
<br>
I do think it's true about a warrior building agro through the fight.  Pallies and Sks can build agro very fast due to thier spells.  If everyone let the tank do his/her job and have a few rounds to build agro I think it would be less of an issue.<br>
<br>
That's not to say that I think taunt is working like it should be in PoP,  but it is possible to be effective with a warrior as the MA.<br>
<br>
ps-  I am refering to 1st tier planes, anything above I have no experiance and cannot comment. <p>__________________<br>

The group had a 63 warrior as MT, a 63 or 64 druid as healer, a 62 shaman (my wife) as slower, a 62 wiz, a 63 or 64 chanter as crowd control, and me (62 paladin). The warrior was MT.<br>
<br>
When we first started, I sent a tell asking the warrior if he wanted me to stun in incoming. I was basically offering a low risk method for him to piggyback aggro. He wasn't interested. We fought for a bit, and he was having occasional problems with aggro. It wasn't anything terrible, just a convenience thing more than anything, but it was more of a difference from my own aggro abilities than I thought was needed. <br>
<br>
He was pulling with a bow. When the mob got into camp him and I would engage for a few seconds before debuffs started getting cast. Generally half the mobs would aggro a debuffer during this initial engagement period, but the warrior usually got it back pretty quickly. Probably pretty standard for a warrior, i'm guessing.<br>
<br>
During one particular pull, my wife slowed the mob too early and got aggro. She sent a tell to the warrior saying basically &quot;Oops, sorry. I'm used to Graal tanking&quot; The warrior understandably got a bit miffed at that and responded &quot;I'm a good tank&quot;. My wife responded by saying that first, she was spoiled and it had nothing to with him, and that secondly, when I was tanking she HAD to slow immediately.<br>
<br>
Some time went by and I decided I was going to help the warrior by letting him piggyback aggro from me. I would stand right next to him when the mob was coming in and stun it as soon as it engaged the warrior. Usually the warrior had aggro by the time the stun wore off and things went much more smoothly. A few times he didn't get aggro very quickly from me and I almost died. It wasn't nearly as hard for him to tank the mobs unslowed as it was for me, but he had a level (2 by the end of the night) and better gear than me.<br>
<br>
After a while, when he pulled he set up right next to me so I didn't have to move next to him. Things worked really well and we clicked.<br>
<br>
If I had been the MT, aggro would not have been a problem unless people were really stupid and/or lazy. He definitely tanked better than I did, but not in relation to my aggro abilities. I think that the balance between aggro and tanking needs to be tweaked a little bit. My concern is that SOE uses a sledgehammer to tweak. If I as a paladin don't have an advantage in the taunting department, I don't have a role in a group. Keep in mind this is a person who has a ready made group waiting for him when he logs in. It's not something that would affect me, but it would really hurt most other paladins.<br>
<br>
I want to make sure that most warriors understand something. When a paladin is MT, he is basically devoting his manapool just to aggro and generally can't afford to use spells for anything else, at least not in a sustained manner. If I have to cast 3 stuns throughout a fight to keep a mob on me (which is about right), that is more mana used than my mana regen can make up for. My mana is slowly going down as I tank. Granted it will be a long time before the gas tank is empty if I use my mana wisely, but if I use any other spells such as a heal over time or a group heal, it is a big hit on my mana. If I have to use my mana for anything other than just aggro, I quickly have to sit and med. I just wanted to point that out so people undertood that a tanking paladin really doesn't bring that much extra utility to a group simply due to the requirements of using mana to aggro. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686">Graal MacBladefury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

No, probably not on an every mob basis.  What you do bring is the opportunity for emergency utility.  If something goes unexpectedly wrong, you have the opportunity for some corrective action.  Much more so than a Warrior would.  Best a Warrior might do is fire off AE taunt and then follow up with defensive or evasive.<br>

I am another 65 Paladin, and I will add my opinion, for what it is worth.  <br>
<br>
First off, 28 pts of weapon skill is worth somewhere around 75+ Raw Attack.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, or anyone else who has parsed the differences between comparably equipped Paladins and Warriors, what this means for DPS.  Flat out, and respectfully as I can say this as possible, you do more damage, period.. lets not debate something that is clear and unequivocally true.  Whether you do *enough* more damage to balance against all the other things could be debated.  Remember, however, that Hybrids were specifically given better combat tables because of how incredibly pathetic they once were.<br>
<br>
As a Paladin, for the first time in about 2 years I enjoy what my class brings to a group.  I think I bring enough to justify myself in that tank position at least 50% of the time when a group is looking for a tank and an SK or a Warrior is also LFG.  I don't think it is an immediate decision to take a hybrid over a warrior, and I have asked my regular group cleric many times how things compare with an equivalently equipped warrior tanking for him, and he essentially tells me he the warrior tanks better, but that I hold aggro better.<br>
<br>
I think there is room for an improvement to the Warrior ability to hold taunt, but if the concept is not broached intelligently, there is a very real possibility of breaking things.  In uber mob raid content, there is no need for an increase to warrior taunt, and part of the problem is that most ideas put forth to fix it will also effect it in that arena.<br>
<br>
I am all for improvements to the Warrior class that allow them to be on par in an exp group situation to a Hybrid tank, if there really is a spreading idea that Warriors are inferior in this regard (I am not wholly convinced of it, but I'll consider it as a valid opinion).  When you compare available spells that can be used while tanking, the dps of the two parties (since DPS stacks, while tanking does not), and the margin of tanking that a Warrior holds over a Hybrid, only then can you balance the taunt factors.<br>
<br>
I generally believe there is a large deal of anxiety because of the limited areas and opportunities to exp in PoP exp groups... I think you will find most classes are not satisfied with their ability to find groups.  I also think, that as tanks, at least we can be assured of one group spot in a group, whereas alot of other classes compete under the broad category of &quot;DPS&quot; for their group spots.  DPS, conveniently for them however, stacks, while tanking, as we well know, does not.<br>
<br>
Unless they want to go adding Rampaging mobs to exp grind areas, there really is never a reason to have 2 tanks in a group, and I believe therein lies the real problem.  If you think for a second that a Paladin has some better chance of grabbing the '2nd tank' group position then any other tank class, your sadly mistaken.  In fact, when the tanking end is covered, a Warrior is above the Paladin on the list, simply because they add more DPS.<br>
<br>
In summary, I am for research into the area of Warrior taunt, and an increase to it that 'makes sense'.  I don't want to see a return to the days of Kunark, where thankfully, exp mobs were so easy in comparison to those of today, that the utterly horribly designed and balanced Hybrid classes got groups only out of charity.  If, as Warriors, you can concede that you will and should be vying for tanking positions in exp groups with Paladins and Shadowknights, I have no problem with class tweakings to your class that make that area more level.  If, however, the goal is to make the Warrior class the absolute best class to take for that 1 available exp group tanking position, it will absolutely swing the scale of class balance back to days of yore.<br>
<br>
There are more Warriors then Paladins and Shadowknights put together on nearly every server.  It is not by chance that this is the case, it stems from a very long period of time where the Hybrid classes flat out stunk.  They stunk for exp groups, they stunk in raids... there wasnt an area of the game or a knowledgeable exp group in the game that would take one over a Warrior.<br>
<br>
If both of our classes can understand that true balance will still mean us vying for the same exp group spots (tank position), and not a clearcut winner from either side in 95% of situations, then we can start to work together on an acceptable outcome.  For me, as a Paladin, this means I must consider the fact that my class, at this point in the games cycle, may be slightly overbalanced in comparison to Warriors in exp situations, due almost exclusively to my ability to taunt.  For you, as a Warrior, you must concede that for most of the previous history of the game from Kunark onward, you held this position of overbalance without equal or peer.<br>
<br>
Push for the changes to be made where they really matter, which is before a Warrior can attain a taunt-enducing weapon.  When a Warrior gains access to those weapons, I believe the classes are very nearly completely balanced. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glatius2>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 764<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/29/03 12:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2815.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> All of the nice theorizing aside, I know that some of my friends, particularly people who tend to draw aggro more than most, Druids, Wizards, Rogues, Monks, Shaman, have all told me that while a Warrior makes a good tank, they can participate more and unload more with a Knight tanking.  My Druid friends have come right out and told me there are entire lines of spells they don't feel comfortable using if a Warrior is tanking because of the aggro involved.<br>
<br>
Every time one of my party draws aggro off me it is a gamble as to whether or not I'll get it back in one taunt, in five, or not until they're dead.  Procs improve that, but never make it go away.  You can't count on procs.  And if you duel wield in order to try and generate procs, you decrease your DPS, compared to a good 2hs, and increase the amount of damage you take due to ripostes.  In effect I lose my DPS edge and my HP edge in order to aggro substantially below the Knight.<br>
<br>
You know what another personal pet peeve of mine is?  Pets.  I can't generate enough hate most of the time to manuver the mobs into the position I want because with a pet on them, the mobs turn right around to the next person on the hate list.  While with a Knight can generate enough spell hate that mobs will move around and change position for them even with a pet on them.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't object to the Knight classes being in good shape.  I don't object to the Knight classes competing with Warriors on a fairly level playing field for group spots.  I do object to such a dramatic difference in aggro control that people can and will decide that a Warrior just isn't worth the grief for a prolonged exp grind.<br>
<br>
People don't like getting beat on.  Nor do they like having to hold back substantially all the time.  Nor do they like the delays involved with someone dying, getting rezzed, and having to be rebuffed due to a string of failed taunts.  Do you get long strings of failed taunts all the time?  No, not really.  But all it takes is one to get someone killed.  And successful taunts are not 95% of the time.  They're not 50% of the time.  They're more like around 25-33% of the time.<br>
<br>
So please don't try and convince me that all is well in warriorland.  I know for a fact it isn't because I live it almost on a daily basis.  And I talk to the people who play in the support roles with myself and other Warriors.  They're feeling the pain too.  Just ask them, the majority will agree. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

Even if its resisted, it still generates hate. If a taunt fails, it doesnt generate anything. Verant claims they dont want to mess with taunt too much because they feel it will make holding aggro trivial. But actually, it already is for hybrids. Cast, stun, debuff...the mob is their baby for the rest of the fight. <br>
<br>
With all the new things Verant is able to do in game now, youd think they could maybe make an item, like gloves or boots that have a hate modifier on them. For kicks or slams. Shields are ok if you happen to get a decent 1h, and there really arent too many out there for Warriors that are made for use with shields. I dont wanna have to use a shield if I dont have to. Maybe if they could add the same type of hate that a Paladin stun spell generates to a Warrior bash or kick, or some sort of hate modifier. Its still a prosthetic though, just like a weapon proc, and to me a Warrior shouldnt have to rely on things like that. It should be inborn to be able to hold aggro and go toe to toe better than anyone else. Afterall, thats ALL we do. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.netset.com/~blazer/zummy2.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=demorgothdh>DemorgothDH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/29/03 6:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2815.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> Asura.<br>
[quote]1. Monk pulls the mob. 
2. Druid snares the mob before it is in range.
3. Shaman slows the mob before it is in range.
4. Warrior finally gets the chance to engage the mob.
What is wrong with this picture? First thing, druid and shaman used two of the highest aggro spells in the game BEFORE the warrior even engaged. [/quote]<br>
<br>
If they're gonna use those spells, before the mob is in range is the safest time. One successful taunt puts you over them on the hate list. They've cast their most agro spells, aren't gonna have to cast them again (and hance pull agro off you), and your first successful taunt has given you an effective 2001 points of hate (number made up, it's effectively procing Turgurs level hate on the mob, + 1)<br>
<br>
When duoing with a shaman, we pull with malos, root, slow, malosini, cripple, epic dot, ulthor dot, bone of bertox dot, then sit the sham to med if he's still rooted. Warrior goes in and attacks and taunts. 9 times out of 10 a successful taunt will land before root breaks (especially if not using high dd proc weapons) which give you ALL of the shaman's agro from those huge agro spells, plus 1 point of agro, plus whatever agro from dps or prox you get after that. If everyone casts their high agro debuffs before the mob has even hit anyone, it deals less damage, PLUS you have a much higher initial agro once the first taunt hits, putting you way ahead of the healers/nukers who haven't engaged yet, allowing them to cast at will.<br>

The druid would snare, and the mob would run towards him/her and beat him up.  You would run like a bat out of hell to engage the mob only to see the shaman slow the mob a second later and watch as it runs towards the shaman to beat him up.  By that time, they both could have possibly taken considerable damage depending if you were successful on your taunts or were lucky enough to proc in the few hits you got in.  Sometimes, in rare but not uncommon situations, the cleric might even generate aggro healing one of the two to generate a nightmare ping pong effect. <br>
<br>
I've seen this happen A LOT and so it's not purely hypothetical. And I've seen worse.  Now sure, if the druid and shaman are in sync, not watching tv/afk, watch the pull, and time their snares/slows right at the same time or .5 seconds after each other (following cast times), it would be easier for me to engage.  But this doesn't always happen, because well...  Even I would say that is a bit too hard.<br>
<br>
Now, I've also seen shamans who would slow the mob and generate aggro which is not a problem at all. I'd simply go over to them and taunt it off.  But RIGHT after I taunted it, they would go on to cripple it because they think I have now secured aggro or something in that 4 seconds.  And then I would taunt it off yet again.  But RIGHT after that, they would dot the mob.  And then I would taunt it off one more time.  Guess what... That ticks me off to NO END.  Believe it or not, not everyone understands about how aggro or taunt works.  And it's not always the warrior.<br>
<br>
Oh, and as for the Caen's Bo staff thingy, I've grouped with two monks who had those in the same day.  And they proc'ed like crazy and hit for loads of damage which was enough to get aggro a few times.  So I was pretty angry at the time when writing the post, no offense to Caen's Bo monks or anything. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And I also grouped with monks dual wielding stun/root blunt weapons, which was a nightmare.  BUT, I never grouped with loads of warriors wielding Blade of Wars...  I don't know if that situation is common, but I suppose certain people can have a problem with trying to keep aggro off Blade of War warriors in exp groups... /cough  I mean, if I were to see a warrior with a Blade of War in an exp group, I'd tell him/her to keep aggro.

SoE seems to have the idea that because Warrior pure melee skills are better than Knights, the way to compensate this is by giving Knights better weapons to make up for warriors having higher skills.  On the subject of monks, they also have a higher min hit than any other melee, but as far as I can tell their max hit is about the same as anyone else so given high attack values, the difference should not be too big (they still have the weapon advantage though, but then they're supposed to do more damage anyway).<br>
<br>
The ratio 1.5 elemental 2Handers are all pretty much all 2H usable.  Of course this doesn't help people who are not quite there yet, and hopefully will be addressed eventually.  If there are 40/30 1H Knight weapons dropping off trash mobs in elemental planes, then there should be a comparable 40/30 warrior 2H dropping off yard trash.  <br>
<br>
If you're in a group where warrior aggro isn't enough for your members to have a net negative flow of mana I suggest trying a harder area or pull faster.  Last time I checked top of the line Wizards are doing about 150 sustained DPS.  I'm really hard impressed any member of your group can do better than this and 150 DPS per person certainly isn't so much DPS that you can't find enough mobs to kill unless you're in a crowded area.  If you're in a crowded area you'll most likely run out of mobs first anyway regardless of aggro issues so that doesn't matter. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=demorgothdh>DemorgothDH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/29/03 9:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2815.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Monks View on Warriors.</span><hr size=1> Oh yeah, I agree with you there, but you said 'before it's in range', so I was adressing that situation.

<br>
I mean, the game has always been about aggro. Stay farthest as possible! Evade! FD if you aggro!  Use concussion, jolt, wait till 90% to engage, etc.  Raid are about that alot, but so are xp groups.  Think of the group of olds, no mezzer, chaos pull where everyone was attacking their mobs and think what groups are these days, mostly single pull, nearly perfect control.  I really prefer to think that groups these days are able to attain that control because players are better (or suck less) not because verant/sony broke the game aggro wise.<br>
<br>
Just check the lines of spells that cause aggros problem.<br>
<br>
Snare, the most powerfull movement spell ever.  Slow, the most powerfull heal/debuff ever and heals for thousands of points of damage at the start of the fight or in rapid succession.  These spells are huge.  They were made to draw aggro often (they also were mostly tuned down already, used to be worse then that except for ch).  Everquest has it exist today would be an incredibly boring game if aggro control was trivial, if casting these spells would never result in a dead shaman/enchanter/clerics.  <br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned the way aggro work with warriors (with a workable taunt since pop) is (out of the way I know and can imaginge) the way aggro should work imo.  Think team effort, think everyone has to know/accept the fact that they are going to overaggro and possibly die and that when they don't or know what they are doing they are rewarded with more efficienty, less death and a greater sens of accomplishment.<br>
<br>
If knights can really bypass this completly and render nearly all form of aggro control trival, then by all means wake up and NERF THEM NOW.  No tanks should have that kind of aggro control in a balanced environement.  An enchanter? Fine, he's made of paper.  A paladin with 95% the hp of warrior and the same ac?  That's broken.<br>
<br>
By being spellcaster they should obviously be better at &quot;burst&quot; aggro, &quot;burst&quot; dmg and other stuff that spend mana (like wave of marr, long recast, high mana, good effect).  When the exception is now the norm (using low mana stun indefinetly), it's broken.  Fix it please.<br>
