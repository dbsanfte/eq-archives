hail Felodius Sworddancer.<br>
<br>
Hello, Rmog I am Felodious Sworddancer.<br>
A travelling historian and storyteller.<br>
Would you care to hear a [story]? <br>
<br>
&gt;I will care to hear a story.<br>
<br>
I could treat you to a story about an ogre legend!<br>
But perhaps you would like to hear a story about the [gnome] that cried kobold? <br>
<br>
&gt;What is ogre legend?<br>
<br>
Suteng was an ogre champion who walked the land long before the children of Rallos Zek were cursed.<br>
He feared no other creation of Zek and the children of the other gods were to be laughed at.<br>
It was at this time that Rallos Zek was seeking a warrior to unite all of his armies and lead them to battle against the forces of the other [gods].<br>
<br>
&gt;What is gods?<br>
<br>
Suteng was a great combatant, however, he was far too cocky to become a suitable leader and this displeased Rallos Zek.<br>
One who respected no one could not do this.<br>
In order to test Suteng, who had grown far too confident, Rallos had his twin sons craft two swords to test his great ogre warrior's reaction and resolve.<br>
Rallos created a great red scabbard to hold the swords as [well].<br>
<br>
&gt;What is well?<br>
<br>
The swords were like no others.<br>
Each one having an ornately crafted hilt shaped like a dragon head.<br>
Sparkling diamonds, black sapphires and jacinth covered the handles as well.<br>
The razor sharp blades were covered in runes that glowed and [shimmered].<br>
<br>
&gt;What is shimmered?<br>
<br>
Suteng bowed in reverence to his Lord Rallos Zek as he was given the weapons.<br>
Rallos warned Suteng that these weapons might destroy him if he were not truly worthy of leading his armies.<br>
Not heading Rallos' warning that the weapons may be too powerful for him to control, Suteng gathered up a raiding party of his finest warriors to seek [battle]. <br>
<br>
&gt;What is battle?<br>
<br>
They traveled across the lands in search of a suitable target.<br>
Finally they came across a goblin army camped upon the plains.<br>
Suteng sounded his battle charge and his band of ogres charged down the hillside into the army's [encampment].<br>
<br>
&gt;What is encampment?<br>
<br>
With each swipe of their swords the ancient ogres slew many goblins.<br>
Suteng waded through the battle, his new weapons calling out for the blood of more powerful foes.<br>
His bloodlust grew with each kill, his blades spurring him onward.<br>
Ignoring his own wounds, he fought on until the goblin army was dead or scattered to the [winds].<br>
<br>
&gt;What is winds?<br>
<br>
Only the hulking ogres of old remained standing on the blood-soaked plains.<br>
Suteng felt like a god and that would be his downfall.<br>
He looked to his companions, the great and powerful ogre warriors with whom he had killed and shed blood. Suteng felt nothing but contempt for them.<br>
They, of course, were weaker then, or at least so he [thought].<br>
<br>
&gt;What is thought?<br>
<br>
Without a second thought, Suteng stabbed the ogre nearest to him in the neck with one of the swords.<br>
His body moved like a whirlwind of death, slaughtering his own companions.<br>
The ogres fought back valiantly, no match for Suteng with his enchanted [blades].<br>
<br>
&gt;What is blades?<br>
<br>
The laughter of Rallos Zek boomed across the plains as the lord of war appeared before Suteng and took the weapons from the ogre's hands.<br>
The swords slashed into Suteng swiftly, killing him where he stood.<br>
The lord of war spoke to the remaining ogres on the battlefield, explaining why he had [tested] Suteng.<br>
<br>
&gt;What is tested?<br>
<br>
He also told them each that if they wished to wield the weapons, they would have to seek them out for they would be broken into pieces and spread across Norrath.<br>
The blades would not be whole again until a suitable warrior found the pieces, and gained the red [scabbard].<br>
<br>
&gt;What is scabbard?<br>
<br>
The lord of war handed the smallest ogre the great red scabbard and told him that it was his charge, and the charge of his family, to test any warrior who wished to have it.<br>
<br>
&gt;hail Kargek Redblade.<br>
<br>
Kargek Redblade looks up from his forge and says<br>
<br>
Hello there, can I help you?<br>
<br>
Your eyes are drawn to an extremely large red sword scabbard strapped to his back with no sword in it.<br>
Kargek speaks again, <br>
<br>
I said, can I help you or do you need help from Wenden?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Who is Wenden?<br>
<br>
Kargek Redblade points to the other side of the forge and says<br>
<br>
Wenden is my partner.<br>
He is standing right over there.<br>
If it is a question about a weapon, he will probably have the answers.<br>
<br>
&gt;What is large red sword scabbard?<br>
<br>
Kargek Redblade turns to look at you and says,<br>
<br>
It is a family heirloom.<br>
I might tell you the story behind it if you do me a little favor.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;What is favor?<br>
<br>
An associate of mine is wandering somewhere in the Feerrott.<br>
His name is Oknoggin Stonesmacker.<br>
If you will deliver this note to him, I would appreciate it. <br>
<br>
&gt;hail Oknoggin Stonesmacker<br>
Yoo leave me 'lone!<br>
Oknoggin Stonesmacker snatches the note from your hand and rips it open with his large hands. <br>
<br>
You take dis to Kargek.<br>
He want!<br>
<br>
Oknoggin says, as he throws a tiny lute at you. <br>
<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Thank you for delivering the note to my associate.<br>
Take this book - it will tell you a little of the history of the old scabbard.<br>
If you would like to own the scabbard , seek out my younger brother Tenal and give him the book.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Written by Kargek Redblade the Seventh.<br>
<br>
Long ago our ancestor Thegrek the first was on the battlefield as a companion of Surtelk.<br>
With his might and quickness he slew many goblin warriors that day as did Surtelk wuth the help of his magical blades.<br>
When the great warrior went insane and was slain by our lord Rallos Zek the blades of Surtelk were spread across Norrath until a true warrior who could control the blades came forth.<br>
Rallos Zek himself took the great Red Scabbard and handed it to Thegrek.<br>
It was to be his charge, and the charge of our family to hold the scabbard until a true warrior stepped forward to be tested.<br>
<br>
As a son of the Redblade family it is your duty to protect the Scabbard and test those who think they are worthy of holding it.<br>
<br>
&gt;hail Tenal Redblade.<br>
<br>
What brings you to my home, Xxxxx ?<br>
Do you seek knowledge of Rallos Zek and the great wars to come?<br>
<br>
<br>
So, you know my brother Kargek.<br>
He is weak and does not believe the legend that our family was chosen by Rallos Zek to bear the great scabbard.<br>
Yet he still holds it.<br>
Very well, I shall give you the first test since my 'dear' brother seems to have forgotten it.<br>
Travel to the fortress where the children of Rallos were first cursed by the Rathe and bring me the heart of one of the goblins who have made it their new home.<br>
Do not return without the heart of your foe and this war totem. <br>
<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Tenal Redblade<br>
Very good, you have wreaked havoc on your foes in the ancient land of the giants.<br>
Rallos Zek must have guided your blade.<br>
<br>
Tenal's voice is suddenly silenced and you feel as if your body is frozen. <br>
From Tenal's lips issues a voice that is not his own,<br>
<br>
'Bring this mortal the scales of the children of Veeshan.<br>
The red and green as well as my war totem.<br>
I will guide your blade.'<br>
<br>
Your movement returns as Tenal falls to the ground, gasping for breath. <br>
<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Tenal Redblade looks at you oddly as you hand him the scales.<br>
<br>
'What are..?<br>
You have done well, mortal, and you will be rewarded if you are truly brave.<br>
Travel to the Plane of Hatred and slay the ancient bard who lives there.<br>
Do not return without his hand and this mark or you will never be a true warlord.'<br>
<br>
Tenal drops to the ground as the last words leave his lips. <br>
<br>
Tenal Redblade looks horrified as you give him the hand of the Maestro of Rancor and show him the mark of the sword.<br>
The godlike voice returns,<br>
<br>
'You have done well to acquire this.<br>
One final task must be completed before you hold the red scabbard in your mortal hands.<br>
<br>
Tenal reaches out and hands you a note.<br>
<br>
'Take this note and a wingblade of the spiriocs to Kargek.<br>
When he receives them, I will speak to you one last time.' <br>
<br>
(Kargek Redblade)<br>
What is this?<br>
A note from my brother?<br>
Thank you for the gift as well.'<br>
<br>
Kargek reads the note and hands you the huge sword hilt.<br>
Your mind is filled with the sound of battle and a voice.<br>
<br>
Place the ancient sword blade, ancient blade, finely crafted dragon head hilt and the jeweled dragon head hilt into the scabbard to receive your rewards.<br>
If you think you are worthy, place your rewards into the scabbard and see what havoc you can unleash on the world. <br>
<br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
<br>
Grats on your epic  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
