Yes, knights and Knights can control agro alot better than warriors who have to pray for a proc. But whose fault is that, really? The casters who tash, slow, nuke too soon? The cleric who heals at the beginning of a fight instead of doing maintenance heals after a fight? In a good group, this does not happen often.<br>
<br>
I have played a ranger to 60; and now my warrior is close to a similar level. Do you know how many times my ranger was passed over for groups because they needed a tank? I can't count the times really. For the first 6 months of Kunark, I could not buy a group because the perception was rangers were broken. Fact was, they had changed but were not broken, except for one thing.. ability to dump agro was needed. VI gave rangers jolt and rangers learned to manage their agro because their role had changed.<br>
<br>
Rangers also hurt themselves alot by whining. Word got around that rangers sucked, and it took about 6 months for that perception to change. If we, as warriors spread the word that we suck because one skill is broken, well we are hurting ourselves more than helping ourselves.<br>
<br>
Right now, as it stands, maybe the perfect group does not include warriors.. but warriors are interchangable. They can fill any melee slot, except a rogue. <br>
<br>
Do you think a group who wants to get started is going to wait for a SK or a Knight to come along, instead of just getting started? <br>
<br>
We have to have a paladin to have an exp group???? a cleric maybe, but a paladin or SK???? I think you are giving them to much credit.<br>
<br>
I have never seen a group say.. lets not fill this last slot with that warrior, lets wait on a rogue, ranger, or monk. Now I have heard them say lets wait on a shaman or chanter of course; because slow is needed so badly at higher levels.<br>
<br>
That being said, I just don't like the whining I have seen here. Other classes have endured just as much as warriors have, and even more. So its time to suck it up a bit. Stop whining, but instead provide a logical case as to why we need to be fixed.<br>
<br>
If you get passed over for a group because a paladin or SK is LFG at the same time as you, live with it, and don't whine. Because you are only propgating a false notion that warriors are completely broken, which they aren't. You would be hurting your own ability to find a group in the long run.<br>
<br>
Instead lets provide Verant a way to fix the one thing wrong with warriors. Taunt..<br>
<br>
If there is anything that needs to be fixed with warriors, its the ability to taunt. To fix it, an AA that allows the taunt cap to be raised to to 300 max, and another AA that allows taunt to refresh faster would work. Also a new mega taunt would work, one that would hit every time its used (a taunt like a lure so to speak), but lets say only refreshes every 3 minutes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lets help ourselves instead of hurting ourselves here..<br>

<br>
If warriors complain about a lack of desirability in PoP then they're no better than rangers were in Kunark.   Be silent and hope VI will fix what's broken with the class.<br>
<br>
I would counter with:<br>
<br>
1. Rangers WERE broken in Kunark<br>
<br>
2. The &quot;one thing that's broken with the class, Taunt&quot; is EXACTLY what people are complaining about.   We're demonstrating it's impact in the current game in terms of mana spent, grouping dynamics, ancillary party member heals, etc.<br>
<br>
3. If you think that if you stay quiet long enough, hopefully people will recognize the problem on their own and fix it, then you have a *lot* to learn about life.   When my new car is not working properly, I take it to to the dealer and tell them about it.   If they deny that it's a problem, then I prove it to them, if they do nothing, then I get louder, pointing out relevant documentation, if that doesn't work, the final step is to go away from the parts department, into the sales showroom and ask somewhat loudly of the sales manager &quot;But didn't you tell me that this thing had a warranty?   I thought I was buying a mechanically sound car from you&quot;    Sales types don't like aggrivated customers implying in front of potential customers that the sales force is a bunch of liars, they ensure that my problems get fixed quite quickly.  I almost *always* get my problems fixed, and never by hoping that there will eventually be a recall, and staying a good little customer. <br>
<br>
4. If you think that by pretending that things are fine will prevent other potential group members from learning that taunt sucks (actually not taunt, but the generation of aggro) and that we represent a grave danger to their characters in experience groups in EQ, I will say, I want no part in your little charade.   People already know, they've known for some time, and it's disingenuous to pretend.<br>

A group looking for an healer will go for a druid most of the time if no cleric are available but the clear first choice with similar gear would always be the cleric.  <br>
<br>
You could argue that if everything is going well that a druid can bring more to the table then a cleric with the use of snare/harmony and better nukers/dot (similar to saying that a warrior will do more dps then a paladin or provide better tanking).  But when someone dies in your group and you have a druid, you wish you had gotten a cleric instead.<br>
<br>
In the overrall picture of class balance though, I think the warrior taunt issue is a pretty small one.  If you look at experience group, the disparity of enchanter, druids, some mages and necro using charm to aa xp is 100 times more broken then whatever disparity that could exist between tanks classes.  I've been rejected out of many more groups &quot;cause they were using charm pets to tanks and didnt need a pitifull melee doing 100dps with only 9k hp&quot; and I'm one of the uber warrior out there.  <br>
<br>
After that you have raid where warrior do not too bad cause mobs hit so hard, but where in some very important key fights most melee are forced to watch from far away looking at 1 ranger doing the combined dps of the 5 monks, the 3 rogues and the 3 warriors non mtanking.  This issue is more general I guess.<br>
<br>
If they eventually come around and look at things like paladin stuns maybe they will nerf them which will close the gap at aggro somewhat but there are things that plague melee that are much worse then that imo.<br>

Warriors are still picked just as often as Pal/SK is, and if you get into groups and hold agro well, you will be remembered as a good tank.<br>
<br>
I also think Thor is absolutely correct about the whole necro/mage/enc charming... whenever servers fall, the first person in BoT is the guild leader of one of the stronger guilds on the server.  he 3 boxes an enc, cleric, and bard... and he uses these chars to kill all the named as soon as they pop, via enchanter charming pet to tank.  I think this, and necros turning Crypt of Decay into a train highway by trying to solo with their charmed pets, are much bigger issues than us not getting groups because we don't hold agro. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193009"> Grendon's Stuff </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
My feeling is that this problem, taunt, is something similar to an annoyance. Like a window will not go down or up. Yeah its a pain, but you can still drive around, no problems.<br>
<br>
But implying warriors are just broken severely because of taunt issues will only hurt us more that help us.<br>
<br>
There is something wrong, but its not crippling the entire ship. <br>
<br>
Maybe someone can put together a log of some sort that demonstrates the problem? With physical proof that is hard to deny, perhaps they will look at it.<br>
<br>
A log that shows how after a stun or other spell, the mob jumps on a knight a very high percentage of the time..<br>
<br>
And how when we taunt, that the agro sometimes happens, sometimes does not.. Do not use proc weapons in this log either, as we whould not have to pray for a proc to gain agro. Make sure your weapon is as good or better than the paladin or Sk you fight with.<br>
<br>
If you can prove that paladins and SKs truly taunt at will, while warrior taunt only works maybe 45% of the time, I think we have a case to bring. It will show we are less useful as what we are supposed to be, meat shields.<br>

<br>
A warrior with decent equip + aa's can own xp camps while a warrior with no aa and levels to 65 with poor equip will find groups harder and hard to come by.<br>
<br>
In VI's vision(TM) I dont think warriors are broken but they depend on equip far more than pallies and sk's do.  I think aa's compensate for poor equip and building a group around you that can help you compensate.<br>
<br>
example: tricketers animation,nights dark terror and voice of terris are 2 examples of how a warrior can increase aggro in an ex group.  These both help.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Where you dont have the stats/equip/aa to hold aggro on a given mob, YOU need to look at what is available to help, imo. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Other classes have noticed this themselves and on the whole are less willing to group with warriors as a result.<br>
<br>
I don't think there's much you can do to manage their perceptions at this point; they've already discussed it extensively on their class boards and reached their own conclusions.<br>

It is not the warriors job to keep aggro.  It is the slowers, stunners, nukers job to not get aggro.  it is the warriors job to take the damage.<br>
<br>
That being said, aggro will switch to the caster in some cases.  the ability of a pally to stun to get aggro back is a crutch that is overused by overnukers, nuking clerics, etc...<br>
<br>
If you wait for the warrior to get enough aggro, you wont grab aggro with a nuke.  warriors can withstand the onslaught until they do get enough aggro.<br>
<br>
IF a warrior get aggro, and the taunt hits, they have aggro.  its just how taunt works (lets not get into the debate) and problem solved.  if the taunt doesnt hit, a shammy can withstand the beating until either damage, a successful taunt, or a good proc will grab aggro back.<br>
<br>
Yes, pallies have the ability to get aggo quickly, BUT as i said, its a crutch, and if leaned on too much, the casters will get lazy, and :LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.<br>

Replace the word &quot;warrior&quot; with the word &quot;Tank&quot; then see the problem. <br>

I can remember back in the day when casters biggest problems were resists and mana management. Nowadays it is aggro. The game has changed from what once it was, and yet people are still stuck in a four expansion old mentality. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krazrussian>KrazRussian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/28/03 11:58:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Knights and SK's getting chosen over warriors in exp gro</span><hr size=1> <br>

I don't think it's fair to compare picking clerics over druids versus hybrids over warriors.  Clerics have rez which is not replaceable by any other classes (well Paladins can rez, but people still want 96% over 90%).  In a well-tuned group with a cleric, deaths are unlikely and maybe your Hybrid will still lower the chance of it happening but it's low enough that it's no big deal, and if it does happen you always have rez.  If you don't have a cleric, even if your chance of dying is still low, you're still looking at a big setback when someone dies unless you've a cleric closeby. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=choppinml>ChoppinML</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/2/03 8:47:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   aye</span><hr size=1> The is a constant grind of AAXP, making the most AAXP in the shortest time is what many see as the best.<br>
Killing things fast and furious results in out of whack aggro, saying people should not overaggro and let the warrior build hate is like telling them to exp slower.<br>
<br>
So they pick SKs or PAL tanks, much less aggro problems. The mobs die fast and exp is flowing.<br>
<br>
Get the picture ? It wont help complaining that others slow or nuke etc they want exp fast and steady and not &quot;careful godforbid I overaggro&quot; fights that take twice as long with a war than a pal / sk.<br>

I have seen a SK hold aggro on 3 mobs in any given tier2 exp zone (like PoV or BoT or Tactics or HoH) and take full advantage of mag / druid and cleric DS. Can you say fast exp ?<br>
<br>
I think SoE will not be getting around giving taunt a hate increase like a Enraging Blow proc (at level 65, it should scale with the levels of course) and eventually introduce an AA that reduces the reuse-time of taunt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lyenaerz>Lyenae RZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/2/03 9:49:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: aye</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yes, knights and Knights can control agro alot better than warriors who have to pray for a proc.

Adding a warrior to your group is like babysitting a 3 year old retard. Everyone needs to go out of their way to make the retard perform well, which means everyone in the group performs less effectively. And that kills the xp flow. <br>

A good group is the one that makes the most xp per second.

<br>
I play a pally and thought I would add a few things .. I know Im badly outnumbered and &quot;The Enemy&quot; here .. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .. and Im sure Ill get some flames and pally bashing but here goes.<br>
<br>
Pally taunt is very good, and pally stuns generate a lot of hate.  However there is more to tanking than generating aggro, and there is more to maintaining aggro than simply hitting taunt.<br>
<br>
Tanking is about aggro/taunt, damage mitigation, HP's, facing, distance, position and timing.<br>
<br>
As the tank you need to make sure the layout of the area, and where people are situated is to your liking.  Quite simply, everything revolves around the tank, and you are the guy who should be setting things up.<br>
<br>
Ive seen warriors tank very effectivly both in BoT and PoV with pretty standard gear.  Im not saying that warrior taunt is as good as pally SK taunt, but I am saying slightly less aggro doesnt have to slow down xp.  Warriors have better mitigation and HP's, and with good position and by managing the pull, or puller to best advantage I have seen very effective tanking by warriors in these groups.<br>
<br>
Believe me the same slowers that you see getting ressed give a pally tank the same level of stress.  The difference is we have a stun that might save the idiots life, however it doesnt make him any better at what he does, and I wont hesitate to tell them when I want the slow to land.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you guys get the EB weapons, and one of these generates heaps of taunt, and so long as your slower has some brains will work fine.<br>
<br>
Personally in an xp group warrior is fine addition, and I am happy to let them tank (if they know what they are doing, and slower is ok).  In areas where adds are common it lets me do my preferred job of managing adds, and keeping things under control and flowing smoothly.<br>
<br>
However I do like to tank, and know I can make a damn fine job of it.<br>
<br>
I personally think we should collectively (as tanks) be screaming about these damn enchanter and mage pets which are ruining the game, and destroying the need for ALL tanks.<br>

My question is this - what did the group do the next round of combat when the main tank died ?<br>
<br>
Level 59 yard trash in PoV max hits for 434 damage.  Doubles, triple-hits... that's a whole lot of damage on a character that can't possibly have more than 10k hitpoints.<br>

First of all I am a 62 cleric with a few AA's under my belt(only about 40 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and I have been flagged for PoV/PoS for a little while.  I group in second tier plane alot, now with an exception here and there, like oh say a 65 pally with 300 aa and over 7k hp unbuffed as being the only tank option we have, I like to go with warriors.  I REALLY like warriors with AE taunt.  This will answer your question about a warrior being able to hold down agro of 3 slowed mobs, hell yes they can.  I have seen it done even without AE taunt, but I have grouped with a few that have AE taunt and let me tell you it is great to have in the group.  For the warrior to be able to go to the top of the hate list of all mobs in a certian radius, priceless.<br>
Now for the agro stealing issue at hand.  If I have a warrior in my group who knows what they are doing, and most of them do, there is NO reason for the pally/sk to cast to no end just to get agro.  It is going to cost me more mana to keep two of you alive than just one.  Also the more you pong a mob the greater my chances are of getting my arse beat when I toss a heal out on you all.  Since I have witnessed this too many times I like to warn the pally/sk that if they keep casting 10 spells to take agro, like oh lets say stunning non casting mobs that don't need to be stunned, I am going to forget where my heal key is and they can go to town healing with their dinky little spells because I am not going to sit around while they try to compaire penis size with the warrior.<br>
Is that harsh?  Yeah but I also do a fair ammount of higher end raiding in my guild and have witnessed something from the newer SK/Pally but mostly pallys that we get in...they want to take agro from our MT on raids.  Let me be the first to say SCREW THAT!  I am not going to wipe a raid because a pally_01 got his panties in a wad over the warrior 5 lvls higher than him getting to tank on the raid.  If you want to pull that stuff on my raid I will TL you out so fast your head will spin when you hit the ground.  If you wanted to be MT, make a warrior.  There is one reason that pally's and sk's will NEVER and I mean NEVER be MT on raids and such, a little thing called the warrior's defensive disc.  This is a fact and most people at the higher end of the game will agree with it.<br>
So from my point of view when you agro hogs try to take over you waste my mana and my time.  Will I pick a warrior over a pally/sk to tank in my group?  Yes, I will, unless there are dire circumstances, but like I said 90% of warrior's know what they are doing.  Be nice to the clerics don't waste their mana, and if not being MT insults your manhood let me know I will send you some flowers with a nice little card enclosed stating, &quot;Sorry, you picked your pally/sk to play, better luck next time you roll up a toon.&quot;<br>
