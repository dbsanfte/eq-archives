And yes, each time they patch we shouldn't expect things to be perfect right away.  But the patch that went into effect yesterday was unacceptable.

What we cannot accept is when they fail to test their changes, and consequently give us a product that doesn't work.  <br><br>Simply put, someone needs to shape up, plan accordingly, and start taking some responsibility when things like this happen. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=283443" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.steelindustriesinc.com/pics/taunt.gif" width=288 height=118 border="0"></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uheugel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heugel</A> at: 9/27/02 8:18:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ujustfive.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Just Five</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 312<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/27/02 7:00:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1330.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yo Absor</span><hr size=1> Woah, chill folks.

The entire thing was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Just leave the game alone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br><br>Remember way<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> yyyy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> back yonder when patches had a purpose? Patches were &quot;bug fixes&quot; or &quot;added content&quot;. Sure; I can't disagree that we've had a lot of new content added since the days mobs in CT dropped Rubicite. Patches back than were ok..had a few minor details .. but hey i'd wager 95+% of the content worked.<br><br>Scroll through time to the introduction of Kunark. God..patches were enormous and I think Kunark was the birth of &quot;oh boy they broke bards again&quot; phrase. Patch..Patch..Patch..hmm, what's happening with the patches? Patches were intoroduced to fix existing patches. Than more Patches were added because the patcher program designed to upgrade patches didn't patch correctly. So..throw on another patch. Kind of looks like that tire tube that you drag behind your boat water-tubing with 50 billion patches on it; each designed and placed to cover existing patches made to fix previous patches to hold the air in. Take EQ now; and the wind of the newness of content and the engine is so deflated by &quot; oh boy patch day..wonder what's wrong now or going to be. &quot;. Should have a board up in Vegas somewhere to place odds. It's saddening to see a game where I have seen take it first infant steps into existance deteriorate into a supersized bowl of nothing it originally was or meant. I mean..Take a poll of what people's first thoughts are on patches..<br><br>a. oh wow new content !<br>b. oh god what's broken now?<br>c. hmm no sense in logging on today because it's going to get repatched anyways.<br><br>Patches no longer hold any kind of anticipation of variety or fixes; nor does the dev team hold IMHO any kind of credibility towards being skilled and capable producers of providing accurate coding to incorporate new design into something of the magnitude of EQ. Sorry, don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings on this; but it's like anything else. Send your car to a mechanic enough to fix a tire and end up with 14 new distributors and 3 carb's and a new exhaust and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> still</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> roll out of the shop on a flat tire kinda leaves the end consumer at the question<br><br>&quot; Why?&quot;<br><br>If you're going to fix something...<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> fix</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> something. Don't go changing the exhaust on someone needing a new tire. The list of credible and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> multiply tested and executed flaws</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is beyond the boundaries of space and time and instead of just trying to draw your customer bases' attention towards the new shiny thing; why not either trim off the old and useless parts of what isn't working; or just take the time and fix it.<br><br>Sure, mudflation and whatever &quot;l33t&quot; term applied to the elder years of EQ now are a valid enough excuse for the troubled performance and need to direct attention to whatever level of the game your primary income of players reside at; but if you know truthfully that the tech side of developing this game is not in capable hands; than just stop trying to kick start it back up. Show it a little bit of respect and just bury it in the yard where it belongs.<br><br>Seriously; I hate griping like this. Makes for nothing but wasted bandwidth in most people's eyes; including my own. I'd much rather just go playing the game again and know once and for all there's no sense in even feeling anything outside of the game because; quite frankly; no one is ever listening.<br><br>I'm only one voice; one person; one bill per check-mark on your earned income per month of Sony/VI/whoever.
