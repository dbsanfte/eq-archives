Keep in mind that this is the Warrior epic you're going after and not a Druid epic.  It's wrong to compare the two.  The Druid epic follows a theme of curing the world of corruption while the Warrior epic follows a stradegy and tactics theme.  To conqure Sever a Warrior needs both of these traits.  So suck it up, it's not eazy.  I will never say it's eazy, but it is possible.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Study Your Competition</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Right now there is a problem with the Warrior Epic Quest known as the Jagged Blade of War introduced into EverQuest with the Kunark expansion.  An alternate advancement ability given to the Wizard class durring the Shadows of Luclin (two expansions after Kunark) has caused over farming of the mob that drops the Green Dragon Scales.  For a Warrior to beat this problem he or she must prepare him/her self to beat the competition.  Defeating Wizards at a game they have been playing for almost a year now requires both outstanding stradegy and superior tactics.<br>
<br>
Wizards are mobile.  A Wizard can get him/her self to almost any location in the game in under 6 minutes given the right atmosphere.  Emerald Jungle is a port zone for the Wizard class and thus a Wizard can be in Emerald Jungle almost instantly.  There is a flaw with their mobility however where Sever is concerned.  Sever requires at the bare minumum at least four Wizards to critical strike their manaburn ability in order to kill him.  Most manaburn wizards will not try Sever without at least 5 and sometimes 6 Wizards in their team.  This leaves an advantage.<br>
<br>
After timing the Wizards on my server the average response time to any manaburn target is 7 to 9 minutes.  That 7 to 9 minutes is the window of opportunity.  This time frame may differ from server to server but it is imparitive that the questing Warrior study the movements and response times of the manaburn teams on their own servers.  Here are a few tips on how to learn the habbits of the manaburn team on your server.<br>
<br>
- Know their targets.<br>
The most common in Kunark are Sever, Talendor, and VS.  While tracking Sever and Talendor is a little difficult VS is rather eazy.  Get to know the spawn times of each and don't try to go after them yourself at first.  Instead wait for the Manaburners to show up.<br>
<br>
- Know their names.<br>
Train yourself to recognise the team wherever they are.  Know the zones they hunt in and even try to relate yourself to them.<br>
<br>
- Know the zones they like to hunt in.<br>
Familiarize yourself with where the MB wizards hunt.  Alot of them are AE members and hangout in places like the Deep, Sebilis, Fungus Grove, and CT.  Hell even ask to pull for them from time to time.  Get to know them personally.<br>
<br>
- Know their guilds.<br>
This is probably one of your best tools.  Know when their guilds raid if they raid and how often.  Most MB teams are from larger guilds and have commitments that will prevent them from going after certain targets at certain times.<br>
<br>
- Know their response times.<br>
Track them.  Ask questions in /ooc.  Do /who commands consistantly and time them from the first moment one Wizard zones in to the minute you see five in zone.  As soon as they have 4 or 5 consider their job done, and yours as well.<br>
<br>
Only after knowing your competition inside and out can you start planning your stradegy.  Without being confident about your competition you are always unarmed against them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Study your target</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Study Sever to the T'.  Know her window of spawn times.  Find her up and track the last kill.  Track the next kill.  Get to know when your window is to start tracking her like the back of your hand.  Sever likes to roam after she spawns.  She has a path she likes to follow.  Her path is no different than any other mob that spawns in the same area.  Study the mobs and their pathing patterns after they spawn.<br>
<br>
Sever is a 32k encounter.  She has an AE that stuns and fears.  She has a disease/poison based dot that does not do alot of damage.  Most of her damage is melee, and she is main tankable.  If you find the opportunity get in close and take a few hits and even a death.  Know how much she is going to clock you for.<br>
<br>
Sever has a huge aggro radius and will require at the bare minum sow/soe or a bard to pull her.  Preferably a Bard will pull at max range.  If your puller falls to close inside her radius it's all over.  One stunn and Sever owns up on whoever pulls.  This may take alot of practice and you may have to even try it yourself several times to get it right.<br>
<br>
Find a comfortable spot to pull to.  Most commonly pull spot is close to the FoB zone.  This area is clear and will give pleanty of opportunity for a clean kill.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Create your team</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Design an efficiant team based on effectiveness not quickness in the kill.  A group of 7 to 9 solid characters is eazy to mobilize and can effectively take out Sever.  Your team needs to relate to eachother and play at the same time durring the spawn window.  Your job is to keep your team members informed, trained, and mobile.<br>
<br>
60 Warrior (main tank)<br>
60 Cleric w/ 4.3k mana pool (main healer)<br>
60 Rogue w/ epic or better (damage)<br>
60 Magician (Mod Rods, Damage)<br>
55 - 60 Warrior (secondary tank)<br>
55 - 60 Druid (cleric cover, mobility)<br>
55 - 60 Shaman (buffs, resists, cover heals)<br>
55 - 60 Bard (puller, damage)<br>
55 - 60 Wizard/Druid (damage, mobility)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Training</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Armed with the information about both your target and competition you can start training your team once you have them formed.  Your job at this point is to educate your team members about your competiton, your environment, and your target.  They will need to know exactly what is required of them before they can become effective.<br>
<br>
Timing is imperitive.  Train your team to gather, gate, buff and pull at least 30 seconds faster than your competition.  Sever is a race and if you treat it this way you can train yourself to win it.<br>
<br>
Do mock spawns in EJ.  Send tells, or announce that your target is up and call out for support.  Time your team and push them.  Let them know that you see one or two members of the competition in the zone.  Push them to get in and ready to go as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Trial and Error</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Sever is a difficult encounter with a small raid force.  Be prepared to fail and lose the spawn a couple times.  Your goal durring this phase is not to win right now.  Instead what you want to do is develp tactics against the encounter.  Get to know the weaknesses of both your target and your group.  Refine your weaknesses and turn them into strengths.  Try, Try, Try and Try again and eventually you'll get it right.<br>
<br>
Hopefully you'll be able to take Sever out on the first attempt or the second.  Don't be suprized however if you end up trying her up to 4 or 5 times.  Sever is a nasty pull and requires alot of patience to deal with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Conclusion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Sever is doable with a small group that is mobile and has good DPS.  You can do it.  Until VI and Sony decide that this encounter needs to be changed it is the responsibilty of the questing Warrior to find a way around the current problems.  The problems are not going away.  Face them, get to know them, and eventually beat them.  If it's worth it to you then it's not impossible.  You just have to set your mind on winning and you will win.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Critisism</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Warrior epic is not all that great, and may not even be worth the effort.  The effort envolved in accomplishing this goal can only be analysied by those willing to do it.  If your guild is able to provide better, or if you feel that it's not worth the investment then this quest is not for you. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193604" target=new><font size=5 face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color=darkred>Keelz Neversleep</font></a><BR><font size=2 face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><I>

What part about creating and training a small team to help you with the encounter did'nt you understand?  You can't expect to take down Sever by yourself and you can't just sit on your bumb in EJ and wait for her to spawn expecting people to show up to help you.  All you did that morning was waste your time.<br>
<br>
The only thing laughable about your post is...  your post.  Get off your ass and &quot;work&quot; for it.  You're a Warrior not a Druid. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193604" target=new><font size=5 face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color=darkred>Keelz Neversleep</font></a><BR><font size=2 face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><I>

I am a member in good standing in a middle tier guild (Twilight Avengers of Prexus).  My guild mates knew what I was doing and why so they started to arrive quickly.  The Leaders in my guild knew how important it was to me and started to help.  After about 45 minutes we tried Sev the first time and wiped.  Rezzed and reset near FoB and beat him.<br>
<br>
This all happened a few months ago and a few things have changed since then but some valuable points can still be learned here.  First and foremost be stubborn but polite.  The polite will cut down interference and maybe get you some help.  Second if you are in a guild work with the Leaders in the guild for support if you can.  I had three or more people from four different guilds come and help, including a MB wizard though he did not have MB up for Sev.  This all happened during fairly heavy play times so it is possible to get Sev without paying an outrageous sum of plat to someone wearing a robe.  Just be stubborn but polite.<br>

<br>
Don't quite know for sure where Sev Spawns ( 0,0 ? ); but when porting into EJ head to the wall and follow it with the wall on your left side until you get to the stairway and an open plateau area. From there Sev can be tracked by a ranger or druid friend ( yes, they really do come in handy for times liek these; and I owe every single one of my guild's druids and rangers a big thank-you for always being mobile and checking on him when I wasn't there ). I was in EJ for about a month and 2 weeks before we ended up getting him and not losing to team MB. It's still fun nonetheless to feel the rush of adrenaline to have competition liek that; no matter how rediculously overpowered some people are to that encounter. <br>
<br>
Also; when I got my GDS the word was out on the server amongst my friends and I think personally I remember about 50 people showing up ( <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) who wanted to see Sev Dead and the scale in my hands.<br>
