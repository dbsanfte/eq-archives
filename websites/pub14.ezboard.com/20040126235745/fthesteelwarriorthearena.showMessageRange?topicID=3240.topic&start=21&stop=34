There's one called &quot;cover&quot; up there that gives you 20% extra mitigation for all of 12 seconds.  Whoopee.  Defensive disc is something like 40% for 3 minutes.  <br>
<br>
there's also this -- <br>
&quot;level 55: Pain Tolerance: Increase Absorb Damage by 160 (L55) to 180 (L65) (buff will last 3 min, warrior self rune) (self)&quot;<br>
<br>
So it's just a 180 pt rune?  Big deal.  <br>
<br>
Except for uber guildiers fighting massive mobs that defensive doesn't last long enough for anyway (and they don't want to do tank switches or can't)... losing defensive discipline will be a huge blow to many warriors and their guilds.  It was one reason in a lot of mid range guilds to still tank raid targets with a warrior.  The guild might not be experienced enough to handle it without the defensive, so they send in the warrior and practice their aggro control to pull off the raid successfully.  With that gone, I think it would be all the more reason to use a knight instead.<br>
<br>
The 4% or so bonus mitigation currently on test for warriors won't be enough to make up for it.  I know for a long time some warriors have said &quot;give us a mitigation bonus at all times in place of this damn defensive disc&quot;.  I think they had a larger bonus in mind though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tudana>Tudana</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/03 11:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3240.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: _</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I like Hrogdor`s thinking that some funny stuff.<br>

It's everything that an insult should be.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>level 20: Provoke: Increase Hitpoints by 200 (looks like a warrior self heal to me) <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is useful... AT level 20... at level 40 it's a joke and at level 60 it's a waste of time.  It'll probably have a 9 hour reuse time on it anyway, if SOE is true to form.<br>
<br>
These 1, 2 and 3 tick abilities will be just as worthless as every discipline other than defensive currently is.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I don't mind them adding the effects, but if anyone thinks that increasing agro by 10% for 3 ticks is gonna do anything other than just delay the amount of time it takes for the monk to take aggro by 2-3 hits or MAYBE avoid a mob from chasing the caster who just nuked or healed down 1 in 20 times, they are sorely mistaken.  The stuns look nice, if they can be used at any time and don't require melee range... but I'm guessing that it won't help dick when the stupid friggin chanter is running around in circles, so you can't even GET within melee range for more than a quarter of a second at a time.  Of course, the group could have just chosen a Paladin, who can stun from anywhere, even if he doesn't see the mob and after he hits it with cease, if that don't do it, he can do desist just to grab more aggro.<br>
<br>
The Pain tolerance would be nice if they simply made that &quot;Increase AC by&quot; instead of some lame damage absorption, since every mob at that level hits for upwards of 160 at that level anyway.  So you avoid 1 hit... what about the other 3 that just came in within a second of that.  Yeah, the 3 minute duration is useful on something that will last all of a quarter second.  Since I can use one ability that will increase my hp by 200, why would I waste any time with a damage absorption effect?<br>
<br>
The only one that looks to be worth a damn is Infallible and there is no duration listed.  At least the 'parry every blow' disc out there is worth something.<br>
<br>
Slice don't look bad though and neither do Barrier or Cover.  I'm not saying they look to be saving the day, they just seem to be the only 3 of them that seem to not look like a waste of time.<br>
<br>
Now Rage... can anyone say &quot;STUPID&quot;?  Increase my damage MODIFIER by 30% but decrease mitigation by 20%?  Ouch.  So I'm gonna take significantly MORE damage, but my primary (and only primary) weapon is going to do 10 more damage per swing?

Instead they are seeing that they have a new system to learn, with a tremendous number of potentially useless abilities (notice the word potentially), and a %4 damage mitigation.  Most reasonable people are keeping an open mind for the moment because this is still in the test stages, but at first glance it looks like someone is giving us a bandaid for our severed leg.  Oh wait we have to apply the glue to the bandaid?<br>
The people at this point who play warriors (or in fact any pure melee) do so because they love their characters.  People are upset because Sony has left their class to rot for months and now when Sony is finally doing something about it, it appears to them to be halfassed, poorly thought out, AND requires people to relearn how to play their class.<br>
Personally, while not exactly excited about the new skills I've seen so far or the number of openings per fight, I am remaining objective untill its at least out of testing.  But if these new abilities DO turn out to be useless as some are proclaiming expect to hear me b#$!$ing with the rest of them, not because I hate playing my class but because I love it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaldanm>kaldanm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/5/03 1:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3240.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warrior changes discussionq</span><hr size=1> PROVOKE :<br>

I was hoping that their melee upgrade was just that a melee upgrade, not something that makes us hybrids, cause i'm sorry that is what this is doing.  @#%$ is @#%$, no matter how you stack it, no matter how you slice it, endurance is nothing more than mana, these skills are esentially spells and &quot;training manuals&quot; are nothing more than parchments.  This aint a kid gettin a $50 jacket when he wanted teh 100$ one, this is mom and dad promising the kid a jacket for months and months and giving him a tee-shirt, then makeing a big deal out of it like this T-shirt is atcualy going to do something to keep you warm in the winter.<br>
<br>
They wanna give us &quot;utility&quot; well there are utility tanks, they are called pally's and sk's, but they dont even bother to use this skills, they just use spells as a form of taunt(one that atcually works 100% of the time and cant fail cause even a resisted stun gets the deseired agro effect) while being group MA(our job).<br>
<br>
All the class needed was some kinda taunt/agro gaining ability boost , and a clear seperation of the lvl of midigation/hp over hybrid versions of our class.  This stuff is just fluff to make us think we are getting something we are not. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~sunbur/watsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Provoke looks promising since its not random and you can activate it yourself(insta-cast). <br>
<br>
The rest of the opening stuff looks like garbage, and the implementation of it annoying. The new combat abilities window is too big and square, if you play in 800x600 it takes up too much screen estate. Also this window currently closes when you press escape heh(/bugged that). And they dont display &quot;You have gotten an offensive opening&quot; or anything like that in the main text window, so you are pretty much forced to keep staring at the opening window instead(or you wont notice/wont have time to react to openings).<br>
<br>
But anyway, back to the good stuff(provoke):<br>
<br>
Insta-cast, range based and according to lucy &quot;Increase Hate by 120 (L20) to 165 (L65)&quot;. It also have another component that apparently affects agro, I am guessing some sort of small +agro DOT. I believe that because I was over on test server: Another lvl 25 warrior had pulled an orc centurion and had hit it for a few seconds, then he stopped and turned his back to it. I was standing like 20 meter away and hit provoke. It did not come directly for me after that. But around 10 seconds later it suddenly ran over and started attacking me instead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eldryc>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/5/03 8:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3240.topic&index=29>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> I don't know how these skills will be balanced when they go Live, but my complain was simply that nothing on the list looks worth giving up that damned defensive discipline for.... ah, defensive... we love and we hate it.  It's used as an excuse to not give warriors anything too often.  On the other hand, for many guilds it IS very powerful.  4% mitigation is, IMO, not enough to make up for losing it.  Right now none of the skills look like enough to make up for it.  None of the changes look like enough to increase our relative usefulness compared to knights either.  It looks like knights will still take damage almost as well, will still have aggro lock, and will still require far less healing in many exp groups because of their own heals, stuns, and lifetaps.  <br>
<br>
I just saw a complain on the druid's grove... a huge thread about how some of them think they suck at healing again.  One guy was complaining that he couldn't keep his mana up in a plane of fire group as the soul healer.  wtf?  I wasn't aware druids were supposed to be able to do that... but anyway, another druid suggested quite rightly that his problem was he had a warrior tanking.  They suggested switching to a knight and that then he'd be able to heal and even have leftover mana to nuke.  <br>
<br>
Talk about broken... but that's the way it is right now.  It's going to require MAJOR improvements to our class to rebalance it.  Maybe they'll improve these skills quite a bit before it goes Live.  Riiiight.... at the moment I'm just not seeing it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eldryc>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/5/03 8:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3240.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> odd, i can't seem to get the ezboard login to work, so no edit button. bah!  complain = complaint... i can't type.

You need to have PoP to get to lv 65, and parchment is for lv 60+ spell anyways. And you can always buy those in bazzar. <br>

A lot of the skill sucks tho. Openign is too rare, too short. SKill has a very little efefct and last very short <p>LV 65 Maestro <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http:///www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=26167">Sirinsa</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I don't see anything that says Defensive is being taken away though.  Will someone please explain this to me?<br>
<br>
All I've seen is that Disc's are being x'ferred to the endurance bar and being given separate timers.<br>

<br>
As it is now I would just put provoke as a hotkey next to my taunt button and not even bother opening the melee abilities window, it's that sad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=keigan>Keigan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/7/03 12:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3240.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   stop the whining!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?classes=WAR&source=Test">lucy.allakhazam.com/spell...ource=Test</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

That link has the current list of skills on test for Warriors.<br>
<br>
You will notice that all of the old disciplines are there PLUS a few new ones. The lvl 65 version of Defensive looks especially promising.<br>
<br>
Take a look at the data and THEN complain if you'd like.<br>
