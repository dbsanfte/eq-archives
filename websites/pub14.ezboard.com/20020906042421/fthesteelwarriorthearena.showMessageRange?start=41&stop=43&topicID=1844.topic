We did get the staff from Hate with 8 or 9 people though and didn't have much trouble doing so.  In Hate it's about knowing the spawn and the pathing.  We had someone who knew it extremely well and made things easy.  With him along I think we could have cut it to the 6 strongest characters there and still been successful.  We can put together 1 group that's all L60 or close to it (58+ i guess) and has the most necessary classes. We don't have uber gear though.  No, i don't play a mage (though i do have a 51 necro).  I do know a 59 mage that has been absolutely tearing through levels though because he's finding soloing/duoing for experience both easy and fast, much faster than bothering with a larger group even when the group is almost all L60's.  I have heard of other classes who solo or duo that are also outpacing larger group experience by a fair margin and that that's something verant says they are &quot;looking at&quot;.  They may increase the epxerience for higher level mobs that pretty much require groups to kill.  The faster exp is just a very pronounced difference with a mage.  He does not have much downtime at all and if he gets KEI then it's virtually zero downtime.  In a larger exp group, where if he's there we'll almost always pull 2 or more mobs at a time, he's very clearly the dominate damage dealer even when a 60 epic rogue is present.  Damagewise in our exp groups, nothing is coming close to the epic water pet tanking a mob with mage nukes thrown in too, not even the rogue.  It's an amazing class to have in your group if you want experience.  Given the incredible damage the class can already pump out, I couldn't believe this player question and verant employee answer posted on caster's realm today -- <br>
<br>
&quot;Will they ever remove the pet haste cap?<br>
<br>
Yes, this is something that’s been recently discussed. We’ll most likely be changing it in a way that will be viewed as a universal positive. Unless you’re being attacked by a pet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;<br>
<br>
/boggle.  another pet upgrade?  Sorry, for me this confirms what I was already thinking.  Verant either has no clue whatsoever how to balance classes or they just don't care.  They watch their percentages and if a class isn't played enough, upgrade time! wheeee!  I really believe that's how Verant makes many (not all! i know there's always exceptions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) of their balance changes.  It's classic MUD operator mentality.  Pump up the underplayed classes.  The tone of the panel responses on the Q&amp;A from caster's realm suggests even more caster upgrades coming soon.<br>

<br>
<br>
as for ease of solo. yes, mages can solo well. not nearly as well as necros, or as fast as wizzies and druids.  we have to know where to hunt to solo effectively. there are some places where wizzies and druids solo that we can't, and certainly more places where necros solo that we can't.  most mages find  a solo spawn taht is easily solo pullable and has a fast spawn time, 6 mins or so. and just sit in that one spot and grind out a lvl.  VERY BORING. yet, pretty fast.  i make great xp solo, provided i'm hunting in the right places. but do you have any clue how boring it is to be the ONLY person in your whole zone?  also, zones where a mage can solo pre epic aren't that common really. in fact, now, many of our favorite solo spots are taken over by uber lvl 60 mellees.. why? mobs we solo tend to have low hp, and not hit too hard.  and the downtime gives them time to BP heal up or regen or bandage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=1844.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=1844.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showPrevMessage?topicID=1844.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showNextMessage?topicID=1844.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1844.topic&index=43><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.emailToFriend?topicID=1844.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.threadControl?topicID=1844.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1844.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1844.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
