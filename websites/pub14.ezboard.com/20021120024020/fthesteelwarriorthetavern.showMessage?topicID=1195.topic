<br>
I was just thinking bout CH chains, warrior tanking, defensive etc. Please note This is first draft, if it becomes an interesting post I'll try to fix up some errors on my part<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Defensive</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Defensive is/was great because not only did it reduce the average damage, it reduced the MAX damage (per attack round)<br>
<br>
So you can set your CH chain to be slowed more apart, because you know no matter what, the damage will not exceed X DPS until the disc wears off.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  DISC OFF DISC OFF</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
So without the disc, there is the average DPS of the mob, and the max DPS,<br>
<br>
The Max dps is the same towards everyone, if a bad roll happens, there is no way to protect against this, except having more HP to outlive it, or better mitigation skills to *hope* that it doesnt happen, after so much avoidance skills/AC it is statistically improbable to get hit for full damage, but it can still happen.<br>
<br>
Warriors Have greater skills to mitigate the damage, On the average, they will mitigate better yet, given the bad roll, they can still take max damage, <br>
<br>
So when setting up a CH chain, you try to get as close to possible to the Max theoretical DPS as possible, without stretching your clerics too thin, or going oom (Much negated to the ModRod2 spell)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;Plateu's&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A warrior, in any given guild should be the first to reach the &quot;Plateu&quot; to sucessfully tank a mob w/o defensive. With CH's going in between X amount of Rounds of attack, gaining more HP will not make the chance of dying in X+1 amount of rounds dissapear, but rather lower the chance of it happening, assuming an error, or lag in the chain<br>
<br>
Example: (Cause I may have not explained it very well.<br>
Deraktor the Vindicator does a a max quad of 800 each (I Think, correct me I'f I'm wrong, but the Purpose of Arguement just go with the numbers.<br>
<br>
This Means that In one given round, He can do 3200 HP, So any character, given 3201 HP, could theoretically tank him, given the healing.<br>
<br>
Of course, getting the nesicary healing to CH a tank every Round, requires many clerics, and is out of tune with RvR.<br>
<br>
As a tank goes up in HP, he will always beable to survive one round, and the chance to tank two rounds, will increase, up until the point (Probably around 5500 or so, perhaps more) The chance for two full attacks rounds, becomes neglible (I think this is called the Law of Statistical averages) So You can effectivly heal the tank with CH's coming every two Rounds. Once the tank reaches  6401 HP, There is zero chance to die in two rounds, given max hits.<br>
<br>
Simply put, all the chances that mitigation/avoidance does is lower the chance for the max hit to happen, into an acceptable range. (@#%$ Happens, Tanks sometimes die, but its recoverable, it wont happen enough to warrant a more rapid CH chain)<br>
<br>
DTV, Given Defensive Hits for I think a max of 500.<br>
This means given defensive, 2001 HP, and the Proper CH chain, DTV could be tanked, w/o the risk of death. This too, is out of proper RvR, and out of the reach of guilds with warriors geared as such.<br>
<br>
So Upping the HP of warrior to 4001hp, two rounds, 6001hp, 3 Rounds. 7000 HP, 3 rounds, but due to the fact that due to the mitigation/avoidance skills, and hits on the average, it would be fairly safe to assume 4 Rounds. (As Would around 5500 or so for 3 rounds)<br>
<br>
This is why &quot;defensive ruled&quot; in Velious, the chance of being able to get a non defensive tank (esp non warriors) to tank him in an acceptable amount of rounds (2 or 3) was very low.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   The Big Bad Biotch</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Avatar of War is commonly given as a mob that &quot;Only a warrior will tank&quot;<br>
Both due to the two ways he is fought, W/ Defensive warriors, as non warrior's.. dont have defensive. or W/O Defensive, as he can kill most characters in a single round, and the main way to overcome this, is through HP, that mostly the warrior has.<br>
The Amount of HP would be 6925 (1154*6, Quad (4) + Flurry (2? sorry if I not sure exactly how many attacks flurry is, My beleive was its an extra attack from primary hand, so if a mob quads, that would be two attacks from primary hand) So, yes, theoretically, an uber guber pal/sk could tank the AoW, given that many HP.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Luclin</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Enter Luclin, On the average, both HP and Mitigation was increased of all class's. The more HP of all class's helped more class's get near the &quot;Plateus&quot; to tank a mob sucessfully given X amount of attack rounds, and the Mitgiation/avoidance helped reduce the risk of death on X+1 into acceptable means.<br>
<br>
**Note: I Do beleive that older content, should be able to be  tanked by non warriors, espcially knights given the proper gear/healing, should just be easier, and more effecient with a warrior.<br>
<br>
On the whole, the MT Melee DPS of mobs, was not increased much, if at all. (I know some mobs hit for more then AoW, but dunno if any hit for more, and quad, and flurry, to overcome the lesser hit) <br>
<br>
Instead verant decided to make the battles laster longer, to challenge endurance, and to have &quot;Gimmicks&quot; to complicate the fight (Curse's, quick respawns  around the boss, multi tanking)<br>
<br>
Due to refresh of Defensive, the DPS of mobs, and the length of the fight, it is not only possible, but for the most part nesicary, to not Rotate MT's, but rather stick one MT up for as long as possible.<br>
<br>
Since Defensive is no longer nesicary, and the overall HP has improved, while the overall DPS has not. warriors have lost the main advantage they had in Velious, Surving the max theoretical damage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The Flaw</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Given all this, I beleive EQ is flawed at the most basic level for raid level tanking. Everyone tanks fundalmentally the same, some class's may tank better on the average, but ALL can take the same amount of max damage, and that is what really matters for raid level tanking.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Verant Won't Fix it</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I Dont beleive verant really has what it takes to fix this, they wont change the basic code in the game. They will apply metaphorical bandaids to the game. Shields come to mind now, perhaps in the future, raising the mitigation/avoidance skills of Warriors, and perhaps Pal/SK's. But unless the max hit is somehow different for various class's, the fix's will be just that, bandaids.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   What should be done?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I really dont know exactly what should be done, too much content has been built on a fundalmentally unsound foundatation, to have it realistically changed. I have a few ideas, quickly come to mind, and probably would imbalance the game now, but if these were implemented during the Kunark time, the later content could have been designed around it much better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  My Idea TM</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As Most of Us know, Damage based on Damage Bonus + DI* where * is an integer between 1 and 20. The Integer range should have been different for various class's, Perhaps 17 For warriors, 18 For Pal/SK 19 For Cleric/bard 20 For Rogue/Ranger/Shm 21 for Monks 22 For Druids 23 for Int casters.** <br>
<br>
**RoughNumbers, please dont respond saying that Rangers should been at 18, and clerics and 19, as that is not the overall point of this thread) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/umadronedorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MadroneDorf</A> at: 9/4/02 12:15:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uketherami.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kether Am I</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/4/02 12:43:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1195.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why I Think Tanking in EQ is Fundalmentally flawed (Long</span><hr size=1> Honestly I hate that the minimum hit is the same for everyone.

Mobs have a max damage they do per round.  You set up your CH cycle to deal with the max damage, as best you can.  Defensive helped reduce that max damage previously, which made Warriors very attractive as MTs.  Now with the prolonged duration of Luclin battles, that attraction is reduced.  And with the additional HP granted many character classes, its much more possible for other classes to tank mobs which would not have been possible before.<br>
<br>
So, if the max damage a boss can dish is 2500 HP per round, you need 5001 HP to survive 2 rounds, and 7501 to survive 3 rounds, regardless of your class.  As other classes (Knights, Monks, etc) start reaching these kind of HP numbers, they tank just as well as a Non-defensive Warrior, regardless of the skills difference. (Yes you won't see a 7501 HP Knight in the game at this time, but who knows what's happening with PoP).  And all you have to do is set up your CH cycle accordingly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucyrzb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CyrzB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/4/02 12:55:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1195.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why I Think Tanking in EQ is Fundalmentally flawed (Long</span><hr size=1> Fairly good point, especially when you look at mobs that have such high ATK that they often hit for full damage.<br>
<br>
Interesting interesting though, especially since one of my pet peeves is a cheal that occurs even before I go berserk...<br>
<br>
Of course, In Pratice, a 7400 HP warrior would be able to survive till the 4th round in most cases vrs a 2500 per round mob, esp if the mob gets to 2500 max per round via flurry and quadding- It would take 3 successful flurries and double attacks, and 6 successfull Dual Wields all hitting for max damage to kill him, which a similar SK would have less chance, due to lower defensive caps.<br>
<br>
You also have some other variables, such as riposte damage. Forget the whole taunting via spells only we saw SK's capable of. An SK will get less ripostes because SK's generally have higher delay weapons and don't dual wield, while warriors generally do. DS could enter into the equation as well, but MoK or other such anti-DS should be used anyway.<br>

Except maybe for tanking AoW and a few other very high end mobs that 99% of all players will never see.  If you can't take down a mob within the 3 minute span of Defensive, then chances are you aren't going to require a Defensive Warrior, you are going to require someone who can live long enough between CHs.  If you can get a Knight who can instantly gain and then permanently maintain aggro and has enough hit points to survive between CHs, then why would you want a Warrior who has to wait for a proc and lowers your overall dps????  And this is just in raids which was for a long time, the entire purpose of Warriors!<br>
<br>
In an xp group, a Knight is much, much better than a Warrior.  Need instant, permanent aggro so the Rogue can backstab, you aren't gonna get it from a Warrior.  Need some additional buffs and utility spells, you aren't gonna get it from a Warrior.  Want ok dps, a Knight does it just as well as a Warrior.<br>
<br>
We're not even second class citizens on Norrath, we don't belong.  Unless you are one of the 0.5% of all Warriors blessed with a hate-proccing weapon, you are inferior in every way to a Knight.  Oh wait, Warriors have a few hundred more hit points and a discipline that really is no longer that important or necessary.<br>
<br>
Can I get quick show of hands to see who thinks that a few hundred hit points and slightly better skill caps and (maybe) dps balances out against the ability to instantly and permanently acquire aggro as well as have other utility spells?  Anyone??  Anyone??<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't think Warriors are asking for a lot from Verant.  We don't want spells.  The Knights have always been better at aggro than us, that's fine.  Would I love to get aggro like that?  Sure, but that's the Knights thing not ours.  We're never going to see the end of the soft cap on AC and I'm ok with that too.<br>
<br>
I think there is a general consensus of what Warriors want:<br>
<br>
1) Some form of innate, Warrior only, damage reduction or avoidance.  So that we either take less damage per hit or have a significantly better chance of not getting hit at all.  I think we would all (or at least a strong majority) give up Evasive and Defensive for this.<br>
<br>
2) A Taunt button that does SOMETHING.  I can Taunt a mezzed mob with no problems, 2 or 3 taunts and I'm pretty sure it's mine.  Taunting a mob off another melee, this just is not happening.  I think all of us have been in too many situations where we watch someone else get beat on as we mash the taunt button and pray for a proc and it happens again and again and again.<br>
<br>
3) Better damage, maybe not much but something.  No we don't need Monk level damage, but an imporovement, maybe even giving half the damage bonus to our offhand weapon.  Sure Warriors will never stack well in raids, but maybe with slightly better dps we won't be as much of a waste of space.<br>
<br>
<br>
A couple other things beyond the general consensus...<br>
<br>
4) A spawnable Severilious.  The poor lizard gets blasted by a manburn team long before any raid could possibly assemble and buff up, 2 minutes later the manaburners are porting to Nexus and putting another Green Scale on their Bazaar zombie.  Please, we already have to shell out cash to a Gnome for Rebreathers to get our Epic, why do we have to shell out much, much more cash to a Wizard for the Green Scale?  Either shell out the cash or equip 30-40 close friends with VP keys and pray no one goes LD and can't come back.<br>
<br>
5) Raise our Piercing cap to match the other weapon skills.  Is there any reason that the masters of swords, axes, maces, flails, halberds, staves, warhammers, and clubs seem to have such great difficulty in truly mastering the dagger and spear?<br>
