<br>
Lately, it seems to me like warrior taunt is really subpar compared to knight taunt abilities. What it boils down to is, with a sk/pal tank the slower can slow the mob as soon as it's in camp, whereas with a warrior they have to wait 5-10 seconds, or even until I land my ch.<br>
<br>
It's a difference of 1 ch for a knight per fight versus 2 for the warrior, which negates the warrior hp advantage as far as healer mana is concerned - especially coupled with the fact that there's less margin for error with a warrior tank for the casters, who often pull taunt off him and need additional heals.<br>
<br>
I seriously think warrior taunt needs an upgrade, and came here to ask if one is in the works, and when is it going live. I mean, right now, as a cleric in PoP I actually prefer a knight tank to a warrior. In PoD at a few nights ago, we had a 58 warrior and a 55 sk in the group, and when we made the sk tank and relegated the warrior to a support role, we actually managed to pull faster! What the hell is that. Not right.<br>

<br>
If they 'fix' taunt their becomes no challenge or difficulty in keeping aggro on the best tank us.  We are suppose to take the hits the best, we get this by sacrficing having the best aggro control.  <br>

If there is something wrong it's that Knight's taunt is too good and needs to be nerfed some not the other way around.  People always overlook the fact that while we do not tank significantly better than Knights nor do significantly more damage (and less than Paladins on Undead), we're still better in those two areas and that's the primary purpose of getting a tank.  All the neat abilities Knights get doesn't matter very much if you're just going to grind 5 hours of boring xp and that's probably the most common grouping setting.  <br>
<br>
I like the way it's balanced right now.  Warrior beats Knights for boring xp situations where you don't expect anyone to die and Knights outperform us when things turn bad.  My only compliant right now is that Knights 2Hs are far superior to any comparably accessible warrior 2Hs at least until you can get a Greatstaff of Four Winds or a Blade of War and 2H makes tanking PoP mobs a lot easier due to their insane ripostes. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kogarroughneck>Kogar Roughneck</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/9/03 1:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2743.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is VI going to look into warrior taunt?</span><hr size=1> (Long time reader, first time poster)<br>
<br>
Speaking of Hybrid/Knight taunt vs Warrior taunt which class do you find your guilds relying more on in PoP?<br>
<br>
When clearing to the bosses we use knights as main tank. When fighting most bosses we also use knights as main tank. Very rarely do we even put our warriors in the tank rotation for Drunder clearings up to and including Rallos Zek, Trials in Halls of Honor, Aerin'Dar, Behemoth, Saryn, or anything else other than Bertoxx any more, and even durring the Bertoxx encounter we still only use warriors as the tanks only after we've exausted our supply of knights for the kings and other assorted named. <br>
<br>
Our warriors end up doing nothing during these encounters and I think alot of us feel like we're getting the shaft. Maybe it's just my guild that has placed such importance on the use of Knights and their all-too-powerful aggro control methods, but our warriors have the best eb weapons availible, we have all the required AA abilities, all the right gear. We have 9k+ warriors but we still end up using Knights who match and even surpass the majority of our tanks hitpoints, which can be another thread all on it's own.<br>

<br>
I agree with this statement, I don't feel our mob control is insufficient, but I feel that knights are too far over powered in comparrison, and we are left with no way to compete. They can have superior AC and HP(we have knights in the upper 8k's while the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>majority</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of our warriors don't even meet this number), but giving them superior Taunt is going too far. It's bad enough their Elemental armors are only 15hp less than ours, in addition to giving hundreds of mana while giving us nothing else to balance out the difference, but to make them better at everything else we can do for our guild at an encounter is dissapointing.<br>
<br>
Why even have warriors in Everquest? The only difference between the two of us is that they get a complete array of heals, group heals, buffs, cures, stuns and so on and so on, and we get.... defensive and shield. Wow.<br>

Even if not in an uber uber guild (we are still tier 5 which isnt bad), in group situations I see myself having problems with that. Last group I was in replaced a SK for me and they got irritated because I couldnt aggro mobs quick enough compared to the SK (thought they didnt even realise SK was 5 lvls higher then me with probably nice equip too).<br>
My guild uses warriors as tanks so Im happy but I do see more and more pally / sks outaggroing me and it makes me wonder what good I am for. Most sk / pal get better dmg weapon then us, most sk / pal get the same if not higher hp then us since they got better aggro, they also get equipped first. Like the above poster said, elemental armor they have same stats str / sta /dex about, they got 35 less hp but got 100 mana added to that. When VI designed epic, to balance them, they did well having x number of stats for everyone and x number of mana + hp. So if they get all mana they dont get hp, if they get more mana, they get less hp.<br>
<br>
Imo, easy way to make us back into our True role is getting rid of all aggro on spells like stun, SK snare, and some other spells. Problem then is that necros / clerics have same spells, so they wont get aggro when casting their spells which is not good either. The problem is nerfing aggro is good for warriors but not good for the general idea since sks would get better at same time which might not be intended by VI.<br>
<br>
Atm it is :<br>
<br>
Pal / SK have advantages War dont have, spells, they can heal / lifetap, root / snare, buff up, CH / HT, etc etc<br>
<br>
Pal / SK have same hp / ac as War in the high end game<br>
<br>
Pal / SK 1hand / 2hander sometimes outdmg warriors<br>
<br>
Pal / SK can out aggro War<br>
<br>
Pal / SK is now MT when it was designed that War was the MT.<br>
<br>
<br>
there are ways to fix taunt, needs some reflection, but I do agree, atm, in high end game the real only advantage of tanks is a disc usable every 10min (a bit less) which is defensive so you only need a warrior every 10min to tank a mob while you should need him 100percent of time for all tanking job. And that is only when you really do require defensive which you now rarely do. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

The comments were made after that patch, I believe, and was specifically speaking about warrior reliance on proccing weapons to maintain aggro because taunt was unable to do the job, whereas knight classes were able to hold aggro with spells. The taunt upgrade was a general upgrade affecting all taunt classes and improving them all. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

I've noticed no significant problems with maintaining aggro over a long duration unless someone is piling up 5 dots constantly on a mob.  Knights have superior short term aggro... maybe too good, but over the long run it doesn't really matter.  They can hold aggro well over the long term but so can we unless you've people who insist on chain cast Strike of Solusek Ro or pile 5 dots on a mob.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phantron>Phantron</A> at: 1/9/03 9:36:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lumudan>lumudan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/03 8:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2743.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is VI going to look into warrior taunt?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I've noticed no significant problems with maintaining aggro over a long duration <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Most warriors dont have any problems maintaining aggro over the long duration.  Its getting the aggro early and holding it through debuffs/slows/early ch's etc that is the issue.<br>
<br>
Warriors are dependant on procs (i.e. flat out luck) to get and hold aggro early.  We give up dmg for no dmg procs to do our job because every other class in the game can taunt better then we do (even if they dont want to, they can).<br>
<br>
I agree a war and pal in = equipment, war will always have more hp and in most cases more ac.  The issue is when both equipped with top end gear have a diff of 500 hp, negligible difference in ac,  and one class can lock aggro down from the word go and hold the duration... which do you want to use?<br>
<br>
Im not sure whether to hate or love defensive anymore, without we are useless as tanks (step up pal and sk), of course with it we will never see any reasonable improvement to warriors because we have... defensive! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aveenlucenthawk>Aveen Lucenthawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/03 4:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2743.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is VI going to look into warrior taunt?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Im not sure whether to hate or love defensive anymore<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I couldn't agree more. It is both what makes warriors better as tanks, and what holds us back. We wont get upgraded because of that disciplin yet at the same time, we are loosing our role as the best tank hands down and there is nothing to replace that role with.<br>
<br>
It is an unfortunate situation that the devs seem to only want to ignore to see if it will go away on its own. <p>Aveen Lucenthawk<br>

<br>
What if they already trivialized aggro management?<br>
<br>
What if there was a class that could hold aggro even through early heals, slows and debuffs?<br>
<br>
What if there were two classes that did this?<br>
<br>
What if these classes wore platemail armor. And had a taunt button as well?<br>
<br>
What if they even had a skill that allowed them to bash through their 2hander, no matter what race they chose?<br>
<br>
What if, because of these things they could hold aggro almost seamlessly?<br>
<br>
If this were the case, then, wouldn't every warrior who says &quot;If they fixed taunt, the encounters would be trivial&quot; be missing the fact that the encounters already are trivialized by knight ability to hold and maintain aggro?<br>
<br>
Just some questions I've had floating around in my head ever since I grouped with a 61 pally in PoN who could hold aggro 10 times better than any one of my trio of warrior friends.<br>
<br>
And since I'm a monk, I don't like getting crunched by mobs too much these days. So I rather liked not having to evade much with a pally tank.<br>

They have to learn their jobs as well.
