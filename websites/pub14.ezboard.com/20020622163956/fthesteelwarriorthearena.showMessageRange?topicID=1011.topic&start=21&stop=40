<br>
If you're trying to measure damage taken per second, which seems to be the most accurate number to measure, Yelinak isn't the best because of his knockback.  Vindicator would be good but he's a pain to pull and his guards respawn every 30 mins.  If you could arrange to kill him 5 or 10 times and MT every time with controlled AC that would be a great test, but you'ld have to have the cooperation of a fair number of people every day for a week or so.  Velketor is up a lot, not sure what the respawn is on his gaurds but he's also be a pain I think.  Yelinak is certainly convenient, if you can find him up for a night.  I can't think of any bad-ass melee-only rooted mobs. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6629>Brutul Vilesilencer</a><br>

<br>
How I would test it is to keep everything constant in regards to defensive abilities, even AGI, preferably of course at 255 since thats easy to get to, and then I would attempt to vary my AC at around 50 point intervals from 1000, to as high as it could go.<br>
<br>
I would take 10+ minute logs against a variety of fixed level creatures, at all AC points.  You attacking or riposting attacks or the mob riposting you, don't really matter.  I'd consider the sole thing of importance to be the Average damage per hit from each mob at each ac point.<br>
<br>
So you'd go from say Bloodmaw in gd at the low end, up to Yelinak at the high end, testing each, for say 15 minutes at each AC point (Lets say 8-10 different ac points).  There are a lot of fixed level mobs but you'd want to say, get them about 10 level gaps.  So a level 30 mob, a level 40 one, 50.. etc..<br>
<br>
This would give you a lot of information about usefulness of AC values against mobs of different levels.  I don't really think you can draw entire conclusions based entirely on one set of logs from yelinak about an AC cap.  And also testing multiple mobs would let you know if the 'cap' is really just related to the level/attack of the mob you're fighting. <br>
<br>
It could be the case, that say the mist panther, because of his level and attack, that anything beyond say 1100 AC does not lower damage, but then on something say thats level 62, if you see that, anything beyond 1150 has no effect on damage taken you could infer that the cap is based on level/attack of the mob and not some fixed number. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ubrutultarewmarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brutul Tarew Marr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/02 6:12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1011.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.blackcompany.cc/member_pics/45.jpg height=185 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm going to test the 1200ac cap Help me develop a plan.</span><hr size=1> Average damage per hit measures damage mitigation, but not avoidance.

Sleeper's tomb golems are level 66 warrior mobs, and you could pull them to the zone.  I imagine you could do the test with just you and a couple clerics.  Pull the first golem, tank him until the clerics go OOM, and then everybody zone out, med up, and try it again.  MotG would be even better if you can get a group or two to come down and clear all the yard trash.  For 24 hours it would be just you and the MotG and you could do a bunch of parsing.<br>

<br>
To test avoidance AC is a seperate thing, relating solely to the hit/miss % chance that a mob has when you vary your avoidance AC (agility is about the only thing I can think of for a player to adjust with this).<br>
<br>
Average damage per hit, does not factor in avoidance at all, it only is the average of the hits, which is mitigation, and which is probably what matters most to people.  If you're asking if say a 10 ac upgrade is better than a 50hp one, you're asking about mitigation AC upgrade, vs a hp upgrade, avoidance isnt part of that at all.<br>
<br>
so basically, assuming your agi is constant at say 255, and you change only your AC via armor chances/removals, you are modifying ONLY mitigation AC, and the hit/miss ratio from the mob to you, should remain the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ubrutultarewmarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brutul Tarew Marr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/02 7:27:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1011.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.blackcompany.cc/member_pics/45.jpg height=185 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm going to test the 1200ac cap Help me develop a plan.</span><hr size=1> Is  your assertion that the only thing that affects how often a mob misses  you is Agility?

<br>
AC on armor, say 55 on the bp of eradication, has no effect on if a mob hits you or not, only how hard they hit you, and that is the entire point of an AC cap test, to see if higher armor class is worth having.  Most players get higher armor class, via mitigation AC upgrades on items.  Say going from 35ac indicolite to 55ac eradication.<br>

Have misses on and then you can calculate two things, hit percentage, and damage per hit.  Damage per second has a huge flaw in that time is a factor in it.  Damage per hit, and hit percentage is a much more accurate reading,  achieves the same thing but removes the time factor.  That way when needed you can simply back out for a heal (if a rooted mob) and it introduces no error.  Also consider the effects of beserker, isnt there an natural atk and ac bonus to it?<br>
<br>
Another reason you want to have misses on and calculate hit percentage is that a totally mitigated hit will appear as a miss, you never see &quot;xxx has hit you for 0 damage&quot;.<br>

Edit:<br>
P.S. Yes it was gorlab who did the testing, but i believe numerous ktf tanks (me, lab, daro ect) were backing up his claims.  He wanted to do testing as through some uncontrolled logs (parses of many raid logs) a trend was noticed and decided controlled tests were needed.  The results we saw were that around the 1200-1250 range ac the value of ac diminished signifigantly.  I would really love to see more testing as we dont know how the new sol skills will effect this. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uklaenie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Klaenie</A> at: 1/10/02 10:34:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uadexxeda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adex Xeda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Swift</BR>Steel Warrior Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/02 10:51:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1011.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm going to test the 1200ac cap Help me develop a plan.</span><hr size=1> I can say with 100% certainty (VI Dev)that during Kunark there was a 1200ac cap.<br>
<br>
<br>
However we've had 2 expansions.....Who knows if they changed it or not.<br>
<br>
I'd prefer to keep agility maxed at 255<br>
find the average damage<br>
AND find the hit/miss percentages.<br>
<br>
If its a repeatable mob, I can then go back loaded down with coinage and repeat the tests at 71 agil.<br>
<br>
That should cover the affects of agil in avoidance.<br>
<br>
Better yet, we all should agree on a target. Then ALL of us go out and log some fights against it. Note our HP, AC, and agility and email the logfiles to me.<br>
<br>
If more than me attack the same mob we can generate a lot of raw data.<br>
<br>
Untill we perfect the testing process, I propose we choose an easy mob such as a specific NPC guard in a city or something.<br>

<br>
Funny you should mention ST golems, we went there last night and I kept my AC constant at 1403-1409 (Aego was my only AC buff, avatar hit me once as well until I asked the shaman to stop). I haven't parsed my logs yet, but I have collected similar data from two fights each vs. Tormax and DtV at the same AC value. I'm using my data to determine the before/after effect of Combat Stability on raid-type mobs, but I have np mailing you my logs if you want Adex (I have CS1 already). Tormax/DtV might be skewed though since these are /defensive type mobs where ST golems are not - yet still level 66 red cons.<br>

I am guessing that 1200-1400 is no increase, but that 1400 + AC buffs is an increase in mitigation.<br>
<br>
Also, like the others stated. I wouldnt worry about DPS. Just figure out the average hit (take out kicks bashs misses blocks dodges ripostes parrys etc) from hits actually landed and that will tell you if the AC is mitigating anything.<br>
<br>
You can also look at percentage of attacks missed, however I have heard pretty good data that AC doesnt affect miss rate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uzbik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zbik</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/11/02 10:24:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1011.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm going to test the 1200ac cap Help me develop a plan.</span><hr size=1> yeli tosses you,couldnt get accurate tests on him imo <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaerildroigheann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeril Droigheann</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 295<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/11/02 11:55:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1011.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm going to test the 1200ac cap Help me develop a plan.</span><hr size=1> The people who keep talking about damage per second are really missing the point of the tests.  <br>
<br>
The ONLY thing we are testing is mitigation, NOT avoidance.  That is why we're keeping AGI constant.  You can't test two things at the same time anyway.  Even if AC does have an avoidance part separate from AGI (which I don't believe it does), it will be far less valuable when compared to mitigation effects.<br>
<br>
Testing ADPH with a constant AGI totally negates any avoidance and lets you see the full mitigation effects of differing AC values.<br>
<br>
If you were testing avoidance, all you'd do is get a bunch of logs and see how many times he misses you vs. how many times he hits you.  That doesn't really give you any helpful information, does it?<br>
<br>
ADPH, not DPS <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45589">Aeryl Firebrand</a>, Warlord<br>

I.E. only you are attacking, mob stays in the same position and you have clerics chain healing you for ~ 30 minutes. Any other way there really is too many variables to really give your test much accuracy. Perhaps you can do tests like on Lord Koi, Lady Mirenilla, Aaryonar, Jorlleag. Our clerics do not run out of mana while fighting these guys. But you will have to make sure the mob is slowed entire time and start your test after it is slowed. Either way you still need the the force to get there and conduct the test. This would be a great test to do, though it is quite unfeasible. <p>Kryai Soulcarver

That doesn't matter if you test hit % and average damage per hit (ignoring claws).  If you get tossed out of range he's not attacking, when you are in range he is attacking.  That is part of why you want to test hit % and average dmg per hit and not test dps.  Damage per sec depends on a more factors that are harder to control and hence, its a very poor test criteria.<br>
<br>
Adex, you really can't have multiple people test because you just don't know what they aren't telling you and those things influence the results.  I did all my testing with the same buffs on, exactly the same buffs.  Its really just too much to control to have multiple people all go test with exactly the same set of buffs for large chunks of time, etc.  And by not rigorously controlling those things your test results will be flawed.  If you are insistant on it then use this as your test subjects:<br>
level 60 warrior, maxed defensive skill, shaman agility buff plus primal avatar.  Agi has to be 255.  Use these buffs:<br>
agility, primal avatar (spell NOT proc), aego, focus (single not group on both).  Absolutely NO other buffs and NO fewer buffs.  Turn on all your chat text and let yelinak beat on you for 10+ minutes.  You can't use any parse programs you have to parse it yourself as they won't do what we want...excel will work fine.  Remove all the claw attacks and calculate how many times yelinak hit you and how many he missed.  Calculate the average damage per hit (and if you graph his damage you will see an interesting pattern btw).  Repeat with 50 ac increments from 1100 to 1550 ac by varying armor only keeping all the above factors constant.  That's what I did. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7197 style="text-decoration: none">Gorlab</a> 60 Warlord<BR>

<br>
As long as others are lvl 60 with maxed skills, and are giving me those three numbers that's all I need to start plotting datapoints on my surface plot.<br>
<br>
Plus you don't need everything to be absolutely perfect. All you need is enough data that you can determine a trend or tendancy. We're not building a spaceship with this data.<br>
<br>
My point is, if we can find a flattening slope past a certain (1200?) AC point, we can finally feel comfortable with HP vs. AC decisions.<br>
<br>
Right now I really like the idea of me personally tanking a gateway golem in sleeper's tomb. Its allways up, its a warrior, it cons red, and I can zone out easily once my clerics are oom.<br>
<br>
New plan is to have:<br>
255 agil.<br>
2 clerics<br>
Me tanking a ST golem. <br>
I'll gather the average damage number and the number of hits  and misses.<br>
<br>
Once I go from 1000ac to 1500ac in 20AC increments, I'll repeat the tests with my agility at 71 via coinage.<br>
<br>
I'll tank the golem untill both clerics are oom and we'll all 3 zone out to med. While outside I'll rebuff agil if needed and switch my AC. I'll then go back in for another round.<br>
