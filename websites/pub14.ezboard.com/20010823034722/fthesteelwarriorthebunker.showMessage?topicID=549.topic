Not that I necessarily want to upgrade (I'm not sure, given my current funding level, that this is even possible)... I just want to make sure that my 1hb skill, if nothing else, doesn't fall behind (and it is *way* behind).<br>
<br>
Here's what I've got:<br>
<br>
1hs: Yak, Crystallized Sword<br>
Piercing: Harpoon of the Depths<br>
<br>
Yes, that's the extent of my weaponry. No, I can't afford anything yet. And yes, I'm aware I won't be getting serious money until I've leveled some. My concern is that if I do level, my 1hb (to say nothing of the 2-handed skills, which I've utterly neglected) will be pitifully far behind and near impossible to raise.<br>
<br>
My question, then, is what stays and what goes? I was thinking of possibly selling the yak before the price drops (again), it goes for 1k or less on Rallos these days... if I'm lucky. Harpoon is primary only and has 1 more delay, so it's almost the same thing, and the crystallized sword is a better offhand weapon. Anyone know if I should pawn the yak and look for a decent-quality blunt? Or perhaps pawn the harpoon and get a walrus tooth plus I-don't-know? Is there a way to get a decent 1hb or somesuch for free (I know druids quad-kite ulthorks in EW all the time, is there a chance at a free tooth there)?<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help, money's tight and I just need to keep my skills up. I'm quite secure on AC and my weapons are not inadequate, I just want to keep 'em diverse.<br>
<br>

<br>
That will allow you to sell the harpoon. Use that money to buy a Mith staff (600pp on TT). That will take care of your 2hb and leave you with some plats. Next, sell the Yak and buy a Cane of the Traquil. I can't stress how awesome this weapon is. Also goes for about 1k or so. <br>
This still leaves you without 2hs, but you should have abour 400pp left, so try to get a deal on a Blade of Xalgoz. They are pretty common so you might get lucky. Otherwise, pick up a Drakkel forged bastard sword. I sell these for 100pp to n00bs because they are super common. You can probably get one free or close too it in GD. Drop by while you are in EW. Only bad thing is that small races can't use. If you play a small race, go for a Tower guard blade or 2h practice sword. While none of these 2 handers is spectacular, they will be good enough to get your skill up to where it should be. <p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-famliy: arial"><b>Wandor Kilbringer<br>Wizard of the 45th Conclave<br>Vini, Vidi, Nuki</b></span><br>

Getting rid of a weapon and not having a weapon of the same class that can take its place is a very bad thing.  Harpoon of the depths totally outclasses the walrus tooth although you should be able to get one of those easily like was previously said.  I would recommend buying a 1hb such as an Enameled Black Mace and using that for skill.  Also for 2hb you can get a Ketchata Koro Mis 7/30 2hb or a 2hb shovel (not sure where its from but it has a great learning delay..don't know exact stats either)  for cheap.  For 2hs if you don't have one there are many that are fairly cheap and easy to get at your level.  Whatever ye are doing, you really won't be too terribly inconvenienced if ye dont have the best items to start.  Also all the 1hd skills rise pretty fast as ye use em. The 2hd skills can be a pain, but shouldn't be that bad either.  Just get in a group where you are not the main tank and have at... <p><p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Lucida Sans" color="#00FF00">Ctair Devernius, Druidic Priest of the 40th circle</font></p>

<br>
I'm kinda getting conflicting messages here. I know that the tooth isn't as good ratio-wise as the harpoon (by a fair bit, about .5 or .4 or something), but it is faster, and it can be switched to the offhand. Also, it's lighter.<br>
<br>
I have the crystallized, so perhaps I'll take the advice about using the yak and trying for a cane of the tranquil... and I'll look into those 2hs options. Thanks (still welcoming suggestions, naturally!).<br>

a pretty useful 2H slasher is that Practice 2H sword ( i think i have it right, i may be wrong ) . Free Damage Shields are nice, especially when someone's trying to gank you. the Xalgoz blade is a nice dmg/delay ratio as well, i would definately consider it.<br>
<br>
personally, i would ditch the Harpoon, keep the yak and crystallized sword, and go for a EBM and a walrus fang.the sale of the harpoon should cover the price of the ebm and walrus fang. i'm not sure of the practice 2H sword but i am almost sure on my server they sell for like 100 platinum or so. having the option to swap hands to me is always a good thing, especially when you come up on a better weapon that you would like to upgrade to. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ushikariiapoccalypse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shikarii Apoccalypse</A> at: 6/6/01 1:18:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ubearogfrostborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bearog Frostborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/7/01 12:26:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_pp.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Money Crunch - What Stays, What Goes?</span><hr size=1> I understand ye wanna keep yer skills maxed, perfectly understandable.  So me following suggestion is, do whut them above me said do.  I'm just gonna tell ya about 1hs weapons here, that are underpriced and under rated.<br>
I calls em Po' Man's Lammys.<br>
<br>
Light Velium Warsword and Forged Velium Warsword.<br>
First is 10/23 the second is 11/23 wt. 2.5 stones.<br>
<br>
No de dont have any stats.  I got both these weapons, at differing times not 3 days apart, for under 3k total. Only 1200pp cash, rest wuz trades.  They are regularly sold for 2k to 3k ea on Karana.<br>
Consider this:<br>
Lammy 9/19 6sta 6 str 20hps and selin fo 15k on my server.<br>
So, figure 30k fo a pair of em.<br>
VS<br>
Under 3k fo a pair O da po mans lammys.<br>
No stats but only 4 tenths of a second slower.<br>
<br>
Inna end, yes I suppose ye should have ye skills maxed, however, whut do most warriors end with?  Lammy or Jade primary and best dam/dly off hand.  Till they gets em epic, or primal or whutever the hell the rage is these days.<br>
Whut I'm saying is, usually its 1hb or 1hs, more often than not.  You know yer gonna dual weild, less ye really PK a lot against damage shields.<br>
I dunno whut these two weapons go for on yer server, but considerin yer current weaponry, I thinks with a bit O smooth operatin ye could gte a pair of these.  Until ye get ye lammys or whutever, they are about as good as it gets IMO.  Cept I guess if you like to rely on procs or have low end stats for whutever reason.  At 50, me str is 170 and me sta 155 unbuffed an without the lammys.  If ye got 30k to chunk off, by all means, *winks* but cobalt is expensive.<br>
<br>
Best O luck ta ye<br>

I had HORRIBLE piercing, 1HB and 2HB skills cause I blew them off till my 40's. To get those skills up FAST I went out and got a hold of 2 of the lowest delay weapons I could find (Piercing- Goblin Eye Poker and FS dagger- del of 18 and 19 respectively), 1HB is harder to find one quick and cheap but look for an Iksar stave (del 23, or do the Kerran Fishing pole quest for lower. you get the idea. Then go find yourself a decent group and ask if they would mind if you were the 7th member...obviously not grouped. You'll meet new people, get to socialize a bit and with duel wielded, low delay weapons (forget about what the damage is) your skill will rise FAST. Keep your regular weapons with you cause I've found that once people have gotten to know and meet me I am ALWAYS first up to replace someone who leaves the group. If that happens then bring out your REAL weapons and fight away....till the next day when you do it again. You'll get into great camp spots that way, meet new people, and your skill will get mastered quickly so that when you CAN afford a good weapon, your skill will be there to make it worth your while!

If you find something that's good, buy it, then stick it offhand for a while.  With dual wield it's easy to build up 1h weapon skill once you get something to use.  No sense spending money on an inferior weapon.<br>
<br>
I would sell one of the weapons, probably the ssoy.  It might be easier to get a good price on the SCH though.<br>
<br>
With the money I would look for 2h weapons like the mithril staff and an executioner's axe.  There isn't really any alternative to the staff at that level, but depending on prices, you could get something like a mithril 2h, earthen blade, or nathsar greatsword.<br>
<br>
Which 2hs you choose depends on whether you have haste items, and if you regularly group with people who cast haste. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showMessage?topicID=559.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showMessage?topicID=558.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.emailToFriend?topicID=549.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.threadControl?topicID=549.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=549.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=549.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker>The Bunker</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
