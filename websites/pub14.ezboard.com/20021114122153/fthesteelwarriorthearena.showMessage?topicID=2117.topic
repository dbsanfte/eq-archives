Jeez.  I can see uber equipped level 65 wars with ND3 and PE1 + this at level 65 with the new cleric buffs (the new symbol + the 1500hp group buff) could easily create a raid buffed MT of what , 10k hp?  However, they also have a 70 foot radius AE 96% rez hehe.  Kind of scary to think what kind of encounters lay in waiting for an uber guild with MTs buffed in the 10k range that would require an AE rez.  LOL.  Not that I'll see it ever or at least probably for another year but this is gonna at least be fun to see what can be accomplished stat wise with all of these.  <br>
