As many have mentioned already, people who tell me to taunt or ask me if i'm taunting after they get hit.  WTF do you think I do?  About all I can do is hit the mob, hit taunt, and try to stand close to it.  Yeah, there's kick/disarm and i use that too, but come on, this is pretty basic stuff.  I think I can figure out how to use the freaking taunt button after 63 levels and 90 some odd AA.  Suggesting that I don't use it when it's needed is just insulting.<br>
<br>
2.  On the flip side, there's people who can't take advice from anyone about anything and just give the excuse &quot;i know how to play my class, shut up!&quot;  I'm sorry, but some people obviously DON'T know how.  For instance, I've grouped with clerics who dump mana on expensive quick heals for no good reason and then we have to wait on them to med.  It started way back when divine light entered the game.  I knew so many clerics who would dump divine light on me when a quick heal wasn't needed at all.  It's a huge waste of mana.  Only use the Light/Remedy spells when a fast heal is needed!  That's not rocket science.  It's simple arithmetic.  Some spells are more efficient than others, so use them when you can.  There can also be problems when it's a new area for people.  If i know the area, I may give some advice.  Take it as advice given with good intentions.  Don't get all defensive and refuse to listen.  I can see why some people suck at playing their class when they take the attitude that they know it all already.<br>
<br>
3. Charm.  It's ridiculous how overpowered it is and it's ridiculous how long it's been that way.  In places like BoT, it's especially broken.  I'm sick of seeing little groups of charmers getting all the named.  Thankfully it looks like the nerf is coming soon.<br>
<br>
&quot;9) Clerics who Elixer Heal THEN cast CH...&quot;<br>
<br>
umm.... why would this be a problem?  It's far better than the other way around, especially toward the beginning of a fight.  Elixirs generate virtually no aggro, so if you elixir the tank, you can delay how soon you have to hit them with a direct heal (like CH).   They generally won't even get you aggro from adds that come with a mob, while if you direct heal before adds are under control, you WILL get aggro.  Direct heals have far, far more aggro than any elixir.  <br>

<br>
Lots of peeps don't like getting told how to play their class.  The thing I do FIRST is ask a high level friend who plays the same class what the player should be doing.  So that way I have a bit of credibility.  Most important, I ask them WHY the way they suggested works better.<br>
<br>
Then I take it to tells.  Who wants to get publicly humiliated.  I simply tell them that I think there may be a better way, that I asked from an ALer (I'm on Mith Marr) and I make sure I tell them why it may work better.  And don't be too forceful and just tell them that they may want to try it.  <br>
<br>
I found in most cases people are receptive if you back it up with credibility and reasoning, and frame it in the proper manner.  Most people try it out, and in some cases they come back with &quot;I tried it and it seems to burn more manna that way&quot; or &quot;I seem to pick up more aggro on slows&quot;.  In which case they were right.  <br>
<br>
EQ is so complex, and most things are situational, I just take the frame of mind that I want to check if it works better another way.  Of course, I tell them if stuff goes bad, I don't mind taking a rez.  <br>
<br>
Treat them like you want to be treated.  If some Cleric in my group had a 65 Warrior, and made a suggestion, I'd at least try it.  <br>
<br>
Of course, if you do this and hte person is STILL not receptive, then they are immature.  I wouldn't group with them again.  There are enough good polayers out there who are receptive to new tactics and cool about those things...<br>

The thing is, I didn't need to have a cleric to know that the light/remedy lines are NOT mana efficient, especially on a tank.  Just look at the mana to hit points ratio.  They're intended as a quick heal when that's needed.  I knew that before I played a cleric much.  I was usually tanking so I knew what heals and when they needed to be cast to keep me alive and I knew which ones kept the cleric in mana and which ones had the cleric saying &quot;LOM&quot; every other fight.  But I wasn't supposed to say anything if someone was blowing mana for no reason because I was &quot;just a warrior&quot; and clearly knew nothing about &quot;their class&quot;.   Huh... really?  If a wizard keeps overnuking early and getting aggro, I'll tell them to back off some.  The group is more efficient if they're not ping ponging and getting pummeled.  I don't have to know their class to say that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Anyway, I'm reminded of the old Whineplay rants where people kept saying things like, &quot;You cannot possibly understand the intricacies of MY class!&quot; in the balancing discussions/flame wars.  Give me a break. <br>
<br>
In one example when I actually tried to say something, it was in tells to a guildmate I'd grouped with a number of times -- I'd be much less likely to say anything to someone I didn't know -- and I tried to be as nice as possible and just make a suggestion to try.  It didn't go over well. I took a similar approach with another cleric in my guild once and he was actually very receptive.  He grouped with us a lot and later told me how surprised he was to learn a lot about how to play his cleric from a warrior of all things (was before i'd played a cleric much).  I was very pleasantly surprised.  It's the former people that peeve me... when you're trying to be as nice as you can about something they could obviously work on and ya just get snapped at.  <br>
<br>
Long winded? I'm always long winded.  It's a sickness.<br>
<br>

1.  People that really just don't know WTF they're doing.<br>
Was in a group where the main healer was a druid.  There was one more druid, but that was the main of an enchanter who was already in the group, making it hard for them to be able to heal if they're mainly working the enchanter.  So, I make a double pull, the enchanter mezzes, all goes well, till I realize that I'm at about 30% hp, and have seen no heal message, or druid casting spell.  I start asking for a heal, cause I know that some druids forget that they can't wait that long cause they don't have CH.  I eventually die, I'm not too mad, till I ask the druid what happened.  And she tells me that she thought the enchanter was the healer, so she didn't do anything.  Now c'mon, the enchanter obviously just brought the druid to buff, seems like it would be a lot easier for the druid in the group to heal me than the druid that is being controlled by the enchanter who is busy in the group.<br>

2.  elitist bastards.  Now, I know a lot of people aren't like this.  But if I go up to some person in an uberguild and, politely ( I might add ), ask them for a buff, if they're not gonna give it to me, they could at least say no or something.  I understand if they are about to port out or something.  But I hate the people that just sit there, even if it's just a sow.<br>
<br>
3.  Ninja looters.  Especially now when you can see what the person in the group is looting.  If you really wanna ruin your rep, it's up to you, but don't ruin the rest of the group by ninja looting.<br>
<br>
4.  Idiots who try to sell items for much much more than it is actually worth, and get all pissy at you cause you say it's overpriced.<br>
<br>
That's all I can think of for now.  I'm sure there's more though.  Definately had fun reading this thread though. <p>Dothos D'Ssani<br>

  Why are you naked? (Turn your Vah Shir models on so that you can see my platemail, or petition to get the 'old' models fixed.)<br>

 Why do you hold your second weapon backwards? (See above.)<br>

I totally agree that I do not like other melees hitting the mob too soon.  I see this mostly with like level 52-54 peeps in their first PoP group.  When I see it I send them a polite tell to get things ironed out and 99.999% of the time things work better fast.  <br>
<br>
You can prolly lump this into a general &quot;people who don't know how to control their own aggro&quot; category.  <br>
<br>
I was grouped with a Wizzie who just dinged 60 and was waiting to mem a new DD spell he couldn't wait to use.  Of course he nuked too soon and got aggro.  Within a kill or two he was back to &quot;stand-nuke-sit&quot; at the right time.  He learned the right time to use that nuke and made the proper adjustments.  Props to Zifnabb the wizzie for that.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1909.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1909.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1909.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1909.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1909.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1909.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a> <b>7</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=1909.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showNextMessage?topicID=1909.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1909.topic&index=133><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.emailToFriend?topicID=1909.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.threadControl?topicID=1909.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1909.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1909.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
