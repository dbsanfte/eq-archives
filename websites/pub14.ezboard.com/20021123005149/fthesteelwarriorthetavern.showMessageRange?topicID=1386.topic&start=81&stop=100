Im sick of Monks and their punk ass ego attitudes and quite frankly it's a nice change to see them taken down a notch. Just posting this kind of message in a warrior forum shows how really freaked out the monk class in general is and I think they are scared. Scared of what? I think they are scared because they can no longer put down other classes and mock others in EQ because of their &quot;superior&quot; abilities.<br>
<br>
Im so glad this happened. I am sick of being mocked by monks and being continuously told I am crap because I play a War. THis is pure bliss.<br>
<br>
You know the difference between a monk and a warrior? Warriors are people who have accepted the short end of the stick and know we are underdogs. We know we must sharpen our skills in order to overcome our enemies and our disadvantages. We must hunt smarter because we do not have the luxury of pushing a button to avoid death. <br>
<br>
The real difference in our classes is not hp or any kind of bullshit stat. Warriors accept and triumph over our weaknesses. Monks whine and bitch about theirs.<br>

<br>
because monks have 1500+ AC too. fixing the softcap would only hlp if warriors got WAY higher AC than monks.. and they dont&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, I would disagree.  Excluding VT items (which in my opinion are broken), it is MUCH easier for warriors to hit 1400 or 1500 AC than a monk.  Prior to VT, with only NToV+ gear, breaking 1300 unbuffed is difficult at best for monks, 1400 is nearly impossible unless you've got NToV+ in every slot.<br>
<br>
Basically, until NToV enters the picture, warriors generally hold a very healthy 100 to 300 point AC lead, assuming they put more effort into +AC items.<br>
<br>
The current trend towards low AC items is caused mainly by the existance of the softcap.  IE, warriors feeling they are forced to choose +HP items, and +HP items alone after 1200 or 1300 AC.<br>
<br>
Without those low softcap benefits, what you end up with is people being forced to make harder equipment selections.  This is beginning to happen with the recent resist Nerfs.  That you need to hit 150 or 200 unbuffed resists to even begin to resist some of the current AE's has forced many monks (and I'm sure other classes as well) to rethink their gear layouts.<br>
<br>
Adding more AC into the equation would have similar effects.  IMHO, in order to really make the raising of the softcap effective, you would need to do 3 things...<br>
<br>
1)  Raise the softcap.  (This would maintain balance all the way to the end of NToV, pre-VT players)<br>
<br>
2)  Retune VT items.  Remove the monk usable tag, and make some PC's that will trade those items for more suitable monk/rogue/ranger type items ala Gareth the Trader for primal.<br>
<br>
3)  Retune NPC boss mob damage and attack values to take these into account.<br>
<br>
If you did these three things, Warriors and knight classes would be far ahead of monks in mitigation, monks and other classes would be forced to make much harder gear decisions (like they did before everyone reached the old resists caps), and you would find it much harder for any single person of any single class to get geared out to the theoretical maximum.<br>
<br>
Is this solution so hard to implement?  I doubt it.  You're only talking 100 or 200 items maximum to re-itemize if you stick to VT and late luclin gear only.  And you're probably talking about adjusting attack values on less than 30 mobs, 50 at the maximum.<br>
<br>
Would this be a little more work than a complete re-working of monk mitigation?  Yes.  Would it result in a lot less grief for Verant AND the players?  Most likely.  At most, you're talking about this nerf affecting &lt;500 players in the game, and probably less than 100 monks, etc.<br>
<br>
And there is a precedent for this... this about the Vulak dagger nerf.  It's been done before.  I'm sure they could do it again if they put a programmer on it for a week or so.<br>

Monks have latched onto the wonderful low weight high ac/+hp all/all items VERANT placed into the game. This, combined with thier other defensive abilities has caused them to become a viable tank class in many situations.<br>
Ideally, warriors should have significantly higher ac / hp.<br>
Monks can get comparable ac / hp with the right gear. This wasn't much of an issue because of the weight penalty to ac for monks, until the advent of the mentioned ac / +hp 0.x wt items.<br>
<br>
What has me concerned is instead of addressing the issue of overpowered low weight items that sidestep a monks inherant ac/weight penalties, they 'balance' the entire class making those same items necessary to be an average monk.<br>
<br>
What I see, both as a monk and a warrior, they screwed up some items and now nerf a  class to balance it.<br>
So two wrongs don't make a right except on Norrath? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukhanktinga.showPublicProfile?language=EN>khanktinga</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 7:05:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An open letter to Warriors from a Monk... </span><hr size=1> The core problem with all class balance issues is something fundamental to the game: too many classes, too few roles. There are 6 classes for whom dealing and taking melee damage are central to their 'roles' in the game: Warriors, Knights, Rogues, Monks, and Rangers. (Beastlords and Bards' melee damage is at best half of what those two classes are valued for). There's just no way they'll ever be able to maintain a good balance between those 6 classes and still keep them unique. The pendulum will swing wildly forever between the classes, that's just the way it is.<br>
<br>
As for the monk problem being a gear problem rather than a class one, that's a no brainer. When I think monk, I think of a spiritual bad ass, in a loose and light pair of pants, slippers, and no shirt to show of his totally ripped frame. A  guy (or gal) with such a tight mind/body connection that he could kick your ass with a pair of chop sticks just as easily as the quarterstaff of ownage. But EQ being what it is: a totally item driven game, a character that should disdain material things as a distraction from his spirituality is instead just as reliant as any other class on getting the next better weapon or piece of armor if he wants to improve his fighting abilities.<br>
<br>
My own personal opinion and view of what monks should be, is that toe to toe with a humanoid-type enemy, a monk would be just as hard to kill as any other melee class, warrior included, regardless of armor. Of course, this 'vision' is inherently imbalanced. Quite frankly, that vision has the monk being better than the warrior in most respects, hardly something balanced for a class-based game. <br>
<br>
So we comprimise that ideal to have some kind of trade off. In exchange for the improved damage and special skills and abilities monks get, they are supposed to have the following penalties:<br>
1) be less able to take punishment for long periods of time (less hps)<br>
2) get hit harder when they do get hit (less mitigation)<br>
3)have more limited equipment choices (wt and leather-class items restrictions). <br>
<br>
Without all three of those penalties, monks become too powerful. It's that simple.<br>
<br>
Where did Verant go wrong?<br>
<br>
1) Monks are in the right place on the HP totem pole, IMO.<br>
2) There simply should never be an AC softcap that is so independent of how powerful the mobs are. Having anything over 1300 AC be useless against frogs in OS is fine. At some point you outclass a mob one on one so much that it no longer matters. But to have it mean little to nothing against mobs like Emp, or the AoW is just plain stupid.<br>
3) There should have been MUCH better supervision and oversight of zone designers so that items obviously too powerful for a class that is supposed to have item restrictions were never introduced in the first place. It should have been obvious to anyone that really knows the game that Low wt , high AC items usable by all melee classes, or even all classes would be unbalancing for monks. It had previously been the case that monk usable armor was always much lower in AC than the best armor available to other melee classes, but a few designers got lazy just put in all/all stuff instead of thinking out more logical armor sets.<br>
<br>
The best solutions, again, IMO:<br>
<br>
2) Completely retool the way mitigation is determined. It should compare the player's AC against the mob's attack value, or some other number associated with how powerful the creature is. You could still have 'soft caps' for when the character is so much more powerful than the mob that he is outclassing it in one on one melee when he has a group to support him. (i.e. is getting buffed and healed, has people to debuff the mob, etc.) So, there could still be soft caps for xp groups, or for fighting greens solo, but AC would always matter against the boss mobs. Also, the actual mitigation tables would be different for plate, chain, leather, and cloth classes. Then, having 1400 AC on a wizard could matter, but he would still mitigate less than a warrior with 1000 AC, or something along those lines. This would give the classes that now get hit for max 90% of the time now some more options for equipment, perhaps.<br>
<br>
3) Retro-nerf all/all and all melee/all high-end items that are the best armor pieces for armored melee, and are clearly too high in AC for monks.<br>
<br>
Verant should have some in-house programs that use their melee algorithms to simulate fights and come up with average dps numbers. If they don't, that's really lame. I'm no programmer, but as a scientist that uses custom written programs for simulations and data analysis, I can tell you that such tools would be easy to write for a professional programmer. Such tools would be 10 times more accurate than the best parsed logs. They could then use those tools to determine when they get the adjustments suggested in 2) and 3) right before even putting them on test, let alone on the live servers.<br>
<br>
I'm far from being a monk-basher. Friends in my guild have monks that are about where they should be in terms of tanking ability and damage without this incoming nerf. One friend was already thinking of setting aside his lvl 60 monk because his item upgrade paths required a raiding, powerguild playstyle he just doesn't like. This will put him over the edge, as he's already started to twink and plvl a SK to replace him.<br>
<br>
So, as a warrior, I fully realize that these were all Verant's @#%$ ups, but regardless of how clueless they've been in the past, they need to fix these problems if they want their other games to be half as successful as EQ has been. I for one, simply don't trust them to maintain star wars and EQ2 the way they should be. They will both probably be good games to start with, but eventually, they'll @#%$ them up if history provides any lessons. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193443" target="_blank">

<br>
It's not that big a deal. It's simply going through a list of Monk items and changing the stats where needed.<br>
<br>
People are once more appreciating some stats and resists in general. You wouldn't even get that much whining if in retuning high end Monk gear you gave them an emphasis on good stats and resist rather than large ac. Many Monks would welcome it, as it would give their equipment a more unique flavour.<br>
<br>
Bump some stats and resists on the mediocre Monk only armour in game and *shock horror* people might start wearing it again.<br>
<br>
Fixing the AC softcaps is a no brainer, otherwise you'll revisit this problem with other classes.<br>
<br>
There are simple creative way to fixing this problem that don't involve pissing off large number of people, and actually fix real problems rather than sympotoms.<br>
<br>
Of course that assumes you're interested in fixing problems rather than just slapping people down. <p><hr />

<br>
How happy would you be if they retroactively changed all &quot;monk armor&quot; to armor with 5 pounds of weight per piece? You DO realize it's not quite as easy as just changing the AC on them and raising stats and saves right? Considering most &quot;monk armor&quot; (read anything with low weight and high ac) is also utilized by other classes as well, the only real solution is to bump the weight on it from 0 - 1 to 5 - 10. Ok, problem fixed right? Well no, all of a sudden we have monks who wont be wearing this gear anymore cause of the way it's reducing their ac now. Ok, so they will just stop wearing it. Realisticly however, who is gonna be happy with monks banking high end loot just cause it weighs more now? Lots of people are gonna want refunds of their gear so to speak.<br>

It was only to point out that from day one we have been CAPABLE of tanking. What made us less likely to be chosen was our lack of hit points and taunt really. We still avoided more and mitigated almost as much we just didnt have enough hp at the time to make healing the monk efficient. Of course NOW its gotten out of hand since I, as a monk, can tank just as well as any other non super twinked warrior and the majority of my armor is TAILORED! Im going to hold off on freaking out until the changes go live personally. I just want to see how bad, (Its not a question of if, its a question of how BADLY they screwup) they break things and THEN ill start foaming at the mouth if monks start taking hits like a druid or something.<br>

Monks could not tank as well as warriors. That is why all the uber kunark weapons went in. Your AC might have compared to a warrior with no gear, but you take a warrior in full crafted and put a monk in full whatever it's called and the warrior comes out way on top. Take a monk in his planar gear and a warrior in his and the warrior once again rocks him.<br>
<br>
Yes, moving down to a different defensive table DOES work to make the fix. It WILL stop monks from tanking. Don't believe me? Wait til you freakin get hit by an uber mob after the nerf. You're gonna get your spine cracked. If you want an advance go try tanking even something as weak as rhag 1 with a ranger or rogue. LOL you're toast monkey.<br>
<br>
FD doesn't work in every single situation so you try to downplay it? LOL nice one, but we're not the morons over on MB. FD does a hell of a lot more then anything warriors get, doesn't it smart guy? And, if you're good enough, FD DOES work in every situation, unless the FD fails. But aren't you getting an AA to prevent that or something? Even if not, saying you need a RV gate potion to reliably escape just shows how little you want to talk about reality.<br>
<br>
The extra defensive skill I was wrong on, I forgot monks don't get parry, but block+higher avoidance &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;parry, so it comes out to essentially being an extra defensive skill.<br>
<br>
So take that &quot;oh oh, I deserve this and I deserve that and I'm entitled to tank everything then heal myself for 1000 hps while lying completely impervious to attack on the ground,&quot; crap and shove it up your ass. No one here wants to listen to you whine. <p>Shelrabbi Hassida<BR>

<br>
are you the highest monk in your guild?  I know of a monk on my server who's over 1500 and he's not top on the server.  I don't know what warriors are capping out at.  Some of the AC on monk gear in north ToV and beyond is ridiculous though.  That's really where a lot of the problems become more obvious and if all this nerf does is reduce mitigation (effectively dropping AC), then these monks won't even be effected because they'll still be above the softcap.  Luclin continued the trend of high AC low weight all/all or all meleer gear.  Select pieces clearly never should have had &quot;MNK&quot; on them as a class that can use the item.  The easiest example is the ac20 +15str/wis belt that is easily obtained off xin thalls in maiden's eye.  The weight is 1.5.  For how easy it is to get, the ac is crazy for a monk, but Verant got lazy as time went on and didn't bother thinking about such things.<br>

Never said they could, less hps and no taunt made them not the first choice. But again monks could tank just fine<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That is why all the uber kunark weapons went in.&quot;<br>
every class got new weapons in rok.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your AC might have compared to a warrior with no gear, but you take a warrior in full crafted and put a monk in full whatever it's called and the warrior comes out way on top.&quot; <br>
Not true. I still had more AC then a warrior. Fully decked out monk pre rok to a fully decked out warriors both had over 900ac with monks haveing roughly 10-20ac more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, moving down to a different defensive table DOES work to make the fix.&quot;<br>
simply removeing the soft cap would have &quot;made the fix&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;It WILL stop monks from tanking.&quot;<br>
Monks are not the main tanks by choice now. As far as being rampage that wont change unless the mob rampages like AL. It wont stop monks from tanks exp mobs either. So what did you fix?<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't believe me? Wait til you freakin get hit by an uber mob after the nerf.&quot;<br>
glade you already have first hand exp with the nerf already:P<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You're gonna get your spine cracked. If you want an advance go try tanking even something as weak as rhag 1 with a ranger or rogue. LOL you're toast monkey.&quot;<br>
seen rangers tank rhag one just fine.<br>
<br>
&quot;FD doesn't work in every single situation so you try to downplay it?&quot;<br>
Not downplaying, just said its not a fail proof.<br>
<br>
&quot;LOL nice one, but we're not the morons over on MB.&quot;<br>
never mind:P<br>
<br>
&quot;The extra defensive skill I was wrong on, I forgot monks don't get parry, but block+higher avoidance &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;parry, so it comes out to essentially being an extra defensive skill.&quot;<br>
<br>
block roughly goes off 6-8% more then parry, but the bad thing is monks def skills don't work from behind ie when pulling.<br>

no it dosen't. now what you guys have to look forward to is the same realistic approch taken for you. i can't wait to see warrior's avoidance reduced by the same reports of 30% mitigation reduction the monk classes on test are reporting. lets see you lose 30% of your avoidance skill's it means 43% of the misses a mob is doing is going to land on you.after all you warrior's want is realistical combat set up's so your avoidance in your big heavy plate should also have it's penalty's. when this dose finaly happen i will laugh my butt off to!! simple thing is they already redesigning the uber mob encounters it would not have been one once diffrent if they raised the soft cap for plate classes they could have already retuned the mobs with the mod rod 2  changes but warrior's are realy stupid anyways all brawn no brain. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uleonardoe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>leonardoe</A> at: 10/11/02 7:11:47 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=121&stop=124>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=1386.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showNextMessage?topicID=1386.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=100><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.emailToFriend?topicID=1386.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.threadControl?topicID=1386.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1386.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1386.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
