me.<br>
<br>
Some warriors have some valid points, most paladins have valid points, but this 'knight' lumping gets to me. The most uberest of the uber lvl 60 AA stacked Shadow Knights may be out tanking your average to better lvl 60  warriors, but the average lvl 60 SK's aren't doing it. I suspect the same is true for paladins as well.<br>
<br>
I still don't see how you claim that warriors are no longer viable tanks because of the supreme advancements made to hybrid plate tanks /snicker.<br>
<br>
I&quot;ll start off by saying I'm happy I didn't see anyone mention Harm Touch as any sort of leverage to the SK class. Cause it isnt' after lvl 20.<br>
<br>
What you seem to miss is the fact that the average warrior is better at soaking up damage than any average knight class.<br>
You hit harder, faster, and more often.<br>
<br>
I don't see warriors missing 17-18 out of 30 swings, but I and other hybrids do this *consistently*<br>
<br>
That in itself is enough to sicken me sometimes, but I digress.<br>
<br>
Warriors have more hp than any other class in the game, and this isn't going to change. Again, it takes the most uberest equipped SK/Pal to match a warrior in HP. The AC softcap, I'm all for gettin rid of that. Warriors should have higher AC than any other class in the game.<br>
<br>
And that, in itself, sums it up for me. Higher AC by even an acknowledgeable margin settles your tanking dispute without question. (with added mitigation and avoidance depending, agreed). But head and shoulders above the rest? Game breaking screw up right there.<br>
<br>
Aggro maintenance is, like many have clearly stated (mostly paladins) a group effort. The warrior shouldn't be the undisputed king of aggro by any means. But he should be able to *keep* it, and so once again I agree that the taunt ability of a warrior should be adressed.<br>
<br>
But dont' ever accuse a shadow knight's watered down line of 60 and below spells being worth sitting head and shoulders below a warrior on tanking ability. <br>
<br>
Lower, yes. Noticeably lower, it already is.<br>
<br>
And don't knock your disciplines, because its like burning money in front of poor people. Our two (2) disciplines suck major ass in case you hadn't noticed, and with the new HT resists to our 55 disc, that's now even more useless than it was before.<br>
<br>
I love being in groups with warriors, cause in my opinion they kick ass. They can take the damage, and, despite what some of you think, they can dish it as well. There's a reason i have 'Others hits' turned off on my text options.<br>
<br>
I think you need to stop worrying about Bob the Sk and Joe the Paladin so much and start worring about Brutus the Warrior, cause its really getting annoying to hear all the 'but pal and sk can do this' crap. <br>
<br>
And I fully support every single pal/sk that came here and said that we took it up the ass for 3 years, because that's the absolute truth. You can request that we don't bring our past deficits into the thread, but the fact is, we sucked hind tit for so long that we like where we finally are.<br>

Gotta admit there is no small amount of hypocracy here when you see a 600 plus post whine thread (which people are routinely directed to as if it's the Warrior Bible) and then the same people go over to M-B and ridicule, taunt and goad the monks who are facing a huge nerf.

This part kills me right here. Tell me, what is your information based on? Numbers you pull out of your ass; I dont' doubt it. If you look at all the other posts on this site, many include log parses featuring paladins/SK's dealing about 85-95% as much damage as a non-tanking warrior. Keep in mind now; a warrior that's tanking will have to resort to duel-wielding and EB weapons to maintain agro (which paladins and SK's can already do, better than warriors). Because 2-handers deal far more damage on high-end mobs, paladins and SK's parse out more damage than a warrior. Do you see a problem here; I sure as hell do.<br>
<br>

<br>
About 5% of game encounters require a warrior to tank because of defensive/sligt hit pointedge. Don't feed me your @#%$ about the size difference. SoL has featured a decrease of about 10% HP between warriors and knights; whereas is knights had 75-80% as much HP as warriors, they now have 85-90%. Outside of this 5%; mobs can be tanked quite effectively by knights/even monks.<br>
<br>
At the current state, a top-notch paladin/SK can tank HP, AL, XTC and Cursed in ssra just fine. THere is no need for a warrior on these mobs, and this is not 2-year old content. Cursed is one of the hardest mobs in the game. So, if knights can tank the same mobs as warriors; why have warriors? They draw and hold agro far worse. THey can't heal themselves, they can't FD in case @#%$ goes wrong, they don't have buffs. Let's not even go into the fact that Shadowknights make FAR FAR better rampage tanks than warriors because they can FD if they miss a heal (a feature HUGE for rampage tanking because FD doesn't take you off hte list permanently, and when you get back up, you're back as rampage tank)<br>
<br>
Looking beyond this, let's check out Xp groups. Here's a hint for you; /disc defensive isn't used often in Xp groups. Used quite rarely actually. HP isn't as big of a deal in tanking XP groups. So, what could a warrior offer to a group that knights/monks (pre-nerf) couldn't? Monks have far better DPS and can pull better. Knights have their versatility; they can get agro better, they have spells. WHy have a warrior? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Lower, yes. Noticeably lower, it already is.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Tell me now, how do you figure it's noticeably lower? Is our mitigation level lower than yours? No, we share the same tables. Is our damage avoidance better, not much. We have higher caps, but the same skills. We have a difference of 700-900 hp; something a cheal rotation (if applicable) can be adjusted to fix. Oh, and our 3-minute wonder disc, which drops our DPS to about 20-30% lower than yours and severly hinders our ability to hold agro,to a level worse than it was without disc; something we are already far worse than knight at doing. <br>

And I fully support every warrior that says we took it up the ass pre-RoK, SoL, and the 3rd quarter of SoV. Hmm, that adds up to about 2-2.5 years as well. Thx. stupid argument. <p><center><p><font size = 3 colo = "blue"><b>Wilhelmm D'Averam<br>Warlord of the Apocalypse</b></font></p></center>
