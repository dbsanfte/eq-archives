I will save you all from a long post, since this isn't my board.  But I would like to see your ability to hold agro improved.  I would say if they gave you guys 80% of the agro holding ability of say an SK/Pally in an xp group that would be fair.<br>
<br>
From the posts earlier, while true it is the caster's fault he is getting agro, it is also a huge PITA for the caster to group with a warrior over a pally/sk right now due to agro issues.<br>

Yes there are other classes that could use help but since this is warrior board we'll keep it only pertained to this class. <br>
<br>
[b]DEFENSE SKILLS[/b]<br>
<br>
Honestly, like Furor said &quot; we need our own mitigation table &quot;. As the warrior should really stand out in his class vs others.<br>
<br>
Remove Defensive and Aggressive as a discipline. Instead make the warrior unique vs any other class by giving them a sliding bar to set their play style to the mob at hand. To the far left is full defensive where you take less and do less, the center which is you do full damage and mitigate as normal and to the far right is aggressive where you do more damage and take more in return. This can be altered at any time. <br>
<br>
Shields should all incorperate furious bash of the highest level when any warrior wields, reguardless of level. ALSO while using a shield the warrior  gains the ability of Block. The higher the level of warrior the higher the skill, thus a level 65 Warrior with a shield would have a 250 Block while wielding a shield which is balanced for losing DPS of a offhand weapon and is incentive to use one.<br>
<br>
Shield Skill. Only needs a little tuning where a person in defensive should be able to shield player. Other then that the skill is pretty good, though I would like a timer like a /dis to show me how much time I have left till its ready again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tactical Mastery Skill: Even at level 3 its ungodly how often mobs can dodge, parry and riposte. Turn the misses on and become quickly demoralized. This skill needs some help. Please retune it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hit points if the system should stay as is should be raised drastically for the warrior IF that is how the class is defined. 65 Warrior wearing the very best of every item should be a few thousand hitpoints higher then any other class. NOW if you used the skills I mention in this post then the hit points as they stand is fine. Best Magelo Warrior vs Best Magelo Paladin the difference is only by 500ish hit points. Though I hope their is more to the class of a warrior then a few hundred more hp and defense / evassive disciplines.<br>
<br>
Taunt. Ah the key that you only hit in frustration cuz it says  TAUNT. Personally I think Verant put that key in the game as a sick joke vs Warriors. They say if we could get agro at any time the game is broken, but its ok for Paladins to hold agro as they tank better in xp groups then us, and are better tanks vs boss mobs that dont require defensive to win. Nerfing the Paladin isn't the answer, stuns is part of their class BUT the taunt button for a warrior should have the agro of a stun, just not the effects. Enraging Blow weapon while nice, requires you to get &quot; lucky &quot; and hit a proc to help get you agro and isnt a sure thing on proc. Most Warriors will never see that kind of weapon nor should it be necessary for warriors to do thier job, which is tank.<br>
<br>
Area Effect Taunt: One of our best AA skills yet is a joke with a 15 minute reuse time, 10ish with additional AA skills. Make it 5 Minutes and 2.5 Minutes with AA skills. Don't tell me that would be broken either, Healing Wave of Marr/Prexus from a Paladin is AE Taunt with a faster refresh time and heal to boot.<br>
<br>
<br>
[b]Offensive Skills[/b]<br>
<br>
Flurry. Great skill when you see how a mob uses it, but a joke when you see how often it goes off for a warrior. This skill is linked as a chance to go off when a triple attack is scored but should be changed to check for when a double attack goes off instead. Higher Dex should also help increase in the skill going off, thus being crippled would lower the chances.<br>
<br>
Fury. We were once the only class with this eye candy skill. Since most of us use 1H weapons the crits did very little to boost DPS, with 2H you could see a improvement on DPS. Other classes that do more damage in larger chunks can make far better use out of this then us. With Fury of the Ages warriors should have a chance to also turn their Crits into Crippling hits, reguardless of where their life is at.<br>
<br>
2H weapons: This goes for every class that can use. Verant you have made alot of high damage 2H with delays dropping below 28 which is the old cut off level for high damage bonus's. Having a 2H weapon with 40 Damage and 25 Delay is CRAP if the damage bonus is only 14, like a 1H weapon. Hell many Knight class's call em crap loot and continue to use their Golden Rods, which should tell ya something since the Cursed Cycle is now very gimp compared to PoP Bosses. Please go back and recalibur these new 2H in PoP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In PoP the items are for the most part CRAP. The items in Tier 1 through 3 are garbage for the most part ( 90% of the items ) if you have any VT gear for the risk vs reward.In the Elemental planes we get our best shoulders which have, get this, ONLY 25 FEKING AC on the puresteel pauldrons and have fun killing the mob that drops em. Was the AC cap raised? Appears so, that at 1800 and 2000 seems to have noticable differences. Be warned! AC items in PoP are horrible! Not only do they have horrible AC but the risk vs reward is not just and needs some serious work. Elemental Armor is where its at BUT the items are not on your standard yard trash which hit in the 900 range along with special abilities but off rare names ( several day spawns )! Even those nameds don't always drop Elemental Armor. Legs and BP (is unsure at this time) only drop off the last Boss in each elemental zone, and even then its a random type of leg and its not a sure drop. How many people wear plate in your guild? <br>
<br>
Bottom line is the warriors, as I mentioned as have other posts before mine, still need some help. Also developers need to go through PoP and adjust the items stats / effects and weigh them properly for risk vs reward.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: I mention several comparisons vs Paladins. This isn't an attempt to nerf them but I look at what they do well. Hopefully through comparisons Sony will decide to help warriors, NOT to nerf Paladins.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solinarinnoruuk>Solinar Innoruuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 276<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/15/03 7:53:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Improve or not the warriors?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>AC items in PoP are horrible!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Not true. AC ALL ALL items in PoP are horrible, as they should be. We dont need monks or rangers or rogues with 2k AC.<br>

Warriors Raex's armor is huge AC upgrades of 20-40AC in every slot except the helm. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeniabigbootea>Zenia Bigbootea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/17/03 1:01:04 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Improve or not the warriors?</span><hr size=1> nm... wasted effort <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeniabigbootea>Zenia Bigbootea</A> at: 1/18/03 1:40:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zhaun>Zhaun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/22/03 4:49:15 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Improve or not the warriors?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Remove Defensive and Aggressive as a discipline.

Frenzied / Agressive / Normal / Evasive / Defensive<br>

<br>
There would have to be a penalty for being in full aggressive mode, and if you are able to instantly switch out, there isn't. <br>
<br>
3 levels: aggressive, normal, defensive. You can switch from aggressive or defensive to normal, but not directly from defensive to aggressive, or vice versa. Make a timer that allows you to switch at most every 1?3? minutes. Have them change offense/defense by +20%/-20%, 0/0, -20%/+20%. There would be a real penalty for being caught in the wrong mode.<br>

The Elemental Armor was never really in question, but when you look for Rings, Earrings, Belts, Shoulders, Masks and Range Slot items you will find the AC leaves alot to be desired. I agree that non plate classes shouldn't get high AC to the point like Velious and SoL gave them but if you look at the warrior only items they are lacking in AC. The best warrior shoulders in PoP are 25 AC, while there are several shoulders with much better AC for far less risk from older expansions. In many cases VT items won't be replaces due to them have a stellar Stats, AC, Saves and Effects which can't be made up for infinetly harder item to obtain, for a measly 20 more hp or 20 more mana with a huge loss of AC and saves.<br>

<br>
There needs to be actually no time penalty for doing this, otherwise warriors are back to square one. The proposed plan of shifting your attack type should happen at the users discretion and instantly. Any weapons masters can go from all out attack, or to a basic stance ( normal ), to a very evassive stance, or to a very defensive stance at a moments notice,  thus there is no reason to have a penalty for doing.<br>
<br>
The penalty already comes into play when you enter the stance. Defensive was you take 30 to 40% less damage while you deal out 30 to 40% less damage. Evassive is you get hit less yet you hit for less as well. Aggressive is you deal 20 to 30% more damage yet you get hit for 20 to 30% more. Aggressive would give warriors a higher DPS but they have to open themsleves up to do so. Hell when you are fighting mobs in the Elemental Planes that Quad + Flurry over 2k, how long would a warrior last with 9k HP in Aggressive? Or Scale this example down to a tank who is 6k HP vs AoW who Quads for 1000ish + Flurry. Or would you go aggressive vs mobs who AE rampage? That MT dies or you get turned on just once you are paste if your in aggressive. <br>
<br>
<br>
Warriors need a real advantage for people to consider when choosing which class they want for their party make up, and since the Warrior comes with no utility and most XP group rarely if ever require them to use a Discipline likes Evassive or Defensive, what does that leave the warrior to offer? 10% more damage then a Paly/SK and where everyone has to wear baby gloves on letting the warrior get agro, thus slowing down the group, thus slowing down xp, not to mention ping ponging causes more mana from the healers which equals more down time.<br>
<br>
Imagine a Chanter, Shaman and Cleric, sitting in a PoP zone where the mobs hit for 500 to 900ish triple attack. They are forming a xp group to work on AA pts. They do a /who LFG and here is what they see.<br>
<br>
65 Paladin LFG<br>
65 Warrior LFG<br>
65 Monk LFG<br>
65 Rogue LFG<br>
65 SK LFG<br>
65 Ranger LFG.<br>
<br>
Which would they choose? More then likely they would go with Paladin to tank, Monk to pull, and Rogue for serious DPS or Ranger for serious DPS + Utility buffs + Snare.<br>
<br>
Lets take another example where a Cleric, Bard, Shaman, Rogue, Rogue are looking for last member to fill a spot in the same type of XP zone as mentioned in previous example. They do a /who LFG and here is what they see.<br>
<br>
65 Warrior LFG<br>
65 Paladin LFG <br>
65 SK LFG<br>
<br>
Which class would they choose as their Tank Class? Since I have 65 Cleric with Divine Arbitration I would go with the Paladin for Wave of Prexus or Marr, not mention BMB or BSS, and superior agro control with stuns and heals.. Some would probably go with SK for the Feign Pulling Ability. <br>
<br>
<br>
Yet both classes mentioned were above the warrior. Why? The warrior offers nothing to the group. 500 more hitpoints is one extra swing with the down side of not being able to command agro at will. Even with 2 EB weapons they are waiting for procs, which during this time the party is put on sharp glass on how they manage their agro. If the warrior opens with a proc or two life is good, if not they go for AE taunt ( 15 minutes or 10.5 with AA ) or they stand and watch the party die.<br>
<br>
If you add the proposed slider bar, the warrior become much more attractive, though it doesn't completely cure the warrior but goes a long way in doing so. Now a party would have to consider this.<br>
<br>
1) Warrior while haveing a slight hit point to help keep them alive, can now mitigate full time better then any class hands down. This alone would make them attractive to healing classes. Aggressive would allow a 2nd Warrior in group to contribute much more DPS even if they do so at a reckless pace, and will be forced to carefully balance his agro.The Second Warrior can switch in to tank mode should the Primary Tank die. Note that warriors can AE taunt and /shield should the going get rough.<br>
<br>
2) Paladins while doing slightly less DPS then warrior, will have supreme agro control. Not only that, but with high level stuns, they to can mitigate damage or buy time for that CH. Healing Wave series of spells can be augmented for over 2K crits. The group heal not only heals efficently but is also a great AE taunt. Need to save someone on the fly then Lay of Hands does just that or maybe toss in a root to hold off an add. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bottom line is Verant did some stellar work in rounding off the Paladin into a very exciting and playable class from what it used to be. Warriors needs some serious overhauling as the class is only living off of 2 Discipline Skills that they recieved at level 52 and 55 and even those are restricted to by time. So for 3 minutes out of 7 minutes for Evassive and 10 minutes for Defensive does the warrior mitigate damage better then a hybrid and even then Warriors only shine vs mobs that hit for over 2K and is impossible to keep a heal cycle on w/o them dieing, those mobs are far and few. At the current rate your guild might be asking Warriors to get a good shield, max out your /shield Discipline to 48 Seconds and get into a shielding order to keep the Paladin or SK alive vs the boss mobs.<br>

<br>
If you aren't getting hit, what is the penalty for reducing your defense by 20-30%? If you were able to switch instantly, there would essentially be no penalty at all for being in aggressive stance. As soon as you got aggro, you would be able to switch instantly into defensive. The negative effects of being in the aggressive stance would be pointless.<br>
<br>
I don't think having some kind of time dependent restriction on it (within reason) would remove its usefullness. Being able to specialize for either damage output or tanking ability without having to burn a /disc would be a massive improvement. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686">Graal MacBladefury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Being able to switch at will removes any kind of skill from using the ability. &quot;I'm not getting hit&quot; *click* Agressive. &quot;I'm getting hit&quot; *click* Defensive. Kinda boring to me.<br>
<br>
Now, if there was a time per setting to switch, then it would require more forethought, on the other hand if there was too much of a switch it would really hurt. Say it takes 10seconds (as an example, dunno how goo that number really is) to switch and there is 5 settings for the &quot;switch&quot; (Frenzy, Agressive, Normal, Evasive, Defensive):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Example1</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
WarriorA is Tanking AoW (just as an example) he is on Defensive for the first few seconds of the fight until the Rotation can get started. At that point if he is feeling confident he can shift up one level to Evasive to improve his DPS/Agro. If the raid is short on healers or there is bad lag, he can stay on Defensive to make it easier on the healers.<br>
<br>
WarriorB is second on the Main Tank list and is not tanking. He stays at Evasive attack setting so he is dealing Ok damage but if WarriorA falls he can step in with AE Taunt, grab agro and already be iin Evasive mode and only be 10seconds away from Defensive mode to help the CHeal Rotation start back up.<br>
<br>
WarriorC is like 5th on the Tank list, he should never have to tank (we hope) so he starts off in Frenzied mode to get the best DPS he can out. He has to be careful about getting on Rampage becasue he is 20seconds away from having no defense penalty (in Normal mode) and may very well be dead in those 20 seconds from a healthy Rampage or two. Also, as the fight goes on and tanks start dropping, WarriorC can slowly edge himself down from Frenzied mode so that by the time he is next in line to tank he will hopefulling be ready in Evasive mode or at least close to it.<br>
<br>
Sounds a hell of a lot more fun and interesting than turning on autoattack and going AFK to me.<br>
<br>
How about XP groups?:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Example2</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->:<br>
<br>
WarriorA goes out to pull, and slides to full Defensive mode in case anything unfortunate happens on the pull. He finds a mob and brings it back, he starts the 10second slide into Evasive mode and stays in Evasive mode for the Cleric and Slower to get thier groove going and then has the choice of staying Evasive or sliding up or down depending on the mob difficulty.<br>
<br>
WarriorB in the group stands around waiting for WarriorA to bring the pull in in Normal mode. This way, if things turn to @#%$ in the first few seconds of the mob hitting the camp (not that that ever happens) he is able to bang out AE Taunt and start tanking sliding into Evasive mode. If things are fine he can slide himself up into Agressive or Frenzied mode (depending on zone, group, etc) and actually deal some decent DPS.<br>
<br>
Wow, sounds a lot better to me. An alternate way would be able to instantly Switch one spot over but not be able to switch again for several seconds. This would have good and bad as well. Instant switching is fast reaction but if you're not within one &quot;step&quot; of where you need to be you may be screwed. Eitherway, the delay is important to the &quot;strategy&quot; of using it and will be another thing to make the real, skilled Warriors stand out from the WarBots and WarGimps<br>
<br>
Just change the Disciplines this intrudes on into short (15-30sec?) versions that stack with this &quot;Stance Slider&quot; and wow, you got some pretty cool stuff going. Sure, a Warrior may then be able to have somthing like 50% or 70% mitigation or damage increase for a few seconds but I don't see that as a horrible thing. Warriors should tank like champs and kick a little ass when needed.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rambling, the idea just stuck in my head and had to get it out. I doubt this is a reasonably expected change they would do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soulflayerdwagonslayer>Soulflayer Dwagonslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/03 4:34:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Improve or not the warriors?</span><hr size=1> The reason for having fast changes is that once you get agro, you will take a set of hits before you can make the change. You wont see it comming as you can't see where you stand on the mobs agro list and you will get a full round of attacks against you. In PoP at the upper levels of play, one round of attacks at an adjusted 20 to 30% more damage will kill a Warrior flat out.<br>
<br>
Take for example Offassa in Plane of Water. He is a mob that hits for 2k x4, Flurrys and has a AE DoT that reduces AC, HP, Mana and Slows. Lets say you have 6 Warriors present at the raid. You will not see any of them use aggressive if its a 15 second to 30 second change, as Offassa can one round a 10k hp tank, so all the Warriors other then MT will be doing really nothing during this time. If they all stay in defensive they lose ALOT of DPS, if they go aggressive they wont make the switch in time to defensive. The change of stances does nothing to mobs that AE Rampage other then the warrior will probably be fighting in a regular ( non bonus ) stance. Even the XP mobs in the Elemental Planes hit for 600 to 900 fairly fast and mitigate slow, lose the Tank and the warrior who is in aggressive will get pulverized when he gets hit as those 900 point hits are turned into 1200 point hits. Gain a add while fighting and if it by chance gains agro on the warrior in aggressive then you can pretty much write him off.<br>
<br>
IF a pause was needed after play testing, then maybe a 5 second pause where the warrior loses the ability to attack for 5 seconds to make the change. Thus for those 5 seconds he stuck in his old stance. 5 seconds might not seem long but thats usually 2 to 3 full set of attacks, not to mention loss of DPS during that time. This would allow warriors in a raid who are 4th or further down the MT line to adjust their play style to be an offensive warrior to help DPS in raid, rather then adding lag.<br>
<br>
Any ways this was a fun idea to come up with. I highly doubt Verant / Sony would ever consider it as they see no problem with the warrior. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=treage>Treage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/03 4:50:35 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Improve or not the warriors?</span><hr size=1> Make it so the ability can't be switched once engaged in combat and the mob is still alive.

This would remove the trivial &quot;getting hit slide to defensive, not getting hit slide to aggresive&quot; mid swing scenerio from the equation.<br>
<br>
I'd just be happy if I could taunt a regular exp mob without having to have end-game equipment to do it while a stock Paladin/SK can do it effortlessly with store bought spells.<br>
<br>
Though VI uses Warriors as a measuring stick for melee balance, I think they either need to tone back the others a bit or raise us to their level. Raising us only adds to mud-flation, and lowering them adds to discontent. Neither of which is an easy choice to make.<br>

2. More options as far as weaponry for the warrior that can't quite attain that BoC or similar. And even perhaps for the warriors that can. Procs are almost everything when it comes to solid warrior taunt it seems. Those @#%$ 17/20 125hp 200dd/dot proc CLR DRU SHM weapons are pissing me off. Same with the SK PAL only 2-handers.<br>
3. Make our taunt button better. I know it was 'improved' a couple dozen or so patches ago but <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Side note: When in an exp group, timing the use of the taunt button according to when the enchanter/shaman/etc lands tash/malo/slow/dot/crit nuke is important. Taunting immediately after helps to maintain or regain aggro. Of course this means you must pay attention to your group's casting spam, and its impossible to do that while in a large raid situation. But taunt still sucks, yeah.<br>

Suggest to Sony that warriors be given an ability of nearly the same effectiveness (NOT aaxp based but nerfed in some way so it doesn't trivialise high level raids) and you might get somewhere?<br>

You can either improve warriosr and break the game some more to balance the gap in aggro generation or you can bring Paladins back to where they should be.  I don't know much about SK keeping aggro because all the ones I grouped with prefer to aggro buff me while they use their mana to contribute more damage instead of showing off how cool their aggro spells are.  This is the way it should be.  A SK should be able to outaggro a warrior if using up mana, but has no reason to if a warrior is present because the mana can be spent into dealing more damage. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kalanathemighty>Kalana The Mighty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.animfactory.com/animations/people_m_z/vikings/vikings_fighting_md_wht.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/03 7:49:43 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.drfun.com/ani/reddragon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Improve or not the warriors?</span><hr size=1> I'd like it if they added AA's that would give us innate procs, daoc had them as rvr skills when you had enough points.<br>
<br>
Wonderful things likes taunting styles and whatnot would be great but the combat system of EQ won't support it.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, Eq has more and better content than any other mmropg. More carrots to chase and more goals to attain. Daoc had a vastly superior combat system. Never did my melees have to rely on procs or whatnot to hold aggro.<br>
<br>
Some suggested aa's i'd like to see are:<br>
<br>
Enraging blow type aa ability: could use say once every 50 sec to 2 mins. A one time hit that adds the same ammount of hate that a single proc of an eb weapon would give. This would still leave those weapons highly desired as it would give you more hate overall but this AA would give a warrior the chance to grab a significant amount of hate right off the bat at the beginning of a pull.<br>
<br>
AA ability to give us effects on our hits at random, such as for example similar to crits and crips:<br>
<br>
Hits that cause a bleeding effect like a dot ( call it Critical Strike)<br>
<br>
Hits that cripple a mob as in breaking bones etc.... ( Bonecrusher)<br>
<br>
Hits that stun a mob at random while generating an appropriate amount of hate.(Dazing Strike)<br>
<br>
Pre 60 in non pop zones these things are not needed.<br>
<br>
My suggestion is to either add these as post 60 aa abilities or make them skills gained from 61 to 65. These would be innate passive skills that would go off like berserk, crits, crips do now.<br>
<br>
An increase of 10% in dmg mitigation is called for too imho.<br>
<br>
I really do not care what a knight class can do, i don't care if they get nerfed or not. I want my class fixed. My suggestions would do alot for warriors without relying on items or making taunt a game breaking skill.<br>
