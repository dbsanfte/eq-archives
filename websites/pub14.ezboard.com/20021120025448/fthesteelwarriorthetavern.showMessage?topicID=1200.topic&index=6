Hopefuly the warriors' better skill at arms maintains the damage balance difference -not counting SU3 &lt;-- not debateing SU3 balance here.--.  <br>
<br>
As for the second best healer in eq?  The mini CH's of druids and shaman will change that so paladins will be ahead of rangers, bards and necros and yet behind cleric/druid/shaman.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways that all aside what do warriors think of the idea?<br>
<br>
If mob can't kill the target PC in X seconds the mob will automaticaly move the next person to aggro it to top of it's hate list. Be it a hit or a heal landing or what ever aggro used. That'd pretty much allow vi to make obsolete any non war/pal/sk from tanking. If vi then wants to expand this idea to make certain classes tank better in some zones, all they need to do is add/subtract PC's from the list of X seconds rule.<br>
<br>
Well?<br>
Show me flaws how this would ruin eq?  Show me why this is a good or bad idea?  <br>

<br>
If MobX cannot kill the PC that it is targetting after Y seconds, he switches?<br>
<br>
So... Warrior01 is tanking for 30 seconds. Warrior01 is still alive. MobX clears his hate list and goes after Ranger01 because the ranger got the first hit in after the 30 seconds? This is good for warriors how exactly? Seems more like a boon to SK's, since after MobX aggros Ranger01, SK01 can cast and grab aggro back.<br>

<br>
If mob can't kill the target PC, and target PC isn't the class(es) ment to tank the mob then, in X seconds the mob will automaticaly move the next person to top of it's hate list that aggroed said mob. Be it a hit or a heal landing or anything else. That'd pretty much allow vi to make obsolete which classes tank which mobs. All vi need to do is add/subtract PC's from the list of X seconds rule.<br>
<br>
Example. <br>
Zone: Fear<br>
List of players who mob will only attack maximium of x seconds -in this case 20 seconds- <br>
Enchanters<br>
Clerics<br>
Bards<br>
Rogues<br>
Monks<br>
Wizards<br>
Mages<br>
Rangers<br>
Beastlords<br>
Necrmoancers<br>
Druids<br>
Shaman.<br>
<br>
This means the only classes not affected by the X list are warriors/paladins/shadowknights. <br>
<br>
If vi wanted to make those three classes unable to tank they'd add them to the X list.<br>
If vi wanted to make enchanters tank they'd take only them off the X list.<br>
<br>
To further complicate this as to avoid round house tanking vi could add a random Y factor where X seconds would be randomly between 5 and 30 seconds there by makeing round house tanking unreliable.<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Definition<br>
ROUNDHOUSE TANKING, is when pc's attack a mob and anyone getting hit by the mob turns off attack and those only gets some of the damage before the mob changes to a new target.<br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
The hope is through this code vi could make mobs require certain tanks. Currently monks and rangers and rogues are tanking many things once left only to war/pal/sk and usualy only war. With this code vi could decide exactly who's ment to tank which mob. It would also keep those who soloed mobs still able to solo them for they only have 1 name on the hate list.<br>
<br>
Think about it. Through the use of this veriable list and verable X factor vi could make mobs chaotic unless tanked by the class(es) vi wants tanking it.<br>
<br>
Hope this time I've made it easier to understand. If you get it what do you think of it?<br>

Ever? Or are you saying that after 20 seconds the mob will top attacking him and go after whoever is next on the agro list but if the next person is a wizard lets say and the cleric builds up agro again then its right back to square one? This is an odd solution imo. Seems overly complicated when the REAL solution is to merely remove that stupid ac cap and take monks and knights off of a few of the best drops so that warriors can continue to have their spot as raid mt. By best drops, btw, I mean some of the items that have 80 ac and 125hp on them and weigh nothing lol. Crap like that that should NEVER have been all/all.<br>

Hopefuly along enough time to kill a pure caster but a short enough time to make monks and rangers and rogues non viable tanks.<br>
<br>
With the list able to be changed from zone to zone or if possible mob to mob vi could decide which tanks will be used in which zones/mobs by the mere absense of them on the &quot;X list&quot;<br>
<br>
i.e. in west commons eq puts this X list in<br>
Enchanters<br>
Necromancers<br>
Wizards<br>
Magicians<br>
Clerics<br>
Shaman<br>
Druids<br>
Monks<br>
Rangers<br>
Beastlords<br>
<br>
leaveing War/Pal/Sk off the list<br>
<br>
The time on holding aggro is max of 12 seconds at which point the mob puts the current most hated pc to the bottom of it's hate list and puts the very next person who does anything to aggro it on top of it's hate list by 50 points.<br>
<br>
The only classes that the mob disregards this rule to are war/pal/sk.  If a War/Pal/Sk is at top of the list then they stay there.<br>
<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
Now lets say in kith vi wants only sk's and wars to tank.  They then add the paladin to the X list and paladins aggro is to chaotic to rely on.  vi also decided in kith to make the time holding aggro for non tanks to be random of 5-30 seconds before changeing.<br>
<br>
This mean if anyone but a war/sk isn't tanking then every 5-30 seconds the mob jumps to a new pc.<br>
<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
Useing this system would allow vi to set tanks for every zone/mob they wanted to set tanks for. <br>
-------<br>
If this codeing can be done mob specific instead of just zone wise then vi could make two tanks required in some zones.<br>
<br>
i.e.<br>
KC all undead would have a list of only pal/sk, while all live ones would have a list of only warrior.  This then requires groups to have a warrior to tank the live mobs and a pal/sk to tank the dead mobs.  There by makeing for the first time in eq multiple tanks needed in exp groups.  so instead of 1 tank and 4 damage dealers and 1 healer a group would need 2 tanks and 3 damage dealers and 1 healer.  The best part is vi could make it so pal/sk weren't always head to head with warriors for a group slot.  i.e. the group needs a hybrid and a warrior.  <br>

the loop holes I left in it are to allow vi to select the class they want to tank any mob. <br>

For example say vi thought in a out door setting where a particular mob needed to be found.  If vi saw to make rangers the only tank in this special setting then they so could do it.   The loop hole is to be used spareingly as to not upset game balance but to allow vi to adjust balance for story line or real reasons.  <br>

So in your mind, monks should no longer be capable of tanking then? You DID realize that monks have always been tanks right? What you would prefer is making it so we have no real choice in the matter of who tanks what since vi SAYS we should use such and such as tanks. Im FAIRLY sure considering the direction Verant has been going that they wouldnt go for your idea sine the last couple of patches seem aimed at making the game a lot less dependant on a single class. Increased hate producing spells, better heals on druids and shaman, giving clerics the ability to tank at LEAST semi effectively, all these are serving to make it so NO class is &quot;needed&quot; at least not like they were in the kunark days. They are tending towards generalizing the set roles we are used to so I DOUBT that they would suddenly step back and say,&quot;We have decided that only warriors, paladins, and sks should tank in this zone, all others attempting to tank will be pevented from doing so. Have a nice day.&quot;<br>
Sorry man, but I disagree with you on this idea, its way too confining for this game to survive by but I have to give you brownie points for at least TRYING to come up with a different idea.<br>

<br>
It is cumbersome, but it WOULD lead to Verant having a lot more options for tweaking encounters and screwing with the players minds.  (&quot;What the hell?  Last week AOW would only stick on Shadowknights, now he only cares about RANGERS?  WTF?!?!?!!&quot;)  I can actually imagine Verant implementing it solely for that purpose in fact.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
The game is in the hands of Verant, who often seem not to know what they are doing.  This would at least allow them to specifically control who can tank what.  But that would also remove a LOT of the interest in the game, since pretty much every encounter that was controlled in this manner would be virtually micromanaged by Verant.<br>
<br>
I can see a whole list of possibilities there, though.  Verant would positively LOVE it.  They could make a mob that procs a hate reduction spell, and then assign it to ONLY BE TANKED BY WARRIORS.  Without any fixes to warrior taunt, that encounter would certainly be a nightmare. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=268670" target="new"><img src="http://www.emeraldis.com/~booraembj/smallbah.jpg" align=left> </a> <br> <br> <br><center><font face="coronet, comic sans ms" font size="6" font color="191970"><span style='filter:glow(color=#87ceeb,strength=3);width:100%'> Aragir Lancot</span> </font><BR>

<br>
Tanking is fun as hell.  Many players find nothing more fun then getting hit by mobs.  You may have stayed with the warrior because you enjoyed lasting longer then others when tanking.  I stayed with the paladin because I loved makeing totaly sure I was the only one hit in most groups.  And I'm sure by now many monks have a taste for tanking non solo and I'm as sure some rangers never lost the taste for tanking.   However that doesn't change the fact that war/pal/sk are supposed to be the main tanks and current mechanics don't make tanking stack well.  Even with this new mechanics the optimal tanking classes still remain at 3.  That's 1 5th of the everquests classes able to tank.  We realy don't need more classes tanking in general.<br>

Anyway back to your idea.  I could see Verant putting something like this in, as was said, simply to mess with us.  From a players standpoint, more specifically a Warrior, wouldn't fixing taunt accomplish the same thing?  If I understand the intent of taunt, isn't it designed to allow us to regain agro at regular intervals?  I'm not sure how but I'm thinking there would be some way of exploiting the agro timer? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udobbanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dobbanz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 227<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/6/02 10:12:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1200.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Idea</span><hr size=1> /agree about softcap. /shiver lol Im sure they would probably &quot;remove&quot; the cap by giving orc pawns an att of 1000 and scaling up from there at first, but since they quickly fixed the exp thing I have hope that they would eventually figure out that the best way is to make more ac count for more and not the ac we have count for less. Oh and seventh, there ARE other tank classes, wether you think there should be or not. Trying to arrange it so that its impossible for monks and rangers to tank except in a few exp zones is a bad idea. I think the collective screams of rage would echo across the face of the earth lol. <br>
As it is, rangers are not being used as tanks on uber encounters, monks are mainly being used as rampage tanks or tank mezzes on mobs in zones like Vex Thall. In other words, those two classes really arent much of a threat to the mt thing on high end raids and NO, if you are raiding ssra and above Vindi does NOT count as high end anymore. So stop trying to reduce other classes draw to be in an exp group since this plan wont be affecting raids much at all. Remember, those people who are reporting monks being able to tank those adds in Vex Thall are at the level where they can have druids tank rhag1 for fun.<br>

<br>
Just seems having a garunteed way for certain classes to shed aggro could be exploited, even with a random timer to it.<br>
<br>
Also, lets look at this code. Each mob now needs at least 15 more datapoints to it- Who can tank, and who can not. Times the number of mobs in game, and you are putting a new load on the Servers and redoing the MOB database- Remeber what happened when they reworked the item database to add focus effects?<br>

It is more and more common to see rangers return to the role of tanking. A role they lost in RoK and got compensated for with higher melee damage and later higher bow damage. It is also becoming common for monks to tank mobs. These two classes should be discourage to tank. However nerfing them isn't a option and it would create many problems with them soloing. These are the reasons aggro needs to be changed. The change in theory follows and is easy.<br>
<br>
Aggro change step 1 Give mobs a check list. &quot;If current target isn't a war/pal/sk/pet, (the list is made to be changeable on a mob by mob basis and is called the x list) then count z seconds and then put target at bottom of hatelist. z seconds would be a random number from 2-20 seconds on most exp mobs and 3-30 on most 61-70 lvl mobs and 1-5 on any rampageing mobs and 7-50 on any other boss mobs. Enchanters/Wizards/Magicians/Necromancers/Shaman/Druid then delay count 10 seconds.<br>
The list could change from mob to mob and zone to zone.<br>
<br>
This is a hard change to aggro. However it doesn't change the following things<br>
1 Aggro can still change before the clock finishes counting<br>
2 The soloing person is still the only one on hate list<br>
3 This doesn't hurt pet tanking for those who use it.<br>
<br>
This added line is only ment to be on mobs med 45th lvl and higher.<br>
<br>
Added Advantage. <br>
With the x list line being able to be set for each type of mobs verant could now make tanking stack in exp groups.<br>
<br>
An example<br>
<br>
In Karnor's Castle <br>
<br>
All live mobs would have only warriors on their x list. There by making the warriors the only class able to tank live mobs in that zone.<br>
<br>
All undead mobs would have paladins and shadowknights on their x list. There by making the only classes able to tank the undead mobs being paladins and shadowknights. <br>
<br>
These two things then requires groups wishing to use tanks to use both a warrior and a knight class. <br>
<br>
<br>
This same formula would allow you to make a few rare spawns only tankable by monks or rangers or beastlords ect. if the the story line called for it or in a specific case game balance required it. <br>
<br>
Also by removeing everyone on the &quot;x&quot; list vi could make a boss mob much harder with little alteration to current mob stats and perhaps even with mobs with lower stats. <br>
<br>
If warriors' AoE taunts threaten the balance of a mob using this &quot;x&quot; factor then a simple lowering of the random &quot;z&quot; seconds to a random seconds of 1-3 would make even that potential gimmick unusable to break that mob.<br>
<br>
<br>
That would fix the tanking situation without haveing to change the ac to godly amounts for traditional tanks. <br>
------------------<br>
<br>
To address the &quot;all monk group&quot;  Monks can always shed aggro by getting FD in and they can do it at will.   Trying to round house tank with a group of monks just useing the random aggro durration facotor is far less efficeint then useing FD.  However a druid and monk and rogue may well find their group less effiecent just like a low dps group has problems or a low healing group has concerns.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/7/02 1:32:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1200.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reworked it some and now have this.</span><hr size=1> Seventh,<br>

What separates good ideas from bad ones is that good ideas have a chance of actually being implemented.  <br>
<br>
Adding an integer to damage tables = not that difficult<br>
<br>
Reprogramming aggro to some pollyannish formula to make Seventhsword happy = Redesigning Everquest<br>
<br>
Plus, it's not real bright to begin with based on the increase numbers of calculations necessary actually lagging out encounters.  It's a poor idea any way you slice it.<br>
<br>
There's a better way to accomplish a similar thing, and it's already going to be implemented in PoP.   Just know this:   Vallon Zek is going to be a FUN fight when it comes to aggro/tanking.<br>
