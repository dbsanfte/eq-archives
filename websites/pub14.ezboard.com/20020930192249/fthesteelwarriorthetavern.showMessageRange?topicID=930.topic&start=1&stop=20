I remember quite well after the &quot;boss mob&quot; in EK was killed, a few guildies and I went to Rathe, because we heard the mobs there were dropping some of the best GM loot around (come to find out, it was basically the same stuff that was dropping in EK).  Well, a group of 6 of us took off into the mountains after a few of the phantom steeds and ghouls that were running about.  I was about level 24 at the time, with everyone else being around 30-45.  <br><br>We circled the first hill to the right past the merchant village, heading toward the Giant area, when the biggest, most horrific monster I'd ever seen comes circling the hill and heads straight for us!  I was lucky enough to get a screenshot before his landed a 500dmg breath weapon on me, followed by two quick 180 dmg-a-piece snaps of his mighty maw which left me dead.  <br><br>After 5 people in our party died, the monk (who happened to FD right before he bought it too) took all of our corpses to the Feerott zone, where a cleric with a click-stick was rezzing people.  My lord, when I looked around after my rez, there were about 150 bodies lying around still waiting for rezzes, and another 80 people waiting for the effects to wear off before heading back out.  <br><br>I met the Bone Reaver 7 times that day.  All in all, I lost about two full blue bubbles of experience, even after 7 click-stick-rezzes.  But even as frightening (and sometimes, frustrating) as is was, I walked away with 4 nice GM items, including my Pendant of the Warlord and Runebladed Sword of Night, which I still use on occasion to this day.   <br><br>Now, I just can't wait to meet my own deity someday in the Plane of War!  <br><br>Heugel Sabre'ur<br>Level 52 Half-Elven Champion<br>Tribunal of Norrath, Saryrn <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ushikariiapoccalypse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shikarii Apoccalypse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>All in the reflexes</BR>Steel Warrior Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 1535<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 11:12:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=930.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Scariest NPC</span><hr size=1> o/t a bit; but that Halloween Event was the most fun I ever had in EQ; even with dying a billion times.
