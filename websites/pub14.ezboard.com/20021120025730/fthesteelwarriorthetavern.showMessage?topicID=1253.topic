So much loss. So much. So close.

I don't remember any of the drive through Seattle traffic from that point on.<br>

I got to work and was numb the whole day, thinking of my guildmate and longtime friend Gmuk who worked in that area and wracking my brain to try and remember if he worked in the WTC.

<br>
I was at work here at the 4th largest transfusion medicine center.  My husband called me at work with the first crash, I turned on the radio here and listened while I worked.  Hubby ended up calling me 4 times that day, once for every crash. I finally told him not to call me unless it was an emergency - we had gone on alert here and were preparing blood to be flown through the FAA barrier to NYC and Washington.  We were the only ones to get thru via the air and since we normally do testing for the Eastern seaboard, the plane was restocked with freshly donated blood to be tested.<br>
<br>
I was too busy to be in shock and I can't say I ever had been afterwards.  I learned that an old friend was missing in the Pentagon.  I used to work in Mahattan on Park Ave.  Just too much for the brain to wrap itself around and I don't like to ride the emotional rollercoaster if I can help it.<br>

I am not sure that I, or the rest of America can comprehend what it feels like to be under constant threat the way it must have been during the times of near weekly IRA car bombings and other violence, or the way Isreal's citizens feel in the face of frequent attacks.  The stark contrast is the magnitude of the attack on September 11th.  More people were killed in that one day than all the victims that have been killed in Isreal and Palestine since Oct 2000.<br>
<br>
Anyway, last year I was working at Circuit City after having been laid off.  There were few customers at that time of the morning and the whole store just stood in shock in the cideo department.  It was too surreal.  None of us could believe it at first.  We immediately thought it was deliberate as neither plane seemed to be out of control.  Beyond that thought we just looked dumbly at each other and the televisions, wanting for explanations, and too numb to say much of anything. <p><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5309"target="_blank"alt = "Korak's Megalo Profile"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR = 10,10,900><b>Korak Sarathai - Barbarian Warlord - The Hand</b></FONT><BR></a><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12530"target="_blank"alt = "Dumesh's Megalo Profile"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR = 900,10,10><b>Dumesh Uhl'Belk - Retired Troll Reaver - The Hand</b></FONT><BR></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udinadassshnameless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DinadassSHnameless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/11/02 8:32:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1253.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wut were yoo doin 1 year today (sep 11)</span><hr size=1> I got told a plane hit the WTC on my way to my first class of the day, didn't nothing of it, attended my classes, by noon i had no idea what was going on still go isolation and no professors talking about it...

That's when it hits us that we're working a few hundred feet from the Capitol, the big, white domed target smack in the middle of DC.  One of my coworkers walked in as we got the order from our committee chairman to leave, he had been driving past the Pentagon when it got hit.<br>

I left and walked to where my mother works in another part of DC, the expression of worry and joy at seeing me alive was something no one should ever have to see on their parents face.<br>

When I get to work, there are police and security everywhere.  When I get inside the building, someone tells me that one of the world trade towers has been hit by an airplane and it might be one of ours. (Yep, I work at United Airlines.)  Needless to say there is lots of confusion everywhere and lots of security since we don't know if they are going to attack us at the United headquarters.  <br>
<br>
Well they tell everyone not to use the phones or the internet.  I have one of the few radios in the office, so everyone is huddled around my desk listening to the news as it happens.  We try to do some work to get our minds off of the disaster, but really can't do much.  <br>
<br>
Needless to say everyone is feeling pretty helpless.  Other employees are helping to manage the crisis, but we programmers are pretty much useless.  Then they grounded all air traffic in the U.S. and we had to recover from that.  Lots of people put in alot of late nights during that time.  <br>
<br>
I also remember there was a crowd of us outside cheering when we saw the first commercial plane flying again after they lifted the travel ban.<br>
<br>
I was relatively lucky.  I didn't lose any family or friends from the September 11th tragedy unlike many people at United.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udraxusmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Draxus MT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/11/02 9:32:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1253.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wut were yoo doin 1 year today (sep 11)</span><hr size=1> I woke up &amp; turned on the TV, and both towers were already in flame.

I had no idea what it was supposed to be and sent it to the delete pile without really thinking about it. Shortly after, someone came by and said &quot;uh have you checked the news?&quot; Of course. all the news web sites were completely hammered and it was impossible to hit any of them. Nobody at the office really knew what was going on until maybe an hour later. <p><html>

Then out of nowhere, another plane flies into the picture and hits the second tower.  I remember looking at my wife and stating the obvious....&quot;This was no accident.&quot;  What was normally a very joyous time, listening to the babies hearbeat, etc became very somber with the thought of bringing a new baby into this world.  I am just glad he was not born early as they were expecting, otherwise it is very likely that he would have come on that day which would have put a really sobering spin on the intoxicating moment that my son was born.<br>

It was worse because my grandma's birthday is on the 11th.  That day sucked and IMO I hope someone puts a bullet between that fuckass osama's eye's. <p>Traxx Warrdorf

i was on a support call with a gentleman that was working from home that dayfor the first time. in the middle of walking him thru the setup for the secureid card checker, he stopped me and told me that the first plane hit. at about that time of of the senior techs had pulled out his little tv that he had for working holiday's/nights/weekends and put on the local channel, which was rebroadcasting cnn.<br>
<br>
we saw the second plane hit, at that time the company we provided support for sent everyone at their main offices home (GE Aircraft Engines, I later heard every place that had an airstrip was evac'ed)<br>
<br>
my family lost an old friend in the pentagon (was a shipmate of my dad's and a neighbor when pa was stationed in bremerton, washington) and one of my cousins was injured at WTC.<br>

I though it was probably a little 2 person plane or something like that. So I went to jump out to ccn.com and other news sites and they where all over loaded and I turned on news radio and started listening and they where talking about hijacked planes. We went down to the 2nd floor of the building to the day trading company to watch there TV's and watched the second plane hit and from that point everything just became a bad dream as a bunch of us stood in there and watched as everything went down. One of the computers there had a feed from the AP line (where reporters get there news from) I watched the second plane hit I watched people jumping to keep from burning and I also watched as both towers came down those are images that I will never be able to forget. My heart goes out to anyone that lost some one they cared about during that.  <p><img

Got a call over the radio, sketchy detail about what happened with first plane.  I almost ran thru the door out of the control room trying to get to the ops center, tv was on and we were trying to digest what had just happened.  While we watched I saw the second plane start to come in.  Then while we are all trying to get as much info into our brains as quickly as possible we hear of other flights missing, hijacked, etc.  Then the Pentegon gets hit.  Another shock to the entire country reverberates.  And then I remember the heroic deeds of those on the fourth plane who by this time are aware of what is going on.  They rush the hijackers and yet another plane full of innocents dies, due to a few cowards.<br>
<br>
I cannot convey my feelings then nor now on how I felt.  The shock, the outrage, the horror, the feelings that just defy description.  But it is a day and time that will be forever frozen in my mind.  I will never forget those innocents that died, and I will not forget those who have died since on this war against terrorism.  I have lost a friend in this war, that is also another part of this whole thing that I cannot and will not ever forget.<br>
