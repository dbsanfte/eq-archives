Guild members should try and group with their guild mates as much as <br>
possible. This will benefit everyone, allowing us to better function as a <br>
whole when needed.<br>
<br>
2. The Guild will setup raids for it's members. It's not the sole <br>
responsibility of the Guild leader or officers to do this all of the time. <br>
ANY member can setup a raid, adventure, etc. The Guild will schedule <br>
monthly raids to the planes (mostly Fear and Hate), as well as maintain the <br>
Guild on the Dragon rotation. Only the Guild Leader and Guild Events officer will be able to schedule these raids, as they will be the only members with the necessary access to the Prexus Raid Calendar. All other events should be scheduled on the Guild Calendar. It is preferred that members setup a message on one of the Raids message boards for members/non-members to sign up. If an event is for the guild only, please state such in your sign-up message, and post it in the appropriate forum. If it is an open event, please be considerate of those outside of the guild who are willing to schedule time to assist us.<br>
<br>
3. The Guild will have regular raids to assist those from the <br>
lower level ranks. These raids will NOT be to &quot;powerlevel&quot; lower level <br>
members of the guild, but rather to help them gain the skills in order to <br>
raid successfully. Higher level members will be present at these raids most <br>
times in order to help with corpse recovery, trains, etc, that may result <br>
from these raids. The goal here is for all of our members to have fun and <br>
learn how to play the game better.<br>
<br>
4. Quest Assistance - quests along the lines of the Epic Quests are usually <br>
able to be scheduled ahead of time. However, there are times where some mobs <br>
have a random timer, or rareness about them that doesn't allow us to do so. <br>
In these cases, the person needing to do the quest (or portion thereof) <br>
needs to notify their intent to the guild as soon as possible. All <br>
guildmates online at the time that are able to lend assistance should do so <br>
upon the questing Guildmate informing them of the mob being up and <br>
requesting assistance, etc.<br>
<br>
5. Some raids will require that an outlay be made by it's members (usually in <br>
the form of reagents). It will be the raid leader's responsibility to obtain <br>
any reagents needed to gain access to where their raid will be taking place <br>
(i.e. Hate and Air stones). It will also be each individual's responsibility <br>
to provide sufficient reagents for any spells they will use on said raids <br>
(Enchanters/Clerics - peridots, etc). All members who have reagent <br>
requirements such as the above shall be reimbursed from the &quot;money loot&quot; on <br>
said raid and the remainder shall be deposited to the guild bank. This will not count towards any other loot distribution. At times, the raid leader may wish to provide all of the reagents needed for everyone, other times, the guild will pay to get these reagents.<br>
<br>
6. Please put any events you wish to schedule on the guild's calendar of <br>
events - being sure to include a link back to the message you posted <br>
containing the event information. PLEASE be considerate of other's events <br>
already scheduled on the calender so we can try and have everyone involved <br>
in as much of the guild activity as we can.<br>
<br>
7. Determining who gets to go on a guild raid - below are the rules for <br>
determining on who should get to go on a guild raid (i.e. pecking order). <br>
However, it is 100% up to the raid leader to determine what they will need <br>
in order to obtain their objective and to have fun:<br>
a. Guild Members<br>
b. Allied Guild Members<br>
c. Friends of Guild Members<br>
d. Friends of Allied Guild Members<br>
e. All others<br>
<br>
Again, the order above is to be used with all else being equal (i.e. if you <br>
need another druid to do something, you would take a Guildmate before a <br>
friend). However, again, it is up to the raid leader to know what they will <br>
need to accomplish their task. Thus, if they need someone of a higher level <br>
(due to needing particular skill, spell, ability, etc) or skill (i.e. a monk <br>
who HAS pulled the plane of Hate over a monk who has NOT pulled the plane of <br>
Hate), etc, they may shuffle the order of a-e above in order to accomplish <br>
their task. HOWEVER, if they do decide they need someone by not following <br>
the above order, they should explain to the others of that class (or <br>
whatnot) why that particular person (or persons) were selected over them. <br>
All effort must be used to utilize guild members first and foremost, and if <br>
unable to, try and find a reasonable alternative (i.e. in the monk example <br>
above, if you have room for the pulling monk, and the guildmate monk, take <br>
both, and have the guildmate learn from the pulling monk HOW to pull, so in <br>
the future, they will be able to do so).<br>
<br>
8. Loot Rules:<br>
These guidelines are to be used only in large-scale raid situations (Plane <br>
of Hate, Fear, Dragons, Venril Sathir, etc). Any other time, it will be the <br>
group/raid leader's sole discretion how to distribute loot.<br>
<br>
Raid Loot Rules - the following rules should be used as standard guidelines <br>
for all raid level events (i.e. the planes, chardok, dragons, etc):<br>
a. If you are eligible to random on an item (i.e. can USE), you are welcome <br>
to random on the item (raid leaders choice of randoming style).<br>
b. We ask that if you feel you wouldn't utilize the item, not to random.<br>
c. If no one who is eligible to random wants in on the item, the item will be deposited into the guild bank for disposal by the guild as deemed necessary to meet any of the guild's obligations.<br>
d. Once you have won an item, you are not eligible to be in for another <br>
random until either<br>
1) everyone who can use a particular item has won an item, OR<br>
2) everyone else who can use a particular item has said item, thus you <br>
get it by default (in this case, this will count as your second, <br>
third, etc, loot, which will remove you from the second, third, etc, <br>
rounds of randoming).<br>
e. God/Boss Mob/BP/Robe/Leggings/Quest Loot<br>
God, Boss Mob, Breastplate, Robes and Leggings shall be merited by the raid leader and Guild Leader, at their discretion, following consultation with other guild officers and allies officers. Their say is final.<br>
f. There are certain &quot;crap&quot; drops in some places (i.e. the wands in Hate, <br>
etc) that do not qualify as item drops or money drops. The raid leader <br>
may award/random these items as he sees fit, and they will NOT be counted <br>
as an item loot.<br>
i. If there are any NO DROP items dropped, and no one who is eligible to use <br>
them wants in on the random, the item shall ROT. We will not have people, <br>
just because they do not like the stats of an item, etc, not wanting in <br>
on the random, only to hope they are just given up freely to someone and <br>
not have them count as loot. <p><img src="http://www.prexus.com/Aequus/jaansig2.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/faequusfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=5.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/faequusfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=5.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/faequusfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/faequusfrm10.threadControl?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/faequusfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/faequusfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="aequusfrm10">Charter & Rules<option value="aequusgeneral">The Fountain<option value="aequusfrm6">The War Room<option value="aequusfrm7">The Town Gates<option value="aequusfrm5">Traders' Bazaar<option value="aequusmembers">The Guild Hall<option value="aequusfrm15">The Battle Chamber<option value="aequusfrm14">The Keep<option value="aequusfrm9">The Questing Hall<option value="aequusfrm8">The Courtyard<option value="aequusofficers">The High Council</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CD7F32>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/baequus>Aequus</a><font color=#CD7F32> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/faequusfrm10>Charter & Rules</a> <font color=#CD7F32> - </font><a href="http://www.prexus.com/Aequus">Aequus</a><font color=#CD7F32> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM DEFAULT AD SCRIPT -->
