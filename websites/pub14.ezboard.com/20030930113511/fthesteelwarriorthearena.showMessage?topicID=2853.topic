So instead of posting my idea on page 6 of thread 20 where most ppl got bored at page 3. Ok from slaving through thread after thread it's become obvious that there are only a few key issues at hand here. One that warrior feeling a bit left out on exp groups in PoP (especially the lesser equipped brotheren) due to hybrids ability to baby groups aggro issues. Two that there is a bit more mystery to skills than spells thus making pure melees constantly question what their abilities do or do not do, where all a hybrid or caster has to do is go to Lucy and WALA mystery solved. Third and last the more RNG factor of the nature of pure melee. <br>
<br>
Now I think there are a few reasonable and practical solutions that will solve a great deal of these problems. One warriors are the only pure melee that I'm aware of that do not have a kinda passive special abilityas they progress in lvl. For example monks get their damage table upgrade and rogues double backstab... which enhances the offensive nature of their classes with monks being more all around and rogues a bit more specialized. Now warriors do get triple attack but so do monks so that doesn't really count and with the nature of warriors being a defensive class is not really what I think they are looking for. I know someone is going to say something about defensive or evasive disciplines. Well I'm am more looking to a passive ability that doesn't require a recharge time nor has a time limit. So let's move on from that one plz. Also base hps I believe should not be counted as a defensive class ability, but rather more I gave up hps to be able to buff myself. As for a solution there is one factor that would give warriors their distinctiveness back, and I know this has been said before and I'm sure it will be said again, but I believe that this distinction should be a measureable and distinctive reduction in the damage table that warriors recieve. Much in line with how monks have their damage increased. Not an AA ability or a spell effect on some piece of equipment, but a passive ability granted to 50+ warriors purely by the fact that they are of the warrior class. <br>
<br>
Now on the exp tank envy issue I think that warriors should just maybe accept that maybe you can't have it all... that maybe the being the raid tank you need to give up a bit of appeal for the exp group. Basically as hybrids have accepted their roles maybe you should too... I don't think there is a respectable hybrid out their that expects to be the MT on boss lvl encounters.. so why should warriors expect to be kicken ultra aggro exp grinding tanks either. As warriors expect hybrids and damage dealers to manage their aggro on raids... so should warriors respect the fact that they should be able to let it fly on mobs they can actually tank. Now with slow migration on higher tier mobs I think warriors will find that their role will return. For in many ways it's SLOW that has allowed trivialized exp mob tanking more than hybrid aggro...for is it not slow the #1 reason that the instant aggro is needed in the first place which has allowed hybrids to take the spot of prefered exp tank rather than the inability of warriors to tank. With the diminishing results of slow on higher encounter mobs comes the placement of warriors role again....<br>
<br>
Which would be further reenforced with the defensive table adjustment as stated before. <br>
<br>
Ok well I've already been a bit long winded on this one... but I hope my point reasonable and somewhat logical ?<br>
<br>
Plz bash away <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for the RNG nature of pure melee's well it's a RNG which might just have suck coding... and it's not just a melee thing... ask any enchanter who had 3 mezes resisted after they tashed the mob... &quot;)<br>

If there really needs to be something done, just nerf the Knights and get it over with.  Any solution you can come up with that involves improving warriors ends up making Knights obselete which is a lot worse than just a nerf. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=burzumdurbatuluuk>Burzum Durbatuluuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/3/03 5:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2853.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My Suggestion on Hybrid Question</span><hr size=1> Who said anything about retroactive PoP mob damage increases?

If you improve Warriors in any way the game has to be correspondingly harder because the game is obviously tuned with Warriors as tanks in mind, otherwise the game becomes too easy.  But that makes the game too hard for everyone else.  SoE isn't going to let you make warrior Gods.  At best they'll let everyone else useless.<br>

We may have needed our mitigation table in the past but in PoP, /disc defensive reigns supreme once again.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ulvrim>ulvrim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/3/03 6:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2853.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> I know someone else came with this suggestion about increased mitigation for warriors also earlier in some other thread.

Although I could be wrong. Basically what I was suggesting was to place a comperable damage reduction increase. Now with things quading for 2k+ or more defensive will still be nessisary in boss lvl encounters. What that innate damage reduction would provide more for is 3rd tier exp groups or groups looking to kill named mobs where the mobs hit harder and thus would return the advantage to the warrior with his or her more efficient damage migration. <br>

The former basically never happens unless SoE decides they made an encounter too hard.  When you improve warriors, you basically end up nerfing everyone else because the game is balanced around warriors.  If the balance is to be kept after warriors are better, then mobs necessarily have to be more powerful.<br>
<br>
Without increasing other class's mitigation, if warrior receives any significant mitigation, then something that a warrior can tank would cream a knight, and something a knight can tank a warrior can tank trivially.  Of course, if you increase everyone's tanking ability then that's doing exactly nothing at all.<br>

The answer is to nerf EB and /defensive...<br>
<br>
Get warriors some better innate taunting that doesn't require EB.  (EB should help, not be the end-all-be-all.)<br>
Add in a numerical taunt adder...  like perhaps add 50hate to kick (hit or miss) OR make a new &quot;kick&quot; that adds 100hate (hit or miss) and doesnt stun or knockback... (either would use KICK/BASH timer)<br>
<br>
<br>
Reduce /defensive effectiveness and then add an INNATE damage reduction to warriors. (15%?) and a lesser one for Knights (5-7%)  While yer at it, unnerf monks...<br>
<br>
<br>
ALL of the disciplines need a rehash...<br>
<br>
I fully support defensive/aggresive/evasive becoming PERMANENT disciplines (that is until you turn them off, or use another perma discipline), with a reduction in overall effectiveness that balances their now Permanent status... (and the innate damage reduction)<br>
<br>
WAR/ROG/MNK should have two types of disciplines,  perma, and short-duration.... the two types of disciplines should be separate when it comes to reuse-timers. (perma ones have no re-use, they have disadvantages built-in)<br>
<br>
Hybrids should only have the short duration ones.<br>
(but those they have should be pretty spectacular...)<br>
one offensive and one defensive.<br>

<br>
Warriors need some kind of better aggro generation, preferably intrinsic to the class and not another AA.  There are already too many posts with ideas for additional aggro generation.<br>
<br>
Oh, and yes, disciplines need to be completely overhauled, for every class.  Many of the warrior ones are almost valueless, even if we weren't always making sure we had defensive or evasive ready for immediate use, simply because of pathetic durations and absurdly long reuse timers.  Or they are just crap to begin with. <p>Ghune<br>

It's absolutely godly on PoP mobs.  Sure it renders all our other discs obselete, but how many disc do you really see other melees use besides the equivalent of Fell Strike and the rare invulnerable disc?  Okay Monks use Stonestance on a regular basis, but that's about it.<br>
<br>
See that mob that hits between 400 to 2000 (which is on the low end of elemental mobs) that nows hits for 400 to 1200?  If the mob hits me max even once, I mitigated 800 damage!  It's kind of weird that Knights don't complain how no matter what about gear they have, you can't possibly expect the best equipped Knight to have more than about 1K than the worst equipped warrior (from the same guild, obviously), and yet when the said warrior hits the /disc defensive button, all the gear difference vanishes as soon as mob lands for max hit at least twice.<br>

Sure I'm talking mostly raids, but how often do you, or for that matter, anyone else, use discs in xp groups?   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drenesh>Drenesh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/5/03 12:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2853.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.prodigy.net/bestsmileys1/emoticons1/reaper2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My Suggestion on Hybrid Question</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ok I've read through many long and often pointless arguement based posts lately on many boards.

So basically, you're going to spam the boards by starting ANOTHER thread of 20 pages where people get bored at page 3? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/binverselogic"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://brains.is-a-geek.com/img/sshasig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
