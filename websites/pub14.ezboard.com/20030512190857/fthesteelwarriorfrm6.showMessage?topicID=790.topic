Those seem to be fairly easy to get and IMO are more useful than the warrior epic.  Druid epic is fairly easy too and may be of consideration.<br>
<br>
If you are stuck on wanting the warrior epic, you will need to make friends with a lot of people.  Then you will probably need to help them on a lot of epic fights as well.  People tend to remember those that helped them on their epic fights and are more willing to help you then.  That is the best way if you are not in a guild who focuses on epics.  And for the time invested, the warrior epic has little payback for a guild that can get it.  For the average guild, the force required for POS could probably do the mechanical dragon in POI.  This can yield a taunting blow weapon with superior ratio to epic, 41% haste neck item, caster items, etc.  Good items for a whole guild.  Plus it flags you for the factory in POI.<br>
<br>
I would also recommend highly making a tracker to park in EJ to watch for Sev or a toon that can sense summoned.  Sev's pet is summoned and can be sensed by a low lvl toon of the correct class (necro?)  Unfortunately though, on Tunare at least, he rarely lives more than 30 minutes after spawning so you need a bunch of people ready to go at a moments notice.<br>
<br>
Another tactic you could try is to find several warriors in the same boat as you.  Then I would have you and each of them find some clerics, enchanters, PORTERS (key for fast mobilization), and damage classes that are interested in the spells and loot table from Sev.  (same goes for Talendor for red scale)  After this is accomplished, I would get peeps in a chat channel and explain some ground rules.  You will camp (ie drop exp groups etc when notified of the spawn) Sev/Tal until all the warriors have their scales.  All other loot is randomed amongst the other attending members.  Some nice spells and possibly haste items drop from Sev and Tal.  I would make it clear that the warriors will NOT random on any droppable/no drop loot other than the scales which are warrior only or another class that can use like a bard for red scale.  People tend to get ticked if they are helping a person with an epic drop and that person wants the non epic loot as well.  Keep track of the spawn times of Sev/Tal and when they were last killed and have a tracker in zone covering the spawns.  Advertise amongst your group when the &quot;expected&quot; spawn time will be and make sure people are in a channel around that time if they are on.  Fast mobilization is the key or you will not get the mobs.<br>
<br>
Instead of using the droppable loot from the dragons you could form an alliance so to speak with people of multiple classes wanting their epic and get help and give help that way.  The same methods could be used from above like the channel, tracking spawn times, etc. just it would encompass more than Sev/Tal.  Then you all could form a semi permant channel that all log into when they play.<br>
<br>
Don't take my post the wrong way.  I just completed my epic last Saturday at lvl 63 and am glad I did.  But, if I hadn't had everything but the Queen Blade and already done turn ins, I probably would have sold the Green scale and bought some weapons that were every bit as good as the epic, like a Great Staff of Thunder 31/30 2hb, procs Planar Stun.  These go for about 40k on Tunare and the scale is close to 100K I think.  For a green scale and selling the MQ of the other parts you could probably get the staff, Windblade, Fleshgrinder and Frostbringer.  Plus, when you upgrade them you could sell off the ones you don't need.<br>
<br>
Good luck on obtaining your epic and don't get in a rush.  It will just frustrate you and this is a game after all and should be fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I never thought I would get my epic, being in a small guild of friends. Guild actually started about 10 years ago back on the old Prodigy network playing a game called Rebel Space. Well eventually we started doing things like Hate raids, and inviting some friends we had made and that lead to a 5 guild alliance. As all of us in the Alliance grew in power, we did lots of Hate, Fear and other fun raids, along with a ton of epic mobs, and 95% of the time I would be MT, even though my gear sucked.<br>
<br>
Well over the course of a year and a half I eventually got to the point I only needed the Golem ball and Green scale, without ever actually Trying to work on my epic. I just took the attitude I would never have it and that was fine, and along the way kept picking up pieces. Even though I was MT all the time, I still rolled against other wars for all the drops and usually was one of the last to get them. But eventually we did a Fear raid and after getting wiped once when zone popped, and a few other times when Draco aggroed unexpectedly, we managed to kill Draco and all three golems and the final one dropped my ball.<br>
<br>
So then for the first time, I actually had to put an effort in and park my little Ranger in the woods to watch for Sev. Luckily that was about the time PoP was released, and with all the patches, and the third try I finally got my scale. I personally looted every piece, and was MT one the mobs they all dropped from and since I still cant afford 60K for a windblade, I am still using my JBoW on a daily basis as I grind AA's in PoP.<br>

Most warriors I know with epic (myself included) had been on dozens of non-warrior epic mob raids and spent over a year gathering pieces before finally obtaining it.  If your not willing to put in the effort don't expect to get it.<br>

Hehe, dozens of epic raid mobs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I know there were weeks when I did a dozen epic mobs, and that went on for well over a year. I got my CoF merited to me on an Ixiblat raid one night. Was the 12th time I had done Ixiblat, and I used to pull him and Tank him, though I died more often then not back then.<br>
<br>
Course I like to be puller and MT in Fear also, even though folks not in our alliance used to think it was crazy having a warrior pulling Fear.  Of course now that most Epic mobs can be single grouped by Lvl 60's with some AA, its not as much of a challenge and I dont do nearly as many epic raids now days.<br>

If there is anyone on Povar who's willing to MQ it, I'm offering a hella trade or plat or combo.<br>
<br>
Cheers, and gluck to those working on it. The satisfaction of doing it plus a decent offhand weap that increases hate by 500 is worth it in my books.<br>

<br>
I'm not assuming your bitching, its just an advice I'm giving you since I have known a few epic whiners in my time and it really got under my skin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tacmanshagirl>TacmanShagirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/03 8:07:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=790.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Never Gonna get my Epic</span><hr size=1> Dont get your hopes down!<br>

<br>
I just completed the Entire Warrior Epic quest in 1 week.<br>
<br>
With the help of some very very nice guildies ! *hugs guild*<br>
<br>
I now have a lvl 54 warrior epic'd!<br>
<br>
I only MQ'd 2 parts the fear ball and the spiroc blade.<br>
I had the hand of the maestro from over a year ago so that was really the only part that was sorta not &quot;in&quot; the week. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
