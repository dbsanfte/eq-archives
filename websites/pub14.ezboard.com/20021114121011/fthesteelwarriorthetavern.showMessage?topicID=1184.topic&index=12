I really dunno where your getting these numbers, a made up profile of a paladin that is completed whored up by their guild having 100% choice of anything they want?<br>
<br>
Self Buffed HP, that may be nice for soloing, but in groups/raids Both Warriors and Paladins will have aego, or POTC, or similar high level buff spell, Soloing? Its not hard to find a cleric and buy Aego, or even find a paladin to cast BMB:P<br>
<br>
Skills:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> CH Lay of Hands </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Nice Spell, Keep in mind it takes AA points and has long ass refresh.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Shield of Words </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Cleric Spell overwrites these, as does aego, and you just complained about AC cap :P (This only add's to AC)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Resolution  </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Cleric/Druid SPells overwrite, Decent Spell for soloing, avaibility of Aego/Potc sorta downplays this advantage<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Greater Remove Curse </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Highly Needed for lots of high end encounters, spell is pretty rare, and Paladins arnt usually the first one to get it, Generally (Yes some guilds may do it differently) Druid &gt; Shm &gt; Paladin &gt; Cleric for order.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Stuns </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Stuns are Nice, unfortunatly most are resisted/immune good for aggro however<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Divine Stun </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Lots of AA points, most things 55+ are just tagged stun immune anyways, and can shut down most CHer's without spell by nuking or moving them, bad refresh time, so if you find a target it works on, you stun it once, then it can cast again. Still a useful skill, But I didnt see you put rampage on warrior advantages: P<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 90% Res </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Nice For soloing/small groups, minorly important on raids if wipeout or you need to quickly get somene back in fight. Clerics got 96% thou.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Roots</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Roots Own, Not gunna argue with you there.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Divine Aura</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Not Gunna argue with ya there, DA owns<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Group Heals</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Prexus Owns, probably the biggest thing to give paladins their niche.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Self Regen</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Constantly takes mana to use, bad ratio. Some warriors can be Iksar/troll to negate difference.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Self Haste</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Warriors can get EPP, if your talking bout Pallies w/ enuff time on your hands, to get slay 3 the warrior should get off his ass and camp this<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Symbol of Naltron</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Nice,takes Peridot, overwritten by Cleric Buffs.<br>
BMB Only Need one paladin for this for raids, groups/solo groups can probabily get if they asked a paladin.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Heals</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Superior Heal is too slow, and not enuff, its decent with fast cast, but its only moderatly useful on raids. CC is good for keeping up casters, unfortunatly its lowest on HoT, and is always overwrriten. There is a new Cleric spell on test that can overwrite this, potentially lessening the use of it, but hell thats not live, thats not a present advtanage/disadvantage (More on this later)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Slay Undead ( Damage that can hit 6k on a hit )</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
To get 6k a hit, you'd have to have 60 or 61 DMG weapon, Only ones I really know of is that UP one w/ bad ratio, and that axe inVT with the bane to make it an good ratio, and to my knowledge theres no Undead in VT. (Correct me If i'm wrong here)If we're talking bout that UP hammer, warriors can get 1300 Crippling blows with it on any monster ;P<br>
Slay is definatly nice, but as many has mentioned there are few places that its useful, VS, IV, Rhag 1,2,3. Few nice places for soloing, but not an abondance, and its not really too much of an increase over FG XP rate.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Dispells</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Nice, but lot of other class's have this, Not too useful<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Cures</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Lots of class's have this and ours are weak and take multible casts to get rid of, still a perk but not a big one.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Anti Undead Spells</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The ratio on these is so outdated, the DPS Increase from using these is minimal due to lost melee DPS (And since your fighting undead, thats less time for IoN or Slay to proc)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Holy Forge</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Long ass refresh, Makes slays go off more, nice for the few aforementioned boss's, decent for xping when you wanna speed it up, warriors got aggressive tho :P<br>
<br>
You forgot Instrument of Nife, and Santification<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Here is the kicker though, Paladins can hold agro better then a warrior and in the case they lose agro can get it back better then any class other then a SK.

Warriors have PE on test, but thats not Live yet, so point taken. Warriors with EB weapons arnt quite as easy to rip aggro off of, and can hold aggro pretty damn well unless someone on a raid is a tard and cant control their aggro, and Warriors STILL tank better due to high skill caps and HP. Before someone responds that not every warrior has access to EB weapons, Point taken, but not every paladin has enough gear to be withing a few hundred HP of a warrior either, this is espcailly true if you dont have access to EB weapons.<br>
<br>

As a puller they hands down beat a Warrior. Divine Aura for things that DT ( since DT is now 20k Damage based ), stuns on pulls or Root, LoH on the run if hp is low<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Paladins are superioir pullers I'll admit, but monks/SK are superior to pallies. That DT thing... unless I completly missed something old world DT still kills me with DA on, Ehehe Essence of Veeshan Pwned me last night with DA on as a matter of fact.<br>
Maybe talking about Luclin DT, I havnt fought Shei yet, so dunno exactly how it works, but thats a pretty small advantage area, and I dont know about any other Mob with Luclin DT, cept old emporer, and he was changed, I'm sure there are some more though, but barely any on the large scale.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Damage: 1H the Warrior easily wins with duel attack and duel wield, but goto 2H and the Paladin is toe to toe with the Warrior and surpasses the warrior vs undead mobs.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That 2h part is not true(Cept the undead part, but we're that totally makes sense from a RP/class perspective)<br>
Given Equal weapons, Lets say Emp 2hder, or palledus axe, warrior will outdamage due to superior skill caps, flurry (as long as we're talking bout Pallies with slay 3!) and tripple attack (May not raise DPS much, but it still does)<br>
I see where your coming from though, there is a lack of warrior 2hders between Creator, and Emp. If we go back to ToV, warriors got the advantage of weapons however, Palledus is both, and TSBS is better then any Pal 2hder for straight damage (and far easier to obtain)<br>
You have a point if we're talking bout tunare weapon, unfortunatly due to its proc, it will be bagged on a lot of raids.<br>
Another thing working againg warriors, which is more of a warrior/guild choice, is that pallies (and SK's) are just more likely to get a 2hder, because they wil be using it all the time, warrior has to use 1h combo, and 2h, making it less effecient for warriors to get one, so less likely to be awarded one, or use DKP. BUT /shrug on my server, first emp sword dropped went to a warrior, go figure.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
One last thing to note, there is a new shield rules being tested on test server. The shield allow for more damage mitigation.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> This isnt even live. And if we're talking bout things not live... Warriors get PE on test, and Clerics get a new Group HoT, lessening the usefullness of Paladin Heals :P, SK's get new DA spell, lessening the advantage of paladin DA, Shamans and Druids  get better heals, indirectly nerfing Paladin usefullness. BUT this stuff isnt even live yet.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see any real documented things on shields, so if you could show me that this actually looses an unberable amount of aggro, or that warriors dont use shields somehow better, otherwise its just a guess... show me some proof!<br>

<br>
So Trade one imbalanec against another?<br>
<br>
<br>
One thing about being a Hybrid, is we have to work a LOT harder to get all these advantage's, warrior will be done AXPing after CA3/CS3/ND3 AE taunt, and possile Abidex flurry, and Rampage. Hybrid needs about 150 or 200 AXP points get max out their  effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Oh Yah, Iustus is a pally, but guess what, he 3 box's, if a warrior 3 boxed they could have many points, and this is just one person, hardly having anything to do with Entire paladin/warrior balance as a whole.. and BTW Dunric has 250 or so now.<br>
<br>
Paladins can do a lot, but cant do it all at the same time.<br>
<br>
One problem with warriors, is that there is simply too many of them, LOT of people switched to warriors/made warriors on suggestion of friends in the kunark/early velious era, and all these are dinging/dinged 60. Number in guilds partially  reflect this, most big guilds will have 8 or so Warriors and maybe 3or 4 pallies.<br>
<br>
There is also the diffuculty curve. When breaking *new* ground, for the most part your gunna need warrior to tank it, however, after that, farmed it a little, farmed similar mobs for so long that its boosted the pal/sk HP/AC gear enuff so its possible for them to tank it, there almost no matter what HAS to be a point, (except at the very upper crux of melee damage) that through the aciqustion of gear, and AA points that a pal/sk can tank it, if not, because, a warrior of less gear, has to beable to tank it. The problem is, that due to mudflation, and the length of the time the game has gone on, is that the end of the curve is much easier to reach now.  If a pal/sk cannot ever tank a raid type mob except at the very upper crux of pure melee damage (AoW type DPS) there would be a trickledown that makes a worse tank, to such a degree, that it is not good to have them be the main tank to in XP group, and as much as some warriors may like that, our utility/dps is *rarely* enuff to warrant our presence in an xp group.<br>
<br>
However, maybe suprisingly I do agree that warriors need some upgrades, I got some ideas, probably wont like em cause they came from a paladin, and I'll admit I&quot;m not as in touch with the issues, as a warrior is, but sometimes a outside perspective is good (just as a non warrior/pal/sk would beable to look at war/Knight balance with less of a biased eye, I'll admit it, i'm somewhat biased;P) <br>
<br>
So Here some ideas I had which I think might improve the warrior class, w/o breaking the game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Taunt</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
On every taunt, the taunter gains Taunt skill/4 (Rough number) amount of hate, if they do not have agro of the mob. In addition, the way taunt currently works stacks with this, IE, on a sucessfull taunt, the taunter would get aggro + Skill/4. However, once they gain aggro, taunt works in the exact same way, IE, no taunt is added after agro is gained, with the exception of going from Non agro, to agro status.<br>
<br>
This would hopefully address being less reliant on procs, and beable to gain aggro more effectivly, however, to keep the game challenging, no taunt is gained, by the use of the taunt skill, after agro is established, so people still have to manage their aggro.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Taunt Weapons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
There is a lack of weapons between EB/SoD (If Sod is still aviable) besides the ever so hard to find Willsapper, besides the still rare, Skybreaker. These weapons would be added to the game<br>
<br>
On Gozzrems Lootable.<br>
<br>
Scimatar of Demolition<br>
Lore Magic Nodrop<br>
14/21<br>
10 AC 50 hp 5 sta 5 dex 10 SVM<br>
Effect: Demolition;1 Second Stun, 100 dmg<br>
<br>
On Chardok Queens Lootable<br>
Argent Sword of Striking<br>
Lore Magic<br>
13/22<br>
40 HP 5 ac 5 sta 8 SVD/p<br>
Effect: Argent Strike, 20 AC Debuff, 50 DD,<br>
<br>
These Two weapons would could give Warriors some more choice in weapons, and make the curve to EB Weapons more smooth.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HP</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Since I doubt verant will ever nerf a class, espcially their beloved monks.<br>
Just as Clerics gain an innate 5% to all heals, Warriors would gain an innate 5% to all HP items.<br>
<br>
PE Would Be War/Pal/SK, all current BRD/RNG with the ability would be given their 5 points back. (i'm dreamin)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> AA</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Ambidex in addition to its current properties, would give offhand damage bonus, Lvl 1: 3, Lvl2, 6, Lvl 3, 9. (These numbers are for what it would be at lvl 60).<br>
<br>
Add Class AA for warriors: Weapons Training Mastery, 9 Points, Increases your attack while wielding any weapon by 75 points.<br>
<br>
Add Class AA for warriors: Skill Mastery (Need better name) This would raise all skill defensive skill caps, not already maxxed by 10 points.<br>
<br>
This would hopefully try to keep the proper ratios of dmg more in line at the end game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Misc</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Warriors are hearty individuals, however, they dont deal with magic too well, Instead of Innate bonus resitance MR, change it to the CR/FR/DR/PR, as warriors are good in suriving in the elements. Due to their stanima, and surivibility, warriors have an innate 5% chance to outright resist ANY FR/CR/DR/PR attack<br>
<br>
Due to their lack of casting spells, and their general lack of knowledge about Magic, warriors take an extra 10% dmg from any spell marked magic, if the spell isnt outright resisted. (If it is resited, they take 0 damage)<br>
^ This is to balance out some of the other change to warriors, as to try to give the class a little bit more indiviudaulity.<br>

It may in fact take more gear and/or more AAXP for a Paladin to reach a point where he is able to tank boss mobs.  However, the very fact that he can, means there is less need for a Warrior as a result.<br>
<br>
Paladins are already one of the tanks of choice for experience groups, for those of us who still form pick up groups.  A well equipped Paladin brings much more to the table than an equally well equipped Warrior.  Which is kind of sad.  There should be some kind of parity, but there just isn't.  800-1k and defensive are meaningless in an experience group unless that group is truly pushing the envelope on what one group can accomplish.<br>
<br>
And Paladins have a real incentive to gain AAXP.  The benefits they gain are enough to get them over the hump of boss mob tanking.  A Warrior gets there with the right gear, so its easier for him.  But he has less incentive to work AAXP.  And if Paladins feel their class AAXP options aren't ideal, check out a Warrior's.  Other than AE taunt, the rest are pretty much considered cotton candy kind of additions.  Nice to have, but not really all that helpful.  Certainly not game changing.<br>
<br>
I do like some of your suggestions Maldrone, and its good to see that other people are begining to see and understand the issues.<br>

<br>
 All I know is that I'm damned discouraged with EQ.  I started out as a druid a 1.5 years ago and after getting up in level discovered that they weren't invited to play in the end-game because they didn't offer much other than a ride. <br>
<br>
About Jan, this year started a warrior because I wanted to be viable in the endgame. I'm sure I read about some grumbling concerning taunt and I did look at all the melee sub-classes but decided I couldn't go wrong being a warrior. <br>
<br>
Hell, now VI starts fixing the druid class that I orginally started with and unbalances the entire melee sub class.  WTF!  I guess the answer is Ebay!   Go buy a damned Pally, since this class is working beautifully that way I can recover some of time I invested in my warrior.<br>
<br>
Who knows, maybe after EQ-3, they'll get around to fixing the warrior class in EQ-1.<br>
<br>
/rant off  <br>
<br>
Sorry for the rant.<br>
