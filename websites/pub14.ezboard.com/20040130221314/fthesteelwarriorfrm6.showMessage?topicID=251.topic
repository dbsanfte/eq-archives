<br>
<br>
9: Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring:  AC9, STR+9, STA+9, MR+9, HP+50, Effect: Shield of the Eighth (Right-clickable and stackable 8 point damage shield)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As you can see, this ring is a big improvement from the 8th ring.  It introduces some stamina and HP (with 9 stamina, the total HP addition for me is 86).  It also still has the Shield of the Eighth effect, which is odd because it's the ninth ring.  Hopefully they will fix that someday.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Garadain Glacierbane will no longer be the main Coldain behind the quests.  It is now Seneschal Aldikar and Dain Frostreaver IV himself, both in Icewell Keep.  If you zone into Icewell from the main entrance which is located in Thurgadin, enter the Keep and climb the stairs all the way up to the throne room.  If it is between 8 AM and 8 PM, EQ time, you will find Seneschal Aldikar standing to the left of the throne.  If it's not between the above time, you will find him in a room on the floor below, but he does not give out the 9th quest in this spot, only when he's at the throne.  To get the quest, say the phrase &quot;I will accept this task&quot;, and you will receive a 6-slot box.  The quest, when summarized, requires you to seek out the 6 Coldain traitors and obtain an item from them to prove that they've been slain (usually a head).  A faction level of dubious will work to do the quest.<br>
NOTE:  Any Coldain you kill in this quest is a traitor and is not on any faction whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Traitor 1 - Rodrick Tardok<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you've been following this walkthrough, you should already have the item you need from Rodrick, which is the no drop &quot;Dirk of the Traitor&quot;.  You do not need Rodrick's head.  If you don't know how to kill Rodrick and you don't have the Dirk of the Traitor, please read quest 6, it explains.<br>
<br>
Traitor 2 - Murdrick Tardok<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You may be thinking to yourself, &quot;This guy has the same last name as Rodrick!&quot;  If so, you are amazingly observant.  Murdrick is Rodrick's brother and is a traitor as well.  However, he's found in the Great Divide, in a cave next to Velketor's Labyrinth, at a location of -5600, +3500.  Murdrick is in the first room to the right inside the cave.  He also has 6 other traitors with him, 2 of which are clerics.  All of them should be dubious to everyone.  DO NOT GO INSIDE MURDRICK'S ROOM.  Going inside the room triggers a conversation between the traitors.  If the conversation ends and Murdrick is not in his spawn point, he will despawn.  This part of the quest is damn tricky.  You may think you have such an easy solution but trust me, it isn't.  It seems no matter where you attack Murdrick, all the other Coldain will pop on you after a minute unless they are harmonied.  When they lose agro they don't always go back to their spawn point in the cave.  A level 60 cannot single pull Murdrick without harmony.  Do not try to have a monk split him, not only will it never work, Murdrick will also despawn.  There are two ways to do this.  You can either have a few groups rush in and kill everything, which is way too unnessecary, or you can do it the way I did and the way I watched everyone else do it.  I had myself (54 monk), a 60 paladin, 58 druid, and 51 shaman.  One group is all you need, but high level harmony is a must.  When you have your group, enter the cave and have them buff and med up somewhere in the hall, but not too close to Murdrick's room.  No one but the person with harmony should ever enter Murdrick's room, and even then they will not go in until ready to pull.  Once everyone is buffed, have the druid/ranger with harmony to enter the room.  They must not be in wolf form, as the traitors are KoS to wolves.  The harmonier will harmony everything then cast a spell on Murdrick to pull him.  No matter how many add, pull them to the group.  If you have more than Murdrick, attempt to split by having everyone attack Murdrick except the one who pulled, then have the puller take the adds outside and kite them for the duration of the fight.  You will need to give Murdrick everything you've got to kill him before he despawns.  When he dies, loot Murdrick's head and Murdrick's plan.  We personally had one add with the level 58 druid pulling, but he simply dumped Murdrick on us and kited the add outside as the shaman healed.<br>
<br>
Traitor 3 - Captain Berradin<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is one of the hardest parts of the quest.  Not because of any NPC difficulty, but because you need to make Tainted Avalanche Ale.  The recipe for which can be found in Murdrick's plan, but here it is: one Bottle, an Iceball, an Ice Wyvern Stinger, Arctic Mussels, Runed Sea Shell (Effect: Cloud), Seahorse Scales, and a vial of Mind Melt.  The only no drop component is the Ice Wyvern Stinger.  The Ale itself is trivial at a brewing skill of 248 (ouch), and it also is NO DROP.  The bottle is bought from bartender merchants.  The Iceball is a drop from snow dervishes in Eastern Wastes and Iceclad Ocean.  The Ice Wyvern Stinger is a rare drop from wyverns in Cobaltscar.  Arctic Mussels are a ground spawn under the ocean in Cobaltscar, in the bottom of the shipwreck closest to the beach.  Runed Sea Shell (Effect:  Cloud) is a rare drop from sirens in Siren's Grotto only.  Seahorse Scales drop from seahorses in Siren's Grotto, and Mind Melt is a poison that can be made from rogues only, and it also is trivial at 248, but is NOT no drop (obviously).  The components for Mind Melt are two Mt. Death Mineral Salts, a Sealed Poison Vial, Ethereal Suspension, and a vial of Quicksilver.  Mt. Death Mineral Salts are common drops from goblins in Droga.  Ethereal Suspension is bought from rogue merchants.  Sealed Poison Vial is made from the pottery trade skill, trivial at 188,  the components for which are an old-world non-ruined skin (I personally used Zombie Skin), a Sealed Vial Sketch (merchant-bought), a Water Flask, and a Small Block of Clay (merchant-bought).  You will then need to fire it with a High Quality Firing Sheet (merchant-bought).  The components for Quicksilver are one Cinnabar and one Gnomish Spirits (both bought from merchants in Kaladim).  For convenience sake, here are some equations:<br>
<br>
Cinnabar + Gnomish Spirits = Quicksilver<br>
Zombie Skin + Sealed Vial Sketch + Water Flask + Small Block of Clay = Poison Vial<br>
High Quality Firing Sheet + Poison Vial = Sealed Poison Vial<br>
Mt. Death Mineral Salts (2) + Sealed Poison Vial + Ethereal Suspension + Quicksilver = Mind Melt<br>
Bottle + Iceball + Ice Wyvern Stinger + Arctic Mussels + Runed Sea Shell (Effect: Cloud) + Seahorse Scales + Mind Melt = Tainted Avalanche Ale<br>
<br>
You may need to find someone else with mastered pottery, brewing and poison making skills.  I gave up after getting my brewing to 151 and had someone else make it for me.  Once the Tainted Avalanche Ale is made, find Captain Berradin in Eastern Wastes in a hut at a location of -60, +2360.  You don't need a full group for this.  I personally did it with myself (54 monk), a 60 shaman, 60 ranger and 53 wizard.  However it was an overkill on Captain Berradin.  When ready, have whoever made the Tainted Avalanche Ale give it to Captain Berradin.  After a minute, he will choke and fall to the ground.  At this point, pull him out of the hut and kill him, the other Coldain there will not assist him.  Once dead, loot Berradin's head and the letter to Peffin.  He does not drop these items if you haven't given him the Tainted Avalanche Ale.<br>
<br>
Traitor 4 - Peffin Ambersnow<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this point on if you screw up you'll need to start with Captain Berradin and make another Tainted Avalanche Ale.  The reason for this is each traitor drops an item to trigger the next part of the quest, starting with Captain Berradin who drops the letter to Peffin.  So be careful, and have as many people as possible help you.  I recommend having two groups for Peffin, or one well balanced with everyone near 60.  I did this with almost everyone in my guild who was online at the time, and it was an overkill but also the first time anyone had ever done this before.  Luckily, it succeeded.  Locate Peffin Ambersnow in a building in the giant fort in Eastern Wastes.  The giant fort is at -1770, +2920, and Peffin is invisible and cons dubious.  What happens is this:  after you give the note to Peffin, some level 51 giants will spawn in the building you're in, 5 level 51 giants will spawn around the campfire outside the building but inside the fort, and Peffin will respawn in the middle of those 5 giants.  This would be very easy if Peffin didn't despawn after a while.  Neither she nor the giants around the campfire will move from their spawn point, no matter what.  The giants simply stand there staring at you if they agro, and Peffin will shoot endless arrows and will never move.  Do not try to AE the giants as you will be summoned and slaughtered.  This is the strategy I used.  Move your army to the back wall of the giant fort, facing the campfire.  They must be against the wall or risk agroing giants.  When everyone is buffed and ready, have a monk pull Peffin out and feign death near you but not near everyone else.  For some reason when we did this she agrod on some people so we had to let her go back and try again.  When the monk feigns give her the note.  The giants and Peffin will immediately spawn at the campfire.  Throw something or shoot an arrow at the middle giant to agro them all.  Remember they do not attack, rather just stare at you, and will not summon you if you use a ranged weapon.  What you need to do is quickly get close to the campfire near where your groups are, and sit.  Stay seated at all times, never get up, and make sure anyone who is in front of you never sits down.  This way all melees are free to run in and attack Peffin, and the giants will not attack them because they're mostly pissed at you because you're sitting and you attacked them.  Kill Peffin as quickly as you can, then have everyone back off so you can get up.  Have another person throw or shoot something at the middle giant then sit where you were to switch agro to them so you can run in and loot Peffin.  You will need to loot Peffin's head and the letter to Doldigun.  She also drops a very nice bow which is extra and not needed for the quest.  The key rule is to not be afraid of the giants when everyone rushes in for the attack.  They simply will not kill you.  Make sure if anyone is going to sit that they sit down behind you.  And kill Peffin ASAP.  That's all!  Oh one more thing, the reason for pulling her from outside the building to give her the note is because some giants also spawn inside that building that DO move from their spawn point, and if agrod they could cause problems.<br>
<br>
Traitor 5 - Doldigun Steinwielder<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This part takes place in Kael and it's really easy and fun.  You need a minimum of two groups, and it can rewarding for all because armor drops for the Velious armor quests where you'll be going.  Gather your forces in Eastern Wastes at the zone to Kael.  Once ready, go inside and invis up or kill your way (the mobs on the way are green and easily soloed by me, 54 monk) there.  The path you take from the Eastern Wastes zone is this:  simply follow the one way hall until you get a large room that splits off in 3 directions.  In this room is a small pond and above the pond is an icy ledge.    Climb up to the ledge and you should see a building here.  At this point the mobs will be harder and you must kill them.  Enter the building and kill all mobs you find inside, or pull them out one at a time and kill them then go in.  One of the rooms in this building is long and has a throne at the end.  Set up your camp in the room BEFORE the throne room, with the giant chair and table.  After the building including the throne room is clear, you and only you will go up and stand on the throne itself and say the phrase, &quot;The Dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain.&quot;  Immediately Doldigun Steinwielder will spawn, who is not KoS.  Give him the letter to Doldigun and you will receive a Ring of the Coldain Council.  Now attack Doldigun and he despawns.  WTF?  Look behind you.  You have triggered two level 51 giants.  Pull these to your groups and kill them.  After they are dead, another will spawn in the throne room and runs to your groups immediately.  This one is level 55.  Kill it and another spawns, this time level 57.  Kill it and ANOTHER spawns, this one is level 60.  After the level 60 one dies, Doldigun will spawn in the throne room and start running.  As soon as the level 60 giant dies run to the throne room and throw something at Doldigun to agro him.  If you don't, he'll run straight through your groups and despawn.  This version of Doldigun is level 55.  Kill him and loot Doldigun's head.  Note that you do not need the letter to Doldigun to trigger this quest.  The letter is needed only to receive the Ring of the Coldain Council, and you can do this quest over and over and over for everyone who wants a head.  Just say &quot;The Dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain&quot; at the throne and attack him to trigger the wave of giants.  There is no spawn time on the waves, but there is about a half hour spawn time on the other giants in the building, and you want to kill these because the giants in the triggered wave will run at low health.<br>
<br>
Traitor 6 - Councilor Juliah Lockheart<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sixth and final traitor is perhaps the easiest of them all, aside from Rodrick.  Again, you need 2 groups for this, composed primarily of tanks and healers.  Juliah Lockheart can be found in Icewell Keep, so make sure everyone who is helping you is not KoS to Coldain.  Enter the Keep's main entrance and head straight across the first floor lobby to the room behind it.  You'll find a large room with bleachers on either side.  If it is between 8 PM and 8 AM EQ time, the room will have three Councilors in it, including Juliah.  If it's between 8 AM and 8 PM, then Juliah will be all the way upstairs in the throne room.  You can do this at either location.  When your groups are buffed and FM, give Juliah the Ring of the Coldain Council from Doldigun.  This respawns her as a much tougher version of herself.  She does not cast and hits for 300ish.  No other NPCs in the zone will assist her.  She fights alone.  The tactic I used was to have a level 60 paladin tanking for about 10 to 15 seconds by himself as an enchanter chain runed him, so she got nice and mad at him.  At this point have everyone else join in until she dies.  Loot Juliah's Head from her.  You're almost done!<br>
<br>
Getting your 9th ring<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Juliah Lockheart was the last kill you need to make.  You now have all 6 items from the 6 traitors.  Put them in the box that you got from Seneschal Aldikar at the beginning of the quest and remember to combine them.  You will need to turn in the full Box of the Guilty and your Velium Coldain Insignia Ring directly to Dain Frosteaver IV himself.  This can be a bitch because Dain is on a 7 day timer and uber guilds who are KoS to Coldain are all over him.  Whenever you find Dain up, hand over the items to receive your Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring at long last.  A faction level of dubious or higher is all you need.  In return you will not only receive the ring, but also a no drop Dirk of the Dain, a nice piercing weapon.  This is actually the Dirk of the Traitor but the curse has been removed.  Return the Dirk of the Dain back to Dain right away and you will not only receive the Dirk back, but also a Declaration of War.  You should never ever destroy the Dirk of the Dain, even if you won't use it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
10: Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV: AC10, STR+10, STA+10, MR+10, HP+100, Effect: Frostreaver's Blessing (Right-clickable and stackable 10 point regeneration, 10 point damage shield, and 10 ATK)<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you haven't already, give the Dirk of the Dain back to Dain and you will not only receive the Dirk back, but also a Declaration of War.  You should never ever destroy the Dirk of the Dain, even if you won't use it.  Note that this is as far as I have gotten and have never controlled the war for the 10th ring, however I have been in it 4 times so I know what goes on.  You're going to need every single person in your guild to participate for this, and if yours is not among the most uber guilds of the server then you'll need a lot of outside help as well.  Have you ever seen or heard about the huge war in the Great Divide that lasts 3-4 hours real time?  That's what this is.  In order to trigger it you'll need to give the Declaration of War and the Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring to Sentry Badain who is in the left guard tower in front of Thurgadin in the Great Divide.  You receive the ring back but not the declaration, and all you need to do for another declaraction is give the Dirk of the Dain to Dain Frosteaver IV.  This is why you never want to destroy the Dirk, in case the war fails, which is very likely.  There is no possible to way to lose the 9th ring, so if you lose the war, you don't need to start over from anywhere other than getting a new Declaration of War.  What happens during the war is, you and your big uber army will be waiting buffed and FM (duh) in front of Thurgadin.  After giving Sentry Badain the said items, the war will be triggered.  A line of Coldain will spawn in between the towers.  Also some named heroes will arrive as well as Seneschal Aldikar behind the waterfall to Thurgadin.  Two of the heroes allow you to communate through them and control a large army of Coldain.  I'm not sure exactly how this works, but you want to keep the named heroes alive because if you do you receive extra goodies at the end.  The only Coldain that MUST not die is Seneschal Aldikar, I believe.  The way you lose is if Seneschal is killed.  Also when all the Coldain are triggered, a wave of giants is triggered and they all charge Thurgadin.  You can either lose by having your forces wiped out, or if a newbie trains giants to Thurgadin.  ALSO when the war is triggered, the *entire* zone of the Great Divide is despawned aside from the war mobs.  There should be no reason for anyone to be there who is not participating in the war.  Obviously you'll be doing a lot of shouting to the zone before the war and during the war, warning people to stay out of the zone.  Anyway, wave after wave of giants will charge Thurgadin.  You just gotta keep killing em.  The duration of the war is about 3-4 hours, and throughout the whole thing wave after wave of giants will be charging.  There are 2 changes in waves.  The first waves are pretty easy, the second change gets harder, and the third change is a bitch.  After all waves are destroyed, Narandi the Wretched will spawn.  He flurries and hits for 750 damage, has mega HP and procs a fire DoT which deals about 350 damage per real second, not tick.  I think the item you need from him is his head.  He also drops a lance which is extra and up for lotto.  I'm not sure who you turn them into, I think Seneschal Aldikar, but in the end you'll be turning in Narandi's head and the Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring to receive the Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV.  You can also receive extra goodies by consulting with the named heroes who survived.  Among the goodies are Narandi's Crown and Amulet.  Congratulations on completing the most awesome series of quests in EverQuest!<br>

Getting to 188 takes 1 full 8-hour day of EQ (mindless button clicking, plus paying folks to use the brewing barrels elsewhere). From 188+ plan on nearly 200 combines per skill up with wisdom (buffed) over 210. Some skill points come quickly (like 10-60), most not (from 208-&gt;209 took way way over 200).<br>
<br>
Someday, when I am ready to go completely insane, I will get my brewing skill up to 248. Before then, I plan to get my &quot;dream tradeskill&quot; gear (wisdom like 245 unbuffed), which should get my combines/skill-up to something like 20ish. I should be able to max out my other trade skills for under 500p each at that time.<br>
<br>
If you plan on doing trade skills, look for the max wis or int gear you can get, and get it over 200.  <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=64195'>Combat Profile</a><br>
