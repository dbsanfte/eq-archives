If after you read this you think that Verant's solution is the best solution, well... you're entitled to your opinion.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
There's a ton of misconceptions floating around from those who are not familiar with the monk class. I sincerely believe a number of these misconceptions stem from a misunderstanding of the actual game dynamic of what makes a monk an effective solo/tanking class. Perhaps if people understood this better, they could find a REAL solution to the problem of melee class balance.<br>
<br>
1) Damage mitigation. Yes, monk damage mitigation is identical to mitigation of other melee classes. Warrior = SK = Paladin = Ranger = Monk. Parse it out yourself. The average hit and hit rate is identical once you exceed the effective AC softcap (somewhere around 1300 in Luclin/Velious, less in Kunark/old world). Warrior and plate class AC exceeds Monk ac all the way from low end to End game, the main problem here is that mitigation itself doesn't scale beyond the effective softcaps. So, a Warrior with 1800 AC gains no benefit over a Warrior with 1400 AC. This is not a problem with monk mitigation, this is a problem with the base mitigation mechanics.<br>
<br>
2) Damage Avoidance. Yes, monk damage avoidance is greater than all other melee classes. A monk will avoid 6% more than a similarly equipped plate class. This is due solely to the presence of Block. Block is about 2x more effective than Parry, as a result, monks will avoid damage more often. Keep in mind that all avoidance abilities are situational. IE, that monk pulling for your raid/group gets ZERO benefit from these avoidance abilities as usually they are NOT facing the mob. This is not an issue as most people seem to agree that monk avoidance should be greater than other melee classes.<br>
<br>
3) DPS. Monk DPS is approximately 30 percent greater than Warrior DPS with similar gear. This is due to a number of factors. First, monks parse damage on a different table than warriors and other plate tanks. Second, we have a selection of weapons with better ratio's than any other melee class except paladins/sk's who get limited benefits due to lower skill caps in their respective skills. This was part of the original design of the monk. We get this and other skills in exchange for lower hps (20 to 50 percent less depending on the level of the game) and class item restrictions due to weight.<br>
<br>
So, based on the limited AC engine, yes, monks do tank as well as plate classes when mana and hps are not an issue. However, in situations when DPS of the mob is very high, monks can't tank well at all. Over a long period of time, monks take less damage, however our low HPs and lack of taunt make our tanking ability very situational.<br>
<br>
Now what about soloing? This is where people make the biggest mistakes. Why do monks solo well? There are a few reasons, and they're not what you think they'd be...<br>
<br>
1) Fungi Tunics. Monks have chosen as a class to wear the Fungi Tunic whenever possible. Fungi tunics grant 15 pts/tick regen, and compared to other monk tunics have a very high ac. When you exceed the AC softcap (1300 or so) and can remain there with a fungi tunic equipped, the fungi tunic is the best Breastplate choice for ALL melee classes. That warriors choose to NOT equip the Fungi tunic in favor of BP's like Eradication or Vindicator BP when they're well over the AC softcap is a sign of poor gear choice by non-monks for soloing, not an indication of monk abilities as a whole. Put a warrior in Fungi tunic and their Regen will match that of monks. Keep in mind that monks forego 100hp+ tunics in order to wear the Fungi.<br>
<br>
2) Monk Epic. Monk epic has the LARGEST impact on monk soloing of ANY item they wield. There are two reasons for this. First, monk epic gives +54 attack. This increases our dps above our normal levels. Second, the monk Epic makes a monk's hands act at 9/16 weapons BEFORE haste is applied.  Compare this with warrior attainable weapons at a similar level such as the Warrior epic, Defiance, etc.  Third, the monk epic gives +40% spell based haste. This means a monk with a 36% dragon haste item is ALWAYS hasted at 76% or better. This is what really allows monks to solo highly effectively. If a warrior were to get a Belt of Many Visions (41% spell-based haste self-buff), then most warriors could solo nearly as effectively as any monk.<br>
<br>
The 6% avoidance is trivial in soloing situations. And when measured, the DPS difference versus HP difference (excluding epic haste) actually balances out in terms of what mobs a Warrior is capable of soloing. Yes, a warrior will have a little more downtime than a monk due to larger HP pool, but they're not anywhere near as poor a solo'er as they make themselves out to be. Factor in a Warrior can also use 20% slow proccing items like Truncheon of Doom, and a well equipped warrior could solo just as effectively as any monk over the balance. Don't believe me? Take a warrior with Belt of Many visions, Truncheon of Doom, and some decent haste/weapons and you'll see.<br>
<br>
So what does this means in terms of the upcoming patch? It means that Verant really doesn't understand the mechanics of thier own game.<br>
<br>
Want to fix melee class balance? Make high AC's effective. Having an AC of 1500 or 1800 *should* mean something. Or better yet, put a built in mitigation modifier into Plate armor. IE, take that Breastplate of Eradication and put in a 3% absorbtion modifier. Do this with Every piece of Plate in the end game, and what you'll have is warriors and other melee classes mitigating more effectively.<br>
<br>
And no, this Won't trivialize the encounters. Assume a warrior had 10% true(ie, mitigate EVERY hit) mitigation with all the best items in game. What this means is that AoW would hit for 965 instead of 1054 quadding + enrage. Oh yah, that 400 to 500 hps per round will really make this encounter trivial. 8P<br>
<br>
The fact is, nerfing monk mitigation won't stop monk soloing. In the end, the monks will just do what we did before we could stand toe to toe with mobs (Yes, Prior to the monk epic, monks couldn't solo very well at all). We'll ID kite, FD kite, and get buffs ahead of time. In the end, unless you nerf monk Mitigation so drastically that it offsets the Fungi Tunic regen AND monk self-haste, you won't see monks not soloing. In the end, monk soloing comes down to HP regen and self-haste, not how much you mitigate/avoid.<br>
<br>
However, be prepared that if you do this, that you'll be crippling all the monks in the game who do NOT have a fungi tunic or an Epic.<br>
<br>
In the end, I think there's a lot of better solutions that Verant could have implemented.<br>

I did not see very many here asking monks to be nerfed, most of the complaints that I saw said monks should not be able to tank as good as warriors.

The issue was that in your average xp group you were probably better off having a monk tank than a warrior.  This should never have been the case.  But I agree with you.  Instead of nerfing monks AC, they should have put plate classes on a seperate mitigation table, either because of plate armor like you suggested (cool idea btw although that would include Bards! =)  ), or just innate to the class.  It could have been done in such a way as to not imbalace anything.   <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127089">Dracillion of Qeynos</a>

While a warrior CAN possibly solo the same mobs as say a Monk, we don't have a failsafe in case things get ugly.  Furthermore, while FD, the monks will still get all the benifits of their regen/mend and can get back to soloing with minimal downtime, while a warrior might bind wound (Using consumables) just to get back to half his health, then, depending on gear, Invigorate up to full health, which with a warrior's HP, could take up to 20 minutes depending on how many HP he has as well as Bind Wound skill (Pre-55)<br>
<br>
Basically, you're arguing that warriors can solo as well as monks, at least that's what I got from this.  Monks should not be a tanking class, however, I don't believe that this change will cause any problems with the way monks pull.  If they changed FD, or removed it completely, or removed your Mend ability, then I would say it's unfair, but I think the changes they made to the monk class works to the better of the game.  I know a few monks who are going to end up pissed off because most of them dropped their &quot;then&quot; current main to plvl a monk.  And I agree with the previous comment, &quot;Nobody twinked a monk because it was balanced&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhaass.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haass</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 538<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/9/02 10:02:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An open letter to Warriors from a Monk...</span><hr size=1> Frankly dude, I think you're asking the wrong community for sympathy.

<br>
First of all, Monkly-Business is FULL of moron monks wearing agi/dex gear that have less HP than my Greaves.  These people are not the issue.  The people that are the issue are the ones that are selecting the HP/AC gear and not being retarded.  Monks with comparable AC to warrriors CAN AND DO tank just as well as we do. <br>
<br>
Don't tell me this isn't the case.  Every goddamned nite I play with an intelligent monk who has the same 1250 ac I do, but has about 1k less HP. When we pull 2 of the same type of mob, we split tank both of them and his HP bar DROPS SLOWER THAN MINE.  And that's sick considering i have 25% more hp than he does, he can and does take damage that much better than me.  Lets not even touch the fact that his mob dies before mine does.  Warriors are supposed to be the be all and end all of tanks in this game and the fact that even in one situation, someone takes less damage than we do is wrong.<br>
<br>
This change needed to happen, and i'm sorry you can't see it.

<br>
This is not going to hurt the monk class. It isn't. Say it with me: This is not going to hurt the monk class.<br>
<br>
All that you guys will not be able to do from now on is tank. Thats it. You will still be able to do massive dps, you will still be able to pull and FD and mend. You just will not be able to step infront of the mob and have it hit you and survive. You will still avoid damage but when you don't its gonna hurt. After all you guys wear LEATHER! It should hurt more than someone in half an inch of plate, or someone in thick steel chainmail! <br>
<br>
Monks are not loosing their damage avoidance. You guys are just gonna get smacked hard when you get smacked. Thats it. That is all this change will do. You're still gonna be monks.  <br>
<br>
So tell me again how this is bad.  <p>Aveen Lucenthawk<BR>

didnt know some monks do not have epic (2hours deal)  or fungi. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=114779>Lyubm<br><a href=http://hossguild.com/>Hoss</a>

However I do agree with the way of gimping Monks is not the answer either. <br>
<br>
I think what VI should do it 1) Fix the AC soft cap where is actually means something to have the high AC plate items. 2) gimp the high AC items monks get and have gotten (example: 60ac greaves from the AoW). <br>
<br>
Doing this would kill two birds with one stone. You would then have the plate class people taking dmg better than others and then monks would not have the crazy leather wearing high AC they do now so they would then take more dmg than other meele classes.<br>
<br>
The path I fear though is VI just making the easiest fixes they can do to fix problems they know they have but doing this hurts more than doing nothing.<br>
<br>
The biggest change will be the new mod rods. This will change the whole entire game without changing the encounters that exsist now. Like the AoW will have the have at least double the amount of clerics you had before in cheal order. Since they gimped the players but have not changed the encounters.<br>
<br>
So what do I really feel about the changes VI is planning? I vote giving VI the finger! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=396468>Balladar </a><BR>

This time, instead of trying to come up with a gimmick for the other classes, Verant went back to the original vision for the class.<br>
<br>
I think Verant blew it with the gear available to monks.  They have naturally high defenses and yet Verant made a lot of high AC gear available to them (this wasn't so in the first year of the game).  This threw everything out of whack and since much of the gear is all all verant instead decided to go after the monks natural defenses.  This will hurt the lower level monks, but bring the higher level ones into perspective.<br>
<br>
The changes haven't gone live yet so we don't know how bad of a nerf this is, but I believe it should have a positive effect on balanced grouping.  Its certainly gonna be tough for the monks to accept since they have enjoyed this advantage for a long time, but anyone who actually watched a similarly equiped and leveled plate class solo next to a monk (the Grey is a great example) has to wonder why the warrior gets stomped to half their hit points while a monk takes about a half a yellow in damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1386.topic&start=121&stop=124>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=1386.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showNextMessage?topicID=1386.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.emailToFriend?topicID=1386.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.threadControl?topicID=1386.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1386.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1386.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
