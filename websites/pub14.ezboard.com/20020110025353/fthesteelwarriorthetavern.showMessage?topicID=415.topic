<br>
i been learning new things since level one and still am at 60.  you can say theres nothing to playing a warrior if you want, i dont care.<br>
<br>
play ANY class to a decent level and group (not a solo class that never does groups), you will learn what each class strength's and weakness is.<br>
<br>
there are some classes (drooid) that i think are mostly useless, but a person that knows their class and how to play is better than an idiot rogue cleric or chanter that gets you killed...and i suspect you may be one of them <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/11/01 4:10:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Funny stuff...</span><hr size=1> Warrior easy?  Perhaps, in some zones, such as OT or LOIO.  But then those places aren't that challenging for a Bard either.  But if you are in a dungeon someplace, and your warrior is pulling, it can be one of the toughest jobs around.<br>
<br>
While everyone is sitting on their butts having the bard play mana song, the Warrior is usually the one thinking about what comes next.  Where does he pull from?  How many spawn are involved?  Can the group take them?  Does he have confidence his cleric can keep him alive?  Will the other melee let him have agro like they should?  Can the chanter handle the pull?  If he is any good, and the situation is any kind of a challange, he is thinking and thinking hard.<br>
<br>
Granted, I have seen some awesome Bards.  Some who could really do their job.  But a Warrior is much more than pounding the taunt key.  Just as there is much more to a Bard than mana song.  I'm sorry you see fit to come to a Warrior board and insult us all by implying otherwise.  It seems you lack respect for others my friend.  Which is unfortunate.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udobbanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dobbanz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/11/01 4:24:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Funny stuff...</span><hr size=1> Quick question. How exactly are druids useless? We can snare, ds, buff, backup heal, sow, port, nuke, dot, and if there is sufficient room to run we can do limited crowd control by rooting adds away from the group. I have played as a warrior before and I do agree that they are much more complicated than just hitting auto attack, bash, taunt, and repeat. Every class is useful in some way to a group. Even(God help us!) paladins. There is a good reason we have that old saying, jack of all trades, master of none. Its because its true.<br>

<br>
How long have you been playing EQ?  Have you grouped at all?  If you don't know the difference between a good and a bad warrior you need to get into more groups.<br>
<br>
Bad Warriors:<br>
-Overpull<br>
-Don't con before they pull and get overhigh reds the party can't handle<br>
-Don't con before they pull and keep pulling blue and green stuff for no xp<br>
-Don't make sure casters are ok on mana before pulling<br>
-Don't conserve healer mana by binding to half before heals<br>
-If they get something they know the party can't handle by accident (can you say goon in OT) they bring it back to the group anyway and all die<br>
-Don't manage aggro correctly and get casters killed<br>
-Don't run the combats by directing people on the targets and breaking from main target to hit/taunt mobs off casters and then have the sense to return to the main target and finish it regardless of the whoopin they are taking from the other mobs<br>
-Don't know how when they are not the main tank to /assist on the main tanks target and not split targets<br>
-Don't keep others coordinated and keep them from splitting targets which will result in cleric aggroed or oom and whole party die<br>
-Run like a sissy bard when they get below half instead of trusting their healers<br>
<br>
Good Warriors:<br>
-Control pulls well in both number, frequency and strength to maximize party xp and minimize risk of dying<br>
-Make sure casters are ok on mana before pulling<br>
-Conserve healer mana by binding to half before heals and maintain aggro well so that the cleric has only one target to worry about healing<br>
-If they get something they know the party can't handle by accident (can you say goon in OT) they alert the party to start calling for a rez or that they will be on a CR soon and they sacrifice themselves so as not to endanger their party<br>
-Manage aggro correctly and keep casters alive<br>
-Run the combats by directing people on the targets and breaking from main target to hit/taunt mobs off casters and then have the sense to return to the main target and finish it regardless of the whoopin they are taking from the other mobs<br>
-Know how when they are not the main tank to /assist on the main tanks target and not split targets<br>
-Keep others coordinated and keep them from splitting targets which will result in cleric aggroed or oom and whole party die<br>
-Don't run like a sissy bard when they get below half instead of trusting their healers and will even sacrifice themselves if necessary to cover party's retreat<br>
<br>
You may say that doing all the above will get you killed a lot of times.  That might be true in some situations where it will call for you to sacrifice a death for the good of the group but let me tell you two things:<br>
1) I never have a problem getting in a group.  My reputation is out there and have actually had people who have grouped with me before ask a group member to leave to make room for me.<br>
2) My xp is fine.  The three blue bubbles you lose when you have to sacrifice yourself because it is the right, Warrior-like thing to do is more than made up for because I know how to pull the right targets, chain pull when party is able to minimize downtime and the xp keeps flowing.  <br>
<br>
Try being in a group with a good warrior sometime and watch your xp bar then look at it when you are with a bad warrior and tell me there is no skill involved in the class!<br>

Druids are the swiss army knife of EQ. Whatever you're lacking in atm healing, offence, travel, tracking, buffs a druid can step in and make up for the slack.<br>
<br>
All of the classes in this game fit well together and contribute to the whole. ESPECIALLY when they're run by knowledgable players.<br>

<br>
Humans-Not the best at any class and only passable warriors at best<br>
Wood Elves-The epitome of wussitude in the world of Norrath aka Santa's little helpers or Forest Faries<br>
Half Elves-An abberrant cross-breed of the two above races<br>
Vah Shir-Ah lets look at what they really are...moon pussys<br>
<br>
No races known for creating real warriors allows their children to grow up to become bards.  Even the Erudites who have no real warrior blood in them but who at least spawn warrior-like Paladins and Shadow Knights have rituals which take all children with Bardish inclinations and toss them into the sea.  Iksar, Trolls and Ogres have been known to eat their young that develop Bardish tendancies.  Barbarians flay the skin from Bardish children and make wallets.  Dark Elves use children with Bardish tendancies in ritual sacrifices and for necromancer practice.  Dwarves and Gnomes who develop Bardish tendancies are locked deep into the mines never to see the light of day.  Even the gentle halflings beat Bardish children mercilessly until they renounce all thoughts of becoming Bards.<br>
<br>
I think there is a lesson to be learned here.  The majority of races in Norrath know better than to allow their children to grow up to be bards.  Hopefully the Vah Shir will evolve into a respectable race and start discouraging their children from becoming bards.  Humans are too liberal and have been two influenced by the fairy folk (notice humans are the only ones who will breed with them) and unless they realize the error of their ways and declare war on the Wood Elves they will suffer their shared fate.<br>
