b) No ac/mitigation/avoidance advantage over hybrid tanks<br>

d) A broken taunt skill to compare to the easy taunt of hybrids[<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
a) it isn't insignificant.  Its around 10-15% except at the very top end.  The more HP AA you get the more the warrior gets ahead.  This is a gear issue not a class issue.<br>
<br>
b) This is just wrong.  You have better defense skills and AA for tanking.  AA only furthers this gap as you get more defensive AA and its percetage base so you get more out of it than a knight.  A knight is adequate in this area to be a tank but not even to a warrior.<br>
<br>
c) again it isn't on par given equal gear.  Paladins can hope for 100 DPS on lvl 60+ exp mobs if they have top end weapon and all offensive AA.  We have warriors in our guild that aren't maxed out AA that do 130+ DPS on the same mobs.  The only time Knights DPS approaches warriors is when the knight has a top end 2h and the warrior hasn't been given dps 1h weapons yet.  This is because most guilds give dps 1h weapons to rangers/rogues first and taunters to warriors.<br>
<br>
d) taunt isn't broken it works just fine.  Taunt weapons were added to help it work even better.  The other day I was mez tanking a mob at emperor fight when I won a loot.  Warrior walked over, hit taunt 1 time and had aggro for me to loot.  That is not a broken skill.  When we have warrior MT's they have a little bit harder time grabbing aggro at first, but once they do they don't lose it and in a pinch they can AE taunt and get aggro instantly.<br>
<br>
I think warriors could use a nudge up here and there to make them balanced with other classes, I think paladins could use a nudge as well since our healing is so underpowered in PoP.  But I don't think the class is broken and I think some tend to really exaggerate things when they say you have no bonuses over a knight. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210569">Fraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
Given the much higher percentage of Warriors compared to Paladins and SK's, it's clear that fewer Knight are competing for more group slots (MT and AT) with greater flexability making them more desirable than Warriors in the first place.<br>
<br>
The sick part is they recently nerfed Pallies and then changed their minds when it was discovered they were effectively soloing in PoP. Heh, cut Warriors out of groups and able to solo too - pretty schweet.<br>
<br>
I frankly would be happier if they fixed Warriors so that they could win 50% of their duels with Knights. That my friends is a better indicator of balance.<br>

And again if warriors are the MT of choice by such a degree that people always take them over a paladin... Paladins will not find a group at lvl 65.  You aren't taking them for their heals that heal one round of combat, you aren't taking them for their dps which is the 4th lowest of any class in game and you aren't taking them for their utility which isn't very high either.  If you really want warriors to be the only viable tank in 50%+ of groups, you can expect to see paladins quit playing completely.  At least SK's can act as pullers. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210569">Fraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
You're making several false assumptions:<br>
<br>
False Assumption #1: <br>
<br>
This is the reason most Paladins find themselves irate, based on a sheer fallacy.   That being that groups are always &quot;maximized&quot;.   This leads the less self-confident to believe earnestly that the reason that they cannot find groups is due to not being in a 'maximized' class.   Maximized meaning that groups always consist of Best tank, Best healer, Best Slower, Best CC, and Best DPS.<br>
<br>
The REALITY is that groups are made up from any 6 people, an can take on a whole multitude of forms.  I've seen rangers tanking, warriors tanking, SK's tanking, paladins tanking, pets tanking... hell, I've seen bards tanking... IN PoP.    You need not be the BEST to have a spot doing it.   I've been in a PoS group with Drui/Shaman/War/Pal/War/Ranger.   It was an insane group, and we never slowed down the pulls.  Sure, I died a couple times, even had the Pally res me back in, and STILL made out like a champ on exp.<br>
<br>
Now, I would argue that because of our one dimensionality, we SHOULD be the best at it, as we serve no other purpose.  I think Paladins and SK's are a tad too good at defense, it should be a little bit scarier for a group with a tank who has guaranteed aggro.   <br>
<br>
Fallacy #2:<br>
<br>
The knight feels as though the sum of his parts, even though it exceeds the capabilites of any class in the game, isn't good enough if one person in a situation is better at one of those parts than he or she.<br>
<br>
This is dead wrong.   Paladins who suck at being Paladins use this as a crutch to garner support for increased power rather than learning and relishing in the powers that they already have.   In other words, You shouldn't be as good at tanking as a warrior, you shouldn't be as good at healing as a cleric, and you shouldn't be as good at DPS as a War/Monk/Rogue/Ranger, because you have intrinsically all that they have and more.    You shouldn't have a problem if there's a war/cleri/monk already in group, because you add something that none else can... the ability to do respectable DPS and if needed to change hats.   <br>
<br>
Moron paladins who try to steal aggro when there's a warrior in group, or let a warrior who's tanking die because they're meleeing and not paying attention don't DESERVE groups.  <br>
<br>
So, what you and those who make the same claim is, &quot;we need to be equivalent to warriors in defense, order to find groups&quot;.   I say Bull... that's wanting to be overpowered.... god mode so to speak.<br>
<br>

Why do you think are there less Paladins than Warriors? Because too many restarted as other classes back when Warriors still were far more powerfull in dps AND tanking.<br>
Why do you think FoH recruits Paladins over Warriors now? Because they have many Warriors already, but given the new usefullness of Paladins on raids, they think they need more - while still having Warriors tank. Paladins are balanced now, Warriors need an upgrade to their raid role (MTing boss mobs) and in pre-highend xp game (e.g. some lesser efficient tauntproc weapons, lesser efficient than the highend game EB weapons I mean)...<br>

If a group has a warrior as a tank they don't invite a paladin most of the time unless the group isn't able to control aggro with the warrior.  Thats just the simple truth.  There is a small chance they'll invite a warrior to take over as tank when they already have a paladin. THere is a small chance they'll add a SK as a puller and backup tank.  Generally groups won't invite a 2nd MT class into a group,  they might invite you because of the person playing, but not because of the class you are playing.<br>
<br>
2) The sum of the parts is not greater than other classes, its other classes perceptions of the hybrids that make it so.  Paladins do low DPS, generally speaking 80% of a warrior, they also tank worse.  They hold aggro better and they have weak heals generally can't outheal a round of combat on an exp mob you fight at lvl 65 unless they have large numbers of AA devoted to their healing side.  The sum of those parts is relatively balanced, its not greater than others. <br>
<br>
I'm not saying Paladins are usless or Paladins need huge upgrades.  I'm saying to the warriors that say Warriors should be the only desired MT that it would be the death of Paladins in an exp group.  Our weak heals and low DPS isn't going to bring enough to a group to get invited unless we can tank as well.   <br>
<br>
In our guild at least people want Warriors as MT becuase our warriors don't have bad aggro issues and make by far the best tank if they have aggro ( AE taunt, Taunt weapons take care of aggro just fine), they want shadow knights because they can also pull more safely and can bring some minor regen, mana regen to a group or they want a paladin who can hold aggro and reduce dmg through self healing and stuns which is sort of a poor mans mana regen for the healers.  I don't see that as unbalanced at all.  <br>
<br>
Also don't spout out the if you don't agree with me you must suck at your class BS, that gets an argument nowhere fast. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210569">Fraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
I group regularly with the same paladin. We have similar gear, and we both often use 2hd'ers (I use a twisted steel bastard sword nice damge and good for agro). On almost all deep blue cons, the paladin tanks a little better. It isn't a lot, but it is enough to notice. On the higher level dark blue mobs, the paladin tanks just as well as me. But on the wite and yellow con mobs, the paladin tanks much worse than me. Neither of us are by any means uber and we both have the same number of AA's.<br>
<br>
Now, that same paladin stuns and through his stuns he is able to generate much much more agro than I can. <br>
<br>
That same paladin is also an emergency backup healer for the rare occasion that the cleric and shaman are suddenly oom.<br>
<br>
Paladins bring decent tanking to the table as well as their utility. <br>
<br>
Warriors bring slightly better tanking to the table, and thats it. <br>

Now do you perhaps see some descrepancy?<br>

<br>
Actually this is totally fallacious, most groups without their heads up their tails invite the person who responds first who will help them kill mobs faster.   A 5 person group waiting for the magic &quot;6th&quot; is FAR less efficient than a 6 person group.   I have NEVER seen EVER a group who desires a 6th member hold out for 15-50 more DPS.   The idea is foreign to any form of logic.  The ONLY time I've ever seen a group hold out is when I see &quot;Slower needed&quot;, Healer needed&quot;   Even then, slower can be Shaman (the best), Enchanter (2nd Best) or Beastlord (3rd Best) or Bard (4th best), but they'll take ANY of them.    The notion of groups making paladins sit at the graveyard in PoV while they all wait for a magical 6th member because &quot;the tank spot is filled&quot; is a fantasy, a figment of your imagination, in other words it does NOT happen.  It USED to happen in Sebilis when Paladins sucked hardcore AND brought an experience penalty to the group, but not any more, definitely not in the planes.<br>

So in other words, not only must one be able to find a group at the drop of a hat, but the REASON chosen must fit into your neat little agenda as well.   <br>
<br>
Fantasy &quot;Paladins, Warriors, SK's are 'MT classes' and both cannot function together in a group&quot;.<br>
<br>
Reality &quot;All tank classes also do melee damage and sometimes other things.  Each brings a unique role to the group, and each contibutes more than simply tanking, and having more than one is acceptible and common practice.&quot;<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2) The sum of the parts is not greater than other classes, its other classes perceptions of the hybrids that make it so.

The sum of those parts is relatively balanced, its not greater than others. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Paladins are actually overbalanced.  There should ALWAYS be a downside, not a barely noticeable one, but a real one.  Warriors have a downside in that taunt isn't reliable enough.   We get to do all sorts of tricks to maintain aggro, and still we see clerics getting beaten upon.   Paladins' downside is exactly what?   I can't figure that out.  See, in my view, having the ability to draw aggro at will *should* come with the drawback that it should hurt more when you do.   Not a barely noticeable amount as it is now, but noticeable... Not crippling like before but just a difference, a price to pay for aggro at will.<br>

<br>
And the sky is falling too.<br>
<br>
This brings fallacy #3:  Warriors who say that warriors should be noticeably better at absorbing damage than anyone else are really saying 'warriors should be the only desired MT'.   <br>
<br>
That's nonsense, I have never ONCE heard a warrior say 'warriors should be the only tank'.  What I HAVE heard, and believe myself is that we should be noticeably better than others at absorbing damage if we cannot control aggro reliably.   Currently, we cannot *reliably* control aggro, which is potentilly ok, but in exchange for that, there *should* be the mitigation difference that justifies our inability to hold aggro at will.   <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In our guild at least people want Warriors as MT becuase our warriors don't have bad aggro issues and make by far the best tank if they have aggro ( AE taunt, Taunt weapons take care of aggro just fine),<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, it's pretty clear that you don't know what you're talking about.   You're assuming a couple of things:<br>
<br>
1. Warriors have an acceptable level of access to taunt weapons.   <br>
<br>
This is patently false, as taunt weapons are NOT a class based &quot;right&quot;.  Sure, I've got nice weapons with EB, but I'm not the &quot;average&quot; warrior.   I see warriors all the time on the serverwide channel asking questions about weapons which I cannot believe for one second that people use at the levels in which they use them, and then I realize how lucky I am.  You can NOT make an argument about inherent skills of a class with a piece of equipment, because that piece of equipment is NOT a class &quot;right&quot;.   My ability to hold aggro with my weapons which drop from raid level higher end mobs cannot compare with your ability to hold aggro with level 15 spells, or vendor bought spells, or even PoP level spells.<br>
<br>
Finally, a word about AE Taunt and PoP.   Since you are cluless I'll fill you in.  AE taunt can be remarkable and at the same time it can be VERY painful.  The &quot;AE Taunt&quot; argument is ONLY valid if you have a single mob in an area or multiple mobs that are in the process of being mezzed.   PoP has come up with creative ways to mess with warriors using AE Taunt.    If you AE taunt to save someone, or to control the situation with multiple mobs around, your health starts to fall fast... this becomes a death sentence for the cleric because on your next heal, he's dead.   I've done a few boss mobs the first time where AE Taunt has actually screwed up the fight by me dying rather fast or clerics getting too much aggro on next heal.  Jeplak, Lord of the Srerendi, Neffiken, Lord of the Kelek`Vor, Terris Thule, hell, even Aerin`Dar are all anti-AE taunt mobs, most of PoP with multiple adds that spawn during fight make AE taunt FAR less valid as a guaranteed aggro generation technique as it was in Luclin.   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>they want shadow knights because they can also pull more safely and can bring some minor regen, mana regen to a group or they want a paladin who can hold aggro and reduce dmg through self healing and stuns which is sort of a poor mans mana regen for the healers. I don't see that as unbalanced at all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I do, because there's no inherent COST to having a Paladin, vs. Having a warrior.   The COST to a warrior is you'll probably be beaten upon a few times, and you have to restrict your DPS to ensure that the warrior can get aggro.<br>
<br>

<br>
This is a very indepth arguement and it has many strongly placed points, but one thing that is occurring to me...<br>
<br>
Most, if not all, of the arguements being presented here are based upon the target classes as being in the highest ranges, as in mid fifties to 65, and having equipment that is generally powerful, if not uber. I'd like to point out that the lacking of capabilities of the Warrior class do not only affect you higher end players, but those of us Warrors who are poor as orc pawns and struggling in the mid fourties to early fifties. I and several friends I know are Warriors in the 43 to 53 range and, putting out money together, we might afford a glance at the types of armor and weapon which are most commonly associated with out class. We have had planar excursions, and our armor and weapon are by no means pathetic, but certanlty not the best, and yet, to Paladins and Shadowknights of our same level and same approximate equipment status, we have no advantage whatsoever. DPS is, in most places, entirely exchangeable. I use 2hs, by friends use 1hs, but none of us outdamage but the more poorly armed Hybrid classes. I got lucky, weapon-wise, and managed to get am SoG at level 42. I was lost and someone offered it to me, as it was rotting on a corpse. Hybrids, even with similar armaments at these levels, still have their early spells and abilities.<br>
<br>
We can *not* out taunt them without serious work, we can't outdamage them in similar circumstances (same buffs, same target, same general level, etc), and out hitpoints are only 100 to 300 more, which equals about 2 hits from an NPC. Up to 6 if they don't hardly hit us.<br>
<br>
I, personally, am a 48 Iksar Warrior. ALL my stats, save strength, are below 150. My str is just iunder 170. I'm equipped with Planar boots, legs, and BP. The rest is mixxed and matched, including SCHW, bracer of Scavanging and Darkplate Helm, for examples of what I can get my hands on. I've got 100pp to my name. How am I supposed to even attempt to compete with a Hybrid? I'm also part of a fairly guild, which though I love them with all my heart, is just big enough to fight in kael, which is no help, considering I'm KOS everywhere in Velious (originally ally to giants, but am trying to switch to dragons. Dwarves are stains on my boots =)<br>
<br>
I understand that as I may get into the higher levels of the games, things may change and warriors become compairable to Hybrids, but at this level, and these circumstances, I often question why I even play my warrior anymore (aside from the guild. I LOVE my guild!)<br>
<br>
Heck, I've even began a Shadowknight. It took hell to get him twinked (not by your standards of twink, but what I could do), but he's 28 and soloing yellows and even a red now and then. All just from his fear  and darkness spells.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I've ranted enough. I feel that equipment changes to improve Warriors is a faulty idea that will only support those who can actually afford it. I feel that warriors need to be tweaked so that their mid-game capabilities are higher, which in itself might lead Warriors to have a slightly higher end-game capability, bringing them at least up to par.<br>

<br>
It's very true .. weapons with EB are extremely rare cases.  Even at 64 in a guild that does VT I still don't have EB taunt weaps .. cause even when they do drop there are many warriors lined up.  Thats just the way it is.... *shrugs*<br>
<br>
In the mean time I have to put up with 'Taunt' skill being my main source of agro unless I want to dig up an old Frosty or Club of the Ocean or Ethereal Sword.  Even WITH a 10% Taunt modification item .. Taunt simply put .. SUCKS.<br>
<br>
Why would I come to a conclusion like that?  I know I don't have any SOLID evidence with me to show this (no parses or anything), however my RL GF plays a 63 cleric we play side by side and I see the efficiency she gets on her mana in various groups. Let me tell you .. DA with Wave of Prexus makes for a very efficient group.  I basically waste more of her mana when I tank rather than a Pally (or even an SK for that matter considering they tap their health back from time to time).  So if a warrior cant even enable a cleric to conserve mana most efficiently .. then what exactly does a warrior bring to a group? (only thing aside from that would be a VERY average DPS).  Honestly its clear the class needs some work. *shrugs* just my 2cents :P.  I do hope VI reads these boards!<br>
<br>

AE taunt works just fine, heck we use it in VT when things go bad and just make sure to heal that tank heavy.  As far as acecess to taunt weapons there are other ways to deal with aggro.

I don't spend all my time tanking, especially at raids.  I do group with other tanks and when I do they generally are MT, Paladins do have value outside of tanking.  However you really are failing to realize just how low DPS most paladins are and just how weak our heals are at 65 in PoP.  If I can't fit into a group in the tanking slot, I'm more of a burden than a boon in general... unless its a odds and ends group that needs the backup healing a lot.

Why would you say knights should have anything on a warrior in that role when we're the specialists and you are hybrids? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frodlin7th>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/02 11:39:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1593.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Fraus,<br>
<br>
Both of your claims are unsubstantiated outside of adding multiple disclaimers.  <br>
<br>
1. DPS:  Your theory holds true ONLY IF warriors and paladins are both equipping similar 2hs weapons, and are BOTH hitting from the rear... then and ONLY then do warriors outdamage knights.  But... you've so many times stressed that warriors should be wielding EB weapons that actually lower our DPS by a large margin, and don't take into account the MULTITUDES of pally/SK weapons that are out there compared to war usable (and war only is a myth).  The regular paladin is going to be doing similar DPS as the regular Warrior in the real world.   I'd accept your premise of 80% if there were equivalent distribution/drops on gear, but as it is now, there isn't, a fact that simply CANNOT be overlooked.<br>
<br>
2. Tanking:  You do NOT take 20% more melee damage than warriors, that statement is fallacious and ignorant.  you take (and trust me, I've run the numbers on this one) 1.5% less melee damage than warriors, this is based on avoidance skill differences, the ONLY place where Paladins are at a disadvantage.   Warriors wouldn't have ANY complaints if you were taking 20% more damage than us.<br>
<br>
But... don't believe me?  Fine, don't.... Listen to how a Paladin on your OWN boards reacted to your claims...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well Fraust, all I can tell ya is that if I go LFG in Valor on one of those rare occasions that I don't have a guild group and there is a warrior of the same level looking for a group 99 times out of 100 I'll get a group before he does. <br>
<br>
As for SK's pulling, anyone with half a brain can get doubles in Valor at any camp. Root one on the way in, have the enchanter mez it where rooted, then immediately slow the other one. Only paladins and SK's can guarantee an enchanter that they won't get beat down by an immediate slow if its resisted every single pull. No other class in the game can stop a valor/hoh/cod mob from hitting for 4 seconds if it looks like the CH is going to be late or to simply cut down on its damage. Our DPS with high end 2h is comparable to high aggro 1hs on a warrior, within 5% (much to their dismay). A paladin with a windblade will outdamage a warrior with primal/priceless.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is this, if you think your class sucks, you're going to play it like it sucks. You're going to exude suckiness. If you look at what your class CAN do instead of what it can't, you're going to impress people and be in high demand. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Pretty much wraps up YOUR argument in a nutshell....<br>
<br>
Finally... this misnomer about aggro control being a group's responsibility...<br>
<br>
This is true UNLESS a Paladin is tanking, then there's no need to hold back.   A Paladin actually INCREASES a group's DPS by letting them go hog wild vs. warriors, so don't give me this &quot;Just jump through 145 hoops and it's easy&quot; line.   <br>
<br>
Warriors are STILL at a disadvantage to Paladins in a WARRIOR's bread and butter job, which is melee damage absorption.  As I previously said, taunt issues are fine as long as my damage absorption advantage justifies it.  Currently in non-disc mode it doesn't... at all.   When both classes can acheive the AC cap easy, and the HP pool difference is about 8-12% raw hp, with your extra HP tucked away in your manabar and LoH buttons, it's not 20% difference, the ONLY difference is about 1.5% based on avoidance skill differences. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ennder>Ennder</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/02 8:51:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1593.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I disagree with that person pretty strongly, he claims that paladins are the best tank hands down in PoP.  I think all tanks are pretty balanced.  If you want I can quote seventhswords posts about how we are a terrible class, but I don't believe what he says either.  Paladins are a balanced class with some minor issues just like every class has minor issues.  <br>
<br>
As far as the 1.5% avoidance, prove it.  First off you need to add in the extra hps, since heals are done with CH its part of the equation.  THen you have to add in your disciplines because they do matter and they do make you a lot better.  Then add in percantage based AA that widen the margin.  All said and done you take a warrior and paladin in similar gear, exp with them for an entire night and look at how much less dmg the warrior takes it is significant amount, not 1.5%.  Paladins offest this by using spells such as self heals and stuns.  <br>
<br>
As for DPS, we parse our raids quite a bit, we almost always see a 15-20% DPS advantage on warriors over knights... that is not counting procs which shortens that gap somewhat.  Shadow Knights offset this by using spells to add to DPS.<br>
<br>
Here are some examples that are pretty high quality.  The rogues had bards in their groups so their dps is inflated a bit.  These were mobs where our paladins were not needed for healing.  All players using ssra quality weapons.  You can see why i don't believe our DPS is even to a warriors from this.<br>

If you really want to see a good illustration of the class balance issues, ignore for a moment the AA abilities, and the gear that the majority of us warriors who are more casual gamers will never see.  Take a look at the mid level game, where, in similar gear, hybrids are just plain better in most situations, and certainly in xp groups. Not to mention soloing, which is pretty much not an option past 40 for warriors because of the risk and the downtime. Currently I'm 51st level, so I havent really seen the high end game yet, but I can say with certainty that from about 30 to 51, hybrids, particularly pallys and sk's outshine the warrior in most situations. And even at that level, what they lack in pure tanking ability they more than make up for with better ability to gain/keep aggro, better utility, and the ability to solo something that actually gives them xps.  <br>
Again, I dont have any AA or disciplines yet, but from my perspective, in the levels I've seen so far, pally's and sk's are basically warriors with spells. I'm hoping that my perception will change when I get a few  more levels, but I'm not gonna hold my breath. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think the main focus seems to be rather obvious.<br>
<br>
If a warrior CANT use the clerics mana MOST efficiently... <br>
<br>
then 'what exactly is a warriors role in a group? '<br>
<br>
We dont have secondary healing skills, (I dont care what some post about those skills not helping, I see otherwise when I see GF playing her 63 cler) .. no FD for pulling skills .. no Archery Mastery/ Backstab / Jumpkick for DPS, no Brells or Divine Aura, no Lifetaps or DoTs or Snares.<br>
<br>
We specialized and I think we should have some benefit/reward for sticking through 65 levels of Taunt/Kick as our only little class abilities.  We have innate HP to the other classes .. but as Frodlin pointed out this is kinda diminished not only with gear but also in the Paladin's manabar; tucked away in the form of Brells (not going to count LoH considering the recharge time on it).  The way things are now, quite frankly, disgusts me.  Warriors are like a broken class or something ... VI forgot to finish warriors and give us some spells like all the other tank classes! (cause 1.5% in dmg, doesnt make up for the lack of spells and overall agro control) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=remorsedarqroft>Remorse Darqroft</A> at: 12/4/02 12:02:53 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=241&stop=260>13</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=261&stop=280>14</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=281&stop=300>15</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=301&stop=320>16</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=321&stop=327>17</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showNextMessage?topicID=1593.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1593.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.emailToFriend?topicID=1593.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.threadControl?topicID=1593.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1593.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1593.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
