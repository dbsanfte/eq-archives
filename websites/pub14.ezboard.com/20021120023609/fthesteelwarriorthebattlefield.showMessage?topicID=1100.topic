<br>
Now on to business, yes I did start a druid as my first class and for a time did do the OT/DL run but soon got bored and moved on around 37 I did CC for a bit then did some fun in SolB and Lower Guk.  However around level 43 my circumstances changed and I was playing at odd hours or odd times so ended up soloing as I did not belive it fair on a group to join then leave about 30-45 mins later only to be looking for a group again in half an hour.<br>
<br>
Anyway sorry about the ramble, I am back to playing at regular times and have started a wood elf warrior, I am finding it great fun and for a while leveled with some other guild alts in FoB and then Kurns from 12 to 23.  I enjoyed kurns and it was great learning pathing and safe ways to pull however I have now out leveled the group as I was playing more than the once a week they did.  <br>
<br>
Basically my question is where are good places to go that are not on the LOIO/OT/DL route, I have debated going to velious around 35 as I really like that place and trying CC again.  However I am stuck as where to go between then and now, I gave in the last couple of nights and did visit loio to see if the type of people there had changed and while I did get in one good group having fun in the sarnak fort multi-pulling and testing the group to the limit ( including pulling 5 sarnaks and all members coming out with more than 80% health and 50% mana, one dropped a sarnak earring of station as well) others had not changed including one group with a cleric that only nuked and a rogue that always went to the front of the mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I am open to any suggestions you have and would love to explore the world some, however I will probably be limited to pickup groups as our guild is mainly 40  and like to spent most of there time on their mains.<br>

<br>
At around 26 i moved on to the Gnoll spires in SK just outside splitpaw, exp here is incredible as the gnolls outside have the same exp mod as inside split paw. Around 28 i would hunt here but keep a look out for groups going into paw and every now and again head inside to see if any groups are hunting there. This took me to about 31, i could have stayed longer but during 24 - 31 if i couldnt find a group i would head up to luclin (the spires in NK are real close by) and hunt neth lair/mseru/DSP and by the time i got to 31 finding groups going into paw was getting harder so i was spending more time on luclin and ended up doing DSP up to about 35 (although you can stay here into your 50s easily).<br>
<br>
from 36 - 45 id alternate between Kodiacs/giants in GD, Ultorks/giants/orcs in EW and CC (probably the best dungeon in the game at that level).<br>
<br>
45 - 50 i went many, many places both with guildies and looking for pickup groups, trying to avoid DL, but time and time again found myself back in DL, simply because it was the only place i could consistantly find a group, no matter what time of day. I did have some sucess though in solb and lguk, id generally stay in DL until i got my lvl safe then travel around looking for a dungeon to hunt in, before coming back to DL to lvl up and repeat. 45 - 49 were tough lvls for me (long and boring) and im glad they are behind me now.<br>
<br>
Anyway hope this helps, good hunting to yer<br>
