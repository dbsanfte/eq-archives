  <br>
  Why should you have to pay anyone to drop a mob you can kill yourself?  Just because it is now the norm?  Thats crap!!  Reminds me of the mob days when the gangs would provide &quot;protection&quot; for a fee.  The fact that this doesnt bother you makes me think you actually have a wizard or have a couple wizard friends you can call on for free.  Sev is a joke encounter for anyone who is ready for their epic.  The fact that some people now find it appropriate to have to pay for everything makes me sick.  For the mere sum of 3k each you can buy a MB's time.... ferget that.  Thats is NOT what MB was intended for.<br>
 <br>
  I am all for MB as a tool used by guilds to drop difficult mobs.  I do not want to see it get nerfed.  But I sure would love to see people that have it show a little respect for others and stop being the greedy bastards they are turning out to be!  <br>
<br>
  Please dont take this as a &quot;I hate all MB's&quot; type post.  Cause some of them are great!  I have seen a group come in and help a smaller guild that was going to be steamrolled by a larger guild on ragefire... at NO COST!  I have seen 1 or 2 offer to help smaller guilds out with a mob they could have not otherwise beat... at NO COST!  What really pulls my chain are the bastards that zone into (just for example) Trak, after my guild has speant 20 minutes out collecting people from around Norath and just as we are about to start the buffing have them announce ... &quot;you have 45 seconds to engage Sev or we are talking him&quot;.  Or the loot whores selling CoF - 90k, green scale 90k, white scale 45k, RBB 50k.  As a warrior with no alt soloing class I will probably never see those sums of pp.... EVER!  That is why I joined a guild.  For chances at these items w/o having to pay for them.<br>
<br>
People say Team MB evens out the playing field for the small guy.... well I say level your self up, join a guild and take part in dropping the bastard that drops the items you want yourself.  I am still a small guy and am in a position to get these items.  I just had to work for it. And now that I am here... the mobs are being controlled by greedy asses!<br>
<br>
To be completely honest, I am pretty sure I will eventually get everything I once dreamed of having 50 some lvls ago, in a lot of cases I already have better.  But the fact that some people now seem to believe you should just buy stuff now, I have a big SCREW YOU waiting for ya.  Have fun, take part in the kills, and for cryin out loud stop supporting the mercinary manaburners.  If you dont buy @#%$ off them, maybe they'll go away.  Feel free to buy your scale or other loot, cause as said before farmin pp and stuff isnt any easier then attaining the item through a fight, in fact it often harder.  But just dont buy from manaburners.<br>
<br>

<br>
Some thoughts on Manaburn, by a wizard/warrior<br>
<br>
- A whole bar of mana used to cast Sunstrike (For example, not even the really uber spells like Garrison's) Will out damage any MB wizard (Assuming he does NOT crit).<br>
<br>
- The advantage of manaburn is not the massive amount of damage, it's the fact that it is unresistable, and does the damage in one hit.<br>
<br>
- Wizards have always been the supreme KSers, they always have, they always will. It's the nature of the class.<br>
<br>
- Do you have ANY idea how hard it is to get the 15 MB wizards together to kill a critter like Sont?! <br>
<br>
- Given the correct group, a single group could kill Sont. Oh no! Nerf them too!<br>
<br>
- Manaburn does NOT trivialize pvp. Why? What good is a wizard with out mana? Yes, the wizard DTed you, how many of your friends did you tell about this? Assuming there are no other people after this wizard, it will take him 6 minutes to med back to full. All of this time the wizard is vulnerable.<br>
<br>
- ANY wizard can solo their way to manaburn. It is not a single few who are capable of getting manaburn. Wizards can solo from 1-60. They can continue to solo all the way through their AA points. What does this mean? A tiny guild can add a HUGE DPS into their guild. Notice the guild that wouldn't be able to even think about killing VS killing VS now that they have 4 MB wizzies? Manaburn has balanced the game more so than ever.<br>
<br>
Now I ask you, after reading all of these facts, why do you still care? Will it bother you just as much when a group of uber_01s come in and woop Sont with a single group? Will you say that levels need to be nerfed?<br>
<br>
Go look at the definition of a wizard class. I'll hint at it &quot;Masters of direct damage&quot;. Did you know druids at level 60 get a nuke that is the same mana/dmg ratio as Sunstrike? (Our highest nuke attainable by most wizards) Druids can't manaburn, it gives us the advantage in direct damage.<br>
<br>
I hope you can take the blinders off of your face, and realize that you're not upset about unbalancing, but rather you're just jealous. Argue you may, but if you look at the game as a whole, manaburn makes sense.<br>
<br>
And one last thing, every class has assholes. A team of MB wizards walks in and KSs Trak from you after you cleared the way? Do you think these wizards are going to get in on ANY raids from ANY legit guild? Monks train all the time, shall we nerf FD? Bards, Clerics, Pallies train using DA, shall we nerf DA too? Enchanters KS using Memblur, can we nerf that too?<br>
<br>
There are assholes in every class, don't let a few KSers ruin a wonderful ability.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uqanamyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qanamyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 1:23:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=954.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Yup</span><hr size=1> WOW , Myllo bro you sayed it better then i did i am not good at makeing my point man you rock Myllo! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uqanamyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qanamyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 1:27:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=954.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Yup</span><hr size=1> so, if your ready to kill serv, why can't you?<br>

All a wizard has to do is wait at any druid ring, see someone zone, press manaburn button, loot corpse, than gate to nexus mana free. Then just wait for the timer to reset and repeat! Imagine if you were to zone into wc with your fungi on. Then suddenly see the loading sign pop up because you died before you even got control of your character. Now start crying as you realize your precious fungi or other expensive item is gone.  TELL me that isnt broken beyond belief. It doesnt matter if you are the best equipped whatever class with the best dueling skills on your server because all the wizard has to do is press a button and wait 8 seconds, then you are dead. Correct me if im wrong but doesnt the wizards epic ds prevent any spell intterupts until its gone? If so then you could pummel all 8 seconds and still die as he channels through the single damaging hit you managed to land on him before the timer reached 0.<br>

&quot;The only way to avoid that would be for a cleric or pally to da the second they see the message. Then run.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uheliuswallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>helius wallace</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 9:51:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=954.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Yup</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Correct me if im wrong but doesnt the wizards epic ds prevent any spell intterupts until its gone?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It's a rune spell with mana regen. Nothing special about it. The best use for it is using it along side a manastone. Ganking people before they zone in is just BS, I thought pvpers had some class, but obviously the folks who do this have absolutely none. Besides, if you know you can be ganked upon entry, why would you go in wearing a pricey item like a fungi, and not have it in a bag? Not to mention the AA points required to pick up both Manaburn AND Nexus Gate, =\ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udobbanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dobbanz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/20/02 11:32:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=954.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Yup</span><hr size=1> Ah thanks for the info about the epic. I was with a 60 wizard friend of mine who was aoeing lguk for fun and profit and he always put up his epic effect before letting me pull everything in reach. I figured it helped him channel as well as block damage. As for the zone line gankers, they have always existed. With manaburn and mana free gates though it has gotten that much easier. As for bagging fungis and such now, yeah everyone does it when they can but in the beggining before everyone knew what mb did to you some people lost some very pricey stuff. Its bad enough on the servers where you only lose cash but when you lose an item as well, even if it isnt a fungi its is still a major blow. <br>
Like I said, I used to feel sorry for wizards, even druids who can solo just as well get into groups a lot easier for the most part but now that we see things like a 60 wizardsolo clearing fear and groups of 4 burning gore and other dragons I suddenly stopped feeling sorry for them and am now mainly ticked off by every dragon corpse that hits the ground due to team mb. I cant wait to go visit graffes the day that verant at least partial nerfs mb,(you KNOW they will with the way its being used) just to see the 50 page long topic in rants with half the people posting how unfair it is that it was nerfed and the other half laughing their asses off yelling, &quot;We told you so!&quot; BTW, by partial nerf I mean tagging 32k or less mobs as mb immune.<br>

&quot;It will kinda stink when it happens but after verant lets the fast ones enjoy it awhile it will be nerfed.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 413<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/20/02 2:35:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=954.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Yup</span><hr size=1> 32k immune? Naw they will probably just not let it stack for 20 seconds and add a 10 second full dispel/stun for the user on it for pvp.  Wouldn't hurt the lower end guilds for raiding, and you could still burn that orc pawn if you wanted too,  <br>
but gankers and farmers on the other hand would be out of luck, until the next thing to abuse came around anyway. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170513">Varaho Carnicero</a>
