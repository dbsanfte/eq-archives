If you read my posts carefully, my intent is to try to open some lines of communication and possibly inform people a little better of the actual mechanics that are causing these problems that Verant is trying to supposedly fix.  It was also put here so that instead of just going over to Monklybusiness and trolling with minimal information, people would instead have enough information to work together towards a comprehensive fix.<br>
<br>
So let's look at some of the issues that have been raised...<br>
<br>
As for raising the softcap, that Verant can lower monk mitigation through new damage tables also indicates that Verant could put select plate classes on new mitigation tables as well.<br>
<br>
We also know that Verant is retuning most of the higher level encounters due to the mod2 nerf.  Would it really be so hard to retune the attack values of those mobs to reduce the effective AC softcaps for those mobs at the same time?<br>
<br>
I don't disagree that Verant dropped the ball on all/all items.  From day one monks pushed that they didn't want all/all items.  What we really wanted was quest, planar and tradeskill armor that was halfway useful.  Old World, Kunark and Velious armor was a waste of space since day one.  Verant took the lazy way out by pushing monks towards those All/all items.<br>
<br>
To be honest, the day I first saw the stats on Dagarn and AoW legs, my reaction was WTF was Verant smoking?  I thought for sure they would nerf them down to something like 20 or 30 ac, or take monk usable off the Dagarn legs.<br>
<br>
The real root of this problem is not monk mitigation skills.  It's persistent laziness on the part of Verant to seriously consider the impact of those items on the overall game dynamic, combined with not raising the bar in Luclin in terms of effective AC (as they did in Velious and Kunark).<br>
<br>
Per my comments on monk soloing ability, my main point was that changing monk mitigation won't do crap if your objective is to allow warriors to solo or prevent monks from soloing.  I wasn't trying to say that all warriors should get the Belt of Marvelous Visions.  It all comes down to self-haste ability + regen.  3k, 4k, or 10k hps is meaningless once you're constantly regenning and the mob can't kill you.  Your solo rate will still be fixed by how many mobs you can kill per hour, IE DPS + regen.<br>
<br>
If you ask me, by giving monks self-haste on their epic + attack, they have put warriors and other plate classes into the position that the only way they can keep their DPS balanced is by getting hasted by a caster.  And as we all know, it's not like every group has a chanter/shaman just waiting to haste you.  Belt of Marvelous Visions was a nice first step, but to be honest they should have made alot more self-haste items available to non-monks.<br>
<br>
For those complaining about monks rampage tanking, maybe you should speak to the Raidleaders who assign rampage tanks as to why they assign monks to the role.  It has little to do with mitigation/hps, though they are a bonus.  The main reason monks get assigned to Rampage tank is because they can FD if the heal is going to land late.  That's it.  Otherwise, it would make far more sense for a pallie or warrior to ramp tank.  After all, they have far more HPs and defensive/self-heals.<br>
<br>
Finally, this last part is a bit of a general rant... so please excuse me 8P<br>
<br>
For those who feel the need to say that warriors should always tank better than monks, maybe you should consider the possibility that you suffer from AA vision.<br>
<br>
In the old days, a level 50 warrior would see a level 60 monk and say, &quot;I don't tank as well as you do, but I will when I'm 60&quot;.  In Luclin, they decided not to add levels and chose AA's instead.  The end result is that every level 60 thinks they should be on equal footing with every other level 60.  Fact is, every 2 AA points ~ 1 level.  So, if I have 30 AA's, I sure as hell better be tanking better than you, especially if I'm wearing late game gear while you've spent all your time in Seb/Velketor's Lab.<br>
<br>
Should a level 60 warrior in similar levels of gear to mine with similar AA's tank better than me?  Hell yes.<br>
<br>
Should a warrior who wears Velious class armor tank better than me when I'm wearing mostly NToV or better armor and have 30 more AA's?  Not a chance in hell.<br>
<br>
If I was level 75 this wouldn't even be an issue.  Well guess what, 30 AA's is ~ 15 levels in time and experience earned.  So instead of posting about monk_001 out-tanking you and having more ac/hp's, maybe you should include how many AA's you have, how much gear you've earned, and then how that stacks up to the monk you're comparing yourself to.<br>
<br>
And don't even start to argue about plate versus leather.  The vast majority of All/all items that are the key point of contention would not fit Any of these categories.  Phase spider carapace?  Sounds like plate to me.  Fungi Tunic?  Sound alot like chain.  Sure, plate vs. leather makes sense when you're talking Warlord BP versus Grandmaster BP, but not when you are talking Vyemm's left eye, Tormax Crown, headband of many visions, or any of the drops in VT.<br>
<br>
As I said, my apologies .. heh<br>
<br>
Finally... to the person who asked how much of my time I spend doing things, here's a breakdown.<br>
<br>
I've played my monk since Aug 99 (first and only main).<br>
I've got over 300 days played.  I hit level 60 somewhere around early Kunark (150 or so I think).<br>
I never MT on raids.  I only offtank when there's a shortage of plate tanks (IE dead or afk)<br>
I spend 5 to 7 days a week raiding.<br>
I spend most of my time pulling on raids (90 percent).<br>
I pull in most every group I'm in unless there's no plate tank (I usually group with guildies only, so not like there's a ton floating around all the time and they're mostly similarly geared)<br>
I parse both my raid and xp fights<br>
I usually XP nowadays in Ssra, CT, UP and Kael.  Rarely do I go into Seb, FG or Velk's Lab to solo.  I have different spots for that.<br>
<br>
I also lose XP's on raid at a rate of about one orange per week raiding due to pulling.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp.<br>

Ya, you know what, about a month ago warriors went over to monkly business because we felt like we were on the short end of the stick, and we wanted to open some lines of communication and possibly inform monks of the mechanics that were causing our problems and work towards a comprehensive fix, and for some reason the majority of the monks opinions were &quot;Shut up you whiny warriors, you just wanna be the focus of attention.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, forgive me for returning the favor, but shut the hell up.  You had your chance to talk and now the monk community has to accept the consequences for not working with us to develop a solution VI would see before this happened.  You've got no one to blame but yourself that this was the solution VI picked.<br>
<br>
Don't be surprised if warriors are less than receptive to your issues now after the 'warm welcome&quot; you gave us over there. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Veteran Haass Wolvesbane</a> <BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a>

<br>
The real issue is that VI once again skipped fixing warriors.<br>
<br>
Why? Why would VI nerf monks instead of boosting warrior ac/hp?<br>
<br>
Answer?<br>
<br>
Knights. <br>
<br>
Think about it, seriously. Someone high up at VI plays a knight. If they boosted ac/hp, warriors might gain some kind of advantage on those two classes in tanking ability(logical as it may seem). In other words, they couldn't &quot;fix&quot; things by mitigation or ac/hp fixes because they would have to give warriors more of a &quot;fix&quot; than knights to keep things kosher- they wouldn't have been able to give knights and warriors the same increases and get away with it.<br>
<br>
Solution? <br>
<br>
Nerf monks. Knights stay right on(or ahead of) warriors asses, and all three classes improve on tanking abilities relative to monks(which was what really did need to happen). Monks got nerfed so that knights wouldn't lose out on mitigation table/ac/hp fixes to warriors.<br>
<br>
If you think that sounds a little crazy look into knight improvements in the past year or so and what they're getting in PoP. Hell, if they hadn't added the new heals in for priests, paladins would have been ahead of shamans in healing ability come PoP. <br>
<br>
Who do you think will step up if it turns out monks are having problems? Hmmm..who has better post nerf ac than monks, good hp, and FD(with AA boosts)... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhaass.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haass</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 542<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/9/02 6:32:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An open letter to Warriors from a Monk...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Or maybe, we could all work on improving this game instead of leaving up to the nimrods at Verant.Up to you.<br>

Unfortunately, it's not up to me, and you and I can't do crap to improve this game.  Like it or not, those &quot;nimrods&quot; at VI are the ones hitting the keys here.  I don't read the boards and based upon how the monk community strikes me today, either nerf them or buff them when I go home at nite.<br>

<br>
Aye, well, morons are morons are morons. Whether you're at MB, Steel Warrior or the freakin Ranger's Glade. You DID get some peoples' attention over there, like me. <br>
<br>
Which makes many of your comments now sort of aggravating Haas.<br>
<br>
&quot;and for some reason the majority of the monks opinions were &quot;Shut up you whiny warriors, you just wanna be the focus of attention.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd invite you to read MB more frequently, but it's not worth it. Point is, you encounter that sort of dreck with a LARGE majority of the posts there no matter what the subject. It's just overflowing right now.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, forgive me for returning the favor, but shut the hell up. &quot;<br>
<br>
That's just mean man. Mean.<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all, Monkly-Business is FULL of moron monks wearing agi/dex gear that have less HP than my Greaves. These people are not the issue.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not really. Most monks don't wear that crap anymore. And the lower AC, lower HP, not yet level 60 monks are in danger of getting hit pretty by hard by the nerf bat (depending on how it swings). Maybe. Definitely need to wait and see how the morons at VI code this. But I'm already bracing myself for the worst. And that makes those people the issue, since they far outnumber the people the thing is designed to affect.<br>
<br>
In other words, I FULLY expect VI to mess this one up from the get-go. Then go back and Patch the PATCH. Like always. Either way, it's gonna suck hard for me.<br>
<br>
&quot;The people that are the issue are the ones that are selecting the HP/AC gear and not being retarded. Monks with comparable AC to warrriors CAN AND DO tank just as well as we do. &quot;<br>
<br>
Where? In XP groups? If so, good gravy that's so pointless a reason to do this!<br>
<br>
But I'm not here to complain about this or even to debate it much. Point is, SOME MONKS did respond to the warriors visiting MB.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THOSE MONKS ALSO PLAY WARRIORS. And frequent THIS board too. One of those monks is me.<br>
<br>
And some monks (like me) are already kinda bummed reading 45 pages of bullshit threads and morons whining about something that hasn't happened yet over at MB, and are just getting tired of reading it here TOO.<br>
<br>
Let's talk about warrior STUFF! And lay off the monks man. The nerf bat stings when it swings.<br>

First of all, I solo just fine without fungi OR epic. Ok, thats outta the way, now onto the next item. Monks have ALWAYS been tanks! ALWAYS! From the days of pre Kunark high end monks could reach 950ac or so. The only class that could do better was warriors who also had to have the best possible gear. Even then the ac wasnt a big difference as far as I can recall. The ONLY thing that has ever kept warriors from being totally replaced by monks is hp and taunt. Thats it, sorry to burst your bubble. The only advantage warriors ever really had was hp and taunt. We had more or less equal mitigation and superior avoidance. All that kept us fom being the ultimate tank class was your taunt button, the hp difference and the illiusion that a monk couldnt POSSIBLY tank as well as a plate wearing warrior.<br>
As for the monks commenton warrir soloing, I THINK what he meant was that with eqal hase, and ratio weaons as a monk, warrors could solo a mob and still have a similar percentage of hp left. /shrug. I dunno for sure but ive only seen high level warriors soloing light blues at best, and awhile back I had to save a level 49 warrior friend because he was trapped in the sarnak fort in loio.<br>
In closing id like to say that the original post does NOT neccesarily represent the opinion of the majority of the monk community. Neither does mine lol.<br>

<br>
If verant did something silly like give warriors the inate ability to proc something like sunstrike 3-4 times each minute of fighting - wizards might take an issue with that.<br>
<br>
Now, warriors arent wizards and we know that. But if we were running around the server on a killing spree knocking over lvl 55 mobs with little downtime, warriors would also bitch to high heaven if we got readjusted.<br>
<br>
Monk know they had it coming. Its not mystery to them, and they understand that verant tends to fix things slowly so if Verant fucks up the nerf and make it so monks are in great peril every pull because they die like wizards - its going to be a bad day to be a monk.<br>
<br>
If monks are kind of like rogues and rangers - they reasonable players, monks and otherwise, will be satisfied. But just like nobody would say a nerf of their class is good, monks arent either.<br>
<br>
Important to remember, this isnt about monk vs warriors. This is about Verant screwing up and attempting to fix it. Maybe monk, like clerics did and warriors apparently will, should get a gimmick to compensate for them losing an ability (although one they shouldnt have had). Warriors arent the bad guys here, neither are monks. And verant already took ownership of the problem. Maybe Monkly Business should focus on getting a &quot;gimmick&quot; out of this.<br>

<br>
While I am ultimatly lack the knowledge and time to do parses, I still think that number is somewhat wrong mathematically, Overall I will accept that block... blocks 6% of all attacks, but that  6% is more then 6% due to other skills and miss's.... <br>
<br>
Let me explain my thinking.<br>
(These numbers I am using are somewhat pulled outa my ass, however they I think are somewhat accurate based on whats I have read.. Feel free to put in &quot;real&quot; numbers.. however I feel my basis of my theory stays through.<br>
<br>
Lets say Mob A Parse has<br>
100 Swings<br>
<br>
Out of those 100 Swings (Monk)<br>
33 are straight out miss's<br>
4 are riposte<br>
4 are dodge<br>
9 are are block<br>
and 50 are hits.<br>
<br>
For a warrior<br>
100 Swings<br>
33 are straight out miss's<br>
4 riposte<br>
4 dodge<br>
3 are parry.<br>
56 are hits.<br>
<br>
So if you look at the amount of damage that block... blocked... it is actually 12% (Which is the fairly close to Warrior HP advantage.<br>
<br>
How did i get 12%, when the total amount blocked was 6?<br>
<br>
Simple, 50 of the hits never connected, so the block skill in blocked 12% of what would have been hits..<br>
<br>
This is not factoring in Mend/FD etc.<br>

<br>
&quot;Monks are DPS and pullers, not tanks&quot;<br>
pulling is tanking with out any healing. <br>
<br>
monk most likely will remain good Rampage tanks, due to how rampage works(not avoidance or anything else).<br>

Also I'm guessing the soft cap is remaining the same from this action(if soft cap was removed for all classes warrios would mig better then monks again)<br>

Lifting or even increasing that cap will utterly destroy game balance and cause VI to have to go back and retune EVERY end game encounter.&quot;<br>
<br>
but what kind of idiots set an AC softcap so low that every plate meleer and monk of high enough level hits it and the better equipped chain wearers and clerics even hit it?  oh yeah... verant... Then they chuck in a bunch of high AC stuff for the plate wearers/monks to make them FEEL like they have much better armor when in fact it's doing virtually nothing for them.  It is amazingly stupid to have set the game up that way in the first place.  When they're building an expansion, don't they have a pretty good idea what kind of AC each class will get up to?  Couldn't they have tuned the mob difficulty accordingly instead of having a ridiculously low &quot;softcap&quot; on the players?  Oh no, that would have made sense!  Would it be too hard to fix it now?  I don't know.  It would be a pain, but the game would be so much improved by it.  <br>
<br>
the monk nerf will be pointless to the high end game if it doesn't change the mitigation softcap.  And of course mitigation is still whacked with or without the nerf because of said cap.<br>
<br>
and btw, whoever was comparing having a monk epic or fungi to having an EB weapon... lol.  Monk epics are way, way more common than eb weapons.  And if you're 2 fights away, you've pretty much got it.  if you've got your 2 pipes, you've got it.  Those parts aren't hard to get with a group or even real expensive to MQ now (10k each or less), just boring, and the other fights are a joke.  The epic is standard equipment for monks by the low to mid 50's.<br>

Well I'm level 60 for a year and a half now, and still 3 fights short of my epic, and I bet i've spent as much time on it as you have, and my remaining fights are a lot harder than yours...unfortunately my epic is a piece of junk and not worth getting, compared to the class-defining item the monk epic is.  Comparing the monk epic to an EB weapon is ridiculous to say the least.<br>
<br>
Fungi tunics cost the same for warriors as they do for monks, and I bank my 100 hp 55 ac breastplate for a fungi tunic when I solo, so does any warrior that knows what they're doing.  Belt of marvelous visions has never dropped for us, and I don't know of anyone that has one.  Monks still do more damage, take less damage, and can heal themselves 25% for free every 6 minutes...that is the difference between monks and warriors soloing, not the fact that warriors are all to stupid to wear a fungi tunic <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6629>Brutul Vilesilencer</a><br>

<br>
Monks are on the same mitigation table as warriors. What that means is that if I get hit for 1200 I have the EXACT same chance as a monk to mitigate that damage down to lets say 600. That's what a table is smart guy.<br>
<br>
So, I have the same ac, a few hundred more hps, one less defensive skill and the same mitigation as a monk. Do you think the few hundred more hps makes up for the extra defensive skill? If you do, you're stupid.<br>
<br>
Then you add your ability to heal 25% of your TOTAL hps, the ability to escape from ANY situation, 2 damage tables above warriors and the ability at level 60 to use a discipline on EVERY SINGLE SPECIAL ATTACK and you're going to sit here and tell me things are kosher? Or that VI should retune the entire game instead of knocking the crap out of one ability that a LEATHER WEARING CLASS gets? Dude, do you have the IQ of a can of soup or something?<br>
<br>
And for the IDIOT that said that monks have been tanks since pre-kunark, you obviously didn't play EQ back then. There is a reason VI gave monks the moss covered twig in Kunark and the reason isn't because of their defensive ability. Rather because of their complete lack of it.<br>
<br>
God, the more you people talk the more I wish there was a way to nerf your class out of the game completely so I wouldn't have to listen to morons spew crap about something they know nothing about.<br>
