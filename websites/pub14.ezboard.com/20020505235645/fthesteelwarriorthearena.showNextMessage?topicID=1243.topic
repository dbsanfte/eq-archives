There are few ways to make big positive changes to avoidance AC, other than levelling. <br><br>The formula for the damage done by a successful hit of a MOB against a PC is DB + RAN * DAM/10, where DB is the mobs damage bonus, DAM is the listed damage of its weapon, if it's wielding one, or the value used for it's bite/claw/etc. attack if not, and RAN is a random integer between 1 and 20.<br><br>The effect of mitigation AC is to bias RAN towards one end or other of the range (i.e. minimum hit for DB, or modal hit for DB + 2 * DAM). For the kind of ACs usually seen on PCs below level 55, increasing AC usually leads to a big reduction in damage taken.<br><br>For level 55+ tanks wearing full HoT or Kael armour and reasonable gear in other slots, there is an observed AC soft cap whereby adding better armour has no detectable effect in controlled tests when fighting low exp blues.<br><br>If you disagree with any of the above, pleae go read some of the other threads in this forum before posting.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Theories</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>There are two theories that would account for the observed fact that increasing mitigation AC doesn't always reduce damage taken.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Soft Cap Theory</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>There is a mitigation hard or soft cap, which, like the 255 limit for adding mana due to wisdom, means that armour beyond this value is ignored or has greatly reduced effect.<br><br>There are supposed to be some statements from someone who might have once worked at Verant supporting this theory.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Trivial Combat Theory</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Due to the nature of the combat formulas, when the mitigation AC of a player exceeds the effective ATK of a mob by a certain amount, then no further benifit is gained. The analogy here is jewelcraft, where there is an equal (5%) chance to fail making a trivial item at 150 skill as there is at 250.<br><br>The main evidence for this theory is the log of an AC-capped tank being hit by mushrooms in FG for minimum damage 50% of the time, and normal damage the other 50%. <br><br>The difference is significant because if the second theory were true, then there would still be a point to having a 1300+ AC against the high-level raid mobs for which it is extremely difficult to do proper controlled testing.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Test </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Test subject was a level 58 rogue, with 1110 AC, 148 AGI, no active buffs except sow. A variety of green wildlife from East Commons, Great Divide, Hollowshade Moor and Freeport was pulled and left to beat on her back (so no ripostes). Hit/Miss rates and damage distribution stats were collected. In all cases the sample sizes were 200 to 300 attacks.<br><br>If the trivial combat theory is correct, then all of these combats should be equally trivial.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Results</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>bat:                   1% of attacks hit, 100% of hits were for minimum damage<br>large rat:             4% of attacks hit,  88% of hits were for minimum damage<br>giant scarab:         13% of attacks hit,  64% of hits were for mimimum damage<br>giant spider:         17% of attacks hit,  76% of hits were for minimum damage<br>owlbear grappler:     23% of attacks hit,  48% of hits were for minimum damage<br>owlbear razorbeak:    29% of attacks hit,  53% of hits were for minimum damage<br>drakkel dire wolf:    38% of attacks hit,   6% of hits were for mimimum damage<br><br>There is a clear upward trend the in the hit rates, and a slightly less solid downward trend in the percentage of hits for minimum damage. None of these mobs were dangerous enough to cause a spike at modal damage.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Conclusion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>The trivial combat theory is wrong, it is never the case that increasing the difference between mob ATK and player AC stops having a useful effect. In other words, the EQ combat tables keep on working smoothly even in extreme cases.<br><br>It is possible that there is some other explanation for what is going on with high AC values. However, it is looking extremely likely that there is a simple fixed AC cap, meaning that raid-level AC gear is equally useless when tanking a froglock or Yelinak.<br><br>Soru <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uuulax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uulax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/19/02 7:19:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1435.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ac.gif" align=absmiddle>  Some more data...</span><hr size=1> How many data points did you get each fight?<br><br>One interesting thing to note is that the Bat could not deal more than 1 damage to the level 58 rogue.  In some tests I did with a level 1 Warrior varrying raw AC, I noticed that past a certain raw AC point (believe it was around 10 or 20 raw AC), level 1 monsters lose the ability to hit for max damage.  At 1180 AC and level 58, level 1 monsters have lost the ability to hit for anything other than 1.  Somewhere between the two lie certain points where they loose that chance. (Note that all level 1 newbie zone monsters are identical in stats).<br><br>What this seems to suggest is that there are certain points at which every mob looses the ability to hit for a certain ammount of damage (the bias on the random becomes so great the chance of rolling for that hit becomes 0).  Against level 1 Monsters (who hit between 1 and 4), the damage increment is very small, so to completely loose the ability to hit at a certain ammount you'd have to bias the random a large ammount (luckily that's very easy at these levels).  <br><br>Anyone care to see if you can get AC high enough to prevent, say, a Sebilis Frog from hitting for max?<br><br>BTW, here's the data from my test (if you want <br><!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre> AC&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 3&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 4&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Missed&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Total Hits&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Total Swings41&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 35&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 16&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 9&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 8&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 76&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 68&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 14456&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 28&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 10&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 6&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 79&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 45&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 12472&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 48&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 7&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 7&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 0&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 100&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 62&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 16288&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 35&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 7&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 0&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 78&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 43&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 121105&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 58&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 10&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 4&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 0&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 99&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 72&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 171113&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 89&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 17&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 7&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 0&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 140&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 113&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 253</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br><br>PS:  Sorry for lousy formatting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usolinarinnoruuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solinar Innoruuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/19/02 7:44:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1435.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ac.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Some more data...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The trivial combat theory is wrong, it is never the case that increasing the difference between mob ATK and player AC stops having a useful effect. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Uh no offense, but your tests didnt prove that at all.
