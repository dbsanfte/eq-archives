<br>
:P<br>
<br>
Anyways, damage mitigation for warriors is rather messed up. But that's the fault of the game's design that goes way back. And now that I've had awhile to think about these changes, near as I can tell, verant's PROBABLY trying to address the issue of plate versus chain versus leather ... BUT ... they're only doing it bit by bit. And this was probably just the first bit. And they're probably going to screw it up anyways.<br>
<br>
So they may have good intentions, but most likely aren't going to institute the stuff properly and then they won't be given much of a chance to finish it by the players anyways.<br>
<br>
But we'll see what happens tomorrow. No big thang.<br>
<br>
But man, there is some skewing of the so-called &quot;facts&quot; about monks here:<br>
<br>
&quot;As if these facts were not pointed out a million times.<br>
1. They hit for the most damage any melee class in the game can hit for.&quot;<br>
<br>
This fact is wrong. The most damaging melee class in the game is rogues, and sometimes rangers (1600 point bow crits are pretty high compared a monk flying kick)<br>
<br>
&quot;2. They are perfect Solo Melee class as well. Feign Death makes it so they can solo almost anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
They're certainly an effective soloing class, when twinked properly. But hell, with a fungi and the right gear even rogues can solo. And &quot;almost anything&quot; is kind of vague and misleading. There are a LOT of mobs that monks can't solo.<br>
<br>
&quot;3. They also get hit least.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, actually rogues get hit the least when they group. :P<br>
<br>
&quot; Among many other things i can point out it is well known that monks have had it great (greatest even ) for a long time.&quot;<br>
<br>
? Had what great?<br>
<br>
I dunno man. Sounds like you're a tad unhappy with your own class, and just cracking on monks to crack on monks.  Whatever. Classic example of the grass is always greener.<br>
<br>
The monk complaining has gone way past the point of sanity, but,  sheesh, so much venom about magic pajamas.<br>
<br>
Anyways, it'll all be revealed tomorrow ... well actually Thursday or Friday after the emergency patch to the patch after the patch which fixes the four or five exploits that will be available after the first patch. And maybe by Saturday you'll REALLY see the changes since by then bard songs will be fixed and spells will stack correctly again.<br>

After all, we do so much more damage than you do that if we DIDNT get some way to dump agro all you would see on a raid is monk corpses. You see, back then we didnt HAVE 6800 hp at the highest end. We had fairly poor hp that couldnt really take too much direct punishment. Enough to toss a star at a mob and pull it back to camp sure, but not enough to make toe to toe on a raid mob a smart move.<br>

I do not completely know everything there is to know about monks but i am just posting the way i see it.  And Monks seem to think that we are the ones who have Nerfed them. Well sorry freind the arguing does need to stop it was brought here. When i look through posts i see Monks going off and i am just pointing out the way i see it.<br>
<br>
I am a level 43 Warrior and i have solod my way up there. But at the same time i have been around plenty of Monks to know that they solo pretty dang well. While as a warrior i have to pull one kill and then bandage for a long time (up to only 50 %) Monks dont have the same bandage cap as we do AND they can Mend wounds along with regen.  Now if i pull and get an add i am pretty much in deep crap. While a monk who gets too much to handle can just lay on the ground and be fine. <br>
<br>
I have gotten many add's from Monks who have done that. <br>
<br>
This is not a bash the monks forum. But monks have come here and complained. I have been quiet but when i look through posts all it is is arguing with monks over a Nerf that is frankly not gonna destroy their class.  It is balancing.  If you have a scale and it is tipping to one side you take a little off the heavier side. Which is what VI is doing. Trying to make tha balance scale even again.  They messed up with the armor that is true. <br>
<br>
Monk posts were brought here so i am gonna throw in my opinion on the monk nerf and piss off a few monks in the process.  Only reason Monks are gonna argue is for arguing sake. Arguing with my opinion or anyone's opinion for that matter is not gonna change the Nerf.  <br>
Especially with us Warriors cause frankly most of us think it is a good move. <br>

<br>
But, I think you need to pay closer attention to the monks you're around, their gear, and their levels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Monks dont have the same bandage cap as we do<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Monks have the EXACT SAME BANDAGE CAP AS YOU. Until level 51.<br>
<br>
50 percent.<br>
<br>
So if you're hanging around with monks that bandage more than 50 percent, they are over level 51.<br>
<br>
Warriors BW cap goes past 200 at a later level than monks (I forget what that is, but it's in the FAQ here). BUT, that's offset in the Alternate Advancement abilities where warriors get IMPROVED bind wounds (and will likely get an improvement to the improved bind wounds in PoP). Warriors with their AA's spent in bandaging will seriously outbandage monks. Like that's really a big deal, but ... point is ... you will eventually bandage much better than the monks you hang out with.<br>
<br>
Anyways, it sounds like you really have problems with monks class specific abilities.<br>
<br>
Seriously, if you WANT to MEND, if you WANT to Feign Death, if you WANT to do all these things monks do, play a monk. <br>
<br>
ALSO, the ONLY monks to have regen are IKSAR. Human monks have no added hit point regeneration at all. They're the same as everyone else. So if you want to have amazing hit point regeneration while you mend and feign death, play an Iksar monk.<br>
<br>
And remember TROLL and IKSAR warriors have the exact same regen as IKSAR MONKS. So you TOO could have had that regeneration as a warrior.<br>
<br>
You chose to play a warrior.<br>
<br>
There are things you will do in this game that a monk will NEVER do. Like wear an AC 75 breastplate. Like TAUNT a monster. Like taunt ALL the monsters in the general area. Like have the Avatar of War beat on you for an entire fight. Like breaking 5000 hit points unbuffed, and 7 to 10 thousand raid buffed (PoP's gonna have some nice HP improvements to warriors, I'd hope).<br>
<br>
You've got a lot to look forward to as a warrior. Don't get hung up on monks who feign death when they get their butt handed to them. They're just monks. You're the tank in the big badass looking armor taking the beating. It's what you do.<br>
<br>
And don't worry about soloing. Because druids and necromancers certainly solo a hundred times better than any silly monk.<br>
