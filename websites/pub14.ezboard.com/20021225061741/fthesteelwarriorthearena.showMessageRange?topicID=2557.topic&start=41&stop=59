It's what you do. You take a mob. You engage it. You position it. You hold its attention. It's what a warrior does.<br>
<br>
I can't think of a single non-raid situation where you would be better off pinning a mob rather than keeping it in the open. Wall agro, poofing, LOS issues with spells and archery, 'You cannot see your target' messages and melee/pet push all argue conclusively AGAINST pinning a mob.<br>
<br>
With that said, how hard is it to engage a mob 15 feet out from camp, in the open, engage it, gain some agro, and then strafe 180 degrees so it's back is to the group, thus signalling that &quot;I have good agro, this mob is yours to do with what you wish&quot;? It's not. It's your job. Do it.<br>
<br>
If you lose agro every once in a while, sit. If you lose it consistently, figure out why and fix it. If people don't listen to why you don't tash before the mob is engaged, or drop huge bombs during enrage, leave. It's that simple. It worked for me when I was in Treeweave and GJBS/Wraith Bone Hammer and it works for me now. <br>

What a nice simple clean world you live in.  Unlike myself, where in the pickup groups I typically find, you're lucky to find 3 out of the 5 players are better than average.  Where when I make suggestions people get all huffy about how they've played their character for umpteen million years and so of course they know more than I ever will, and of course immediately afterwards they bitch about how I'm trying to do my job.<br>
<br>
Leaving a group because not every player is doing exactly what they probably aught to be doing, at least on my server, will get you a lot of time sitting at the zone in LFG. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

I take it you have never hunted in a tight walled dungeon?<br>
<br>
From my experience it is the pets and casters chain nuking that knock mobs into walls and corners more than the melee classes. Its even worse when the mob is rooted or stays back to fight some other target and you can't drag it back out.<br>

Once I pick a general way to face a mob as my warrior, I'll keep it at that position the rest of the fight, but I'm not going out of way to milk another 5dps out of a mage pet. I frankly don't care. I have more important things to worry about like making sure that I don't die to enrage, to give a damn whether the pet will or not.<br>
<br>
I know I may sound high and mighty but I really get annoyed when mages tell me to maneuver so the pet can backstab, hit the back etc... What's worse is having 2 pet classes in the group and you position for one pet and the other mage bitches cuz you respected one pet and not the other. Or they bitch because their pet and the group pushed a mob in such a way that the pet is no longer at the mobs back.. and of course, it's the warriors fault!<br>

God, honestly, just STFU. When you join a group you are supposed to be eliminating problems, not providing them.

-I am a tank<br>
-I have a pet that is even more dependant on seeing backside to do damage than a mage pet.<br>
<br>
There are two sides to this:<br>
<br>
1) A good tank, if everything is going well, will position the mob and keep everyone and everything else behind the mob.  However, perfect conditions do not always exist and shtuff happens.  As a tank, I will position the mob to the best of my ability with pets, rogues, rangers, etc behind it.<br>
<br>
2) ANY pet class that places their pet too high on the importance list needs to reevaluate their priorities.  Group dynamics and using each class to its fullest IS the responsibility of the GROUP, but there is a point past which I assume you will take care of your own class issues....  I expect NO ONE else to accomodate my pet, although I might ask someone to try something a tad different if I feel it won't be too much of a chore for them.  All pet classes know pathing blows... there are times the tank has much more to worry about than the life of a pet, and pet owners are usually more equipped to handle said issues.<br>
<br>
Example: party is rocking and mobs are dying left and right...  I ask that the Warrior tanking moves ever so slightly to the right allowing my pet to get behind... warrior agrees as my pet can add some surprising damage despite its un-uberness.<br>
<br>
Example2: Party was trained... I am tanking and the slow landed by the chanter gets him a nice beating.... then two more mobs join in.  I don't care about the dang pet.. in fact, If I can get the pet killed and save the chanter/cleric/ (insert player class here) I am going to... taunting and getting aggro in a hurry is primary... Its a minor consideration where that pet is &quot;dumbpathing&quot; to and dying to rage because its owner can't reel it in.<br>
<br>
In short,  the spirit of the original post was fine...  however, the attitude I got when I read it (and re-read it) was closer to &quot;YOU need to make my pets do their extra 5DPS&quot;.  I know that wasn't the spirit of that post, but I couldn't help but getting that from it.<br>
<br>
I agree with the statement tanks should do their best to try to optimize such things...<br>
<br>
I disagree with the idea that it is ALL the tanks job (or even that its mostly their job).  The pet owner should mention tips how to use their talents better... the tank should do their best to help out, but the pet's usefulness rests mostly in the hands of the pet owner.  Anything else on the part of the pet owner is just laziness.<br>
<br>
If I can feign pull, MT (and add-tank at the same time), cycle short duration group buffs/taps, nuke, debuff, and control my pet, (Hybrids rarely get to med in a group) then a mage can handle nuke, debuff, med, and their pet.<br>

I take it that you don't seem to realize that Kromagnon was most likely referring to PoP zones?<br>
<br>
PoP zones are mostly outdoor and have plenty of space for you to run about. <br>
<br>
If you are referring to a dungeon, and you find a dungeon thats so tight 2 people cannot walk abreast, then the whole group should be as close together as possible.<br>
Or hmm.. ever heard of Shrink potions, Cobalt Bracer? If you are always in a dungeon and you are of a big race, then for goodness sake, SHRINK yourself! if you have the Bracer, then Shrink everyone! That will give you plenty of space to move around.<br>
<br>
IMO, don't blame the environment cos it does not suit you. You should be suiting yourself to the environment instead. <p>&lt;fontcolor=&quot;cornflowerblue&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tiejinnie - 60 Warrior&lt;br&gt;<br>

Not all of them it is still possible to fight in a tight space level 61+.<br>

No other person in the group should have as much control over the facing of the mob then the MT, and if the druid or someone else does, I strongly suggest you remove them from your group.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned, it seperates the good tanks from every one else, at least in the eyes of those with pets and to a certain extent, other tanks. It is not rocket science ... MT has an important job and pets are a big factor in the game now. The path of least resistance is that the MT positions the mob to rogues and pets. If you do not do that , that is fine as well, but I will pick the warrior that does each and every time, but do not be surprised if you are not the MT on the next big raid *shrug*. <p>Baron Runestorm   Epic Arch Mage <br>

<br>
Actually, at least in my experience, for a raid this isn't true.  What happens is the MT positions the mob in the place and facing the direction that is the best for the raid, such as head first into a corner, or walking it up and down a hall, or facing it in the direction where its knock back won't send everyone careening through the air to their deaths, or where the Clerics can position themselves safely and still perform the CH cycle or whatever.<br>
<br>
The pets and rogues accommodate the direction the mob needs to face due the situation, not their preference.  The needs of the raid out weigh the desires of the pet users and Rogues.  And this is as it should be.  This is of course for a raid.<br>
<br>
Now, does a group MT have some leeway and control in which way a mob faces?  Yes.  Does he necessarily have complete control of where the mob is?  No, not necessarily.  Many times circumstances or other player actions will cause a mob to be in a less than ideal position.  Then the MT can just do the best he can.  Saying its completely under his control is wrong.  <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

Some mobs, the higher level you go, it becomes near to impossible. Being able to control the mob 100% of the time is impossible, but realisticaly, one KNOW'S those situations, or should at least. The point was really that in *most* type of situations, a MT working *with* the pet class *can* when working together achieve more efficient results. It is not about 'thou must playeth in this fashion', and neither it is ' yer a pet class, I Bob-the-tank ju do pet, me do taunt'.<br>
<br>
Sadly that point was long lost. <br>

<br>
&quot;Its not my job. Go away.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's interesting.&quot; -- bloody rare, but maybe someone out there read it and thought that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
&quot;I do it already.&quot;<br>
<br>
The post was intended for the #2 reader. #1 is welcome to their opinion, but I like many people am interested in efficiency and getting maximum bang for the ridiculous time expenditure EQ demands. As such, If I know I have a #1 and a #3 tank to choose from one day, you know who I am going to pick up.<br>
<br>
Maybe someone out there in EQ-land got the original intent of the post (let's work together on this for the benefit of the whole group) and took it onboard, if so then I'm happy. The rest of its just a traditional message board pissing contest, and I have no intention of wading into it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=h0gfather>H0gfather</A> at: 12/5/02 4:36:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chatjaogre>chatja ogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 363<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/5/02 6:23:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2557.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Mikar must hate me, since I always die to enrage hehe :/ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aauminki>Aauminki</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 1286<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/6/02 2:04:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2557.topic&index=56>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> That's a lie Chatja!

<br>
If I can give the pets the back of any exp mob, I will. If the pet can backstab, it becomes a bit more important to me. If the mobs running around and being a general pain to position, I might not be able to do so.<br>
<br>
On raid level encounters... I'm not going to swap an about to enrage mob. Sorry, but your pet is competing with all the melee that are on the back, if he's not. If this mob has been knocked across the room and back 8 times... You may or may not get the back. <br>
<br>
Someone said that if the mob enrages, your quadding pet is dead before his HP bar updates?<br>
<br>
I duel wield 18 delay weapons, generally. I generally have at least VoG, and 36% item haste. I laugh when people call rage in channel because I'd be dead by the time I read it. And I rarely take much, if any, enrage damage.<br>
<br>
Really, it works better if both classes make the effort. The tank positions it if he can. The pet class backs off if he can't.<br>
<br>
Warrior, really, is just attack, kick, taunt, same as mage is just /pet attack, nuke, DS. It's knowing when and where to press those buttons that seperates the wheat from the chaff. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17853"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://photo5.matchnet.com/beta/2002/10/15/13205296.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bubbahbonecrusha>Bubbah Bonecrusha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/7/02 8:37:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2557.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pets, Positioning, and PoP.</span><hr size=1> In new UI, you have a bank of pet hotkeys that DO work even when you are casting spells. <br>
<br>
I also play a shaman so I see both sides of this first-hand. As a shaman, I stand behind the mob when I malo/slow. That way, if I draw aggro, the MT doesn't have to chase the mob. Rather than run away, I will torpor myself if I get aggro.<br>
<br>
As an MT, I can only do so much. If pets engage too soon or someone draws aggro away and the mob gets out of melee range, positioning is a pita. I prefer a group that goves me 2-3 seconds to aggro and position the mob before they engage.<br>
<br>
Grouping in PoN in the goblin caves, I had a druid cast a Ro's debuff too early and got summoned. She ran away and the mob follow and I followed the mob /sigh. The cleric then asks, &quot;How hard is it to get away when you get summoned?&quot; The whole time I'm thinking, &quot;When the hell will they learn that if they stand still I can re-aggro SOONER and they'll take LESS damage?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glatius2>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 627<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/7/02 10:12:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2557.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pets, Positioning, and PoP.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;When the hell will they learn that if they stand still I can re-aggro SOONER and they'll take LESS damage?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Amen.  I've seen too many Wizards and Druids who think being summoned means they need to kite. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>
