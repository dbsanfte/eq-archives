<br>
A: I agree (and I think most knights do too) that warriors need a &quot;better&quot; taunt. As I said in another thread, perhaps a button that adds small amounts of unresistable +hate that will help a warrior *travel* the hate list. There are already 2 buttons for instant aggro (although they are not as great as people want them to be) You *can not* give a warrior a button they can press every few seconds to lock aggro 100% because it would make the game boring.<br>
B: Warriors *HAVE* higher dodge/parry/riposte skill caps (higher than knights)<br>
C: Warriors (on test) have the block skill through shields, like every other shield class.<br>
<br>
Are any of you a warrior on test? How can you comment about the lack of aggro when you have not seen the changes first hand. Perhaps the aggro generated by a shield is significant.<br>
<br>
About defensive. You call this the &quot;3 minutes of glory&quot; discipline, but do you honestly think that 3 minutes of every 10 is meaningless? I have yet to see a warrior in my guild have real aggro issues with others pumping out great dps. Some people act like if a knight was tanking fights would take half / a quarter of the time... this is not true. There is no way to raise DPS past a certian point, and as it stands the non warriors in my guild output at the same rate that they would if a knight was tanking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukildace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kildace</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/27/02 4:17:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re: So much for warriors being needed to lock aggro...</span><hr size=1> I don't mind if SKs and Pals can aggro well.<br>
I don't mind if SKs and Pals can tank fairly well. (Hell i'm happy for them, they get their niche there by tanking mobs you have to position like in RoV or VT for instance)<br>
<br>
I mind that warriors are no longer the BEST tanks for boss mobs because of our sucky mitigation and flaky aggro (yes of course aggro depends on the raid, but it depends more on our lucky, or unlucky procs than on the raid, if I don't proc once in the first minute I'll lose aggro no matter what), I mind that we were balanced because we were the best and only tanks and that we no longer are (We can't solo because we're the best tanks, we can't buff, cast, we don't have decent class AAs because we were the best tanks ... well we no longer are and we're not pissed because we arent' the best tank in EVERY situation, we're pissed because we aren't the best tank in most situations and we have nothing else to offer to the raid, even pals have more DPS than we do and we have to get 2HS like Emp and Seru to compare).<br>
<br>
I don't mind having a redefined role, make us tank 15% better than other classes inately therefore we rock at boss tanking more than any other class but sometimes SKs and Pals are better than us, give us more Dps abilities, more proccing weapons with damaging procs at EVERY level, add 300 lure dd to enraging blow so our dps doesn't suck anymore, give us some group discs that act as buffs like haste that makes the group go over the cap (Like Warcry, only useful), or adds more HP, something unique we can add to a raid when we're not tanking (50 or 60% of the time for the guild's main tanks, 90% of the time for non main tanks).<br>

<br>
B: Yeah, but I still think those skills should be upped. Pallies are a great class now, (or so I hear, if not, wrong forum) while warriors are feeling they should be a little better.<br>
<br>
Pallies have<br>
dodge - 155<br>
riposte - 200<br>
parry - 205<br>
<br>
Warriors have<br>
dodge - 175<br>
riposte - 225<br>
parry - 230<br>
<br>
Maybe up them all for warriors by 15 or so. That should be enough. Or something of the like. Maybe only up dodge to 210. Maybe lower, but SOMETHING!! lol<br>
<br>
C: I don't ask for a shield, I ask for block. I do not need a shield, because that will make my taunt/DPS way inferior. I am ok with pallies and sk's getting a nice block skill with their shieldthingy, but I would like warriors to just HAVE block.<br>
<br>
Lastly I would like to ask why you are preventing warriors from having a little upgrade? Do you think we do not deserve to do better than we do now? Almost all classes got their upgrades, except for warriors. Everyone got a lot better at their role, but warriors only got a bit better. The role of tanking &quot;that big ubermob&quot; has become harder because &quot;that big ubermob&quot; is way more uber than he was an expansion ago. <p><CENTER><HR><TABLE width="400"><TR><TD align=center><A target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=280301"><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>Ursza Datank</FONT></A></TD><TD align=center><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>level 60 High Elf Wizard</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align=center><A target="_blank"  href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=250867"><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>Kater Ambandil</FONT></A></TD><TD align=center><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>level 60 Vah Shir Warrior</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>Member of <A target="_blank" href="http://www.divinewinds.org">Divine Winds</A> on the <A target="_blank" href="http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern">Saryrn server</A></FONT></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uainmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ainmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/27/02 4:53:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ainmer.homestead.com/files/roland.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re: So much for warriors being needed to lock aggro...</span><hr size=1> From the Everquest web site: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp">eqlive.station.sony.com/l...lasses.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

&quot;Warriors are the masters of armed combat in all its many forms. They are right at home on the battlefield and are trained to take as much punishment as they dole out, because of their innately strong constitutions. &quot;A warrior is not made,&quot; they say, &quot;a warrior is born,&quot; and so it is. Those who prove themselves to be hardier than others are perfectly suited for the rigors of this class. Though slow to regain their considerable health when injured, warriors are excellent companions for healer types. Only the Erudite and high elf races do not produce warriors. &quot;<br>
<br>
It's true, we are trained to take as much punishment as we dole out.  It's just too bad we dole out jack @#%$ for punishment.<br>
<br>
The &quot;masters of armed combat&quot; must be some kind of sick joke, however... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uursza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ursza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/27/02 4:57:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re: So much for warriors being needed to lock aggro...</span><hr size=1> Oh and I do not play on test because I have a job, I work for 9 hours a day 5 days a week.

When I first read about the upcoming changes to shields I was very concerned, but then I saw the &quot;wait and see&quot; post and took that to mean that there were going to be some changes to warriors to balance this out. However, after reading your post in this thread I no longer hold out that hope.<br>
<br>
All we want to be able to do is tank, tank far better than any other class in the game, it's our only job and we give up so much to be the best at it. We are one of the worst solo classes in the game, almost totally dependant on groups for exp. We don't get spells. We don't bring anything to a group, and more importantly to a raid, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> except</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> our ability to tank. While at the same time we need help/buffs from almost every other class in the game to be able to do our job effectively.<br>
<br>
Look at the state of warriors in the game today. We have monks being able to tank almost as well(or better) than us in groups and on raids while at the same time doing massively greater amounts of damage and being able to FD, mend, pull, etc. We have hybrids being able to take aggro from us, hold aggro better, and do a better job TMing on raids, not to mention MAing in groups. The HP advantage we had over hybrids has now almost completely disappeared, there is a paladin in my guild with over 7000hp raid buffed. Our class defining discipline has been slowly eroded to the point where it is useless for 99% of the games content. Our relative DPS has fallen behind to the point that other classes do many times our damage on raids.<br>
<br>
What is the response the growing outcry over this? A huge upgrade to shields. All this does is make hybrids better tanks, while they lose none of the aggro generating abilities from their spells(and actually getting improved aggro spells on test at the same time). It does nothing for warriors except diminish us further. No warrior in the high end game will ever be able to swap out a hate generating offhander for a shield. Not while trying to maintain aggro over rogues backstabbing with 16 20 daggers, monks triple attacking with 17 19 claws, rangers trueshotting and wizards throwing out 5k Garrisons crit nukes. I don't care if you gave every shield in the game an enraging blow proc, it still wouldn't cut it.<br>
<br>
Absor, all we want is to be the best at our <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> job in the game, the one thing we are supposed to do far better than any other class. Tank. Please, put us back where we are supposed to be. Give us a separate and improved damage mitigation table. Give us a higher dodge cap. Give us innate block WITHOUT a shield. For God's sake give us something, before it's too late.<br>

<br>
I just wanted to point out that this is kind of a misrepresentation of the actual facts.  While true, it does not point out that the paladin maintaining aggro without turning on autoattack will be casting stuns constantly, and pounding on his taunt, disarm, and beg hotkeys.  And will STILL lose aggro to melee's who are pounding on the mob, if he runs oom or stops casting at any point.<br>
<br>
Stun hate seems to be forgotten rather quickly, where melee hate seems to be something the mob remembers for a while.  Just based on personal experience, not parsing or data collecting or anything like that.<br>

<br>
If you look through every single one of my posts here I have in no way said warriors should not get a little upgrade. I have simply tried to point out that warriors are still superior tanks for boss mobs at high end EQ. I have stated in several posts that I agree with the concerns of warriors about taunt and class DPS. Lastly, I have NEVER whined about an upgrade to another class on any board.<br>
<br>
The majority of posts I have seen in this forum lately have been along the lines of...<br>
&quot;omg SKs can taunt, warriors are useless&quot;<br>
&quot;knights are better tanks&quot;<br>
&quot;there is no difference between a knight and a warrior except warriors do not have spells&quot;<br>
<br>
And I strongly disagree with ALL of the above. Warriors are, and will continue to be superior tanks until knights get another 1khp (with warrior hp staying the same) and defensive / evasive disciplines. Knights have been able to out aggro warriors since the first SK dinged level 9 and purchased disease cloud, to this day I dont see SKs MTing AoW, Emp Ssra, VT boss mobs (other than triton MTing aten with them) etc etc.<br>
<br>
Relying on procs alone for aggro sucks, but bitching about spell lines that will allow warriors to gain a 20% aggro modifier is absurd. I have not seen you say it, but instead of random_warrior435 posting &quot;well, glad I have a sk twink.. time to switch mains&quot; about changes to the knight class is rediculious. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uursza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ursza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/27/02 7:20:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Knight aggro</span><hr size=1> I see, ok<br>

I agree with you there.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with knights being able to outtaunt me and I think that the spells Verant added are nice, they will make the SK more a utility class and help warriors gain agro on raids. Great for the game.<br>
<br>
I do not think knights can tank better. They are coming really close though, too close for me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And I hope you would agree with me that fixing/upgrading taunt is not enough.<br>
<br>
I am also scared of the shield upgrade, because there is currently no information about how this would benefit warriors.<br>
<br>
My main is currently my warrior, but I indeed would think about changing it back to my wizard if there is no change to warriors. Problem is that I would have to leave my guild to change maincharacter. <p><CENTER><HR><TABLE width="400"><TR><TD align=center><A target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=280301"><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>Ursza Datank</FONT></A></TD><TD align=center><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>level 60 High Elf Wizard</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align=center><A target="_blank"  href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=250867"><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>Kater Ambandil</FONT></A></TD><TD align=center><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>level 60 Vah Shir Warrior</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>Member of <A target="_blank" href="http://www.divinewinds.org">Divine Winds</A> on the <A target="_blank" href="http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern">Saryrn server</A></FONT></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uarative.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arative</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 289<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/27/02 7:24:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=70>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Knight aggro</span><hr size=1> I heard from a war on test that was bashing with a shield and hitting from 60 to 70 damage a bash.

If that is true, I dont think it will effect our DPS as much as people think it will. Certainly I will like to see what sort of taunt factor is added to the bash, if its high enough, it will be a viable alternative to dual wielding. But given that I can only think of 2 shields, one from Cazic and one from Aary that have 100hp, I doubt I will be using a shield much, I am not willing to give up the hitpoints, that and the fact my bash is like at 50.<br>
<br>
I would very much like to hear from test warriors on their thoughts about how shields are working.<br>

<br>
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?  There is less than a 500hp difference between hybrids and warriors.   As for the shield thing, yeah the last thing warriors need is a shared upgrade that will help close the gap on other classes doing our job as well.   Im not a top tier tank, but ive done Gozz,Doze,Telk,RC,VTS,Vindi,Zland, with wielding the warrior epics 1h and 2h and I really dont see a taunt problem.<br>
<br>
I would just like a more substance to my class, personally i think mutually exclusive skills would be awesome, ie you can pick a tanking/damage/archery/whatever AA  instead of being MeatShield01 tank 1 of 5 in a raid , hoping for the tank ahead of me not to die.   <br>
<br>
Not all warriors should be meatshields, let the ogres have that job =).<br>

<br>
In reply to the &quot;400hp&quot; diff between knights and wars:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Unless you have some messed up points guild with knights having tripple the point raid attendance than every warrior I dont see how the gap isnt at least 700 or more with your knights / wars. I am one of the best equipped knights on my entire server, and I am about 1k hp from the best equipped warrior on the server and 900hp behind my guild's highest hp warrior (raid buffed).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In reply to &quot;has already been stated time and again that a warrior with 255sta and ND3 will have about 400-500 more hps than a knight with 255sta and ND3 and PE (dont get me started on PE)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The 425hp diff is with no gear factored in. A warrior will have an extra 100-125hp in their secondary melee slot usually, along with 100hp crystalized acid bracers of much farmage etc etc. I said earlier in this thread that the real world difference between wars and knights is much larger. Since you used furor as an example lets go that route.<br>
<br>
Furor has about 7800hp raid buffed.<br>
Dregor (foh SK officer) has about 6900hp raid buffed.<br>
Kreugen (one of the best equipped paladins that I can think of) has about 6950hp raid buffed.<br>
*numbers based off magelo profiles*<br>
<br>
Like I said earlier, I am about 900hp behind my guilds best war. Dregor / Kreugen seem to be about 850-900 behind theirs. That 425hp diff doesnt translate well into real game numbers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So everquest melee classes are going to be compared/balanced using Furor and the best Sk's ?  How about atleast using the average or using the top 90% of what a melee can be.   <br>
<br>
If you search through the top warriors/sks on Drinal (the server im familiar with) you'll see the difference is about 400-500hp  and of course there isnt an AC difference..<br>

<br>
If you play a knight class your answer to this will be a yes. Correct me If I am wrong please.<br>
<br>
Are you going to loose dps and aggro from your offhand ?<br>
<br>
No. You never had an offhand weapon. You were designed with a shield in mind.   Your knight only weapons have special ratios to compensate for the lack of an offhand weapon.<br>
<br>
As a knight you ALWAYs had 2 options. <br>
a) 1hs+shield combo. (knight low dps mode)<br>
b) 2hs for increased damage.(high dps mode)<br>
Regardless of option, knights aggro ability is not dependant of weapons in hand.<br>
<br>
Warriors are a dualwielding class. We always had 2 options.  <br>
a) Dualwielding (high aggro and low dps mode) <br>
b) 2hs for increased damage (high dps mode)<br>
Warrior aggro ability is dependant of dualwielding fast ratio weapons and procs. <br>
<br>
When this shield upgrade goes live, warriors will suffer a loss in dps in 2 ways.<br>
1) The loss of our offhand weapon damage (something we always had)<br>
2) The lack of 1hs with ratios designed for shields.<br>
<br>
Can any knight, and Absor, honestly  say that BOTH warriors and knights will loose DPS in the same degree when they choose to use a shield?  <br>
<br>
Hell if bash indeed does increased damage with a shield equiped this would mean that knights will GAIN more DPS from this upgrade. <br>
<br>
It is ridiculous that knowing these facts someone has the nerve to say that warriors will benefit from the shield just like knights will. <br>
Remember melee class balancing where knights are supposed to be 80% of the warrior melee? This would be totally false while using a shield.<br>
<br>
Can you see how this gonna benefit the warriors in the same degree as knights?  <br>
No. It wont.<br>
<br>
Are knights loosing anything to gain the benefits of the shield block?<br>
Heck NO. they GAIN from it much more since they always had shields as part of their arsenal. <br>
<br>
Do not ignore the fact that we dont have a shield and 1hs designed for it in the bank when this goes live. <br>
<br>
<br>
Posible solutions to balance this out so we all benefit from this in a balanced manner :<br>
<br>
1) Warrior normal 1hs weapons will gain a Damage Bonus when a shield is equiped on the offhand.  The Damage Bonus would be high enough to maintain the supposed class balance where knights are 80% of warrior melee.<br>
This would allow warriors to use their current 1hs instead of having to hunt for some uber mob to drop a 1hs with ratio designed for a shield. This would allow BOTH knights and warriors to benefit right away when the shield upgrade is implemented. However warriors would still have to buy or hunt for a shield.  And aggro would still be an issue.<br>
<br>
2) If the above cant be met. Give Warriors(Rangers,Bards, Rogues) the ability to block with offhand weapon. Either equal or almost as effective with a shield.  This would allow warriors to gain from the block modifier feature in their current low dps-high aggro mode(2hs is our high dps mode just like knights).  Add the aggro to bash (large races can benefit from it through Slam) and add aggro to the kick (so medium/small races can benefit from it as well). <br>
<br>
Either of these 2 options(or both) would allow EVERYONE to benefit from the incoming changes in a balanced manner right away when implemented. <br>
<br>
<br>
The following is not a balanced way to do it(please Absor do not copy/paste the following for next patch message. K thnx):<br>
<br>
Implement shield changes to benefit Knight, Casters and Priests right away. Warrior aggro will be done through the new line of aggro spells aviable for shadowknights and Enchanters.  Introduce Warrior only 1hs restricted for shields alone. They will have to hunt for them or buy them to benefit from the changes while the knights, priest and casters can benefit from this with the gear they always had.<br>
 Warriors will loose dps from this change since they always used an offhand weapon. Their already flawed aggro gaining capabilities might be lowered somewhat, but with the new line of aggro spells combined with other players having to hold back even MORE to not steal aggro will allow warriors to use the shield. What matters here is that most classes will benefit from this change more.  Warriors are still working as intended. Other will be improved even further. <br>
