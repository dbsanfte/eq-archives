Therefore, I need to tank as best as I possibly can. As a result, I've worked solely on AA that will help me take damage better in order to make me a better tank.<br>
<br>
I've maxed Natural Durability, Combat Agility, Combat Stability, AE Taunt, Physical Enhancement, Lightning Reflexes, Innate Defense, and Planar Durability. I just started working on Stalwart Endurance. After I max that, I'll work on Planar Power.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any other suggestions? Bear in mind that all I want to do is tank better. I don't give a crap about DPS in exp groups unless it will help me tank better.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid to work on any offensive AA that will give me more attacks due to the riposte damage I can potentially take. I noticed that after I switched to my 2Hander (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17278" target="top">Staff of the Four Winds</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->), the damage I took was significantly decreased in comparison to my old 1 Handers, and I hold aggro just as well.<br>
<br>
However, I would be interested in offensive AA's that don't offer more attacks per round if they will pull more aggro. For instance, do the increased crit percentages from Combat Fury allow me to add more hate, or does the extra damage not count toward the hate I generate? I know that wizard crits don't count towards increased aggro. Is it the same with warrior crits?<br>
<br>
I also thought about Tactical Mastery, but I heard that you still take riposte damage even though your attack gets through. That sounds kind of underwhelming.<br>
<br>
Any input/advice is greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Most of the other offensive aa points are a trade off.. they will generate more aggro but make you swing moare as well and therefore take more reposts.

Seriously, combat fury and tatical mastery are both great aa's and work well with 1 and 2handers. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

All of these will result in additional damage with no additional ripostes.<br>
<br>
Here is something to consider about the other offensive AAs (including Stalwart Endurance - less timed stunned = more hits) too: Although you may swing more (thus more riposte damage), you are doing more damage, which makes mob dies faster (thus stopping riposte or any other damage to you). Of course as already stated more swings and more damage is also good for the additional aggro built up too.<br>

<br>
Also, Flurries (at least from mobs) cannot be riposted from what I understand.  I believe I also read here from a poster that said they flurry a lot and never get riposted.<br>
<br>
As far as the additional swings bringing additional ripostes, well if you are going for DPS agro you may have to do Punishing Blade and just deal with the extra damage you take from ripostes.  However if you rely on procs then the extra swings from PB won't make that large of a difference on the overall hate you generate.<br>
<br>
I just recently got 65 though and I have just 6 AA's so maybe someone with more experience with the above mentioned skills could give you some in game situations to make the comparison on.<br>

<br>
It has no defensive value whatsoever - BUT, the dps (and hence aggro) increase is nice, without causing any extra ripostes than you would already be taking. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=573077" target="_blank">Fvighlander</a><br>

The other offensive AAs will (unless I'm forgetting something, like I forgot Ingenuity in the first post). <br>

So long as you stick to the 2hs, you should be good.

<br>
All I can tell you about is the following AA skills that are outside defensive ones but ADD a HUGE amount of aggro.<br>
<br>
Combat Fury 3<br>
Flurry 3<br>
Ferocity 2<br>
Fury of the Ages 3<br>
Punishing Blade 3<br>
Raging Flurry 2<br>
TM 2<br>
<br>
Using mainly a 2h Twisted Steel Bastard Sword and a 2h Primal War Lance.  I have out aggroed level wizards, rogues, rangers etc. You name it..I out aggroed it.  Even when someone had 275aa backing them.<br>
<br>
Okay now someone is going to say &quot; extra damage does not improve aggro&quot;.  LOL..it sure does.  With the above skills and being level 65 also I do 120 dps on a low to 150 dps on a high which both were around 70% speed.  I rarely lose aggro when in a group.<br>
<br>
When I upgraded just to Punishing Blade 3 I saw an increase of around 20% in damage done and the following happened.<br>
My minimum hit went from 1 to 18.<br>
My maximum hit went from 587 to 735.<br>
My average hit went from 129 to 198.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time I was in a uber guild and back then I was actually told to put away my 2h weapons since I was always stealing aggro from the MT who was tanking a major named mob.  The MT was decked out in over 100 defensive AA skills but lacked any offensive AA skills whereas I was balanced more towards offensive AA back then than defensive.<br>
<br>
So I would say get those offensive AA skills up as they do help a lot to keep aggro against any mob but also make sure if you want that much aggro you have the defensive skills to survive all the attention or you will fall like a &quot;paper tank in the wind&quot;.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps but remember that each of us have to choose our own paths to go by.  Choose whatever AA skills you are comfortable not what someone thinks you should have.<br>
<br>
PS...when I finish raging flurry 3 and tm 3 and ferocity 3 I plan to go back to TOVN and kick those stupid flying flurry type mobs that use to kick my butt.

No offense but your smoking some good stuff there.<br>
<br>
minimum hit is affected by weapon delay and character level only.<br>
Maximum hit is affected by strength, weapon damage and delay and character level only.<br>
Average hit is determined by ATK.<br>
<br>
Punishing blade does nothing more than add an extra swing to 2h attacks on some rounds.  It does not affect how hard you hit, it does not affect how often you hit,  it does not affect minimum or maximum hits for any weapon in any way.<br>
<br>
Anyway with 1800 ATK, full offensive AA minus double riposte and ambidex, using a Twisted steel bastard sword I average 110-120 on level 60+ blues in the elemental planes.

An attack negated by a mob's special defense does not negate its aggro.  I've ran into too many rogues not paying attention in XP groups to verify this first hand.  If I turn attack off on enrage, rogue gets waxed on enrage.  If I leave autoattack on, it doesn't matter how few or how many of my attacks actually pierce the auto-riposte, the rogue stays happy.<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone's able to prove that any of the AA that make you attack more often (Ferocity, Ambi, Flurry, and Punishing Blade) gets you more aggro.  It's just a logical assumption since obviously the act of swinging at a mob generates aggro, so more swings should be more aggro.  I think it's a bit silly to worry about Ripostes so you wouldn't get anything that makes you attack more.  If you're that worried, just get a good 2hander. <br>
<br>
The only AA that can possibly give you more aggro are Ferocity, Ambidexterity, Flurry, and Punishing Blade.  Everything else just adds more DPS, but not aggro.  Think of them as a permanent attack buff. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=weoden>Weoden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/03 6:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3052.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Maxed My Defensive AA's, Now What AA's Make Me a Better </span><hr size=1> if more attacks = more aggro then non-enraging blow weapons that were fast would own the game(ignoring enraging blow weapons) and I don't see that at all.

I don't think anyone is saying more attacks = more aggro. They're saying more attacks with the same weapons = more aggro. DPS certainly plays a factor in aggro; I definetly notice the difference in aggro if I'm slowed, normal (unhasted/unslowed), or hasted. I don't know, maybe this has to do with potential damage though. <br>
<br>
In any case (ie barring more aggro generation from offensive AAs), more DPS is always good, especially after you've maxed all your defensive AAs. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.dragonsfang.com/revolution"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/ssbbrothar/tamsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->{<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=474594">Zarrina</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->}-------------------------------------------------------{<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=240522">Torria</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->}</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=broddathep>Brodda Thep</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/03 11:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3052.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Maxed My Defensive AA's, Now What AA's Make Me a Better </span><hr size=1> I don't think DPS plays any role in agro.

<br>
ie a 5/20 weapon and a 17/20 weapon wouldn't generate the same agro.  Each ATTEMPT to hit the mob with the 17/20 would generate more agro than each ATTEMPT to hit the mob with the 5/20.  Perhaps the amount of hate is based off of ratio.  Who knows?<br>
<br>
But I have seen enchanters who got a facesmasher get agro JUST by swinging that thing around.  Even with 10 skill they can still get agro off of a warrior dual wielding cruddy weapons and who is still doing 5 times the DPS of that enchanter.<br>
<br>
So offensive skills that increase your chants to attack would be best for generating agro. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hussarian>hussarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/03 12:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3052.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Maxed My Defensive AA's, Now What AA's Make Me a Better </span><hr size=1> I've noticed significant aggro increase with Punishing Blade myself.

i think # of swings and dps both effect aggro generated.  I usually use a windblade because of the dps.  When I was using a pair of fleshgrinders, they seemed to taunt a little better than windblade even though the dps is significantly lower.  Speed apparently had something to do with it.  However, I've also noticed with windblade that if I get a string of misses at the beginning of a fight, it seems to be easier for someone like the poor chanter to pull aggro while getting some good, hard hits early on will stick the mob to me.<br>

I.e. swinging at 50 damage weapon makes the mob madder than swinging a 10 damage weapon (but you might get to swing the latter quite a bit more often).  It's very easy to verify that swinging more with the same weapon gets you more aggro.  Just get slowed and you'll see a noticeable drop in your ability to keep aggro assuming your weapon has no procs.<br>
<br>
It doesn't seem like the actual DPS you dish out really matters though.  I know monks and rangers are always like &quot;OMG I have 2500 attack!&quot; on raids and I don't see them getting hit more often than usual.  Pre mod-rod nerf any number of Luclin ubers have AC so high that you can only hit for min and casters didn't seem to get aggroed any more than usual (which should be the case if DPS matters, since warriors do significantly less damage). <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lykwidmofu>Lykwidmofu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/03 9:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3052.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Maxed My Defensive AA's, Now What AA's Make Me a Better </span><hr size=1> Personally ive decided to go all AA toward defense and 2handers.

And if you get the right AA , a decent 2h weapon (over 1:1) can put out some incredible damage. <br>
<br>
 When you have the potential to land 4-5 hits with a big 2h in a single combat round , your potential damage to the mob is huge , makeing for huge aggro.<br>

 Two handers are the wave of the future , and with windblades (50/44) goin for under 20k now it wont belong before most tanks are using em .<br>

<br>
Listen up a second please some of you doubting warriors.<br>
<br>
Take a player who casts a huge damage spell at a mob.<br>
Now take a warrior who is doing 120 dps which is 7200 damage in one minute.<br>
<br>
and we all agree DPS = damage correct and so is the spell doing damage?<br>
<br>
If you were a mob and someone cast a 10000 spell at you and a warrior is swinging a blade at you lets say in a 15 sec period which would be 1800 damage who do you think the mob is going to go after?<br>
<br>
Common sense says if I were the mob I would go after the caster as he/she ticked me off the most in the first place (even if the spell fizzled).  That is what we call aggro and therefore AGGRO is attempted (whether failed or successful) wether it be a caster casting or a warrior swinging at a mob.<br>
<br>
Now given the information above can you see where the amount of damage and attempted damage does and can create an aggro situation?<br>
<br>
So ie. the more the ATTEMPTED damage the more the aggro generated.  I don't care whether your truncheon hits that slow proc or not.  Just the attempt at trying to slow the mob will create aggro.<br>
<br>
So...if we go by this premise then we have a new formula that gives us an idea on how much aggro is really produced by counting ALL attempts/swings/casts/procs against any one mob.  There is one addition before we do this formula though.  The hate list weapons out there with aggro procs do add multipliers into this equation so that we will hold for those for another another day.  I would imagine there is a multiplier 2x for 250 proc hate weapons, 3x for 500 proc hate weapons etc.<br>
<br>
VARIABLES from Parser.<br>
<br>
Total Damage Done to Mobs 198000<br>
Number of seconds in battle with mobs (1650)<br>
Your average Hit per swing (19<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
ACCURACY: Number of Misses (150)<br>
AACURACY: Number of Hits (1000)<br>
DPS: 120 (Total Damage to Mob/Number of seconds)<br>
<br>
AGGRO FORMULA:<br>
Total Damage of Mob + (Average Hit per swing x Misses) = True Aggro to the Mob<br>
198000 + (198 x 150) = ?<br>
198000 + 29700 = 227700 True (Attempted and Successful Damage)<br>
<br>
Now lets slip that into TRUE AGGRO DPS now.<br>
<br>
227700 / 1650 = 138 DPS<br>
<br>
Now lets take a caster who casts a 2000 damage spell on the same mobs in just a period of 20 secs.<br>
<br>
Lets see 2000 / 20 secs is 100 True aggro dps (whether it succeeds or not) but in that same time period a warrior will do 2760 True Aggro DPS so we can assume that even if the caster fails they will not receive aggro.<br>
<br>
But lets take this one step further.  The caster decides in same 20 secs to cast a 5000 damage spell on mob. 5000 / 20 = 250 True Aggro DPS (whether it succeeds or not).  Same time period warrior will again do 2760 True Aggro DPS so we now assume that since the caster is doing almost twice as much TRUE AGGRO DPS that caster gonna get the mobs attention.<br>
<br>
Sure there are a lot of variables besides these like what weaknesses against certain spells a mob has or hate proc weapons etc. but what it starts out with IS DAMAGE pure and simple.  Whoever does the most damage first gets the aggro and yes procs like slow, boil blood, snare, darkness will always tick off a mob.<br>
<br>
Go against a uber named mob in say TOVN and see that casters will wait to use their UBER spells with UBER damage against these mobs.  Why?  Its simple by that time the MT has done like 20k damage not including procs off their weapons etc before the caster even casts that uber 10000 spell.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion whether we attempt the damage or have successful damage that ALL DAMAGE, whether melee or caster (whether successful attempts or not) + PROCS on weapons (whether successful attempts or not) = to TRUE AGGRO.<br>
<br>
Simple Test but warn the shaman or enchanter in your group before you do it.<br>
One mob use your slow/snare/boil blood/darkness weapon and as long as you attempt to any proc the mob (seeing a message mob has been successful or that proc failed) aggro will be held on you.  Then on next mob don't use the weapon and the shaman slows and I guarantee that 95% or better that the mob will attack the shaman.<br>
<br>
So once you have the TRUE AGGRO DPS then you can figure out which procs like boil blood, snare, darkness, slow, lifedraw etc work better to keep the mobs attention.  Just hate proc weapons will not do this all by themselves.  Hmm..a little footnote for any proc weapons have your dex around 150+ if you really want weapon to proc.<br>
<br>
Okay..now flame on for all I care<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     The above conclusions have been tested and proven.<br>
<br>
And a previous posted pointed out what I knew all along about min and max hits per swing.  I was half asleep when I posted that one.  Sorry about the mis-info but however AVERAGE HIT PER SWING is gotten by total damage / total hits.<br>
<br>
Hmm..and on TM I still consider that more damage.<br>
<br>
The definition of TM is:<br>
This ability allows the warrior to evade defenses of the Enemy.<br>
Each rank grants an increased chance to avoid an opponents special defenses such as: block, dodge, parry or riposte.<br>
<br>
If a mob cannot block your attack:  More damage to mob. Less damage to you.<br>
If a mob cannot dodge your attack: More damage to mob. Less damage to you. <br>
If a mob cannot parry your attack: More damage to the mob. Less damage to you. <br>
If a mob cannot riposte your attack:  Less damage to you.<br>
<br>
IE. It allows you to bypass a mob's defenses which leaves the mob OPEN to more successful attacks on it not to mention a reduced amount of damage back to you on mob's riposte.  So its offensive and defensive.<br>
<br>
On PB 3 it did raise my DPS about 12% - 15%.<br>
<br>
Geeze..and all of this was the condensed version of what I was going to post.<br>
