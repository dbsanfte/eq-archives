(I have also a 62 magician and Plane's-Able Cleric and Paladin)<br>
<br>
Lets face it, LDoN changed the face of EQ drastically. Nowhere before (outside of the PoP zones) could you level that fast.<br>
<br>
They did however make some mistakes. Here is my opinion of what they could have done to fix these dungeons.<br>
<br>
1) DO NOT COUNT FAILURES. Everyone wants to be rewarded for a job well done but nobody wants to have their failures rubbed in their faces. This also led to people starting a dungeon and alienating their friends who might have come online after they were already inside. Nobody wants to leave a dungeon and have that black mark put next to their name.<br>
<br>
2) Loot should have been awarded at the END of the dungeon. Sure you can have the normal drops that already happen, but the real loot should have been in a box at the end of a dungeon, guarded by a named MoB. EVERY TIME.<br>
<br>
3) ALL Loot found in a dungeon should have been NO DROP. I sat back and watched the Rusting Hero Shield (AC40 HP+55 Mana+65 All resists+7) drop to 500pp. Thats absurd! That shield should sell for a lot more, but because it wad readily available, the prices fell and fell and fell. The same thing happened to the Delightful Orb and Stained Axe of the Scions. All of those items have flooded the market from LDoN.<br>
<br>
4) Points awarded. The HUGE difference in the points awarded in a dungeon is just insane. If these dungeons are built to suit the groups that enter these dungeons, they why should a group of 30s only get 3 points for a win, if the 65s can get 51? Yes the points are to buy things at the adventure merchants, but that could have been addressed by putting required levels on the items on those merchants. In order to the point at which you can afford some of the higher point items in those merchants you would have had to complete hundreds of dungeons. When I see an item that has a reccomended level of 35 and costs over 500 points, I just laugh. You will be level 50 before you can afford that item, just from the exp you get doing all those dungeons. Award points by the character's level with a max of 55 points (hard max level dungeon). For example a level 20 character would receive 20 points for completing a dungeon in the allotted time frame. Award half the points for a completion in &quot;overtime&quot;.<br>
<br>
5) EXP is just too good in those dungeons. The LDoN dungeons took the place of many of the dungeons we grew up with. Najena, Befallen, Sol A, Sol B, The Hole, Charasis, Nurga/Droga, Sebilis and City of Mist are virtually empty now. (not that this is a bad thing for those of us who hunt there).<br>
<br>
6) Augments were just way out of whack. These are a great idea but to put augmentation slots on EVERY item just screwed things up. The only items that should have received augmentations are the main slots (Chest, Arms, Head, Hands, Legs, Feet, Neck and Waist) and Weapons and Shields (held items are not shields unless they have AC).<br>
<br>
Everyone has their own opinions, these are just some of mine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gryffshadowjumper>Gryff Shadowjumper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/29/03 7:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2122.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What SoE did wrong with LDoN</span><hr size=1> ***********-Another Warrior's Opinions-**************<br>
<br>
I think your right, in some ways, and wrong, in some ways.<br>
<br>
The loot in a box, I think is wrong and right. You cant have no matter what you get loot. I think that there can be a chance, to have items in a box at the end of a level, because people would also do what they do now and do LDoN all day and get more and more and more loot each time, granted, with the no drop loot, it would work out great. I just think that basically giving the loot away at the end of the dungeon is bad, because I think the way the loot is now is also alright.<br>
<br>
<br>
The all loot bein no drop is al right, because it would make it so that you cant go into the bazaar and equip yourself with &quot;uber&quot; gear and go out and be awesome. ALL SPELLS NO MATTER WHAT SHOULD BE NO DROP, but thats just spells. I like the no drop loot thing but I think that only some things should be No drop, like the augments are already no drop.<br>
<br>
That just one dwarf's opinions, disagree if you like. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://deprugh.home.mindspring.com/Torii1.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Having also been here since the beginning of time as he has I have the same views on the AMOUNT of certain items that has dropped within these adventures.  Its absurd to say the least.<br>
<br>
Because of this the economy has been turned inside out and yes it has even affected tradeskilling items we can craft and sell.<br>
<br>
I guess that some of you don't remember the old days when you would save for months to get your first uber weapon?  &quot;combine weapons&quot; I think thats what they were called from that npc that wasn't always there in east commons tunnel.<br>
<br>
Granted we have to evolve and I do agree that we should keep up with the times but flooding the markets with super items from LDoN therefore pushing their values down to 1/20 of what they should be is very stupid and wasn't very well thought out.<br>
<br>
I am talking from experience in reselling items quite a lot in bazaar and auction channel and same for tradeskilling having 5 GM's in 5 tradeskills.  What LDoN also did was to kill off a very large market of each cultural armor tradeskillers could make.  Don't get me wrong.  We still have a market for it but its very small to what it was before due to the augmentations you can put on pieces of armor acquired both before LDoN and after LDoN came out.<br>
<br>
