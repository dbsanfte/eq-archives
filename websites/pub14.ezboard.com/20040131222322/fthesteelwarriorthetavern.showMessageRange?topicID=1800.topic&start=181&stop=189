<br>
this is ripped from a post by one of our guild sk's who is running 7800hp raid buffed in ntov gear. granted he has a sick amount of AA points.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have mainly followed a defensive sequence for my AA so far, with a few offensive ones thrown in here and there. With defensive ones finished, I will be doing offensive ones soon.<br>
ND3, CS3, CA3, PE, and then planar durability, lightning reflexes, innate defense from pop abilities. Along with a few points into stamina when it was lower.<br>
ND3, PE, planar durability were all well worth it for the hps gained. CA was also good. Whether CS3, ID, LR make much of a difference I am not really sure. Mitigation is fairly important now, so I think it does help in PoP.<br>
<br>
Soul Abrasion 3 - The best SK aa really, supposedly the SK equivalent of slay undead 3 I guess, but pallies got ripped off with how few mobs SU3 works on (and its only 20% increase in average damage dealt against them anyway, and is spiky), but maybe they got the better use of it pre-pop.<br>
SU3 increases the lifetap from self imbue lifetap proc buffs by 3 times. With the level 55 buff that makes the proc from 50 lifetap to 150. With the 63 lifetap it makes it from 65 to 195. It's constant, its consistent, it works on all mobs (that arent 100% MR), really nice skill.<br>
<br>
2h Bash - Good skill, tiny DPS increase, but good for interrupting casting. Before PoP it only interrupted up to level 55 mobs, same as regular bash. Now with PoP it interrupts blue con mobs (that arent immune to stun component of stun spells I guess, ie no dragon/giant flagged mobs.. pop giants areng giant flagged so most blue things in pop it works on). Also has the normal ~1 second semi stun to it on mobs it works on, if a mob is running away and then 2h bashed, it will stop still for a second. Also during the time the mob is bash stunned it doesnt attack, though this may not actually decrease damage taken if the mobs swing timer keeps going, they will just attack straight after. I havent looked into this though.<br>
<br>
Spell Casting Fury - Really crappy skill at level 1-2, at level 3 it becomes good. A lot of points for what it is I guess, but with self imbue lifetap procs increased, zevfeers bites, lifetaps, weapon procs etc, its actually quite nice. Also needed to get full effect from HT increasing AAs later.<br>
<br>
Leech Touch - Makes next HT do less damage, but lifetaps. Doesn't stack with any other HT disc or aa, and uses regular HT timer. Kind of weak in a way for most purposes, but an instant 900pt damage/heal can come in handy especially when I know for sure that a heal wont land on me in time. Has probably saved my life in excess of a dozen times while exping, but maybe I just know its there for exp groups so can be more risky with my heals. Raids I have used it a few times as a sort of quick heal for myself if Pooby drops. I can only recall it saving my life maybe once in this situation though.<br>
Later I can increase the ammount this will lifetap for (from 900 to 1500 at the cost of 9 aa I think, a bit steep).<br>
<br>
Super Harm Touch + Unholy Touch - Proper HT upgrader, level 1 UT increases HT base to 1500 base, and auto crits (so always will do 3000 damage with SCF3). Also stacks with HT discipline which further increases the damage by 50% (so to 4500).<br>
Level 2 should be to 2k base (4k always crit, 6k with disc).<br>
Level 3 should be to 3k base (6k always crit, 9k with disc).<br>
These would all be more with focus items.<br>
Unholy Touch &amp; Leech Touch its only one or the other though, if I blow one I can't use either til they reset (60 mins, can get it down more with more AA).<br>
I only have Unholy Touch 1 at the moment, will be working on UT3 next I think. Fast damage is becoming more important with PoP.<br>
<br>
Speed of the Knight, Knights Advantage - Increases number of attacks while using 2h. Worth it for the DPS increase from what I gather, I have level 1 of each but it can wait til after HT. I also hate knight 1h weapons with a passion at the moment, the huge DPS drop is too big for the minimal defensive gain at the moment with the current generation of knight 1h weapons (or lack of them really).<br>
<br>
Thats all of note for SK.. other than Fearless (which I have yet to see an encounter it will be useful on, maybe Aerin'Dar?).. at 12+6 points to get this, seems fairly expensive for something that is never used. I have always expected to see a mob that requires the MT to have this, but haven't seen it yet. I don't have it anyway to comment more, nor do I plan on unless there is a need for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
add all this in with uber instant aggro and the fact he only has 600hp less than our guilds ma means that we should start bitching for a nerf to knights if you guys aren't going to come to the party and back us in our requests for reasonable upgrades<br>

the ogre part is irrelavant, but the time played is big.  i have experimented with many many weapons combos...<br>
going all the way back to mino axes and stuff...<br>
<br>
my first &quot;magic&quot; weapon was a Brutechopper..(weeee<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )   <br>
<br>
the point here is that not long ago, my guild desided that we would have a big discussion about what weapons do for the tank to control agro.   my point was that if you have fairly speedy weapons with a proc that snares, stuns, nukes, or makes critters mad at you, you WILL hold agro.<br>
<br>
i put this to the test a couple of times...MT'd Treah in PoG with Trochilic's Skean and a Silken Whip of Ensnaring.<br>
we had a couple of SK's there and one was new to the guild and itching to prove how much of a tuff guy he was...he tried to steal agro from me and failed.  i used the same weapon combo in CT where a rogue doing sick DPS couldnt pull the mob off me.<br>
<br>
i have moved onto new weapons...new ideas and stuff, however, the basic idea is that if it makes the mob mad, do it.  Trochilic's Skean may not appear to be that good of a weapon, but if you consider it's stun and minor damage, the thing really does kick butt.   i still carry it, sentimental, i suppose.<br>
<br>
i would also like to say, in my experience, never can a warrior out agro an SK with a 2 handed weapon.  just doesnt seem possible.<br>

<br>
Fact[4]: Currently the mitigation/HP difference between Warrior and a Knight is not sufficient to justify the aggro control difference between the two. A slowed mob will use up considerably less of the Knight's HP resources than an unslowed mob will use of the Warrior's HP resources. Knight superior aggro contol allows early slowing. Warrior aggro control makes that extremely risky.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>as for 3, simply not true unless the rest of the group is too retarded to root/memblur/whatever. Even if they are too retarded to do that a decient amount of the time the warrior can get agro before the slowed mob has a chance to swing. This is true based on my own experience, no exagerateing. From playing my wizard there is no way that I could nuke more with a knight then with a warrior and still regain mana enough to not need to sit out on fights, or what have you (with some flowing thought, KEI, horse, and spiritual purity on) you just need to pay attention to when you nuke and toss in clicky nukes/whatever when you want mana back. So three is simply not true, or if it is true for some it is not true for all, and therefore is not fact.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So you mean to claim that Knights don't have better aggro control?  That stun is in no way shape or form better at moving a character up on the hate list than taunt?  That taunt never fails and always works?  That a Shaman who is slowing early won't get beat on a great deal more with a Warrior tanking than with a Knight tanking?  Are these your true contentions?  You counter my facts with ways to work around it, which doesn't negate the facts.  It just shows that with more effort, you can make it work anyway.  My final conclusion shows you why people won't generally prefer more work over less work while reaping the same results.  Less work &gt; more work.  Simple concept, I'm really hoping you get it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>for 4 the ending is hyperbole, &quot;Warrior aggro control makes that extremely risky.&quot; bullshit, I've never had a slower die on me because i couldn't taunt off of an initial slow (again no exageration). If you have because you couldn't get agro either you suck or your healer sucks, or the game really hates you. The slower could also have made a mistake as well, that being cani low, slow, get hit once, then low life agro kicks in, cleric doesn't heal in time and slower doesn't heal himself for whatever reason, etc. The rest of four falls apart with three. One root spell goes a long way.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Any Warrior who claims they've never had a slower die on them off an initial slow is either a liar, has never played in PoP, or isn't playing a Warrior.  Does it happen all the time?  No.  Does it happen enough to make slowers leery of Warriors?  Yes, it does.  Read the thread on the Shaman boards about Warrior taunt and you'll see that the majority of Shaman agree with that.  Now, are you telling me that you're a better judge of what gets a Shaman killed than the people who play a Shaman? <br>
<br>

Your confidence in your own intelligence is over blown.  You're confident that you know it all, yet seem completely unable or unwilling to listen to what the other classes are saying.  You completely disregard what Clerics are saying, what Shaman are saying, what Warriors are saying, what Enchanters are saying, and so on.  All that seems important to you is what you are saying.  Well, your opinion doesn't amount to a hill of beans compared to the majority opinion of a number of classes.  And trust me friend, you're not any smarter than a lot of people who play Warriors.<br>
<br>
The only ones who seem to have majority disagreement with Warrior aggro control seem to be people who play Shadow Knights and Paladins.  And why might these classes think it's a good idea that Warriors not get any improvement in any way shape or form?  The answer should be pretty obvious.  <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
Holding aggro is not the same as getting initial aggro.  I can HOLD aggro just fine with an EB weapon but if it doesn't proc right away and taunt fails a few times in a row then the chanter is tanking.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes I get lucky and get an EB proc on the first swing.  If that happens the mob is generally locked on me the whole fight even with an early slow.  Sometimes I don't get a proc for 10 seconds and taunt fails 4 or 5 times in a row.  Doesn't happen very often but it DOES happen and that usually means someone dies.  A knight can guarantee that that will NEVER happen.  I can pop AE taunt every 15 minutes but even that doesn't work if someone has low HP aggro.  It doesn't take much for a chanter to get low HP aggro... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=472195">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Ok, DiedraofXev, while having a slight bit of overconfidence in your language skills, you attempt to minimize the issue by playing the age-old &quot;context&quot; card.  The problem with playing that is that anyone that actually knows context will own you for life, as if you were a goat and that person had all of the Louisiana Purchase to mow.  (For those that don't quite get my point, goats eat stuff like grass, and the Louisiana Purchase was a really big piece of land, with stuff like grass on it, and it would take the goat a long time to eat it all.)  Anyway, context is in fact key, as by using context you can then create a conclusion.  Without context, your answer to the question &quot;Why is that poster so stupid?&quot; might be &quot;F*** you, Valyr, I'm right and you are an idiot!&quot; when perhaps the question was referring to the latest poster that is coming with the new EQ expansion.  That's context.  Context is not a crutch to mindlessly swing when you want to want to bean someone in the head.  Warriors have enough crutches, please keep yours to yourself.<br>
<br>
You, DiedraofXev, just like Goladus, show that when all else fails you have to ignore or modify the meaning of words to fit your conclusion.  In your case, you decided that &quot;not as efficient&quot;, &quot;third choice&quot;, and &quot;a risk vs a known&quot; all mean &quot;useless&quot;.  Hell, you even intimated that useless means something other than useless due to space constraints in a really big book called a dictionary.  <br>
<br>
Here's an aside:<br>
<br>
Did you know there was another book, similar to a dictionary, called a thesaurus, in which words of similar meaning are grouped together for ease of reference, thereby allowing for better definitions of words in the actual dictionary itself?  Roget has a stellar one, I suggest you look into it.  (Don't get the pocket guide, not very big, not the effect I'm looking for).<br>
<br>
Back to my point:<br>

By showing what wonderful ways (and they are wonderous, these abilities, that the other classes get...the ones that get aggro, that heal folks, that do damage...really neat stuff) folks can work around the flaws in the Warrior class in regards to game mechanics, you have unwittingly described the exact scenario that we have collectively posted about.  The conclusion others are reaching (ok, not you or anyone you know or have ever grouped with, no need to get all indignant) is simply <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WHY SHOULD THEY BOTHER WORKING AROUND SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WORKED AROUND IF A KNIGHT IS TANKING INSTEAD OF A WARRIOR</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  People (drivers of toons, eaters of Cheetos, drinkers of Code Blue Cherry Super Mountain Pepper Turbo Edition) are lazy.  They do the least that they have to, and they like it that way.  It's part of that efficiency thing (dictionary, anyone?).  This issue here is game mechanics.  How hard is it to push the taunt button every six seconds?  How hard is it to push that same button, if not ever six seconds, then every six seconds while the mob is sticking its boot up someone's ass other than your own?  This is not a player skill thing, but nice way to minimize the problem.  Just because the bat being swung at your head hasn't hit yet doesn't mean it isn't coming.<br>

<br>
Pfff... now, play an enchanter : Would you prefer in your pickup groupe :<br>
A - A knight, where there is 95% chances (while playing as usual) than you will NOT a take one of those deadly double 500 or more in all your xp scession.<br>
B - A warrior, where there is 80% chances (while playing as usual) you WILL take a hit and maybe die if the warrior is not lucky with procs/taunt one time in all your xp scession.<br>
<br>
- If I was a chanter I will choose A. I prefer the PULL-SLOW-KILL chain to the PULL-WAIT-SLOW(prey to not aggro)-KILL chain. Even if The 2nd one work.<br>
<br>
- And I am a warrior and you know what ? when I am forming a group, I don't want another warrior. I take pally or Sk is the spot is risky, but never warrior. We dont have any utility. Knights have a magic card.You can put 2 pally in a group, they dont stack like you can stacks mages ou rogues, but they stack better than warriors. 2 warrior in the same xp group is a waste. You never ever grouped with another tank in your group ?<br>
<br>
I wil finish on this basic class analysis :<br>
- Paladin : Tanking 80% utility 20% (a pally can tank almost everything except some bosses. If you can't, go play your cleric and look at a mage pet who is never afraid do it)<br>
- Warrior : Tanking 100%.<br>
<br>
now, in PoP, a Tank who cant aggro fast at the start at the combat only worth 60 ? 70% of a tank who can do it ? <br>
So put warriors at 70 or 80 and pally at 80. Weeee, we are the specialists, and someone can do the same stuff we do with added utility.<br>
It is not class envy, I want only to tank, and I know many pally geared just like me (same equipement spots) who can tank EVERYTHING that does not require defensive. But you you know why you are not tanking in your guild ? because, if the raid leader say &quot;Tanks are now paladins&quot;, then all warriors of your guild will play alts, keeping their 65 toon autofollowing clerics with a /shield macro ready, and they will use it for boss tanking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hyardgune>Hyardgune</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/3/03 2:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1800.topic&index=187>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No, there isn't any aggro control problem.</span><hr size=1> Forget playing alts.

This isn't how things should be.  Our reward for building our characters up should not be to be so specialized that as a class, we are wanted for situations where you absolutely, positively must have /disc defensive. <p>Ghune<br>

So three is simply not true, or if it is true for some it is not true for all, and therefore is not fact.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'll tackle this one first:  <br>
<br>
I don't like calling people &quot;retarded&quot; for not having much desire to restrain themselves unnecessarily.   In other words, you are *indeed* correct that group aggro management can overcome relatively weak warrior taunt.   Were this *not* true, the game would be almost totally unplayable for the warrior.   <br>
<br>
The question then becomes &quot;Does the warrior bring enough to the group to compensate for the extra stuff that we have to do?&quot;  I think most of us have learned that while this used to be true, it's becoming less and less so.  Enough people are still ignorant enough that we're not destitute *yet* but early identification and addressing of issues is *always* better than learning later and addressing after people leave in frustration.   <br>
<br>
For instance, Paladins used to suck.  They used to suck REALLY REALLY bad.  People used to not want to group with Paladins.  The *primary* reason for this was because of the experience penalty that a group would suffer due to the presence of a paladin.  Since this experience penalty no longer exists, I would argue that any attempt by any Paladin to claim &quot;a return to Kunark&quot; doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.   Now, Verant addressed Paladins' concerns (Lack of offense, Lack of Defense, Experience Penalty, Lack of a mana pool, sucky spells).  The problem was that they waited WAY too long.   People who had enjoyed playing Paladins pre-Kunark up and quit... re-rolled new toons, so on and so forth.   <br>
<br>
At the time, warriors were concerned that buffing up Paladins to almost warrior-like abilities would negatively affect warriors, but many saw the need anyhow, because playing a class that sucks.... sucks.   We also had inherent advantages that would STILL remain inherent advantages.   Advantages such as the highest AC/HP armor (by a respectable margin), kick or slam,  dual wield, and critical hits...not to mention /disc defensive (which wasn't that big of a deal until Velious), we had cool disciplines though.   We were reasonably satisfied that we'd retain some melee advantage, and we did for some time, too much some would argue.<br>
<br>
Then came Luclin, which really was the beginning of the decline of the warrior class.   Unique warrior specific advantages disappeared with Spell Casting Fury and Combat Fury AA's, warriors' little &quot;eye candy&quot; appeal was gone, it turned from cool to laughable.  Everyone went from &quot;oohh ahh... look a 500 point crippling blow&quot; to &quot;DID YOU SEE WHAT THAT PALADIN DID?&quot;   and &quot;Wow, the caster did THAT?&quot;   or &quot;Man, Ranger A is a god&quot;.  Warriors kept plinking away though.<br>
<br>
Mid Velious balancing began to rid the offensive advantage of dual wielding, and luclin itemization widened this, finally PoP mob design destroyed dual wield as an &quot;advantage&quot; and has turned it into a disadvantage.   Now the proposed 'solution' of 'just get yourself some EB weapons' while it sounds nice and dandy, it doesn't address the real problem, but worse, it's MORE dangerous if the EB weapons you choose (4 out of 6 EB/TB weapons are 1 handed, one is from Rallos Zek, the other is from an event that no one in their right mind would want to do).   <br>
<br>
Kick and Slam were an advantage because it allowed us the &quot;extra attack&quot; that others didn't get, and the opportunity to interrupt spellcasting (with slam from level 1, with kick from level 55).   In order for Knights to have this 'extra attack', they had to use a 1h weapon and a shield.  With AA's this is no longer true.  While this is not a major thing, it's yet another area where the warrior &quot;advantage&quot; has evaporated.<br>
<br>
We've gone over the warrior &quot;AC/HP on armor advantage&quot; ad naseum ad infinitum, but it bears repeating.   Until the Elemental planes, the best equipment wearable by warriors is also wearable by knights.   Again, this is a change from where it once was, and in my view, an unnecessary one at that.<br>
<br>
Itemization:  Luclin was crap for warrior itemization and PoP seems to be following suit.   We had the famous debates of &quot;If warrior and paladin are wielding the same weapon, then the warrior will out DPS Paladins&quot;.   The counter debate being &quot;When does THAT really happen seeing that there's a Pal/SK weapon on almost every boss encounter which exceeds what we have available to us?&quot;<br>
<br>
What it has turned into now is that the 'differences' while they USED to be extreme, are miniscule.   While warriors WERE overbalanced in relation to Paladins, the reverse is now true.   Precisely what warriors feared and were assured was never going to happen... happenned.   Now what we're left with is &quot;If warriors can do X, there's no reason to have a knight&quot;.  This is pure mularky, the fearmongering of 'returning to Kunark' is precisely that, nothing but fearmongering.  The reason that we will NEVER &quot;return to Kunark&quot; is because there is no experience penalty.<br>
<br>
Now, the advantages of Solid Aggro lock without corresponding grave consequences are visible to anyone willing to open their eyes and see.<br>
<br>
I've discussed this issue with DPS types and they UNIVERSALLY agree that there is a DPS cap based on aggro which is smaller than the DPS cap based on mana, by a factor of about 40DPS.   3 DPS types in a group who can raise their DPS by about 40 each exceeds the damage brought ENTIRELY by the warrior, not just the damage difference based on skill levels (which is closer to 20ish *if* using identical weapons, which is still a rarity).  If you disagree, I'll be happy to start a thread on Graffe's to verify this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
for 4 the ending is hyperbole, &quot;Warrior aggro control makes that extremely risky.&quot; bullshit, I've never had a slower die on me because i couldn't taunt off of an initial slow (again no exageration). If you have because you couldn't get agro either you suck or your healer sucks, or the game really hates you. The slower could also have made a mistake as well, that being cani low, slow, get hit once, then low life agro kicks in, cleric doesn't heal in time and slower doesn't heal himself for whatever reason, etc. The rest of four falls apart with three. One root spell goes a long way.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, I don't think anyone's denying that there are acts that groups can perform which increase the likelihood of a warrior getting and maintaining aggro.   What we're all basically saying is that there's a serious imbalance in aggro generation (not maintenance) in relation to the corresponding difference in tankability between warrior and knight.<br>
<br>
Finally, I'd like to address an issue which a couple of people have brought up.   That being 'No one ever said we can't do some mob because we don't have a paladin'.   I'd like to know which mobs those were.  Generally speaking the only risky mobs I've seen that are 1-group targets are BoT minibosses.   Some groups prefer to have warriors doing them.   The fact though is that on at least 3 of them, a warrior is NOT the best tank for the job.   Certainly on Laef Windfall, he's definitely a 'warrior tank mob', because his damage is melee based, can be mitigated with defensive or evasive, but funny thing is that the reason he's a painful mob is because Slow works funny on him.   It actually LOSES effectiveness at various points throughout the fight.   He's unpredictable and unpredictability in mob melee damage is best handles by a warrior.<br>
<br>
Gaukr on the other hand, delivers his damage and &quot;spikyness' through a proc which warriors are not at any particular advantage over anyone else to avoid.   /disc defensive doesn't help at all with procs, so there's no real *need* to have a warrior tank even in a single group.   On the other hand, his damage is so extreme for a single group that you lose it and someone WILL die.   This is actually more beneficial for a paladin than a warrior.<br>
<br>
Oreen can easily be tanked by a Paladin and again, aggro control makes him the best choice.<br>
<br>
Hreidar is a puss who can ALSO be easily tanked by a paladin.   <br>
<br>
Now, these are mobs on a 6 hour respawn, as are most mini-named in PoP on long respawns.   Because *one* mob is best tanked by a warrior, because of spiky melee damage who is on a 6 hour respawn doesn't make warriors any more necessary in experience groups.    As a matter of fact, it's more like 'Dude, come tank Laef for me&quot; then &quot;see ya later&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arothtb>Aroth TB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/15/03 5:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1800.topic&index=189>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Great.
