<br>
Last night when we were killin Vindi, I was not the MT -- but got my arse handed to me anyway.  The MT was using a red/blue epic combo and I was using a 12/20 main hand and a frostbringer off hand.<br>
<br>
When Vindi was pulled, I stayed back a bit to avoid all chances of getting proximity agro.  I missed the assist call, so I was actually the very last melee to join in.  When I did join in, I was directly behind Vindi -- but far away.  I actually had to inch up until I could hit him, ensuring I was at max melee range.  Vindi moved a bit, which resulted in me being at around 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in relation to Vindi (6 o'clock being directly behind him).<br>
<br>
I then got a quad rampage it seems, which brought my health down a bit -- but not near where I would expect low health agro.  So I stay there, hoping I get a heal.  I then get another hit or two which brings me between 2 and 2.5 bubs of health, so I back out of the fight and turn off attack -- waiting to get a heal.  I got a few heals from my 2 box druid and another druid, which brought me to 80% health, so I went back into the battle.  Almost immediately I get rampaged again, which brings me to 2 bubs.  I try to back out, but get summoned.  I try to back out again, but Vindi turned and killed me before going back to the MT.<br>
<br>
At this point, no one else had been killed at all.  I'd imagine that the epic rogues, rangers, monks, etc... would be higher on the hate list, but they didn't get any agro.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming the summon near the end was from low health, but why didn't anyone else get low health agro?  Wouldn't they be getting hit with rampages as well?<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I was one disappointed mofo sittin in the nexus  :/ <p><Table Style='Filter: Alpha(Opacity=100, FinishOpacity=50, Style=3, StartX=85, FinishX=20, StartY=0, FinishY=0)'><B><Font Color=White Face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11741" target="magelo"><Font Color=White>Turom Toesmasher</Font></a><br>Warlord of <a href="http://www.ashenrage.com" target="ar"><Font Color=White>Ashen Rage</font></a><br>The Seventh Hammer<br></Font></B></Table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uxantartyelkaandas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xantar Tyelkaandas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/02 11:07:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1031.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rampage</span><hr size=1> Rampage has nothing to do with aggro lists....<br>
<br>
it can be very bizarre at times, too...<br>
<br>
Usually, the first person to engage (not tanking) will be on rampage.<br>
<br>
*BUT* I have seen it work different ways... ie, I crashed to desktop fighting Kelun recently. Another warrior was solidly on rampage before I crashed. When I came back, suddenly, I was on rampage for the rest of the fight. I have heard of similar things happening to other people, too.<br>
<br>
But then again, you said you were one of the last people to engage.<br>
<br>
It can be pretty puzzling sometimes. <p><center>

<br>
Setting Rampage: <br>
<br>
Every mob in EQ has an Aggro list, pretty much like a ranger or druid track list. On top of it is the one with highest aggro, the one the mob will pick and attack. <br>
<br>
A mob that rampages has another List, which we can call 'Rampage List'. It is basically a Copy of the Aggro list, when the mob does his first Rampage. <br>
<br>
AGGRO LIST: <br>
<br>
- Tank1 <br>
- Tank2 <br>
<br>
RAMPAGE LIST: <br>
<br>
- <br>
- <br>
(no one is on it because the mob didn't rampage a single time yet) <br>
<br>
Then we will send Tank1 and Tank2 in melee, and right at the moment the mob will rampage for the first time, the rampage list will be created. <br>
It should look like this if everyone pays attention and doesn't enter the aggro list (Bard AE song, random group buffs on Tank1 / Tank2, etc) <br>
<br>
AGGRO LIST: <br>
<br>
- Tank1 <br>
- Tank2 <br>
<br>
Rampage List: <br>
<br>
- Storaz <br>
- Teradok <br>
<br>
Once this is done, whatever you will do after, the two persons on top of rampage list will be Storaz and Teradok, untill the mob is blured again, or wipe the raid completely. <br>
<br>
Of course, as soon as we start fithing, more people will enter the mob aggro list (cleric first mostly when the first CH land), chanter Tashing, paladin curing or using lay hands. <br>
<br>
A common aggro list will look like this after 10 seconds of fight: <br>
<br>
AGGRO LIST: <br>
<br>
- Warrior <br>
- Cleric <br>
- Cleric <br>
- Cleric <br>
- Paladin / druid / shaman (backup heals at the start) <br>
- Other melees <br>
<br>
Each time the mob rampages again, he will add these new persons entering the aggro list, to his rampage list. <br>
<br>
In our exemple, versus Arch Lich, it would typically look like this: <br>
<br>
AGGRO LIST after <br>
10 seconds of fight <br>
with arch lich: <br>
<br>
- *Tank1* <br>
- Cleric1 <br>
- Cleric2 <br>
- Curse Remover1 <br>
- Curse Remover2 <br>
- Curse Remover3 <br>
- *Tank2* <br>
- Other melees <br>
who joined the <br>
fight and pressed <br>
auto-attack <br>
<br>
Rampage list: <br>
<br>
- *Tank1* <br>
- *Tank2* <br>
- Cleric1 <br>
- Cleric2 <br>
- Curse Remover1 <br>
- Curse Remover2 <br>
- Curse Remover3 <br>
- Other melees <br>
<br>
Contrary to the Aggro list, the order in rampage list is NOT modifiable, even if you zone, camp out, die, when you will come back in melee range and attack, you will be back at your spot in the rampage list, and be rampaged again if it's your turn. <br>
<br>
Rampage list is 2 Targets at the same time, getting a round of Attack each time the mob rampages. This means only the MT + 1 Warrior will be rampaged whole fight if we do well. And this is much better than before, cause we were thinking rampage was MT + 2 warriors , and it was monopolizing all clerics. Now it will only take 2 clerics to heal rampage actually. <br>
<br>
<br>
- FAQ: <br>
Q: What happens if Tank2 dies, or gets out of melee range? <br>
A: The mob will pick the next person on his rampage list (Cleric1 in this exemple) <br>
<br>
Q: I am on rampage but not supposed to be, what do I do? <br>
A: Run out of the mob's melee range <br>
<br>
Q: But I am a cleric and I will be out of range for CH if I do that. <br>
A: Run out of range anyway and ask someone to replace you asap. You will die if you don't run out of range. You will still be able to do long range heals, heal other people running to camp for a heal, etc <br>
<br>
Q: Would it be possible to send in 3 or 4 warriors for the first rampage proc so a cleric isnt rampaged if one warr dies ? <br>
A: Yes certainly, let's say you want Tank1, Tank2, Tank3, Tank4, Tank5 on rampage list, in this order. All you have to do is have them all shoot arrows before the first rampage. Make Tank1 shoot 100 arrows, Tank2 50, Tank3 25 , Tank4 10, Tank5 1 arrow. And you will have an aggro list in this order once the first rampage happens, and the rampage list will be the same order. <br>
<br>
Q: Or would that make the mob rampage more than just 2 ppl ? <br>
A: No, it would still be Two targets max. <br>
<br>
Will add more to the FAQ if anyone has more questions. <br>
Hope it helps, that way we will be quicker at setting rampage if everyone is careful with aggro. <br>

<br>
In your case the only thing I can think happened is you proc'd a lot at the start and were number 2 on the hate list as Vindi did his first rampage - thus getting number two position on the rampage list. Vindi doesn't rampage often so it's possible even though you were last to attack it was a good few seconds into the fight (after you had joined it to) that he did his first rampage.<br>
<br>
Not sure if you had a rampage tank plan for Vindi - but you should. We play extra-safe and have a dedicated cleric for rampage on Vindi (tougher mobs need more) and also have the rampage tank go defensive. If the rampage tank loses more than 1.5 bubbles of health then the cleric should start a CH. Usually Vindi rampages so little (especially once crippled etc) that the CH will land when the rampage tank is still well over 50% health - sometimes though he does a triple rampage and unless the rampage tank was full health or a CH was in-bound already that will get him so low health he will get low-health aggro and die - then a CH rotation cleric will likely be on rampage.<br>
<br>
In your case for sure it was low heatlh aggro that got you summoned. In future you shouldn't really move if you go below 2 bubbles - just hope for a heal or take the death. If Vindi had summoned a few seconds earlier (unlikely as most corner-wedge him so he doesn't need to summon MT) he would have had to run to you as a mob can't chain summon - meaning you'd have pulled him out of position and been on everyone elses hate list <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uturomtoesmasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Turom Toesmasher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 313<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/15/02 4:33:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1031.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.gaiahealing.com/everquest/turom_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rampage</span><hr size=1> Actually there is something that I left out of my orginal post, which I didn't think was pertinent then, but now thing it is.<br>
<br>
This wasn't our first attempt -- I was the MT on the previous Vindi attemp and completely fuxored it up. :/  I wasn't ready, so I didn't have my finger ready on the defensive key, then when I saw Vindi, I engaged him -- paniced and hit the wrong freakin key.  So I never got defensive off.... and well, an Unslowed Vindi -vs- a non-defensive war with 5500 buffed HPs doesn't last very long. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'm thinking that perhaps the rampage list stays with the mob until he's killed.  On another Vindi killing some time previously, I was not MT, but was on the rampage list.  I got killed and was clicked back in -- as soon as I was rezzed, I got rampaged and killed.  I've seen this happen to people on a Dain slaying as well, they'd die and get clicked back in just to go splat on a rampage. <p><Table Style='Filter: Alpha(Opacity=100, FinishOpacity=50, Style=3, StartX=85, FinishX=20, StartY=0, FinishY=0)'><B><Font Color=White Face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11741" target="magelo"><Font Color=White>Turom Toesmasher</Font></a><br>Warlord of <a href="http://www.ashenrage.com" target="ar"><Font Color=White>Ashen Rage</font></a><br>The Seventh Hammer<br></Font></B></Table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukinadafz60.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kinadafz60</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/16/02 2:34:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1031.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rampage</span><hr size=1> So the question is if they obtain a new rampage person after one dies.

On the Vindi example I would have thought the rampage list would have cleared by the time you re-engaged. We managed to wipe on Vindi recently and it was about 20-25 minutes before we re-engaged, rampage had reset by then.<br>
