<br>
healers are a bit harder than int casters since they can nuke/dot and heal up...thus allowing them to sustain their dammage longer and tip the scale of the fight.  here's my full list as a warrior from hardest to easiest:<br>
<br>
1. bard.  as a warrior, nothing i can really do to prevent them from kiting me around, dispelling me, debuffing me, dotting me etc.  pretty much impossible to beat a 65 bard.<br>
<br>
2. SK.  like fighting another warrior plus they can automatically take away half your HP in one shot as well as dot, use a pet and lifetap a good chunk of their HP back.  possible, but highly unlikely.  it usually comes down to whether they have their HT up and if they're smart about using spells.<br>
<br>
3. paladins.  sort of like SK...it's like fighting another warrior...but with 3x as much HP as one would have.  still highly unlikely to beat a 65 pally of equal gear...but if they're not as good of a jouster, you at leats have a chance if you're skilled since they're pretty much 100% defensive when it comes to spells where as a SK is 100% offensive.  a couple well timed kicks and good jousts can make it a close fight...but in the end, it's still warrior vs warrior with 3x hp.<br>
<br>
4.  rangers.  were impossible before they fixed snare resists again recently.  no more snare kiting if you have good MR.  make sure you have a fast horse and you can usually stay inside their bow range.  they generally stick to dual wielding in duels, so jousting owns them.  i'm at around 50/50 success rate against 65 rangers with am/eq.  key words are stay in close.<br>
<br>
5. shaman.  have decent hp/ac for a caster and have really effecient and fast cast heals.  it's usually a toss up of whether they debuff you and get in a lucky slow.  they seem to be able to channel through a lot more dammage than all other casters i fight.  their pets are annoying too, especially if you don't have the anti-stun aa.  most of their dots are reasonably resistable if you're prepared.  just pray slow doesn't land.<br>
<br>
6. wizard.  POP lures hurt.  MB hurts.  but if you're at ~9k hp, a wizard that tries to MB you has just lost the fight.  getting through their epics is annoying...but once you start pounding are their tender inner flesh, they tend to run around like school children.  they have super low HP, and a few good joust rounds can end their day quickly.  sure, they can insta-gate.  but that's a win for me IMO if i make someone run away.  well timed kicks &gt; wizard nukes.  a few interupts = game over.<br>
<br>
7. enchanters.  i'm not sure where to put enchanters.  they're extremely powerful in once instance and yet completely worthless in another.  i also think their stuns have recently been nerfed in pvp, because they haven't been using them lately.  so ya, they can mez you with 100% dependability...but then what?  their pets are pathetic and don't hit you while mezzed....and they don't have the mana to take down a well equiped warrior with nukes or dots (almost all of which are MR? i think).  they're AMAZING in team pvp...but in 1 vs 1...i don't know where to place them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8.  necro/mage.  not too hard, and pretty similar.  they send in pet, and expect to nuke/dot you while you deal with it.  i don't deal with it and focus strictly on them.  if pet is too big a bother, snare glands are great for using on their pets to keep them distanced so you don't have to worry about them much.  they have crap for HP/AC and a few rounds of good jousting will send them running when they get smacked for 300+.<br>
<br>
9.  druids.  used to be really hard like rangers before they fixed snare resists.  now snare never lands (at 300 mr).  their hp is low, so every couple rounds they will have to stop focusing on dotting/nuking (their nukes are pretty easily resistable as well), and heal themselves.  they often go for their longer casttime heals, which allows for up to 2 kicks to stun them as well as a few more rounds of melee to make them run away.<br>
<br>
10.  warrior.  it's really all about jousting skill here as well as gear.  i find fighting other warriors pretty boring, since there isn't much strategy and it's more about math than pvp on who wins, unless one person is a lot better than the other at jousting.<br>
<br>
11.  monks.  generally speaking, they're usually not a problem unless they have a really nice POP 2 hander and elemental armor.  but jousting takes away a lot of their DPS and evens things out (dammage wise)...thus making a warrior's greater HP and AC the deciding factor here.<br>
<br>
12.  rogues.  occassionally, you'll come across a rogue who is just amazing at circle straffing.  the other 98% of the time tho, they go down like paper.  jousting owns rogues with their low hp, and if you have high ac, most of their backstabs are gonna be for minimum dammage...which is still less than my average 2 hand weapon hit.  a lucky poison can change things a little, but rarely have i come across rogues who use them...and i almost always resist them anyhow.<br>
<br>
13. clerics.  most boring fight ever.  there's nothing they can do to you besides melee if you have good MR.  none of their nukes land, and even tho they have nice melee and proc weps, jousting still beats the crap out of them...especially since most clerics don't know how to joust and just leave attack on the whole time.  disarming clerics is always fun too when the whole rest of the fight their flustered that they're only hitting for 1.  it's really an endurance race of who has to go pee first.  you melee them down, and then they heal back up.  can last forever with their super fast and effecient heals...and the fact that the clerics usually have the best FT of any other classes you'll come across.<br>
<br>
<br>
i don't really have any experience fighting beastlords, so i can't rate them.  and by the way, this is strictly my opinion from my own experiences against all above stated classes.  =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dobbanz>dobbanz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 435<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/21/03 9:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1948.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What is the best class for PVP?</span><hr size=1> Put beastlords up there with mages and necros since they have a strong pet and add on alot of hp since they are a melee/caster hybrid.
