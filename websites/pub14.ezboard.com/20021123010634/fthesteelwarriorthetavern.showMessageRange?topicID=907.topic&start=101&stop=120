mobs for 6k,it's more than eye candy, it's damage power.<br>
<br>
Aye, SU3 rocks, especially with the large number of undead boss mobs in Luclin.  In SoV, it's 100% useless.  The question will be how much of PoP will be undead?  How much of the old world is?  RoK has 3 zones with some nice undead, but 0 boss mobs that are.  It's great for xp, solo.  It's great for Luclin boss mobs.  But that's it.  I'd rather have an ability that ups my damage 10% vs everything.  I'd much rather have the equiv of ambidexterity for 2h weapons.  It annoys me greatly with my paladin that my greatest weakness, damage dealing, is something my AA only helps with against 1 type of mob, while classes that already significantly outdamage me get a nice boost vs anything.  Then there's flurry as well, a further bit of damage increase for warriors vs everything.  General stuff is good.  Slower xp with them, since you can't choose to maximize the xp gained, but the freedom to go beat up anything you want on a given day.  <br>
<br>
Ask yourself seriously which you'd rather want: 10% vs all or 20% vs undead?<br>
<br>
I do hope they fix some stuff in PoP.  It sounds like they'll need to address the hp vs mitigation issue.  With monks getting high AC/HP stuff, warriors (and paladins/sks) need to catch up to the monks in mitigation.  Warrior damage is fine, as long as boss mobs have reasonable AC.  But taunt/aggro needs work.  An AA skill that works the reverse of the casters aggro reduction would would be awesome.  It would still mean paladins/sks taunt better, on demand, but warrior aggro will increase a lot.  The impact of 5-10% can be seen quite easily with the enchanter aggro mods.  1 class only gear is something Verant is trying to get away from.  But something that gives warriors a bigger benefit from pure hp things (+hp spells like aego, symbol, brell's, and focus and +hp on gear) would be nice, to distance the warriors and non-warriors a bit more.  These things are static to all classes right now, meaning that the better these get, the less, percentagewise, the gap between warriors and others.  A 10% bonus there and you tack on another 400+ hp to warriors.  <br>
<br>
As always though, balance is such a fine line.  If things were perfectly balanced, uber-guilds would have an equal mix of all classes.  But they aren't and they never have been.  There will always be some that rock, some that are in the middle, and some that suck.  There will be some that are &quot;needed&quot; in numbers (in quotes because 1 class is needed in numbers, others are wanted in numbers), some that suffer a very steep loss of effectiveness for each additional one added.  It's a tough thing to balance, especially with all the things that factor in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uparvvardt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Parv Vardt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 157<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/8/02 8:59:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Blah!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For example warriors have 100 mitigation (hypothetical number)<br>

<br>
Right.  And 80% of 110 is 88, so with this 10% upgrade, you're still 80% a warrior in mitigation.  With the added 2%, all you're doing is creating a static gap in mitigation, the effects of which are amplified with increases to either class.  I fail to see how such simple math evades people.  That, or VI can't explain properly what they want.<br>
<br>
The warrior class is being heavily marginalized with nothing being offered in return.  We're being defined primarily by our gear, and unless you have top quality gear you're not going to have any significant gains over other melee classes.  Skill at managing agro will only get you so far, and then it's up to having a shitload of good gear to carry you the rest of the way. <p><FONT FACE="verdana, arial" size="-2"><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66788">Parv Vardt</A> [<A HREF="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/">Legacy of Steel</A>]<BR>

Paladins get Slay Undead instead of &quot;bracketed melee boost&quot; because it makes RP sense.  You are HOLY KNIGHTS, the bane of the undead.  Saying that :<br>

Is like saying &quot;Ya, I can only use this half the time i raid, and then all the time I xp, but it really sucks&quot;.  Seriously, how many paladins with SU3 are screwing around in kunark? How many are spending any more time on velious than their ToV cycle and AoW?  You can XP in multiple zone with it, to great benefit.  It is of marginal use on boss mob encounters that a paladin would be participating in when he was at that level.  To me, it seems like a fine skill, and downplaying it because it only works on undead is bullshit.  Howling stones, Karnors basement, some seb, the grey, and probably a few others i'm too tired to think of right now are all blue at 60, and as such, are viable XP grinding spots.  What is the warrior equivilent of this?  Flurry? Heh.<br>
<br>
And lets be realistic, warriors aren't really bitching about their damage output compared to yours, we just want to TANK better than you, and better than everyone else, like it should be.  I think it's great that pallies get slay undead.  Very in character.  I just don't think that overall, the melees are balanced anymore, this time in the opposite direction.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaxterixenobelix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Axterix EnObelix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 3:15:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Blah!</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;To me, it seems like a fine skill, and downplaying it because it only works on undead is bullshit.

I've never said it wasn't a fine skill.  But people here are trying to make it out to be the second coming.  It isn't, it's got serious drawbacks that overall make it less useful than a 10% increase in damage vs anything.  Sure, you can do all those zones.  But it's all undead.  And those zones are pretty much solo/duo.  It gets old.  Fast.  But you'll primarily use those zones anyway (even before you have SU), simply because paladin damage sucks vs non-undead.  I'm not denying it's a great ability.  It is.  It gives a paladin with mass AA the ability to make xp needed to get other AA.  Of course, for the cost of SU3, he could have gotten the other useful AA stuff<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Huge investment to get SU3, after all.  Cost of things doesn't really matter though.  What matters is what you can do with everything in the end.  Higher cost can always be compensated for with more time.  Right now, with the large number of Luclin high end mobs being undead, it's sweet, if your guild does those mobs.  But if your guild doesn't, then it's not nearly that great.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as I said already, I'm not denying it's a good ability.  But ambidexterity is as good/better.  Right now, I see a bunch of people saying &quot;look, the grass is greener over there&quot;.   It isn't, it's the same shade of green.  Got to look at the complete picture, not just little snippets.<br>

It has been very frustrating to watch warriors be continually overlooked as other classes leap forward in power. <br>

Considering that Verant has not done anything to fix outrageously messed up situations like widespread manaburning of 32k-100k dragons, I have very little faith that they will do anything about the issues we have raised.<br>

1)Improve the effectiveness of warrior's &quot;taunt&quot; button.<br>

Either give warriors an innate % modifier when it comes to taunt (this would help warriors of all levels) or increase the cap for warriors (this would help the higher level warriors).<br>
<br>
2)Give warriors a seperate damage mitigation table.<br>
<br>
Either give warriors their own improved mitigation table (would help warriors of all levels) or give AA class skill that works similar to defensive (Defensive 1,2,3 = 10%,20%,30% direct decrease in damage taken).<br>

All hybrids I know of see themselves as being a % warrior, not &quot;x amount less&quot; than a warrior.  The example you gave shows a paladin being 88% of a warrior.  By giving them another bonus on their hp, you're now making them closer to 90% a warrior.  As I explained above, the effects of having a static gap rather than a percentage gap are amplified as the skills increase.<br>
<br>
When does it stop?  When warriors have 9k hp, and paladins have 8500, making them 95% as effective as a warrior?  There will come a point with a static gap where the difference between a warrior and a hybrid in even numerated stats such as hp will be rendered null. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ulorddaeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lorddaeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 11:43:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=118>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  work in progress, same topic, revised my old post.</span><hr size=1> ack, it trippled, i promis i only clicked once<br>

<br>
letter follows:<br>
I know this is long. but i've seen where general complaints with no background/arguments to show the position get ignored. so for each of the points below i tried to show how i got to that point.  I thank you now for reading this.<br>
<br>
there is a thread right now on steel warriors that i initially just dismissed outright. but after reading some of the points offered up, i started to realize that what they are saying has alot of merit.<br>
<br>
the thread is basically that by using Warriors as the &quot;yardstick&quot; for melee, by raising other classes, and leaving warriors mostly alone, the developers have &quot;reverse nerfed&quot; warriors.<br>
<br>
let's talk a bit first about &quot;the concepts&quot; of the classes. Warriors are the masters of armed combat in all its many forms. They are right at home on the battlefield and are trained to take as much punishment as they dole out, because of their innately strong constitutions. <br>
<br>
A paladin is the very embodiment of a holy knight, fighting for the cause of good in every aspect of his or her life. As the paladin gains life experience and proves his devotion, he will be granted the ability to use limited clerical magics. They share some of the powers of clerics along with a good deal of the fighting ability of warriors, but have a few virtues all their own. <br>
<br>
Shadowknights are exactly what their name implies - beings with the power of knights who live and work in the shadows. The antithesis of the paladin, shadowknights derive all of their powers from the evil gods they serve. Their abilities are a blend of warrior-like skills and necromantic studies.  (taken from <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp).">eqlive.station.sony.com/l...sses.jsp).</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
to condense those very verbose paragraphs, Palladins and Shadowknights have forsaken some martial ability to develop the use of spells, where warriors are only interested in martial ability. This basic concept was refelcted by different factors in the game, Armor available, melee tables, and skills. before all this AA mumbo jumbo, and this supposed &quot;class balancing&quot;. warriors fit this description. we stand there and get hit, and deliver hits, we hit taunt to give us that extra bit of aggro to keep the mob standing in front of us. we did not deliver as much damage as a monk or as a rogue because, while they are pure melee classes as well, they are tweaked/pointed into more of an offensive melee rather then the warriors defensive one. Pallies/SK's were classes that traded some of that offensive power and tanking ability to develop the arcane/diving magics. This gave them some utility and versatility. They were no where near the equal of a Warrior in straight combat, they would have to use those spells to compensate for this.<br>
<br>
Paladins and Shadow Knights have been improved in thier ability to take hits and hold aggro while doing so. this is the sole thing that a warrior offers to a group. pally's and SK's can now be just as effective in this role, but also bring thier spells and versatility to the group. Since the game has been launched many changes have come about that have led to the diminishing effectiveness and desireability of a warrior in grind groups and in lesser raids. Let me explain why, starting with defense. <br>
<br>
Warriors are defined from each other (kunark era) ONLY by thier gear. in the days of kunark and earlier this was reflected in the game by the Warr only gear having that extra 10-15% AC compared to the pally/sk items. here are the kunark BPs for example (12.5% better AC with kunark armors)<br>
<br>
War=Cobalt Breastplate +45 AC +12 Str +12 Sta +12 Dex +50 HP +20.00 Wt <br>
SK=Blood Ember Breastplate +40 AC +12 Str +8 Sta +8 Agi +8 Dex +10.00 Wt <br>
Pal=Deepwater Breastplate +40 AC +10 Str +10 Agi +10 Wis +50 Mana +10.00 Wt <br>
<br>
don't forget that this was when you were lucky to have a 1200 AC, much less talking about AC softcaps.<br>
<br>
Today, assuming that you do have all your AA filled in, you once again find that the only thing that defines a tank is his gear. (no, i doubt such a mythic warrior exists at this time, but if wer'e talking balance let's take it to the extreme as that's where the differences will be best seen). the same 10 BP's show up under each under a search on allakhazam's site. (using ACx10, hpx1) for pally, sk and warrior. so this means that pallies, SK's and Warriors can now all have the same AC. <br>
<br>
Great Shadow Platemail <br>
Heavy Yttrium Chestplate<br>
Breastplate of the Void <br>
Breastplate of Speed <br>
Breastplate of Eradication <br>
Chestplate of Fiery Might <br>
True Mithril Breastplate <br>
Breastplate of Superiority <br>
Jenniy's Two-tone Cuirass <br>
Warmaster's Ribcage <br>
<br>
and with the exception of the velious class quested armors, much of the next 10 are the same as well.<br>
<br>
so basically, in the armor category, pallies and SK's are now the same as warriors. this removes the advantage that warriors had in the AC and related HP areas over SK's and pallies.<br>
<br>
then came luclin, with it's AA points. all melee classes got Natural Durability, Combat Stability, Combat Agility. everyone was fine with that. Hybrids also get another AA advancement called Physical Enhancement. This skill add's an additional 2% to each of those 3 prior skills.  This is where the problem starts. now, it was explained that if warriors are considered to be at 100% of &quot;yardstick&quot; and pallies/sk's are considered to be at 75%, then a 10% boost to both yields 110% and 82.5%. this still leaves that 25% lead that warriors are supposed to get, but then with physical enhancement they get an additional 2%. this makes them at 84%. this makes them now 76.3% (84/110=76.3%)as effective again tanks this is a relative 1.3% gain.  according to the smart people out there that like to fiddle with it, a warrior with 255 stam has 3335 base hp before items. a pally has 2891 with 255 stam.  this means that pally/sk have 86% as many hp, before item adds. now with the 10% bonus that warr's get, that's 3668 hp from ND 3, and pally/sk get 3237 with thier 12%, now they are at 88% of a warrior. <br>
<br>
now, the real kicker is, since pallies and SK's wear the same armor that means they get the same HP bonuses that were reserved for warriors. now, say that both the warrior and the pally have +500hp in items, and it's been shown that the AA skills also affect these bonus's so now we have 4218 (1.10*(3335+500)), and 3797 (1.12*(2891+500)), now the pally is at 90% as many hp, because a straigh addition is a larger percent addition if the base it is being added to is smaller (100 added to 100 is a 50% increse, 100 added to 200 is a 33% increase, law of diminishing returns). While HP buffs (aegolism, talismans, etc) do not get the multiplier by adding straigh HP to a character. The relative benefit's are greater on the one with the smaller starting pool.<br>
<br>
the explanation for this extra 2% gain was posted on <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000583.html.">boards.station.sony.com/u...0583.html.</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> The major flaw in this posting is that while a warrior goes from 100 to 110, and a hybrid goes from 75 to 82.5 the hybrid is still 75% of a warrior, even though the warrior gains 10 points, and the hybrid gains 7.5. they are still proportionally the same. but now, with that extra 2 percent they are now 77% of a warrior. they get an extra boost. this extra boost is enlarged with +hp items. and if you go by straight HP, they are not 75%, they are 86% by base hp. and that gap is shortened with any +hp item. and while HP buffs (aegolism, talismans, etc) do not get the multiplier by adding straigh HP to a character, but the relative benefit's are greater on the one with the smaller starting pool.<br>
<br>
So, when you have a Warrior and a Pally/SK standing next to each other. with the same gear on, with ND3, CA3, CS3, and PE for the hybrid, Aegolism (1100 hp), Focus of Spirit (405 hp)and +1000 hp from items, you get the warrior having 6273 hp, and the pally/SK having 5862 hp, now the pally/sk is at 93% of HP, where they were at 86% standing nekked.<br>
<br>
also, it has been shown and confirmed that there is an AC softcap around 1250. combat stability/agility push this softcap to 1375 for warriors, and 1400 for hybrids. so now, while we have 6% more hp, they have 2% better AC then us, you know, the guys that eschewed all other skills other then the ability to fight.<br>
<br>
now onto offense. no matter what weapon your wielding, its what offensive category/bracket your in that defines just how much you can do offensivly. and from the oct 8 2001 patch, we get the biggest of the &quot;balancing changes&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Paladins and Shadowknights, besides the benefits they gain from the two-handed weapons change mentioned above, have also been moved to the same combat tables as warriors. In the future we intend to examine the existing one-handed weapons useable by knights for possible upgrades. We are also increasing the Taunt skill cap for these two classes to 220.&quot;<br>
<br>
basically, we went from &quot;Masters of combat&quot; to being the same as the pallies and SK's. you know, those guys who gave up some offensive power to cast spells.<br>
<br>
now let's talk about other upgrades the pallies and SK's got. from <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000135.html">boards.station.sony.com/u...00135.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> we get &quot;Recently we removed the mana pool difference and significantly reduced the casting cost difference. We also gave the hybrid the advantage of unique spells and a significantly reduced penalty for casting while fighting (weapon delays continue to count off while spells are being cast – only for hybirds). In combination, all of those changes make for a very nice balance of spell casting power and melee power for the hybrids.&quot;<br>
<br>
okie, so now, they get to cast more spells, and their weapon delay is not reset when they cast a spell. cool for them. but now that they have this increase, their damage abilities have gotten a significant boost. <br>
<br>
so now thier DPS is even to, or greater than that of warriors. (in the thread this letter comes from, some people have posted actual combat parsed data showing this from a reliable high end guild {page23 of the post} <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=907.topic&start=441&stop=460).">pub14.ezboard.com/ftheste...stop=460).</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
so, when we gave up the ability to cast spells, or backstab, or deal out damage with special kicks to be the &quot;masters of combat&quot; in the earliest of &quot;game concepts&quot;, pallies/sk's sacraficed this martial ability by learning spells, and it made sense. now they get everything a tank does, AND get thier spells too.<br>
<br>
to counter this, you say in the melee balance post &quot;The &quot;Defensive&quot; discipline is also somewhat overpowered, but many high-end encounters now factor in this discipline in their design so this also remains unchanged.&quot;<br>
<br>
so now our defensive discipline has been &quot;factored in&quot; to encounters and as many high end warriors say that defensive is a crutch. we trade our offensive ability in DPS to take half the DI of the mobs damage (currently the used terms on the boards are mob damage is DI*(randon number between 1 and 20)+DB, where DI is damage increment, and DB is Damage bonus). but to keep aggro, what many are doing is upping the speed of cleric rotations so that the tank can maintain the taunt generated by his damage output. <br>
<br>
so, using this tactic, warriors are no different then paladins and SK now in melee ability. throw in the added aggro that can be generated by the spells they cast and paladins and Shadowknights become the optimal choice for playing the Main Tank role. as this realization sinks in, a few guilds are using these two classes as main tanks for high end encounters.<br>
<br>
now to summarize. through the new armor, new weapons, class balancing, and caster balancing the Role of the warrior according to &quot;the vision&quot; has been effectivly elimiated by blurring the class distinctions.<br>
<br>
now, because i don't want to just seem like complaining. here are a few of the more credible suggestions introduced on the same thread. all of these are for warrior only, as giving them to anyone else would make the alteration useless in the way of balancing the warrior class back against the rest of the field<br>
<br>
1) the most popular suggestion is to have warriors on thier own melee table. where monks are on a table that increases thier offense. put the warriors on one that increases ther defensive abilities. even a 10% reduction of the DI of mobs would see a noticeable effect on our ability to take hits during combat, and not be too overpowering, and it would affect warriors of all levels. <br>
2) allow warriors taunt to affect mobs of any level when they are level 60. allow taunt to have a direct addition to the hate list equal to thier skill, not a chance of working. similar to Eraging Blow weapons.<br>
3) raise the base AC softcap by 100-200 points. this would be similar to number 1, but would mainly affect warriors that are in end game style armors.<br>
<br>
warriors are quickly loosing their Role and desireablility at all levels of play. we have been replaces by sk's and pallies in all but 1% of end mobs. this is what we are asking verant to take a look at if they ever read this letter<br>
<br>
or did i miss something? and thanks for reading it all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
have a nice day. <p><img src="http://www.xmission.com/~pitchers/klaumbaz.gif"><br>
