First he gave me a ton of nice equipment and buffed me (449 hit points at level 1, buffed!). Then he damage shielded me and would pull a mob with snare. With a 12 point damage shield red mobs dropped like flies, and he didn't need to heal that much so he was always FM. The problem is, my offense, 1HS, Taunt, are all maxed, but my defense and kick are down around 15. What can I do to raise these? Should I just go find a low blue and let it beat on my without dmg shield and without attacking it, just getting heals from the druid? That could take a while methinks =)<br>
<br>
I now regret being powerleveled, but I want to raise these skills ASAP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uxzzy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xzzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/26/01 9:25:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Powerleveling isn't so sweet</span><hr size=1> You can still PL if you want, just don't use a damage shield anymore.<br>

Either way, there's no easy way to do it. To raise skills you've neglected, you gotta use them as much as possible. If defense is low, find someplace where you'll get hit a lot and go there. ;) <p>Xzzy, from the Bristlebane server.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uklaive.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Klaive</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/27/01 12:02:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Powerleveling isn't so sweet</span><hr size=1> I had a similar problem when I made my first Dwarven warrior and gave him a pack of bones and he shot straight to level 7 without touching a mob.  I tried a blue and it wasted me so I ran about for literaly 2 hours non-stop in the newbie area beating the crap out of stuff and the highest I got offense and defense was 9.  I eventually had to just restart him over and it turned out for the better anyway. <br>
<br>
PLing is the devil.  Ya I know wurm is the devil too but what if you PLed using a wurm?  Can we say the anti-christ?<br>
<br>
And whats worse than having low skills is not knowing how your class is played.  Warriors IMO have the second most involved job in a regular non-raid type party after the enchanter.  You gotta pull(at least I always end up doing it) and keep the right mobs on the right people, reads: NEVER SHALL THE CLERIC BE HARMED.<br>
<br>
PLing is a nice way to get past the boredom of the lower levels but is a bad way to create a long lasting character.<br>

At least you figured out early that you're hozed, at lvl 10 you can still recover (fairly) easily. Try going to the small orc camp in EC and agroing the whole mess, with that druid healing you (WITHOUT the thorns) as his pennance...just stand there and get beat on until you're 40-50 defense and whatever other defensive skills you can learn. If you can, find a shaman to hit you with a STA, DEX and AGI buff (I say DEX &amp; AGI because VI never really stated that AGI affects skill improvement but I suspect...) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukraiven12.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kraiven12</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/28/01 7:21:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Powerleveling isn't so sweet</span><hr size=1> You guys simply don't know how to PL.  Of course if you do it that way it will suck.  For levels 1-10, do not use the thorn shield.  Simply the buffs.  I PL'd myself using a 51 druid.  Current Level: 41.  Days played: 2 days 5 hours.  1hs, 1hb, parry, riposte, dodge, kick, taunt, all maxed for level.  Even my swimming is at 186.  You have to know how to do it properly.  If you apply thorns at level 1 you'll have a level 15 in no time but he'll have the skills of a level 2.  Don't apply the thorns until around level 10 or so.  From then on, with the 24 point damage shield, I was consistantly taking 2-3 low reds AT THE SAME TIME and the defensive skills went up just fine.

For some reason I tink yer lying.<br>
At 50 i never power leveled a day in my life.  My swim is 183 and I routinely swim from the zone in point in Iceclad to the bridge to EW, and from where the raft outta oasis pops in TD to swim to the elven out post ands catch the boat to FV. At 20 I dropped off a boat in TD on the way to kunark, swarm around for 4 EQ days.<br>
First of all, swimming is a time related skill to raise.  You hit 41 in 2days and some hours.  Unless you fought in the water the entire time theres no way to get yer swim that high.<br>
All yer weapons skills are maxed at 41?  No way.  To have reached 41 in that time the mobs would have to of been dying so fast you could not have possible hit them enough to have raised yer skills.  <br>
Further more, exactly what was the purpose of Pleveling to 41 in 2 days?  Exactly how many friends do you have that know ya?  Or are ya already established in a guild that likes ta see powerleveling?  Part of the game is the reputation you build as you move thru the ranks. Utterly impossible when power leveling on this scale.  <br>
2 days is not enough time to have learned yer defensive skills, no way in hell, you do realize that to reach level 41 you need a total of 74,880,000 points of experience?  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/sstair/">www.geocities.com/sstair/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> Not to mention the time it would take you to find suitable places to PL between the times when an area would green out.  Come to think of it, why don't you tells us where you hunted to achieve this?<br>
Or why?<br>
Is there a point to power leveling? To each his own I guess.<br>
I do know I am regularly invited to Seb and Velks and Karnors and CHardok and some planar raids, icewell AND kael thats right I bounce back and forth enough between dorfs and giants to keep ally faction with dorfs, by friends I've had for all 50 levels I've been playing. I'm not even relying on my guild to do raids in these areas, nor am I piggy backing on a friend.  <br>
Mind if I ask a question?<br>
<br>
Why do we play the game?  For what reasons do all of you play?<br>

I'd say it's possible. My warrior is a secondary of mine, with almost no powerlevelling except for levels 1-10.. just to nudge her out of being a newbie.<br>
<br>
Past that it's been hunting in areas with good XP bonuses with good groupmates. At level 41 she was around 6 days played, and had all skills maxed except 2hs.. which was at 189. Of course her swim is only at 125 or so, but then, I never put effort into practicing. :)<br>

Where do you gain that kinda swim skill?  I assure you crossing rivers wont do it.  Most of the people I know have swim under 100 untill after the first Kedge Keep raid.<br>
Swim that high in 2days five hours? I doubt it.  You be killing mobs so fast when would you be swimming?<br>
Keep in mind there is an EXP cap on red to level mobs. After a certain point depending on mob levelvs. player level there is only so much exp you can get.  Also mobs give exp of various levels in different amounts.  Dungeon mobs more than out door mobs of the same level but also in outdoor mobs.  2 mobs of exactly the same level can give different amounts of exp gain.<br>
<br>
As fer 41 in 6 days..I suppose, did you ever do anything other than fight?<br>

i agree 100% , bear, reputation is everything.  buuuuuut...<br>

newbie levels are usueless.  a lot of the people you run into between lvl 1 and lvl 20, well, by a lot i mean 99.9%, are idiots who you dont need to build your &quot;faction&quot; with.  the melees who dont have any range weapons for pulling... the clerics who want to melee... the druids who want to nuke... the rnagers who dont know what hamony is... etc.  these people are going to be left behind anyway, by anyone of an intelligence above that of a chimp.<br>

Personally, I'd like to see competence and skill, well rounded understand of how and what yer class can do.  One of the best damn guilds I ever saw, had a few restrictions, You had to have yer Seb Key, yer CS Key yer HS key and at least 85 days played.  Best damn guild I ever saw bar none.<br>
When ye powerlevel even if you do manage to max yer skills etc, you still will be woefully under educated.  Meaning yer knowledge of zones, of mobs of this technique or that.  Of late I've had more warriors ask me mundane question that they should have known 20 levels ago.  Do the game, powerlevel all you want, when it comes to basic game lore/knowledge of Zones/Mobs, tactics etc yer gonna be woefully behind.  To illusrate I know a level 40 warrior who has no clue about what a MA or a SA does, how to use assit correctly or when to let some one with brains pull.  Never taunts before breaking a mez, cannot understand mana restrictions, how to use taunt effectivly. Heres a 40 war with decently leveled skills with mush fer brains.  Routinely gets entire groups slaughtered, guess what.  Thats right, the chars is only about 8 days old.<br>
It is not JUST the skills you need to worry about.<br>
The noobs that are just getting started, hey, you were once a noob too.  I'd rather take the time to educate em than have em get me killed 20 levels later.  Just my opinion.<br>
<br>
I wont say all here, but, a very good many of the players I know that powered to beyond 30, like to hang in places like Lguk to get those nice drops, in general are very item oriented, hell I am too.  But to date I've not seen a one of them not get owned in Lguk.  Chit going down so fast they stand there in a daze and die. Welcome to the real world.  <br>
Yeah, there are level 30+ noobies.<br>

Bearog, you do realize that tanking red mobs raises your defensive skills MUCH faster than tanking hordes of blues? You do know also, that tanking 3 mobs at a time raises defensive skills WAY faster than tanking those 3 mobs separately?<br>
<br>
You know... there are 50sh warriors out there who don't know the difference of powerleveling a noobie and powerleveling a new toon for experienced player.<br>
<br>
Why I did it?<br>
<br>
My RL friend quit playing his warrior, and three of us were left.. ench, cle and wiz. So it was easy decision for me to drop the wiz and pick up a new warrior.<br>
<br>
And to your friends argument... normally PL'd characters are in environment where you have already higher level characters and friends... so yes, I've been doing raids to Velk the Sorc, Dain, WW, ToV, Hate, Fear, Air, etc. with my warrior... so your point was?<br>
<br>
And why do we play the game?<br>
<br>
Simple... I play to have fun and to relax. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
If getting a level in the mid 30s took you about an hour or so, you spent 10 hours min in 30 to 40 out of yer total of 53 hours.  You stopped at 41.  Givin that mutch, screwy tho it may be 53 hours to 41, 10 hours of that for 30 to 40, leaving 43 hours for the other 31 levels.<br>
You jumped in the water, started swimming and went to sleep.<br>
So of those 43 hours remaining, how long did you sleep? If yer Pleveling a char on a server where yer established yeah I can see how you'd be ok, you already have friends to run with.<br>
This is yer 5th warrior to 41 on as many servers? You make friends fast.<br>
I never said swim wasnt easy to do, I said swim to 186 with all other skills maxed in 53 hours or less is quite a feat.  Hell theres hardly enough time in there to bank, er I guess it was all left laying and you started with twink gear so getting new gear was not required.<br>
<br>
To each his own.  I guess we all get differnet enjoyment values from the game.  Kinda reminds me of the ol table top gamers that pencil built their characters with godly gear or stats.  The point was?  You remember, or maybe not, the D&amp;D etc type RPGs.  There was always one or two that altered this stat or just happened to have that piece of equipment etc.  To some its a loots/numbers game.  Nice way to relax, turnning EQ into a 9to5 clone lol.  <br>

Guess who pulls or who makes strategies killing the big mobs?  Thats right it's me.  Heh I know this game better then most.  I pull on raids, and am the main tank.  Before this I played an SK and Shaman.  I retired my shaman around 52 and my SK around 30s.  Warriors stuck out to me more then the SK class did.  So I made one and used all the knowledge I learned from my first two classes to become a great tank.  Also at the time my guild had only one 50+ warrior the guild leader, so I decided to help with that problem too.  I may not have the best gear compared to people in uber guilds, but I am pretty skilled.  Not everyone are noobs still if they power gamed or leveled.<br>

I soloed those places til they greened out.  I had 2 Jade Maces, FBSS, and Fungi Tunic with some other stuff like Sebilis Scale.  There's probably better places to solo now but those were my hunting spots.<br>

For me it was: 1-10 (WITHOUT THORN SHIELD) Freeport newbie area/surrounding area.  11-23 or so, Lkaoe of Ill Omen not far from FV zone. 24-29 or so was other side of Lake, near FM zone.  30 - 33 or so fm near zone pulling giants and burynai.  34 - 41 **SECRET** uncamped location yielding massive exp but 0 loot.  Actually I'll tell ya..the Yeti caves in Dreadlands.  I've never seen anyone there.  Time to start on my piercing skill...later guys<br>
<br>
Again I am just proving that it can be done.  I do NOT condone this for people that don't know what they are doing, as you will have a crap warrior that doesnt know wht he is doing.  BTW Kazark that is very respectable to get that high in 10 days without a druid..hard core man <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ..my weapons were smoldering brand and CSS + fbss and my armor was common (treeweave, various crafted etc etc..)
