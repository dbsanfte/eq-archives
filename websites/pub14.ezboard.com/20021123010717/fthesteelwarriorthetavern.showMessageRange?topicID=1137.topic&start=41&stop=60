I know not everyone is 60, but most 60+ mobs are usually killed and tanked by guilds that have level 60 warriors (to my knowledge).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I will try to further this discussion later when I have more time. I have yet to see why shadow knight self only aggro spells are of such concern (since before the DC nerf they were able to do this anyways). And I really do not see why a spell that will help a warrior achieve a 20% taunt modifier would upset you.<br>
<br>
To Varaho:<br>
In one of these threads I pointed it out why knights tanking big stuff isnt effective. There are times when knights make superior tanks (such as fast killing situations) but those are few and far between. The reason you dont put a knight up to tank the other mobs is because they lack the hitpoints and damage mitigation skills of a warrior. I have played a warrior, and a shadowknight, and a couple of other classes at the high end raiding game. I assure you to have a warlord tank things *IS BETTER*. Nearly any class can pull aggro off of anyone, but why would they want to. How many raid mobs are there with significantly less than 100k hp? The ones I can think of are...<br>
<br>
VS - usually manaburned, best to have a riposte/parry tank<br>
Trak - who cares, tanks get trak touched hardly a MT fight<br>
Sev - He hits for minimal damage<br>
Gore - Best to have a knight tank (if they dont get feared) because of the slow.<br>
Talendor - Never killed him, gets burned a lot<br>
Ragefire - He doesnt exist<br>
VP - Been here a few times, didnt tank.<br>
Master Yael - I dont wanna tank DT mobs, not a MT fight<br>
Fear Golems - See yael.<br>
Naggy / Vox (for sub 53 crowd) - umm 60 people rusing a mob (at least on my server) hardly a MT fight.<br>
<br>
Most of that is about 2.5 year old content and to be honest a caster could tank some of those mobs. I am sure a shaman would hold aggro well.<br>
<br>
And on uber hp mobs I assure you that you need a warrior so you dont burn through cleric mana spam CHing a sub par tank for a 30 minute fight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/26/02 10:44:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And on uber hp mobs I assure you that you need a warrior so you dont burn through cleric mana spam CHing a sub par tank for a 30 minute fight. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The actual question is, can the mob do enough damage between CHs to kill the character out right?  If a mob does 5k damage in 4 seconds, you have a 4 second CH cycle, and the character tanking has 6k, the MT lives.<br>
<br>
If a mob does 7k in that same time period then you need a MT with 7.5k, right?<br>
<br>
Of course you can reduce your CH cycle to 2 seconds instead, and have a reasonable chance of keeping that MT standing.<br>
<br>
It all comes down to how much damage is getting through and how many HP the character has.  Frankly, with most mobs, anything over 6k HP is gravy.  There might be a few that really require more, but not many. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A> at: 8/26/02 10:47:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugraalthedorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Graal the Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/26/02 10:51:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Well, I have to admit, I just don't see how they are going to work it so that a shield increases a Warrior's agro similar to his wielding a procing off hand weapon without giving the Knights the exact same utility.

Come on Glatius. That isn't a real concern. Knight's have always been able to out taunt a warrior. It isn't important who can taunt better, it is important that all of the tank classes can taunt adequately enough to do the job. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> That</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is the only thing that really matters.<br>
<br>
The way it always worked before was fine. Knights could taunt better, but you generally didn't want them to. Only as a last resort would a knight tank, and only after all the warriors had gone down. That is the way it should be IMO. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

Who is to say that it won't be so much better now that moving the Knights into the MT position is really worth the effort?  Because that's what it comes down to.  Not that a Paladin or Shadow Knight can't tank a boss mob, just that its a bit harder to keep them alive.  But if they lock agro hard enough, maybe its worth the extra effort?  Who knows, that has yet to be determined.<br>
<br>
Again, its a situation where the Warriors are 'supposedly' getting a fix/upgrade, but it really helps another class more.<br>
<br>
And if the Knights were attractive as group tanks before, this is going to make them EXTREMELY attractive now, given even MORE ability to control ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukhumak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khumak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/26/02 11:20:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: knight tanking</span><hr size=1> Catre, that's not the point.  The point is that since Knights have enough HPs and AC to survive the CH cycle in nearly any conceivable raid condition that satisfies the tanking requirement.  <br>
<br>
The other requirement for MT is holding aggro.  Since Knights can maintain aggro far better than any warrior wielding any weapon in the game they are a better choice for MT because the raid as a whole can increase it's DPS.  This makes the mob die faster and the MT as well as the rest of the raid take less damage overall.  The actually CHs on the MT might be slightly less mana efficient due to the slight HP advantage of a warrior in the same gear, but the efficiency of the raid as a whole is much higher with a Knight MTing than with a warrior MTing.<br>
<br>
Because of this it would be bettter to replace all warriors with rogues or monks for damage output and let the knights do all the tanking.<br>
<br>
For warriors to be viable as the most efficient choice for MT (we're not asking to be the only ones capable of it, just the most efficient), there are 2 things you can do.  You can either make warriors way ahead of any other class in damage mitigation and leave aggro management the way it is or you can leave mitigation the way it is and give warriors the same ability to get aggro at will that Knights have.  In my mind the second option would be preferable. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85547>Khumak</a><br>

WARRIORS WILL STILL HOLD AGGRO FINE. <br>
<br>
Any dipshit SK who casts one of these on himself during an MT style fight (AoW, Emp, whatever) deserves to get his ass deaded.  <br>
<br>
I've said it many times, and I'll say it again. Keeping aggro to tank is not solely the warriors job. It falls on every melee (and those @#%$ wizards who chain nuke until OOM) to control their own aggro.<br>

Use your head. It means a 55 warrior cannot use taunt on a 56 mob for example. Has nothing to do with level 60+.<br>

Agreed.  It’s always been true that agro control is the duty of the group, not just one member.  Wizards don’t over-nuke if the group doesn’t want them to tank, Monks FD, etc.  The proposed added value to shields doesn’t change that.  If X class could always hold agro, but his group says that he shouldn’t, then he shouldn’t.  If the group wants the warrior to tank, he will.<br>

DPS comparison is what you’re talking about here when you say that lowering DPS and losing dual-wield is what you would have to sacrifice to get ‘perma-evasive’.  Either it matters or it doesn’t.  And, well, in either case if the Warrior is going to lose DPS for the benefits of a shield, so is the Knight.  I’d be hard-pressed to tell you which would give up more, but for the tanking warrior it’s not so much about DPS.  For any other warrior, no change.<br>
<br>
As for the agro concerns, we understand.  Right now I don’t really want to get into specifics, but we have a few ideas about how to make this work out for all you warriors.  Give us some time to fiddle with it.<br>

&quot;The proposed added value to shields doesn’t change that. If X class could always hold agro, but his group says that he shouldn’t, then he shouldn’t. If the group wants the warrior to tank, he will.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is correct and the crux of the matter, if the group/guild/encounter wants better DPS and someone who the need not limit themselves as they have more reliable aggro control, why have the warrior tank at all?  This was the whole concept behind &quot;strong taunt/weak mitigation&quot; in the past, and what we're looking for is that balance.  Anyone can reliably aggro a mob if they want to, but none so well as knights.  There is supposed to be some drawback to doing this to make you *want* to slow down to ensure the warrior has aggro.  <br>
<br>
The group USED to say they shouldn't, but no longer, now they say &quot;gee, as long as this guy's tanking, our dps is x% greater, and there's no visible difference between him and the warrior....later warrior.<br>

Sure, let's completely ignore the fact that warriors are already being left out of groups in favor of knights because of their superior aggro control.  Why would any group, comprised of reasonably intelligent players, ever want to lose efficiency and lower their DPS so that a warrior can tank when they can go all out and max DPS with the knight tanking just fine?<br>

Sorry Absor, you're completely missing the point.  What Edward Dunai was pointing out was that despite losing the DPS, the knights will have no problem controlling aggro because they generate aggro with spells, unlike warriors who have to rely on RNG based procs and to a smaller degree, their DPS. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uzumbukfleshcarver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zumbuk Fleshcarver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/26/02 9:28:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re: So much for warriors being needed to lock aggro...</span><hr size=1> Lets not forget about mashing that damn taunt button too. heh heh Although I think that only works on Frogloks and some Sarnaks.

Okay Absor, fair enough.  But can you not see that by increasing Knight agro, even if you increase Warrior agro by the same margin at the same time, you potentially decrease Warrior desireability even further outside of a raid scenario?  And you additionally run the risk of making Knight agro so solid, so attractive, that people decide to use Knights as MTs because of the DPS efficiency factor? I'd also be interested in seeing how you compensate for the lost agro from the Warrior's secondary weapon without giving Knights a whole new level of agro control in the process.<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe you folks have a rabbit to pull out of your hat though, so I'll wait and see.  But you haven't particularly reassured us that all is well.<br>

I really hope this isn't the entirety of changes on the drawing board to help out warriors. If done right, it might very well help warriors out on very difficult encounters. <br>
<br>
It will NOT help out in the everyday xp grind where the primary focus is DPS, DPS, DPS. As a paladin, my DPS blows. The difference is, when grouped with me, monks and rogues can go full throttle without worrying about aggro, assuming I have mana. The fact that monks and rogues have such insane damage output means that the primary purpose of the group is allowing them to do as much damage as they can. XP groups are all about damage output.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't think beefing up shields by itself (even after adding some mechanism for warriors to maintain taunt) is going to make up for the high damage melees essentially tanking almost as well as warriors and doing up to twice as much damage...in addition to usefull perks like sneak/hide and FD. The gap between warrior DPS and rogue/monk DPS is just too large. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

<br>
DPS helps us, in a lesser extent, to maintain aggro.<br>
If we lose 1/3 of our DPS *and*, let's say, 30% of our (totally random) proc-rate, I think we have rights to expect some aggro boost.<br>
But the real point is : a knight will either lose DPS. That's right. But with their spell, they will have the mob's attention anyway, so for them, no big deal about aggro.<br>
AND they will receive a mitigation/avoidance boost, so they will tank better than actual warriors (not one with shields if they wear these).<br>
<br>
So, to summarize, they will be given a tanking boost, and they have a very good aggro control.<br>
Now, please Absor explain to us (or me if I did not get the point) why we should let warriors tank, when a knight will tank just fine, and when a knight will allow an entire raid/group to do their job at 100% effectiveness ?<br>
<br>
Because of our &quot;3min-of-glory&quot; discipline, that concerns only a few mobs out there, so warriors are needed only for 4-5 mobs that 98% of warriors will never see because they don't want (or don't have the playtime required) to be in a über guild ?<br>

PS : about groups that should let the warrior aggro... You're right, but time to time this is not even possible.

<br>
I think there are two reasons the shield upgrade is a knight upgrade.<br>
<br>
I am going to quote the messenger of the gods :P<br>
<br>
First reason:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It’s always been true that agro control is the duty of the group, not just one member.

<br>
If a warrior would wear a shield instead of dualwielding a onehander with a nice proc that gives considerable agro, the rest of the group would have to put in a lot more effort to try and keep the agro on the warrior. They wouldn't want a warrior to wear a shield because of this. The monk would have to FD more, the others will have to lower their DPS even more, etc. That's why I think that upgrading shields is primarily a knight upgrade. This might not be the case if taunt or other ways to gain agro are improved.<br>
<br>
Second reason:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> DPS comparison is what you’re talking about here when you say that lowering DPS and losing dual-wield is what you would have to sacrifice to get ‘perma-evasive’. Either it matters or it doesn’t. And, well, in either case if the Warrior is going to lose DPS for the benefits of a shield, so is the Knight.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
With all the great pal/sk only onehanders out there I can garantee you that the warriors will loose more DPS.<br>
<br>
This can only be made more &quot;fair&quot; if all those great onehanders get to be warrior usable and flagged &quot;NONDUALWIELDABLE&quot;<br>
<br>
In conclusion:<br>
<br>
Improving taunt for all taunt-classes is not a problem to me. Of course knights will be able to lock agro better, but so will warriors. Knights are extremly good at getting agro as it is. Important thing is that it will improve the warrior.<br>
<br>
A group wants a solid tank and a big load of DPS. I think the warrior DPS is ok, no complaint there. But I do not think the warrior is superior in tanking anymore. I think they should be, as it seems to be the life goal of a warrior.<br>
<br>
My solutions to balance the warrior class would be to:<br>
<br>
A: Fix/Upgrade taunt<br>
B: Up the dodge/parry/riposte skillcaps for a warrior<br>
C: Give warriors the block skill<br>
<br>
If this can be done I would be one happy warcat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><CENTER><HR><TABLE width="400"><TR><TD align=center><A target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=280301"><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>Ursza Datank</FONT></A></TD><TD align=center><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>level 60 High Elf Wizard</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align=center><A target="_blank"  href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=250867"><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>Kater Ambandil</FONT></A></TD><TD align=center><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>level 60 Vah Shir Warrior</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT face="Arial Black" size=2>Member of <A target="_blank" href="http://www.divinewinds.org">Divine Winds</A> on the <A target="_blank" href="http://pub27.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern">Saryrn server</A></FONT></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uyulin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yulin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/27/02 2:35:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re: So much for warriors being needed to lock aggro...</span><hr size=1> Hrm. So...<br>
<br>
a) Paladins and SKs can taunt whenever they want.<br>
b) Paladins and SKs can tank just as well as warriors (without defensive)<br>
c) Paladins and SKs can currently do this without any near godly equipement (EB proc'ing items)<br>
<br>
Then we throw in...<br>
a) Enchanters and SKs can now cast hate increasing spells.<br>
b) Shield using characters getting mitigation/avoidance bonuses.<br>
<br>
Now Absor, exactly what is the role of the warrior? You, yourself (VI), apparently knew the role of the warrior revolved around duel wielding (and especially its procs). Look at how many shield items you put in the game that aren't usable by warriors, or even better, look at the number of class specific shields. (/hug fear shield, heh)<br>
<br>
Now I remember long, long ago threads coming out when people started questioning the &quot;knight ratio&quot; for weapons, and what was VI's response? It was made higher than dual wielding classes' ratios because the knights couldn't dual wield and could only use a shield in offhand. It was to compensate for the loss of damage in offhand. Were there ever, at ANY point: warrior, monk, ranger, rogue, bard, or beastlord weapons designed with &quot;knight ratios&quot; *incase* one of these classes wanted to use a shield? I think not.<br>
<br>
And now you throw off the notion of loss of DPS from using the shield? That kinda sounds hypocritical to myself. So you acknowledge the loss of DPS for KNIGHT classes when using a shield but when it comes around to the warrior class, we get to &quot;lose DPS for the benefits&quot;? This is some major bull I'm hearing. The Knight doesn't lose the DPS the warrior does because they have access to &quot;knight ratio&quot; weapons, WARRIORS DO NOT. Oh, unless you except every level 60 warrior in the game to have killed Emperor Ssra? Oh, and even then, 16/19 is still not knight ratio, thanks.<br>
<br>
(ps: If we were actually in an encounter where we needed defensive and had to use a shield, don't go forgetting that defensive takes our DPS and turns it into nothing. so uh, yeah, we get double penalized now, thx VI!)<br>
<br>
And on the whole agro issue. I just wonder if VI can't concievably come up with &quot;raid&quot; reasons for enchanters and shadowknights, so they create these hate increasing spells as something to give them; knowing the warriors are completely useless when it comes to actually doing their own agro. Again, Absor, this BACKFIRES.<br>
<br>
So now you got:<br>
<br>
level 60 warrior with 6850hp, 12/19 + 15/21 1hs, NO SHIELD IN BANK EVEN, neither EB proc'ing weapons, 1350ac.<br>
<br>
level 60 paladin with 6250hp, 24/22 1hs, has four or five shields in bank, agro ability out the arse, 1300ac.<br>
<br>
If the encounter does NOT need defensive, why use the warrior? This is a RAID encounter question (we won't even go into the utter uselessness of the warrior in exp groups). The warrior has 600hp on the paladin, the ac is meaningless to either one of them as they both only have CS2; HOWEVER, the paladin now has increased mitigation/avoidance (let alone when the paladin gets Physical Enhancement, grats on even more!) AND keeps higher DPS AND has no problem with agro since he has spells and the shield hate (if this will really do this) going for him. The warrior.... well, he looks goofy.<br>
<br>
Is this change supposed to be the warriors' way to get higher &quot;dps&quot;, by making the knights use a shield and tank, while we attack the mob from behind?<br>
<br>
Absor, if you are still reading this, answer this:<br>
What is the role of the warrior? We can only tank better by using a discipline that has hindered our growth for years (let alone the fact you are totally ignore pre-55 characters where the warrior can't even rely on saying he has /disc defe), we rely on other classes to make sure we can agro while at the same time disregarding buffs that actually help (sorry, while MT'ing and having a bard in my group, where are all of these hate buffs going to go? because I sure don't have the room), we rely on damage dealing classes to STOP attacking so a mob doesn't forget about us, and later rely on getting near impossible to get weapons for some to keep agro ourselves. Again, what is our role? To type /disc defensive on like four mobs that 95% of the game's warriors will never see or fight? If so, get rid of it and totally rework the class and all the encounters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvikoz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vikoz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/27/02 2:59:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re: So much for warriors being needed to lock aggro...</span><hr size=1> Hell Absor after reading your reply you comfirm what we been worried about.
