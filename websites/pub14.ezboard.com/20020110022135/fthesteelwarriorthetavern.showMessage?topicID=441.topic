<br>
Main Tank<br>
<br>
I have a few pet peeves when I comes to people playing main tank. <br>
<br>
1. Pick a target. Folks have gotten use to the enchanter telling em what to attack. No need for that to happen. Call out yer target, Enchanters will mezz the others. Just leave the chanter a caster to suck dry. <br>
<br>
2. Assisting puller. This isn't necessary. If a Monk is pulling, that Monk should ALWAYS assist the main tank. That being the case... return to point 1. <br>
<br>
3. Don't change target. Unless it is of the utmost importance to attack something other than yer first target, don't switch. If you do switch... announce it and return to point 1. <br>
<br>
4. Leave the Monk behind. I know it sounds cruel. Don't be a hero if you don't need to. Monk are the most likely to survive in any situation. If the group needs to get out of the area, don't hang around waiting for the Monk to leave. RUN. More than likely, the Monk will survive anyway.  In this case, stay away from point 1.<br>
<br>
Lastly.... <br>
<br>
5. Don't be afraid to take the lead. If you don't take the lead, someone else will (Enchanter).  In a battle, the main tank leads all other melee, they follow you.  Main Tank calls the shots. Period.  So go back to point 1 when yer ready.<br>
<br>
That's it.  If you guys don't agree, please say so. I'd really like to hear what you think.  Or if ya got some stuff to add, please do so!  Thanks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think you want to make one clarification.<br>
<br>
You're not talking about 'main tank' you're talkinga bout 'main assist'  A main tank is purely someone who's designated to hold agro for a fight (usually boss fight, I've never seen the point in trying to use a MT for clearing the way)  While it is the main assist's job to pick a target as well as a little bit of the assist order.<br>
<br>
When a main tank is actually used, you only have one target and you already know what that is (IE Tormax, Vindicator, Statue, Dozekar, whatever), so there's no need for a main assist. (usually)<br>
<br>
In fights where there are no mezzes, I honestly advocate no main assist... just kill what's in front of you.  If it's in camp you're down to two choices, kill it (or at least keep it off the casters) or wipe out.  It is probably a good idea to have the casters/damage dealers all assist the same person to take out one mob much faster than the others... but on a whole, I'd rather see the tanks split out across all mobs in camp (unmezzable situation) than trying to worry about who's supposed to be on which mob.  Better to keep the casters alive, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
But I know that there are also people who can't really tell the difference when assisting and not assisting are important, so with these people it's usually better to just have them always assist the main...<br>
<br>
/shrug  I guess I'm rambling now.<br>
<br>
but, your points make sense when you're talking about a situation where you're fighting mezzable mobs (which doesn't seem to happen very frequently to me, heh) <p><IMG SRC="http://users.starpower.net/dmoser/images/Kaldayr.jpg" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=200></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/umysthawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mysthawk</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/21/01 12:43:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Question for Tanks</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 4.

Exactly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Monks assist Main Assist on Pulls.<br>
<br>
explained a bit more for those wondering:<br>
the monk is basically the harvester; he/she goes out and finds stuff to kill and brings back to the group first and foremost. either Myself or the MA decides what the group is going to Kill first.<br>
than when a mob is engaged ( by myself or MA ), the monk assists off the MA person until the mob is at around 25% health less or so. than monk leaves to get more mob's to bring back.<br>
<br>
this rule i follow is situational to the hunt; planar raids, and, grinding groups i use that formula. the monk can always lose aggro ( in a perfect world 100%, but more often than not he/she can FD off adds ) and that is why i; nine times out of ten; never assist off the monk once the mob is within the groups range. i tell the monk to assist off myself or the main assist person once we fight if they didn't do so already. Most Monks i fight with know this, and, i have been fortunate to know many many good monks on my server.<br>
<br>
and it's always good to get into the /assist ( main tank ) mode once you get into the 40's or so, and, it keeps the enchanters happy when they are CC'ing. and always <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Tell Your Group What You Are Fighting !</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. that frees up the enchanter to mez and if your Enchanter suggests attacking a different mob's ( leaving caster mob's for mana draining ) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Tell Your Group AGAIN What You Are Attacking and You Have Changed Targets</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.

It is the main assists job to pick the target, everyone must assist the targets that are selected and announced by the main assist.  The main assist however MUST listen to what the chanter/bard/necros are telling him/her through the battle.  Often times you will be able to figure out which mob should be your next target.  I often times will go after the mobs that are either hard to mez, or have the oldest mez on them.<br>
<br>
2. Everyone should assist only the main assist.  The main assist can, if needed, assist the puller and the puller should be aware this might happen.  That means when the monk goes out to split some mobs, the monk MUST target the mob that needs to be picked off from the split.  You have no idea how many times I've pulled my hair out because the monk is FD between me and the mob but doesn't have the mob targeted.  It's frustrating trying to target the mob with the mouse, only being able to target the FD monk, and having the monk spam, &quot;TAG!&quot;<br>
<br>
3. looks fine enough<br>
<br>
4. Shouldn't make any special exception for monks... There really is no reason to die for anyone except maybe the cleric.<br>
<br>
5. I'm of the opinion that the class you play should not be used to decide who calls the shots in a group.  Whoever is good at organizing and understands the strengths and weaknesses of the classes will likely be the best leader regardless of their class. <p><center>

I'm not saying that the leader of the group/raid should always be the MA.  What I'm saying is that all melee basically flows through the MA.  If the MA is attacking nothing, more than likely you'll have a bunch of other melee guys standing around cuz they're waiting for the MA to act.  Fact of the matter is, as MA you have to CHOOSE something.  You're not giving the chance to wait for an order alot of the time in a large scale battle.  If you're waiting for another player to decide for ya, what's the point of being a player?  You may as well be a NPC or a remote controlled toy robot.  Regardless of the common belief, melee do think.  Melee gotta think, or they die.<br>
<br>
So if the order ot a soldier is to kill everything on sight, you don't need the General telling you over and over again to kill a particular target.  <br>

<br>
BAH. We have the most HP, therefore are the best suited to take damage and are the most likely to survive. It's our JOB. If a caster dies because a warrior ran, then that warrior brings shame to all warriors.<br>
<br>
After all, we have HP in the multiple thousands range and those frail little guys need someone to hide behind. <br>
<br>
Monks on the other hand are a different story. Let them die. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Obviously this differs from situation to situation, but generally if I'm in a situation where we are running from something (it doesn't happen often anymore) I want to be the last one there to give the group as much of a head start as possible. <p><hr width="25%">

<br>
I always figured if ya need someone to blaze the trail through a zone, a Warrior is better suited to do that.  Monks are better suited to bring up the rear, and slow down any mobs following behind.  Would you rather have a Monk run ahead to protect the caster?  I'm a Monk and I wouldn't even want that!<br>
<br>
Let the Warrior run with the casters to protect them along the way.  Let the FD'ers stay behind to slow the mobs down.  If a Warrior is left behind, he has less chance of survival that a Monk would.  I.E.  FD... mob goes after the group.  Monk pops up and the mob returns to kill em, as the group continues to run.  Monk FD's again.  Mob goes back after the group that's a long way off now.  Monk re-pops aggro the mobs once again.  Wash, rinse and repeat.<br>
<br>
Sounds better than standing around to die no?  Let the Warrior protect the casters on the way out of the area, that's something yer better at than any other class. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ujummpovar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JummPovar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/21/01 8:10:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  RE: Question for Tanks</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There really is no reason to die for anyone except maybe the cleric.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
