Keep it coming!<br>
<br>
Here's what we got so far:<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>a Lost Pirate:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Talk to this NPC on the rocky side of the pirate island in Iceclad. You'll need to say the following to him:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Ami wants chapter P.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
He'll go into his story about his deal with Ami's book (that's another quest). He says he lost the pieces to his map of the area. You say:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I will find the parts.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
That's right... &quot;PARTS&quot; not pieces. He will give you the Map Binding which is a four slot container to place the 4 pages of the map into and combine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dire Wolf Stalker:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (#1)<br>
Ok, the first page of the map is found on a Dire Wolf Stalker. This level 35 wolf is an easy kill and is located roaming near the giants by the Dragon Bridge to the Eastern Wastes. Find a druid or ranger to help track this thing. Kill normal dire wolfs to spawn this guy, they are his PHs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Stormfeather:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (#2)<br>
Heheheh... that's right, the notoriously bottlenecked spawn, Stormfeather drops the second page of the map you'll need. It spawns near the three pirates (sitting in a circle) atop the hill on the pirate island. Be watchful of KS'ers. He is level 35 and highly-contested. Best estimates show this guy spawning every 18 hours +/- 1 or 2 with a chance to skip (meaning 18 more hours of WAITING!)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bloodmaw:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (#3)<br>
Ok, this is a bit of a miniquest in and of itself. You're going to travel to the Great Divide. There you will hack your way through the Tizmak caves to collect 4 pieces of yakman meat. This stuff is NO DROP and it is usually just left rotting by lower level hunters. Once you have the four pieces of Yakman Meat, you'll need to hunt down Bloodmaw. This is the tricky part...<br>
Bloodmaw's cave entrance is located at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>n6048 p2860</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. There are about half a dozen of these Kodiak things you'll have to get past before you find Bloodmaw. He is located at the back of the tunnel... just follow the tunnel straight through and you'll get to him. I recommend getting a camo or invis from someone so you don't have to bother with these things.<br>
Once you get to Bloodmaw, don't get too close, or he will attack you. His agro range is VERY small though so you can get within trading distance without being attacked. Ok, move around to his back and approach him slowly and have one of the meats on your cursor. As you approach, try giving him the meat... this will test the maximum trade radius and not have him attack you. Once you get the trade window up, give him all four meats. Bloodmaw will despawn right away. Then you have to turn around and say the following to the Bloody Gnome:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I want the map please.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
The gnome will give you the third map piece and despawn.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Lodizal:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (#4)<br>
The fourth and final pieces of the map is dropped by the giant, level 60 turtle, Lodizal in IceClad. Once this thing is slowed, you just need a couple of tanks to go in and finish the job. He is on an approximately the same <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>timer</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as Stormfeather, although they do NOT share the same spawn <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>table.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Combining:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Once you have all four pages of the map, combine them in the Map Binding. Take the new fashioned item back to the Lost Pirate. He will give you the map back in return. After you receive the map, a rabid cougar will attack him (continuing his string of bad luck), kill it if you wish. (mind as well)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the Turn-In:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Take the map to Captain Nalot. He is in the right igloo (when you're facing ToFS) at the pirate camp. As your reward, you receive the Eyepatch of Plunder.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>--Thanks to Celestial Apokalypse and BabaHanz.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
There are four pieces to the map.  One piece drops from Lodizal, named level 60 mob in Iceclad, spawn timer roughly 11-12 hours.  Another piece from Stormfeather, a named level 35 snow griffon in Iceclad; his spawn time varies in my experience, but that's probably because he can skip spawns alot.  Third piece drops from A Dire Wolf Stalker.  Take a ranger or druid with you to the dragon portal in Iceclad, and kill all of the regular dire wolves that you can find until the stalker pops.  Regular dire wolves are placeholders.  Lastly, go to Great Divide and kill Tizmaks, and loot 4 NO DROP meats.  Go to where Bloodmaw spawns, which is in one of the caves near Velks.  He is KOS to everyone.  The easiest way I found to turn in the 4 meats to Bloodmaw is by having an enchanter or druid charm him.  After this, he despawns, and the gnome behind him will give some dialogue.  Say what you have to say, receive last piece, and go speak to the Lost Pirate in Iceclad, and follow the dialogue from there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varaho1>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 1251<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/31/02 4:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=709.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eyepatch of Plunder Walkthrough in the making -- NEED IN</span><hr size=1> You all forgot the chant to help you with the stormfeather camp:<br>

Well after having a friend log my account in and kill Lodizial and get me the 4th peice, I decided I mind as well start on the rest...so myself and a 60druid (same great guy) went off to GD and slaughtered the Tizmak caves AE style until I got 4 meats rather quickly (10 min tops). We went up to Bloodmaw camo'ed, I clicked it off, he charmed him, I handed in meats, he poofed, I asked the gnome for the map, then he poofed.<br>
<br>
Off to IceClad now, to get me setup for the Stormfeather camp the next day (today and last night) he hit track just for chuckles and lo and behold, a dire wolf stalker was up. We mosied on over and toasted his ass and I looted the 1st page...3rd so far in under 30 minutes of online time (keep in mind, friend got me lodi peice, we went straight to Bloodmaw, got that in 10 min, then to IceClad, where we intercepted the stalker, about 5 min after getting Bloodmaw peice - I got lost in GD trying to find a shortcut to Thurg so I could put the 4th map peice in a safe place, took about 15 min to get that done and us to the tizmak caves)<br>
<br>
Later that night we talked to a Dwarf Pally who had been there for 9 hours (this is about 3:30am last night) and said the last spawn was 7am the previous morning (12/30) so we let him be.<br>
<br>
I logged on 4 hours later (this morning) and SF wasn't up. Went AFK and back to sleep. Got back on at 11:45 and my friend was there to join me. <br>
<br>
I had to go to the doctor's office and share the comp with my bro throughout the time so my freind kinda took over the camp when I was away. Hehe.<br>
<br>
We camped him straight till about 6:30 earlier tonight (he was supposed to spawn this afternoon around 3pm) so we got worried that he skipped. We stuck through it and when my friend logged I made a non-kos Druid, and Stormfeathersux was born <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    who I set AFK and periodically monitered amidst my New Year's Eve celebrations.<br>
<br>
I monitored like this until about 12:30am and sat down for some hardcore campage. At 1:15 Stormfeather popped, I hit (-) and then Ctrl+S+X and began the incredibly long 30 second switch to Baadan. At long last, I switched chars, began spamming all the channels I could with %T %T %T!, and attacked the mofo. He dropped like a rock and had a nice 'Second part of Iceclad Map' for me and nothing else unfortunately.<br>
<br>
Incase you are keeping tabs...<br>

Dunno if this is still the case but this is what I found out when I did the quest.<br>
