<br>
Later that day I wrote myself a letter to read years and years from now, to my kids possibly reflecting how it felt when that happened.<br>
<br>
I didnt really get emotional about it until i saw a video clip on the news that showed a person falling from the WTC, when i saw that, i went into my room and cried for a bit, we had an assembly today and (even though horrbily put together and presented) brought back some memories.<br>

If the war is still goiing on when i am old enough to enlist, i will sure as hell go spelunking in afghanistan and punch him once for each person who lost their lives, twice for the firefighters, and then a few thousand more times for the hell of it. <p><hr width="267" align="left"><table  width="*" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><tr><td  align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168211" target="new"><img src="http://www.imahosting.com/sigs/baadansig1a.jpg"></a></td><td  align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=54401" target="new"><img src="http://www.imahosting.com/sigs/azumaan1a.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td  align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112720" target="new">51 Half Elf Warrior</a></td><td  align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=145036" target="new">34 Erudite Necro</a></td></tr><tr><td  align="center"> &gt;Dragon Maw&lt; </td><td  align="center"> &gt;Dragon Maw&lt;

<br>
Needless to say i sat there for over an hour with my mouth opened as i watched the second plane hit, then the reports from the pentagon, and the plane crash in PA<br>
<br>
I finaly went down to have breakfast and the workers down there hadn't heard anything...it was hard for me to tell them the news.<br>
<br>
Later that day there were a couple FBI agents walking around with the Dean, and the campus police.<br>
<br>
That day will be forever etched in my mind.  I remember when i was 10 visiting the WTC and looking out across the city, wish i could have gone back before this happened.<br>

I heard about the first plane hitting the WTC as I was flipping thru the channels. They didnt say what kind of plane it was so I figured it was a small single-double engine Cessna or somthing like that. This was when nobody knew it was a hijack and just figured it to be a horrible accident. Well I listend for a few minutes then kicked in my cd player instead. When I arrived at training there was nobody in the classroom, so I wandered around and fount everyone packed into the breakroom watching TV. So I asked what was going on and was told a second plane crashed into the WTC. So I'm thinking to myself &quot;what are the odds of 2 planes crashing into the same building&quot;... then I removed my head from my arse and realized what was happening and had to sit down (I know I can be naive sometimes).  Needless to say we spent all of our training day watching the news.. talking, swearing, crying. I'll never forget the events of that day.. the victems, thier friends and families, and the Hero's of that day and the days to follow.  I still get choked up most when I think/hear/read about the passangers of flight 93(?) and the sacrifice they made to save the lives of others.<br>

Instead, news were on..half awake, I watch thinking they start the show late. Switching channels, I see the same everywhere and settle down to watch..<br>
Realizing what happened, I don't know what I thought or felt. A dream? A joke? Disbelief. Denial. Shock. Not even anger at this moment. I was numbed and stunned..glued to the screen for I don't know how long.<br>
<br>
Shaking this off, I race to my comp. My icq is a blinking xmas tree mess.<br>
I'm in luck, I find one of my NY friends online. Nothing happened to him, but he had a first-row seat having his office near the crumbling towers. But all the normal phonelines are dead. I offer him to call his wife.<br>
<br>
In the end, I'm in luck. No one I know died there. But none of that helped. I felt like I was sleepwalking in a bad dream for a couple days.<br>
Its still irritating to think back, or to watch the pictures on TV again.<br>
<br>
My first thought of anger was &quot;screw those fucks, drop nukes to the whole darn place&quot;. At that time I didn't care/realize that it wouldn't be any better and kill tons of innocents. Vengeance, in the worst way.<br>
<br>
I remember having to turn the TV off after the 3rd day of straight news reporting only..I didn't want to hear it anymore. I needed some calm to just relax and take my mind off this whole thing. I'm reminded every day, and although I could live without memory, I don't want to forget the lives this cost.<br>
<br>
I'm normally pretty cold, I didn't think anything much I could see would still shock me considering all the stuff that already happens in this world, but this event did. And while I realize its very unlikely to happen, I'll down some good drinks whenever I see Osama's head severed from his body in the most painful way mankind can imagine. <p><p><font color="red">Baron Rugal Bloodwind<br><font color="6F6F6F">

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   I've been awhile on responding to e-mails like this as I have no words to accurately describe what I am feeling. <br>
<br>
Shock, dismay, anger, hatred, sorrow, none of them fit the bill, nothing conveys the numbness that rests in my gut. <br>
<br>
I don't even know who I want to hit back at, the anonymous fucks. But there exists in me the overwhelming urge to hit back, much harder and more viciously than I<br>
was hit...and that scares me. <br>
<br>
In our mad rush to avenge ourselves, we will become our enemies. <br>
<br>
&quot;I beheld what I became, and abhorred what I'd become&quot; - me, after playing thru Wing Commander 4 and playing the evil Blair route. <br>
<br>
I watched &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; last night on HBO and something was conveyed to me, that only this or perhaps the &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; could. The utter<br>
dependence that mankind has on violence to solve it's problems. The ultimate threat of any society has is death, that threat was carried out on us by a band of zealots<br>
this last Tuesday. <br>
<br>
My one constant feeling on this is that we must make sure it never happens again and sadly, tragically there is only one way to do this. That is to make the cost so<br>
unbearably, inhumanly, mind numbingly, horrifically high that the cost so far outweighs the gain that it never is even considered as a solution ever again. <br>
<br>
As much as we would like to believe that power does not flow from the barrel of the gun, we must acknowledge and even embrace that fact. <br>

And yes, I did fire up Rainbow Six and smoked some Tangos.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I dont mean to come off sounding like a hawk, but the Israelis have a ceremony in which they swear in some of their Army officers where they gather on the plataeu of Masada and take the the oath &quot;Sheneeth Lo Tafo&quot; (this is spelled phonetically and incorrectly) which literally translates &quot;Again not, it shall fall.&quot;. <br>
<br>
The people of the United States need to remember that mantra, and also that if we do not take steps to stop the merchants of terrorism they will return and strike us again.<br>
<br>
Sorry to get on my soapbox but after watching the news alot of stuff was dredged up I thought I had put to bed and this is good catharsis.<br>

I remember distinctly the series of events. I was in NY about 20 miles north of the city. My student's were working on a lab and I was chatting on AIM with one of the girls in the office of the company I worked for. She said &quot;oh my god...i plane just crashed into one of the towers.&quot;  At that point, noone knew what exactly was going on and I was thinking it was some idiot in a cesna who flew too close and paid the price. <br>
<br>
In any case, my 3 students and I filed outside to the balcony of the 2 story building we were on to see if we could see the smoke. At that time, a jumbo jet roared over our heads at about 1000 feet. It seemed a bit ood. It was too fast and high to be landing at Stewart Air Force base, or the Fishkill NY airport, but too low to be doing anything else. 3 min later that plane crashed into the second tower. By that time we were back inside and getting ready for more instruction, when I looked down to see an IM saying the second tower had been hit. I tried to IM back but lost the service. I tried looking up some news but the web was paralyzed. Most web and telephone connections around the NYC area were severely damaged by the damage to the towers. <br>
<br>
There was no TV or radio in the center we were at. One of my students was a NY State fire investigator. The other was a reserve fireman and had 3 brothers who were NYC cops. The third worked for the Red Cross. So we all piled in our cars and headed to my hotel room to watch the news.<br>
<br>
We stood in utter shock and amazment while watching it live on one of the local news channels. As a reporter was talking a screaming body landed not 10 feet behind him and bounced (coverage like that thankfully was edited outside of the local market). Just then, the first tower started to come down. I couldn't believe it. Chuck, the fire investigator's beeper went of before the first debris hit the ground. The other two students received them one after the other and they all headed out. 5 min after they left I got a call from Chuck telling me he was coming back to get me...they wanted as many network guys as they could get.<br>
<br>
I spent the next 5 days at ground zero and the red cross building. I didn't sleep for more than a few minutes for 9 days. I drove home on Sunday to my frantic wife who insisted I not spend another day there. I lost 2 friends in the towers and one friend I served with in the Pentagon. I spent most of the 11th this year trying not to break into tears every time I saw a picture on the television of a fireman or of the towers, which was so frequent I had to keep the tv off all day.<br>
<br>
I don't care what anyone says. I don't care what anyone thinks. I saw it...I felt it...I smelled it, which is the one thing I will never forget. For what they did I want to scour the earth for every last person who was responsible for this attrocity, no matter what their motivation was, and kill them...slowly and painfully. I want to film it as we bury them with a pig, which according to the moslem faith, will bar them from paradise and consign them to hell, and then distribute that film to every news agency in the world so everyone can see. Screw anyone who gets in the way. We told you we were coming. Move it or lose it...train coming.<br>
<br>
peace,<br>
