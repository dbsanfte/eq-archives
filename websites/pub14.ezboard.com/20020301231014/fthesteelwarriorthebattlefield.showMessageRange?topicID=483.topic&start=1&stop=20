It is unlikely that you will have enough resist gear to resist much at all.<br><br>I would recommend level up. You stand a much better chance of resisting AE and fear at 48 than at 45. Moreso at 52.<br><br>Here are some more hints that will make your first dragon raids more fun:<br><br>1. NEVER go on a pick up dragon raid. These are usually attended by people who have little raid experience and can often end up with a very long and painful CR.<br><br>2. Try to make it to raids sponsored by higher level guilds that are killing for pali book/scales/ragefire because they will usually have high level clerics/shaman/chanters to buff you.<br><br>3. Don't forget your resist gear in the bank. Don't duel people while you are waiting. Don't spam the chat channels. DO sit quitely and talk within your group. Leading raids is a much harder task than you know so every little thing that you do to help keep the raid leader sane is a big help.<br><br>4. If you are not the MT sacrifice AC for HP and resists. <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial"><img src="http://www.bfdesigns.net/eq/wandor_sig.jpg"><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor's profile</b></a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.exarch.net/"><b>Fusion of Flame</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6102" target="_blank"><b>Moordian's profile</b></a></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=remfdatroll>Remf da Troll</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/22/02 4:23:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen</span><hr size=1> ...only go on vox/naggy raids with people who know what they are doing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Honestly, that's the biggest key to having a good raid.

If the plan is like &quot;Ok, casters come in 4th wave, push him against back wall&quot; be wary. If the plan is &quot;First tank in, then all groups, don't ping pong, druids on group heals, clerics /assist nagafen for heals, nuke at 40&quot; you have a bit better chance. It's all about edumacating the masses. <br><br>At 45 you will be fine, I promise. If you can, buff your resists to 100 MR/CR or FR/CR simultaneously. If not, get the FR or CR and use /fearless. If you don't want to do that, group with a bard and you'll be safe. At 45 put your higher delay in main hand, or just something so that he'll go for another warrior before you. Getting chewed up sucks, and at 52 warriors have more available to them along the lines of staying alive. <br><br>Honestly, something that doubles for 250 and kicks for 40 is not bad, the melee is fairly negligable on any buffed tank. Get lots of bards. Something not often considered is this: You only have a few clerics, then eliminate the groups that don't have them. It may sound cold hearted, but some times unprepared groups are a liability. More lag, more mana spent on a clericless tank, and so forth. <br><br>Another thing to consider is that he has 32K hit points.

I'd be willing to bet some of these more recent Nag/Vox raids fail *because* they are trying to MT.  Instead of spreading clerics around to heal everyone, they are all concentrated on a 52 warrior who can't hold aggro anyway.  The best way to fight any 32k hp mob is to make balanced groups and beat him until he's dead while the healers heal up damage.

These were raids with people from 4 or 5 guilds, all regular attendees to the raids and therefore experienced dragon killers.  Recently I've been attending dragons raids again with one of my alts (level 45 druid), so far 65 Naggy and 4 Vox, all successful and for the most part guild-only (mostly alts, with 2 or 3 mains that are still under 52).<br><br>The advice above is very good, and the most important piece of advice is that whoever is in charge really needs to know what they're doing, and people participating have to be good at foloowing instructions.  If not, chances are the raid will fail, no matter how many people you throw at the dragon.<br><br>With my main, raids ranged in numbers from 24 to 40 people.  This was a while ago, with no high-level buffs available, no epics and much lower quality of weapons and resist gear than currently available.  Our raids now are much smaller.  Our record is killing Nagafen with 12 people (of which only 1 was a cleric) and Vox with 16 (although only a rogue and a shaman were left standing at the end).  Vox is significantly harder than Nagafen since due to her Complete Heals you need enchanter sieves, and even then she might still CH a couple of times.  Still doable without enchanters, but much tougher.  The only time I was in a raid with no enchanters there were 36 people and only 18 survived, after 4 CHs.  The lower numbers are a reflection of higher damage weapons (e.g. we have a rogue with Ragebringer and en epic monk now in the dragon crew), better buffs (Focus, Shissar, etc), and more experience/better tactics (in-guild group that knows what they're doing).<br><br>Assuming the raids you attend have good leadership, make sure you have good resist gear.  Make an investment in some diamond and blue diamond jewelry. If that is out of your price range, there are still some good things you can get cheaply, such as a rune boned fork, cloak of the icebear, earrings of fire reflection, etc.  There are some good guides to resist gear on the web, you just need to do a bit of research.  My level 45 druid has attended all of his killings with about 120 MR and 120 FR buffed.  That has been enough to resist most of the Fears, although the fire/cold AE really eat him up.  If you can get to 100 unbuffed in MR and CR/FR, then you should be OK at level 45.<br><br>Some other tips:<br>- We find that shadowknights make the best Naggy/Vox tanks.  They can taunt with spells and keep the dragon on one target, making healing easier. Warriors can't taunt them since they are red to a level 52.<br>- When you are low on clerics, paladins work great.  Whenever we've killed a dragon with 1 only 1 cleric we've had 2 or 3 paladins.  LoH is great for this kind of fight.<br>- Positioning is very important.  The main tank needs to know how to do this.<br><br>Hope you get to do this, it's a lot of fun!<br><br>Galdraith<br>Warder of the Corps<br>Veeshan <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugaldraith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galdraith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/02 5:22:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Vox/Nagafen</span><hr size=1> One last thing.

While wizards are certainly not necessary, they sure as hell make it a lot easier on the rest of the raid party. The hard part is getting enough to show up.<br><br>On Naggy ice comet works wonders - 1120 per cast so a single wizard can easily do ever 10% of the damage in about 21 seconds. That's about 160 DPS. If you have a good wizard turn out this fight will be VERY fast.<br><br>On Vox, chanter's are of course a give for seive, but again - at 51 wizards get draught of fire which works very well on the ice dragon. 731 damage per cast every 3 seconds. If you have 5 wizards on the raid you can basically burn Vox down from 35% in less than the time it takes for Cheal to go off.<br><br>Like any other raid, all classes have their place. You are better off with a balanced raid that knows what they are doing. <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial"><img src="http://www.bfdesigns.net/eq/wandor_sig.jpg"><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor's profile</b></a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.exarch.net/"><b>Fusion of Flame</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6102" target="_blank"><b>Moordian's profile</b></a></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uturomtoesmasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Turom Toesmasher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/24/02 2:17:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fraglak.com/images/sig/turom_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Like any other raid, all classes have their place.

The biggest damage dealer was one of the rogues, since he has Ragebringer.  The tanking was all done by the SKs and they both held aggro the entire fight (one died when Nag was at 30% or so and the other pciked up aggro immediately).  We won with maybe 2 deaths.<br><br>We've also done it a few times with only one cleric, but 2 or 3 paladins (LoH is great for when the cleric runs OOM).

No, they actually shine in these fights.  Especially SKs (for holding aggro) and Paladins (LoH saves the day when it's a small force and short in clerics). Rangers do OK, but rogues and monks are preferrable (unless you don't have a higher level ranger doing buffs, if so SoN and CoE are nice, so a ranger is a great addition).<br><br>I find Vox much harder. We killed her once with 15, but it took two attempts.  The first one she started running but killed the remaining people with her last AE so there was no one left to finish her off!  The second one a rogue and shaman were barely alive when she started running, and the rogue finished her off.<br><br>Anyway, happy hunting, these are a lot of fun!  And also easier to find up.  Being a smallish guild we don't normally find the bigger mobs up when we have sufficient force, so this is fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uturomtoesmasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Turom Toesmasher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/25/02 1:52:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fraglak.com/images/sig/turom_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen</span><hr size=1> tisk tisk tisk... having level 60s buff you up is cheating.

I too have done a Nags raid with 1 cleric as well; but this wasn't what I have done, this was what I would choose for a 12 person self sufficent Nags raid.<br><br>I must say however that it is impressive that you could manage a small raid without bards for the resist and debuffing protection.  You must have had some *very* good equipment, such as SS armor, in order to keep your resistances adquately high enough while not trashing your AC/HPs.<br><br>I really don't see  how you can say the hyrbids shine in this situation when at the same time you say they have level 60 buffs on them.  Of course they will be better equipped for this situation that a 52 warrior with level 52 buffs.<br><br>I never really said that putting a hybrid into a raid will cause it to fail either.  In one of my posts I tried to stress that there are much better choices for your raids.  This however was not the main point I was trying to make.
