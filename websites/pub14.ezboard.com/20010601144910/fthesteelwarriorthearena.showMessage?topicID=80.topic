<br>
Basically, monks in my opinion are much easier to play nowadays. You can twink them up with fighting batons (8 dmg 20 dly), which only cost around 1 to 2 k each. This of course, does NOT apply to those that are completely new to everquest.<br>
There's also been a major increase in the monk population, mainly because of kunark. Lizards get regen and infravision, and even higher AC than the human counterparts.<br>
A twinked monk can now shine as well as a twinked warrior from level 1 to 40.<br>
From level 40 to 50 though, the monk will do more damage and have higher AC than the warrior, though only having half the hps.<br>
<br>
Now what happens with kunark? (post 51)<br>
1) Warriors get more AC than monks - I'm fine with that.<br>
2) Warriors get even MORE hp than monks - I'm fine with   that.<br>
3) Warriors get kunark set armor. Monks get none (except for the monk robe which is insanely hard to get, and only a select few monks on each server will have one.) - I'm fine with that cause we're supposed to have low AC.<br>
4) Warriors have four to five disciplines which they will commonly use at level 60. Monks will only use two commonly: Stone stance (for pulling) and inner fire (increases damage done)-hrmmph.<br>
5) Warriors get triple attack at level 60. Monk gets nothing. - I do not mind this so much as triple attack rarely goes off. But it is still an insult to monks. = P<br>
6) Monks get to use weapons. *Woo hoo*. Think..the tranquil staff... 29 dmg 30 dly effect 120 dd unresistable stun.<br>
Think... ton po's staff 44 dmg 40 dly 120 dd unresistable stun.<br>
Think...runed fighter staff. 19 dmg 20 dly.<br>
<br>
But ops! How many monks actually have them? On my server on karana, i have counted: 6 monks after a week of asking the higher guilds. None has the ton po from trakanon. Two ppl have the runed fighter staff. So make that... 8 ppl who have those ubberly godly weapon on the KARANA SERVER of 2000 ppl during peak times.<br>
<br>
-The tranquil staff is dropped from the skeleton warlord in karnor. He is a totally random spawn. He can spawn once in a month, or spawn 3 times in an hour. He drops the tranquil staff at a 120 kill to 1 drop rate. I am currently offering items and cash of up to 120k + for it in karana. Lemme know if you have one for trade. = P<br>
<br>
Now look at the weapons that the average monk will get:<br>
<br>
Stave of shielding (17 dmg 28 dly)<br>
Wu's trance stick (7 dmg 18 dly effect 83 dd)<br>
Jaded mace (9 dmg 18 dly)<br>
<br>
Now look at the weapons that the average warrior may get:<br>
<br>
Jaded mace<br>
Jarsath trident (11 dmg 22 dly)<br>
Spined dragon claw (10 dmg 21 dly)- harder to get.<br>
Wurmslayer (25 dmg 40 dly) - though the delay sucks.<br>
<br>
So let's equip the warrior with the jaded mace in primary, and jarsath trident in secondary. Well gee, it's a 0.5 ratio to 0.5 ratio.<br>
<br>
Let's equip the monk with two stave of shielding. It's a 0.607 ratio on both hands.<br>
That seems fine? OH YES, except that the primary hand gets a bonus to damage. Low delay weapons are gods, that's why a jaded mace at level 60 does more damage than a stave of shielding in the primary hand. So let's switch the primary hand slot with a jaded mace to balance things out.<br>
So it becomes: 0.5 ratio on primary and a 0.607 ratio on secondary.<br>
<br>
Of course, i have not forgotten flying kick which can do anything from 3 dmg to 120+ damage a kick. Too random for my taste.<br>
<br>
This is the AVERAGE monk versus the AVERAGE warrior.<br>
What happened to the half hp and lower ac penalty of monks? Wasn't it supposed to be justified by the &quot;OHH WOW you're doing lots of damage&quot; title? <br>
To be honest if i lose 50 percent of my hp, i expect to do 40 to 50 percent more damage. Is that an unreasonable expectation?<br>
<br>
Now...you justify this by saying: <br>
You got mend! And you got feign death!<br>
OH yes, i definitely agree on that. Mend is great! It heals a bub of hp every 15 mins or so. <br>
Feign death is great! But it doesn't work when:<br>
<br>
1) A mob is hitting on you , you are below two bubbles of health, and you feign. (post level 45 for me). You have to run and make a reasonable space between you and the critter, then feign for it to work. - try it if you don't believe me. I've done this about 20 times in karnor, it hasn't worked once.<br>
<br>
2) Feign death on a wandering mob, and you'll have to slash q, go linkdead and wait 5 minutes every single time if you don't want to pull a train.<br>
<br>
Basically, feign death is a great skill. But it's not as good as some of you might think. It's mainly used for chain pulling.<br>
<br>
So let's sum up the overall:<br>
<br>
The cons:<br>
-Monks have half hp of warriors. <br>
-Rogues do more damage and have higher AC than monks (kunark). <br>
-Monks have pathetic resist gear. <br>
-The average monk does not do a lot more damage than the average warrior in kunark. <br>
-If you have a rogue in your group, there is no reason to get a monk unless you need a puller. <br>
-Monks can never solo unless they are lucky enough to have those ubber weapons along with a cloak of flames.<br>
-Monks are the only class not to get kunark set armors.Paladins get deepwater, warriors get cobalt, druids get elder spiritualists, clerics get donals and so on.<br>
<br>
The benefits:<br>
-Monks get mend. <br>
-They get feign death. <br>
-They are useful to a group for pulling. <br>
-They do a bit more damage than warriors.(kunark)<br>
-If you manage to get the ubberly rare weapons for monks, you will do a lot lot more damage than warriors.<br>
<br>
So what is a monk's function in a group? To pull.<br>
What can a monk contribute to a group? A little bit more damage than the warrior, and their pulling abilities.<br>
<br>
I hope you now realise why a lot of us monks are complaining. We didn't go into this class to only realise we are good for pulling. *Unless you are lucky enough to yada yada yada get tranquil staff*<br>
My suggestion is to let the ubberly rare weapons drop more...There is no other solution to this. Verant insists that we need to be properly equipped to do more damage, yet only 6 ppl have the staff on KARANA? A server with 2000 + ppl on peak times?<br>
We are not asking for more damage than verant envisioned us to do. We are not asking for more hp. We are hinting for more AC.(shiverback armor really sucks...the bracer is 4 ac. The sleeves are 5 ac. Azure sleeves have 12 ac and vox bracer has 7 ac. There's not even a helmet)<br>
What we really want, is to do more damage. And only if the equipment verant bases monk's damage on drops more, can the average monk population perform their tasks as a damage dealer.<br>
Would like to hear your thoughts. = )<br>

I dueled a very twinked monk that was 39th level the other day and he got me down to less that one bubble before I killed him.  He was using two knuckle dusters and had a few super twinked items such as a necklace of superiority and some other high end stat candy.<br>
<br>
I also have several monk friends that I duel with a lot for fun.  One is two levels lower than me and has beaten me every time we fight.  He wields Master Wu's Trance sticks or fights bare fisted.  Most of his armor is Cresent armor that he got by soloing in Dalnir.<br>
<br>
Group wise.. I dont think that we could pull off some of the raids and thigs we do without monks.  We set up double Feign Death pulls that SKs probably couldn't do.<br>
<br>
I started my own monk not too long ago and am killing things at 17th level by myself that I used to have trouble with in the 20s with my warrior.  I'm sure once I get to the higher levels with him, I'm going to start feeling that weight restriction as well as the lower HP and AC... but, I'll take that slight disadvantage if it means I get to be one of the least common and most unique classes in the game. <p><img SRC="http://www.geocities.com/trunksz/VanZant.jpg" NOSAVE height=100 width=400><br><b><font color=black>V</font><font color=navy>an</font><font color=black>Z</font><font color=Navy>ant</font>  <font color=black>B</font><font color=navy>rave</font><font color=black>S</font><font color=navy>word</font></b><br>

What AC was your warrior at? What type of gear were you using?(As in dex? str? agi? ac? hp?) Did you have a haste item? <br>
<br>
Realise that:<br>
Wu's trance sticks are 7 dmg 18 dly.<br>
Knuckle dusters are 14 dmg 28 dly. <br>
<br>
A monk's fist at level 50 is 14 dmg 30 dly.<br>
<br>
And MOST IMPORTANTLY:<br>
What weapons were you using?<br>
<br>
Now...if you were level 52, and you lost to a level 39 monk. <br>
<br>
That means: Monk has 22 hp a level. 39*22= 858 hp. Add some nice hp gear, give him say 1000 hp (for easy reference). With mend, that gives 1250 hp.<br>
<br>
You, at level 52, have close to AT LEAST 2200+ hp.<br>
So let's assume, you have double the hp with your equipment. Say 2500 hp. <br>
<br>
I am just making things up for easy reference. A warrior has twice the amount hp of a monk. Makes sense. = )<br>
<br>
Now...the only way you could've lost so much hp from this point of view is:<br>
<br>
1) You have less than 800 AC. (which translates to you need to play more. = P)<br>
2) You are using a 2 handed weapon with a horrible delay.<br>
3) You are using two yheskas.<br>
<br>
Now notice...<br>
Yheskas cost around 3 k platinums.<br>
Wu's stick costs around 15 k platinums.<br>
Knuckle dusters cost around 10 k platinums.<br>
<br>
If you were using yheskas...i could see the posibility of you losing 4 bubbles of health. Hard to believe, but it's a possibility.<br>
<br>
Now, if you were using jaded maces, or some weapon equivalent in kunark, i don't see how in the world the monk could've taken 2000 hp from you considering he's 13 levels below you?<br>
<br>
Please enlighten me of your equipment that you used to duel with him.<br>
As for the higher level monk, you will NEED to get a jaded mace or some low delay weapon with a ratio of close to 1/2. You will, and DEFINITELY beat the monk, considering if you have indicolite or cobalt armor. <br>
<br>
AND, you say that your new monk has an easier time than your warrior?<br>
Well, my new warrior has a much super duper easier time killing critters than my monk. Why? Because he's twinked to godliness. My monk was my first character, back then monks never used weapons. <br>
If you're telling me your warrior was twinked, and your monk has an easier time than him killing stuff, then something is definitely wrong. = P<br>
Reply soon now, curious to hear what equipment you have on your warrior. <br>

Monks equipment much easier to get than warriors.  I mysef gotten Wu's at lv 40 (no monk in the group), hell you can start camping it at 36.   I drool over equipment that monks get easily at 30 that is NO way in hell I can get them a similar item if any is available.  I also have an adamantite stick 19 dam 30 dly.  Wu's stick sell for less than 10kpp now.<br>
<br>
My damage compared to a monk is laughable at 42.  I have a Kunzar and a ssoy.  Man you argument about us having more hp is not well thought out.  MOBS at higher level dish out insane damage, the key of survival is to kill them quick.  The extra HP will keep me alive a little longer.  <br>
<br>
Mend and FD are HUGE benefits.  Try to live without them for a week and them come back and talk to me.  Also bind wound is caped for warriors until 50+, which is a huge drag.<br>
<br>
Let me point this out, a monk at my level can solo mobs I can't consintenly and safely.<br>

<br>
First off, I'm a human warrior.  My hit points at level 52, Unbuffed are closer to 1900 rather than 2200 like you suggested.  I use AC gear, not HP gear, so my equipment doesnt help me a whole lot.<br>
<br>
As for AC, I have the best one can possibly get without having much planes gear and kunark armor.  Its an 864, unbuffed. (My best armor peices are indicolite boots and cobalt gauntlets, all else is sub-planar armor.)<br>
<br>
My haste item is the standard issue FBSS (19% Haste).<br>
<br>
Here are my basic melee stats:<br>
Str- 141<br>
Sta- 100<br>
Agi- 106<br>
Dex- 103<br>
<br>
Here are my weapons:<br>
Green Jade Broadsword- 11 damage, 25 delay<br>
Shimmering Partisan- 17 damage, 39 delay<br>
<br>
Now, keep in mind that the 39th level monk was seriously twinked.  He was an Iksar with Gem Encrusted bands, a necklace of superiority, Heirophants cloak, knuckle dusters, what seemed to be mostly crescent armor, an FBSS, Sarnak Ear rings of Station and some other very nice stats equipment.<br>
<br>
Also, my current weapons are fairly slow by comparison, but are what would be considered high end weapons.  In overall damage output in a group, I'm usualy one of the highest.  In PvP its a different situation.  Keep in mind, the GJB sells for about 25k on Fennin Ro and the Shimmering Partisan sells for about 15k <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
i don't like everything about a warrior.  to be honest, we are bad at everything except tanking and taking beatings.  to win duels i have to buy 100pp+ of potions, and camp the jailmaster in perma for a while trying to get  wooly spider nets.  to me this is unbalanced, to many others, it's whining.  <br>
<br>
getting into the stat details ruins the game.  nothing is worse then someone comparing numbers.  last night i used a shield with my wurmslayer because i liked the look.  its pretty ludicrous seeing a warrior with the shield, because people say &quot;i lose on damage&quot;.  i like the look, and i like the fact that it boosts my armor as if i wore another breastplate.  <br>
<br>
anyway, to be honest, monks have their purpose in everquest.  vanzant said it, some things are done so much easier with monks.  sometimes i have problems taunting off a monk.  to win a duel against a monk i have to manuver like a ReaperBot in quake.  <br>
<br>
don't be so downcast.  it's a game, try to make the best of it.  if not, seek another game that suits your gameplay, plain and simple bro<br>

Lot's of reply. Time to rebutt. = P</span><hr size=1> Alrighty! Seems like i've made a very active thread here.<br>
Lol<br>
<br>
My first rebuttal is to :<br>
===========================================================<br>
Surgius<br>
I QUOTE:<br>
&quot;Monks equipment much easier to get than warriors. I mysef gotten Wu's at lv 40 (no monk in the group), hell you can start camping it at 36. I drool over equipment that monks get easily at 30 that is NO way in hell I can get them a similar item if any is available. I also have an adamantite stick 19 dam 30 dly. Wu's stick sell for less than 10kpp now.&quot;<br>
Ahhh yes. I absolutely agree with you. Wu's stick on some servers are 10 k. Some are 15 k. Wu's sticks CAN be camped by lower level ppl. The lower level monks around 40 to 50 who have them will do great damage.<br>
-HOWEVER, i was referring to POST level 50 issues where this is NOT the case. = P<br>
<br>
Your next point:<br>
&quot;My damage compared to a monk is laughable at 42. I have a Kunzar and a ssoy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kunzar is : 8 dmg 22 dly effect engulf darkness.<br>
SSOY is : 8 dmg 24 dly effect yheska.<br>
If you are using these two against the wu's trance stick:<br>
Wu's stick: 7 dmg 18 dly effect smite. <br>
OF COURSE the monk will do more damage. Again, let me repeat myself, i am talking about POST level 50 issues.<br>
Where warriors use: Jaded maces, jarsath trident, spined dragon claw. (9 dmg 18 dly, 11 dmg 22 dly, 10 dmg 21 dly).<br>
Their damage becomes very very comparable to monks then.<br>
While monks, have their ubber weapons to keep up with kunark mobs, dropping once in a FULL FULL FULL moon.<br>
<br>
Your next point:<br>
&quot;Man you argument about us having more hp is not well thought out. MOBS at higher level dish out insane damage, the key of survival is to kill them quick. The extra HP will keep me alive a little longer.&quot; &quot;<br>
<br>
WHAT!! You're saying HP ISN&quot;T IMPORTANT? WHAT???<br>
Abashi performed some tests before if you read the monk thingie. Monks do 25% more damage fist wise compared to a warrior using yheskas at level 60. (Remember, level 60).<br>
SO let's see...you have double my HP. You have much better magic resist. You say that pathetic 25% more damage will matter against a kunark mob that has 10 K + hp????<br>
We all depend on nukes usually to kill down those crazy mobs. PERIOD. HP IS important. Complete healing is used on warriors, but rarely on monks! (at higher levels)<br>
<br>
Your final point which i agreed:<br>
&quot;Mend and FD are HUGE benefits. Try to live without them for a week and them come back and talk to me. Also bind wound is caped for warriors until 50+, which is a huge drag.&quot;<br>
Yes, i have always said MEND and FD are great! But not as important as not having a dominant role in a group (besides puller that is). I HAVE played my warrior to level 29 now. I have played necromancers to level 46. I have played my friend's level 60 cleric. I have played my level 51 paladin friend. I know how it feels like without mend and FD. I know it's a great skill. HOWEVER, i would GIVE IT UP to have a dominant role in groups (If they ever nerf fd pulling). <br>
ANd monks for bind wound is also capped until level 50+. I don't see your point. = P<br>
==========================================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Next!<br>
==========================================================<br>
Jaikar:<br>
&quot;Me thinks monks complain cuz they're sissies who are jealous o' me Might...&quot;<br>
Oh absolutely you piece of hunk! hehhee.<br>
You're just jealous i got the bondage look and all the females go around me cause they want to be dominated.<br>
hahahahaha.<br>
<br>
But seriously, we're mainly for feign pull post level 50. I wish they would've said that earlier in the manual or something.-unless you have those ubber weapons.<br>
I really hate to dissappoint young monks that come and say to me, <br>
&quot;WOW you must be a superb damage dealer! I can't wait to be like you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then i go:<br>
&quot;I usually just spend the days pulling for my group...rogues do more damage than me, and warriors do comparable damage unless i manage to ever get those ubberly rare weapons for monks.&quot;<br>
<br>
===========================================================<br>
To splaktar:<br>
<br>
Those superbly equipped monks don't have anything to complain about. Because they're the ubber group.<br>
They have everything, there is to have. <br>
I am referring to the other normal monks like me in the level 50 to 60 area.<br>
The rakusha cloak you talked about? Well there's 4 in karana. i've gone on hate raids and killed innoruuk about 12 times now. Not a single one has dropped.<br>
As for your weapons, just go for a jaded mace, jarsath trident, or a spined dragon claw. = P<br>
==========================================================<br>
<br>
To vanzant:<br>
<br>
You are level 52. You have 864 AC, 1900 hp, FBSS, 11 dmg 25 dly in primary, 17 dmg 39 dly in secondary.<br>
<br>
The level 39 monk has: 740 ac?, 1250 hp, fbss?, 14 dmg 28 dly in primary, 14 dmg 28 dly in secondary.<br>
<br>
you're telling me he took your HP down by : 1520?<br>
Before you managed to take off his 1250 hp?<br>
I'm sorry man, but that just plain doesn't make any sense at all. I don't know what to say. <br>
<br>
The results imply that levels don't matter when you duel.<br>
<br>
Stat wise, by just LOOKING at that, it would seem to everyone that you would beat him by at least 3 bubbles of health left.<br>
perhaps it was an off day? I don't know. try duelling him again and log your results. I'll have to see the results to believe it.<br>
===========================================================<br>
<br>
To Athas:<br>
I quote:<br>
&quot;oh for god's sakes man, this game is not a damn career, you picked a monk because the thought of being one appealed to you. maybe you didn't get what you wanted, but neither did everyone else. when i started this game, i expected that at higher levels killing giants would be a simple feat, and to be honest, i wont be able to solo a giant till im very deep in planar gear.&quot;<br>
<br>
? <br>
I started so manyyyy other different classes. Did you not read my first line when i posted? = P<br>
<br>
And i still can't solo a hill giant btw unless it's green and doesn't wield a weapon.<br>
<br>
I quote:<br>
&quot;getting into the stat details ruins the game. nothing is worse then someone comparing numbers. &quot;<br>
Ummm....... So you're saying:<br>
&quot;I choose you because verant says you're the damage master!&quot;<br>
Wizard replies &quot;OH yes! I Do the most damage of any other classes! Verant said so!&quot;<br>
While the magician with it's pet quad hits for 58 consistently and he nukes almost as well as the wizard. = P<br>
Man...we need to compare the numbers. WHY?<br>
Because sometimes verant is WRONG. Why are they wrong? Because theory wise, it is easy to implement something and say it will go well. However, in reality, there's something called &quot;randomity&quot; and &quot;misjudgements&quot;, which prevents things from working out as well as they predicted. <br>
<br>
And another point you made:<br>
&quot;anyway, to be honest, monks have their purpose in everquest. vanzant said it, some things are done so much easier with monks. sometimes i have problems taunting off a monk. to win a duel against a monk i have to manuver like a ReaperBot in quake. &quot;<br>
<br>
Definitely. Monks are pullers. Period. That's their purpose. <br>
Why doesn't verant put it in the manual that says &quot; You're a puller for groups, unless you manage to be the 1 to 2 percent of the monk population that gets the ubber weapons, then you'll be a damage dealer&quot;. <br>
Let's see how many monks will be running around everquest? = P<br>
<br>
And if you have problems taunting off a monk, i'll have to see your equipment before i can make a comment. = )<br>
<br>
Your last comment:<br>
&quot;don't be so downcast. it's a game, try to make the best of it. if not, seek another game that suits your gameplay, plain and simple bro&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh i do! That's why i play so many other classes! I make so many friends. I go to commons and go shopping all the time! If i spend so much time in everquest, i might as well make it a happy time!<br>
I'm not exactly whinning about my class, or saying the grass is greener on the other side. I'm coming out with &quot;Look, verant promised us this, and it's really not this. It only applies to 1 to 2 percent of the monks (damage dealers at higher levels). The rest of us will become pullers.&quot;<br>
=========================================================<br>
<br>
ANd finally!<br>
To Rimlaol:<br>
<br>
&quot;Me tink dat joo monks whine too much , me warrior have hard time killing tings cause joo monks iz faster den uz warrior's. &quot;<br>
Well...try putting yourself in my shoes. Verant promises you to be a damage dealer, and you are until at level 50+, you barely do 10% more damage than the warrior unless you get some ubber weapon. <br>
Monks are faster? Of course if they have those kunark weapons.<br>
Warriors are equally fast? Of course if they have those kunark weapons. Remember, you are using TWO yheskas.<br>
8 dmg 24 dly weapons.<br>
Monks can buy the fighting baton:<br>
8 dmg 20 dly.<br>
For almost as much as the yheska. OF course at your level monks will do more damage than you. I'm talking about post level 50 issues when warriors get:<br>
Jaded mace: 9 dmg 18 dly<br>
Jarsath trident : 11 dmg 22 dly<br>
Spined dragon claw: 10 dmg 21 dly<br>
<br>
If you are a monk at around that level, and you see warriors doing close to your damage, and they have twice your HP, and have more AC (due to cobalt and indicolite), rogues have more AC than you and deal MUCH MUCH MORE damage, you will want to voice your opinion too.<br>
<br>
Your next point:<br>
&quot;Me not know why joo complain , joo have a fast time healing den uz warrior's also. Me tink dat Half elf guy who made dis web page is right , joo monks got it easier den any udder classes, so stop joo cryin!!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Heal faster? yes. Mend. I agree. Why do i complain? because of the above points i said.<br>
Monks got it easier than any other classes? ROFL<br>
The hardest in my opinion is a paladin and shadowknight. The easiest is the necromancer and druid.<br>
If you mean MELEE class wise, between warriors, monks, and rogues?<br>
Then yes, i would say that a TWINKED monk will have an easier time SOLOING.<br>
A TWINKED warrior will have an easier time SOLOING than a rogue.<br>
Remember, SOLOING only. Not for grouping.<br>
<br>
I quote:<br>
&quot;Me use yaks and still almost lose to a monk me AC is around 600 to 700 too so splain dat .... &quot;<br>
<br>
You do not tell me what level you are, you do not tell me what level the monk is. you do not tell me what weapons the monk is using. You do not tell me how much AC the monk has.<br>
...........<br>
I beat a level 60 warrior with my level 40 monk.<br>
*Guess how? the warrior was naked in the arena!*<br>
= P<br>
Well you get my point. heheheheh.<br>
=========================================================<br>
<br>
Alrighty, it's good to hear your opinions guys. <br>
I'm not exactly the person who just whines about &quot;Oh my class is underpowered. I wanna be like necros&quot;.<br>
I make good solid arguments and points. And i have played many other classes. I am just telling you WHY so many monks are unhappy with their classes at level 50 to 60. And it's a very very valid and reasonable argument.<br>
Thanks for your time.<br>

I've camped the jade mace and trident for a good 100+ hours <br>

half the other melee races so there's a lot of competition for them.<br>
There are a LOT of monk only weapons in kunark, certainly more<br>
and better than warrior's....<br>

a rakusha cloak, once he dropped 2 bloodmoons, and wiz wand,<br>
also once dropped 2 paladin shields...least they aren't as rare<br>

I can't believe things will change when I get to 50+.  Right now monks outdamage me by a good amount.  I would love if it were true but I don't think it will be true.  I read several messages about 50+ warriors saying monks outdamages them by a good amount.  Your AC is similar to warrior, your dodge is higher than warrior.  And your bind wound is not caped to 100 until 50.  Ask any monk above 30, what their bind wound skill is?  Again I stress this point, monks can solo mobs, I cannot.<br>
<br>
You are way wrong on the monk weapons.  Batons 8/20 1kpp, I sold them myself.  You can start camping them at 29 in Dalnir.  To get an equivalent weapon I have to go to Karnor's 46+ zone like the dwarven sap (I am a dwarf).<br>
<br>
But the above is not the issue, is it?  The issue is usefullness in groups?  Warrior's have a primary, get beat on until mob is killed.  Monks, primary, pullers.  Both equaly important.<br>
Secondary for both damage.  Monks do more damage.  In my book, you are ahead.  But you want to your primary to be damage, well let me tell you a little secret.  So do I!  Mobs at higher levels have some insane HP, I hate to be nickel and diming until a casters kill them.  I think Melee classes need a small upgrade on their damage at higher levels.<br>
<br>
Please play your warrior past 35, and come back and talk to us again.  I think Monks and Warriors are balanced with the monk ahead.<br>

ANyways, heheh.<br>
Rebuttal time:<br>
<br>
==========================================================<br>
To splaktar:<br>
I quote<br>
&quot;Laugh, yeah right, like I haven't spent time camping them...<br>
I've camped the jade mace and trident for a good 100+ hours <br>
each and never seen one drop, only saw cobalt gloves drop which a cleric won the roll on.....bs...&quot;<br>
I know how ya feel...camping long hours, then having something drop and some other class gets it. = (<br>
Realise that i never said warrior weapons were easy enough for everyone to get. Realise that i never said monk weapons were easy enough for everyone to get.<br>
That doesn't mean that there's only 4 or 5 of them in your server. If you see them go on the bazaar every weekend, you should probably buy it instead of camping for it.<br>
What about monks? Post level 50 weapons that we require to keep up: Tranquil staff, runed fighter staff, peacemaker staff (Trakanon's guards), ton po's staff (trakanon).<br>
Have you even SEEN any of these go for sale? Have you tried counting the number of ppl on your server that has these?<br>
<br>
The last runed fighter staff traded for: Spined dragon claw, heiro's cloak, and a rod of mourning.<br>
I offered: Crown of king tranix, iksar ceremonial bp, and a jarsath trident. For some reason, the fellow picked the previous offer over mine. *Grumbles*<br>
<br>
Anyways, you see my point. It's very very rare..and expensive. Wayyyy more expensive than warrior weapons.<br>
<br>
I quote another:<br>
&quot;Just don't act like warrior items are<br>
easy to get, usually the are usuable by rangers, paladins, and half the other melee races so there's a lot of competition for them. There are a LOT of monk only weapons in kunark, certainly more and better than warrior's....&quot;<br>
<br>
Point 1:<br>
HRMMM....I never said warrior items were easy to get. <br>
Point 2: <br>
I never said monk weapons were easy to get.<br>
<br>
You still have to put effort in camping if you want these items.<br>
Now...let me LIST out what monks only weapons there are:<br>
Runed fighter staff, wu's trance stick, fighting batons, ton po's staff, tranquil staff, cane of harmony, cane of tranquil, essence of dol,knuckle dusters, wu's tranquil fist, adamantite bo staff, peacebringer,sage battle staff,wu's quivering staff,bo stick.<br>
Those are the MONK ONLY weapons.Total: 15.<br>
<br>
List of warrior only weapons :<br>
Jarsath trident, fist of zek,ashenbone hammer,sarnak battlestaff,truncheon of doom,earthenblade, felhammer,monsoon,sunderfury, executioner's axe,amy tendril, bloodfire, jagged long sword,kunzar,goblin stone dagger,kylong war dagger,shimmering partisan,vilk's dark defender,xalgozian fang.<br>
Those are the WARRIOR ONLY weapons. Total:19.<br>
Do not forget, you have A LOT A LOT A LOT more weapons that you share with other classes.<br>
I got all this info from the eqlizer website.<br>
Go ahead and check it out. : <br>

To Surgius:<br>
I quote:<br>
&quot;I can't believe things will change when I get to 50+. Right now monks outdamage me by a good amount. I would love if it were true but I don't think it will be true.&quot;<br>
Oh believe it. It's true. I have a friend on karana, level 60 warrior, sithgear. Go talk to him. Ask him about what he thinks.<br>
Monks have the reign of the melee title at level 40 to 50.<br>
Warriors have the reign at level 55 to 60.<br>
During the 51 to 54, it's hard to conceive who is better. But it's about even. (better as in not damage dealing, but overall effectiveness)<br>
<br>
I quote:<br>
&quot;I read several messages about 50+ warriors saying monks outdamages them by a good amount. Your AC is similar to warrior, your dodge is higher than warrior. And your bind wound is not caped to 100 until 50. Ask any monk above 30, what their bind wound skill is? Again I stress this point, monks can solo mobs, I cannot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Monks outdamages them by a good amount? Define good. 10 percent? 20 percent? 50 percent? <br>
Look at the weapons: If you're using a 9 dmg 18 dly in both hands for a warrior, versus a monk with 9 dmg 18 dly in primary and 17 dmg 28 dly in secondary for a monk, how much difference can there be? (lower dly weapons do more damage),<br>
Do you realise that FLYING KICK does less than 5 percent of a monk's overall damage at higher levels?<br>
Do some log parsers if you have a high level monk.<br>
<br>
AC being similiar to warriors? Yes, at level 35 to 50. Even higher at times. We have half your hps! <br>
However, i STRESS, again post level 50, you will have more AC, rogues will have MORE AC, shadowknights will have more AC, paladins will have MORE AC.<br>
<br>
Bind wounds cap ISN&quot;T IMPORTANT! Grrrr. You won't use it until you have reached level 51, and you can bindwound up to 70 % of your hp.(Unless you're a solo type of person, then you should just go play a monk instead.)<br>
<br>
Monks can solo mobs you cannot?...That's at level 35 to 50.<br>
I am talking about level 50 to 60. <br>
I am a level 51 monk, and i cannot even kill a level 40 trashyard mob in kunark *outside karnor* by myself without heals or buffs.<br>
I can't SOLO ANything AT ALL!!!<br>
You can! Get the truncheon of doom, it proc's a debuffing slow. And you can solo kunark mobs!<br>
<br>
*Ahems,anyways, i dont' think soloing is an important point for melee classes*<br>
<br>
I quote:<br>
&quot;You are way wrong on the monk weapons. Batons 8/20 1kpp, I sold them myself. You can start camping them at 29 in Dalnir. To get an equivalent weapon I have to go to Karnor's 46+ zone like the dwarven sap (I am a dwarf).&quot;<br>
<br>
? I never said you warriors will get better weapons than monks before level 50 or even after 50. I have always STRESSED on POST 50 when you will get those great ratio weapons i mentioned, and then become COMPARABLE to monks. And monks will have their great ratio weapons drop once in a full moon!<br>
<br>
I quote:<br>
&quot;But the above is not the issue, is it? The issue is usefullness in groups? Warrior's have a primary, get beat on until mob is killed. Monks, primary, pullers. Both equaly important.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, the primary issue is usefulness in a group. Now...monk's job is to pull. MOST ppl who start their monks do NOT think that way. That is why a lot of us are unhappy. AND verant also disapproves of feign pulling!<br>
IF they had stated in the manual &quot;MONKS are pullers, great damage dealers if they have some ubberrrrrrrly rare weapon, or else they'll do 10% more damage than a warrior post level 50&quot;, let's see how many monks you'll have.<br>
<br>
I quote:<br>
&quot;Secondary for both damage. Monks do more damage. In my book, you are ahead. But you want to your primary to be damage, well let me tell you a little secret. So do I! Mobs at higher levels have some insane HP, I hate to be nickel and diming until a casters kill them. I think Melee classes need a small upgrade on their damage at higher levels.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, our secondary role is damage. No doubt about that.<br>
Monks do more damage, yes, no doubt. But not to a significant enough damage degree of having penalties like:<br>
<br>
1) Having a weight limit of 15.<br>
2) Having half the hps of a warrior.<br>
3) Having pathetic resist equipment.<br>
4) Unable to stun.<br>
5) Lowest AC among rogues and warriors.<br>
6) Does a little more damage than warriors unless they have some ubber weapon.<br>
7) Having NO NEW KUNARK ARMOR SET!!! GEeez.<br>
<br>
Mend and feign death is always great. No doubt about that. I never forget those two skills when i voice the troubles with the monk class. but those two skills cannot justify for a monk doing only about 10% more damage than a warrior post level 50 , unless they have some UBBERRRR rare weapon.<br>
<br>
I quote:<br>
&quot;Please play your warrior past 35, and come back and talk to us again. I think Monks and Warriors are balanced with the monk ahead.&quot;<br>
WHAT? I don't have any credibility because i have played a 51 monk? I have watched warriors repeatedly in my group?<br>
I have gone to fear, hate, sky, done naggy, venril, vox, the new dragons, noble dojorn, and countless other super mobs? <br>
I Don't have any credibility because i play:<br>
level 60 cleric, level 46 necro, level 51 paladin, level 25 druid, level 30 warrior?<br>
<br>
WHAT????!!!???!!!<br>
MAN, that last line really pissed me off. <br>
AS IF i don't learn by watching! <br>
<br>
Why don't i say this to you?:<br>
&quot;Play a monk till level 60, then come back and tell me if it's balanced.&quot;<br>
Would that piss you off? Yes. <br>
Did your comment piss me off? YES. <br>
<br>
Now don't go telling me i don't know nuts about a warrior. I might not have a level 50+ warrior, but that doesn't mean i don't know what a level 50+ warrior is capable of, can use and equip himself, how rare the items for them drop.<br>
<br>
Don't go telling me i don't know how to use a high level warrior in a group, because i haven't played one. Because, watching a warrior for over 50+ days played , doesn't mean you'll be able to learn anything useful about him.<br>
DUH.<br>
Go watch a monk feign pull. You'll get it by watching him for 2 minutes.<br>
<br>
*Sorry, i get a little pissed off when ppl tell me i don't know anything about the class that  i'm debating about&quot;<br>
==========================================================<br>
<br>
To tubolard:<br>
&quot;*covers his ears and shouts* &quot; shuddaps, me no kare iffin yu git yur arsed kiked by koonark mobs. jus dont let dat blud squirt on me shiney armors or me kik yur arse &quot;<br>
<br>
I love you too darling.<br>
<br>
===========================================================<br>
<br>
To athas:<br>
&quot;btw it's not just about the weapons  i can't compare my lame slam to a dragon kick or whatever you calls it...yee gods... &quot;<br>
<br>
As i said, it only accounts for less than 5 % of a monk's overall damage output. That is why monks want a minimum flying kick damage because it still does 3 damage at level 60. It's really not as good as you think it is.<br>
ASK monks, would they give up flying kick for slam?<br>
I WOULD. WHY? <br>
Because you STUN with slam. You interupt casters.<br>
Go and ask a few higher level monks. Some won't give it up, but a good number like me would LOVE slam instead of flying kick.<br>
<br>
===========================================================<br>
<br>
To emrald warrior:<br>
<br>
I can still kick your butt at level 51.(if you're my level) = P<br>
Bring it on!!!<br>
<br>

Anyways, that's all for this time. <br>
