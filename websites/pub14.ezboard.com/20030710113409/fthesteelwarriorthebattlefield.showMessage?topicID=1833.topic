Dwarves: start indiff, source of the coldain rings (9th and 10th have nice stats), and source of the shawls (very nice for casters).  The armor quested from them is the lowest of the 3 factions, but is also the easiest to get.  The drops come from Kael (giant city).  Though it's the lowest of the armors, it's still usually very good for people low 50's and even into the 60's if they don't have a guild that can do Temple of Veeshan.  Dwarves hate the giants, and don't care at all about the dragons.  Nothing done to dwarves will effect dragon factions, nothing done to dragons will effect dwarf factions.<br>
<br>
Giants: unless you worship rallos zek, you start kos.  There are 3 giant factions - Kromrif (hate the dwarves most of all), Kromzek (hate the dragons most of all), and King Tormax.  The armor quested from the giants comes from the Zek giants, and the main drops come from Temple of Veeshan, west wing.  The armor has the highest ac of all velious factions.<br>
<br>
Dragons: everyone starts kos.  Unless you get a faction hit from Vindi, Statue, or AoW, you will have to spend a long while in Kael killing giants to get non kos.  The armor quested from them have the best stats of the velious factions.  The main drops for the armor come from Halls of Testing in Temple of Veeshan (east wing).<br>
<br>
My suggestion, kill giants, get the drops to turn in to Thurgadin (dwarf city).  The coldain rings are very nice, the 8th gives an instant click 8 point damage shield, the 9th has good stats and the same effect, the 10th requires a fairly bigger guild to complete, but gives very nice stats.  After you've worked on Thurg armor and rings (and shawls for casters), then it's the time to pick giants or dragons.  By the time that happens, and you need to choose between the two, you will most likely know which one fits you better. <p>Veteran Overdorf <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18306">Hussar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Kneeslicer - Drunken Tsunami</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dobbobaggins>Dobbo Baggins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/9/03 10:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Velious faction questions</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>you will have to spend a long while in Kael killing giants to get non kos<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> that is a big understatement. today half a ring war 4 arena raids 3 sk guilds. warmly or kindly can't remember. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=1ludor>1Ludor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/10/03 12:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Velious faction questions</span><hr size=1> many dragons in WW are one group doable, above the ntov scar off to the left along the coastline is the best camp spot. easy farming for frostbringers and dragon armor. most dispel one buff at a time and someone needs to watch for roamers.<br>
<br>
farming armor items depends alot on your diety and pp, all the armor out of ntov is inferior to diety class armor. most ppl will want to farm dragon armor since its better for all classes EXCEPT warriors = ( , if u got diety armor u wont care either way. you will need to fix faction with dragons by killing mobs in kael, higher lvl mobs give more faction. easier to get to and kill for east tov(dragon) armor too, plus 1-2 groups killing dozekar now for some of the best items in the game.<br>
<br>
the ONLY reason to be on giant faction is for the tormax's quests of killing the dorf and dragon kings, both require 25-35 ppl to kill at least. u could do warrior quest armor too, but i doubt that will happen. vindicator, statue, and tormax are 3-5 group kills anyways for easy good loot.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=577575&amp;resize=true" target="top">Ludor Sheolbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I done this guide a while back as I was moving from faction from Dwarfs to Giants.  Once you have ally to giant faction the armour is alot better (warriors normally have HoT armour, skyshine) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khallimbloodhelm>KhallimBloodhelm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/11/03 12:42 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.ptd.net/~twyst/images/ra.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Velious faction questions</span><hr size=1> It really depends on your guild.  If you're in a guild that just starting out in Velious and isn't very high in level (I.e. most in 40's, 50's, maybe a few 60+)  You are probably gonna start out on Dwarf Faction, since you are already non KOS and their armor is the easiest to get.  So you start out by having Kael Arena or Platehouse raids.  I think, if I remember correctly, it took me about 4 or 5 Kael Arena raids before I was high amiable, or ally.  You can turn in armor at High Amiable.  So do that, and make sure to get ur guild to go to the Platehouse, where you can get 6-10 plate drops in a night.  <br>
<br>
Once you have either moved beyond the difficulty of Kael, or are completely outfitted in Thurg armor, then comes your next step.  You actually begin this step while getting armor from Thurg.  When you kill in Kael, lots of Giant Warrior Helmets will drop.  You collect these as you raid Kael.  Also, while you are raiding Kael, your faction with the Dragons will have started to go up.  As soon as you have reached non-KOS (dubious) faction with the dragons, head into Skyshrine and turn in those giant helmets to Gaurdian Enots, I think, who is right at the gate inside SS, near the WL entrance.  This will gain you dragon faction that you need.  <br>
<br>
Once your guild has moved beyond Thurg armor, you will hopefully be ready to move on to Skyshrine armor.  This is the natural progression.  You will then begin fighting in the Halls of Testing, in Temple of Veeshan.  These mobs are all drakes and wurms, but they are anti-dragon faction wurms.  Meaning when u kill them, you gain dragon faction.  HoT is like a testing ground the dragons assembled for their would-be-allies, trapping all sorts of wild wurms and drakes in there for you to kill.  These mobs will drop armor, and at a much better rate than the Kael giants.  After turning in lots of helmets and fighting in HoT for a while, you should become maxed ally to the dragons, and you can then begin to get Skyshrine (Myrmidon's) armor.  <br>
<br>
After your guild has outgrown the Halls of Testing, and has outfitted most of its people with Skyshrine armor, its probably time to switch factions again.  This is the hardest of the faction changes.  You will move into West ToV and start killing CoV faction wurms and named dragons, who drop Kael armor peices.  You may not be able to kill some of the named dragons there yet, like Liendara the Keeper or Telkoranar or Gozzrem, but if you wait for a higher guild to clear them, you can then farm the armor from the trash pops.  <br>
<br>
It will take you quite a while to get your faction up in Kael, and the only real way to do it is this.  Keep killing in WToV whenever possible, and start killing Coldain Wolfmasters in GD.  These drop Coldain heads.  Get lots and lots of Coldain heads.  It takes between 50 and 100 coldain heads to get ally faction with the Zek giants.  While killing in WToV and killing lots of Wolfmasters (heads drop off 1 in 7 wolfmasters, approx), hopefully by the time you have 100 heads, you will be dubious to the Giants.  going from max KOS to Dubious is the hardest of the faction jumps.  <br>
<br>
You only need to be ally to the Zek giants, and you will be ally to them first, because the Dragon kills give Zek faction, but not Rif or Tmax Faction.  Dwarves give both rif and Zek when u kill them.  Zek giants have no beards, and wear what look like buckets on their heads, and plate armor.  Rif giants have long white or grey beards and hair.  You can hand in coldain heads to two giants in Kael.  A Kromrif Recruiter, who is non aggro, perma rooted mob next to the EW zoneline in Kael, and Captain Bvellos, who is upper 50's in level and lives in the bank building in central Kael.  <br>
<br>
Bvellos is on Zek faction, Recruiter is on Rif.  Bvellos gives better faction hits when u turn in heads, and also gives Tmax faction hits, but you MUST be dubious or above to turn in heads to him, or he will kill you.  The Kromrif Recruiter, however, you can do while still KOS.  Just bring someone who can cast invis with you.  Open the trade window with the recruiter, he is non aggro and won't attack you, put the heads in, and have ur friend invis you.  Then hit trade.  repeat this for every 4 heads until you are dubious to the Zek giants.  (you will have to run and check periodically.)  Then start giving your heads to Bvellos.  It took me 50 heads to Bvellos to go from dubious to max ally with Zek giants.  I am still threatening to Rif giants right now.  <br>
<br>
Now you are ally to Zek and can turn in your armor, but the quest armor giant is in a room behind Tormax's throne room in the south end of the zone.  You MUST be either non KOS to rif giants, or invis, to do this.  I would recommend being invis, anyways, unless you are non KOS to Tormax.  Tormax is not often up, but he has two or three gaurds that are on his faction that are in the throne room you have to go through, and they see invis.  Go south past the bank, along a ridge, invis yourself, go over the ice bridge, and take either the left or right door into the throne room.  Hug the wall really tight, and move your way around to the back of the throne room, and through the door there, in order to avoid aggroing Tmax's see invis gaurds.  Quest mob is named thunderforge.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and for Tmax faction, only 3 things give positive hits, to my knowledge.  Killing Dain in Icewell, killing Yelinak in Skyshrine, and handing in dorf heads, which takes forever. You need Tormax faction to do the quests involving Yelinak's and Dain's heads, which give Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying and Belt of Dwarf Slaying.   <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-family:copperplate gothic light;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>They come like sacrifices in their trim, <br>
