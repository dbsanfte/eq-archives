They didn't actually fix anything. Your mitigation will still softcap, and you will still have other classes tanking as well as a warrior, becuase they chose to patch the symptom, rather than fix the problem.<br>
<br>
They hoped this would distract you and that you wouldn't notice that you weren't actually fixed.... They were right.<br>
<br>
The only difference today compaired to yesterday, is yesterday you had a large Monk community supporting VI fixing Warriors, with the consensus in the whole community being that Warriors were badly broke... today you don't... today you're simply left competing with the Knights... you lost an ally, not an enemy.<br>

While a (admittedly sizeable) minority of the Warrior community is reacting with glee to the nerf on monks, most of us are not.<br>
<br>
If the Monk community somehow feels that Warriors did this to them, they are sadly mistaken.  Read the message from the development team, especially the part where they said that they (the development team) messed up.  VI felt that monks were overpowered relative to the other melee classes.  I can't say that I really disagree with them although I wish they had found a different way to handle the issues of monks being overpowered.<br>
<br>
If you and any other Monks want to scream at the Warrior community for your loss of power, that's your business.  Of course it's not going to do you any good since all of us folks here on Steel Warrior don't actually change the game, VI does. <p>Hyardgune Varangian <BR> 58 Ogre Myrmidon of Gathered Might <BR> Solusek Ro</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 461<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 8:59:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1373.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Good patch</span><hr size=1> If you're flying on an airplane and notice cracks in the wings, are you responsible for the delay of the flight when you bring it to the flight crew's attention?  Should you have kept your mouth shut and just continued flying?  Are you to blame when the Airline cancels that flight and disorders a lot of people's lives by rerouting them to different flights?  Who is really responsible here?<br>
<br>
The Airline is ultimately responsible.  The care of their airplanes is their reponsibility.  Just as the care of EQ is the responsibility of Verant.  If some individuals who play the game point out some cracks in the wings, is it really their fault how Verant decides to correct the problem?<br>
<br>
We the Warrior community came up with literally dozens upon dozens of ideas of how the situation could be addressed.  We discussed these ideas into the ground, tearing them apart in every conceivable fashion.  And when all is said and done Verant decides the best fix is to nerf Monks.  Warriors didn't decide this, not at all.  In fact the consensus was pretty universally that an upgrade to plate melee was more in order.  Verant made the decision, for their reasons.  Will it really 'fix' Warriors?  No, not really.<br>
<br>
But it will put the status quo back into a more sensible order.  It is going to be tough for the Monks, it is going to take some getting used to.  But given how tenacious and clever the best Monks are, I'm sure they'll work through it or around it.  And we don't even know how bad its going to be yet, do we?<br>
<br>
So please don't feel you should blame the Warrior community for this.  Verant does what Verant does.  The best we can do is ponder their thought process and walk away baffled.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 867<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 1:37:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1373.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re-cap time</span><hr size=1> So...<br>

They changed monks so as they were hit harder but less often ( via test server reports ) allowing frogs spiders and shrooms to die as easy as they did with a no go on extended raid tanking. Pulling might get harder or easier depending on how much they actually changed. Other changes to defense are on test as well atm.<br>
<br>
Manaburn will no longer stack, allowing for shorter fights in PoP without making them 6 seconds. TMB was simply a scapegoat on this.<br>
<br>
Complete Heal was capped, possibly too allow for healing upgrades or to increase the value of relative high hp totals. Being able to take a full cheal and not waste mana is a good thing with the next change.<br>
<br>
Mod Rods were rationed to make the value of mana, and thusly DPS and tanking more important. Mages need a new power because of this change though. This may hurt Wizards unless they can manage to make fights short enough to use high damage spells or just long enough to pepper mobs with a few good ratio ones.<br>

<br>
Wizzies - As it's been said...bound to happen. The AA in and of itself isn't overpowering considering how often it can be cast in it's current state. Where the problem lay was with greed and groups of wizards getting together to take the fun away from others. This wasn't all MB wizards, but it was enough to pretty much halt Epic progress for those needing white and green scales on many servers unless you had access to upwards of 100k plat in some cases. Personally, I don't think the solution they came up with is the best one. I think it would have been better to put a floor on how many hitpoint the mob had before you could us MB on it. That way, MB would still be usable on the truly high level encounters, but would keep you from taking out the kunark dragons. Say somewhere in the nieghborhood of 300 to 400k and below, the spell would work with the dot component they are adding, and then anything over 400k hp's it would work as it has in the past. With the changes to the mod rods, this would keep the high damage up there and still keep the need to conserve mana up there. As it stands now, with the change, mana burn will really no longer be worth the points spent in it. With the current level 60 spells, a wizard can do as much or more damage by just using their normal spells than they can wasting all their mana in one shot over the same amount of time (you'll have to ask a wizard about this...wasn't taking notes when the guildmember that explained it to me last night made this assertion and backed it up with numbers from how much damage he did on the last raid we had).<br>
<br>
Monks - well...noone wants to see a character class nerfed, but I have to agree with the assessment that to raise all the other classes to where they should be, especially Warriors, they would end up having to change too many encounters. I really don't think this is going to effect too much from the monk playstyle other than in solo abilities, and quite frankly, as a warrior, I have zero sympathy for someone who whines because they can't solo...welcome to my world. The whole idea that the magic pajamas protect monks doesn't hold water with me either...plate classes are wearing a magic buick, and that should still out protect the pj's. I still think there is too close a margin between knights and warriors, but with some of the things that are reported to be coming out with PoP, plus some of the inevitable changes with gear, i think we may again see a more clear division between the classes.<br>
<br>
The thing with the mages i'm going to have to agree on. I hate to, believe me...it's quite convenient for me to have basically unlimited healing available to me, as well as pretty much unlimited nuking from my casting classes on a raid. However, it really does take the skill level as a determining factor out of the equation in alot of cases. There is no need to conserve mana any more. I disagree that mages aren't doing anything but constantly summoning mod rods...that's only the case if you only have a couple of mages. Once you have at least 2, they are doing other things most of the time unless it's a truly large raid.<br>
<br>
The CH thing doesnt really bother me either for a couple of reasons. First of all, I have shammies and druids to make up for lack of healing should I ever manage to get over 7500hp and need more than the ch gives me. I'm not over that...i don't anticipate being over that for some time. Those who are over it are just going to have to use some tactics to overcome a healing shortfall. Darn...you'll have to think...what a biatch. There was no specific mention of a better heal than the current CH, but you don't have to be Steven Hawkings to see that there is a clear implication that they have at least though of offering something better in the future and and the very least want to leave room to do so.<br>
<br>
I think there are a few things here that I haven't seen any posts take into account that benefit melee classes indirectly. With the removal of the infinite mana pool, caster dps is going to come down more in line with that of the melee classes. In some cases, on the longer fights, it's going to become much more necessary for there to be melee. I think in the long run we're going to be needed more.<br>
<br>
Also...there was a comment made earlier with regards to the ch change that this was proof that Verant supports zerg tactics. I can't cite specifically where the information came from as I have been asked not to, but I did receive some reliable info yesterday that proves just the opposite. It has been rumored that there will be PoP zones where when you enter, you will have the zone to yourself, either through some sort of alternate zone views for differing raiding parites or a lockout for whoever tries to go in second. In addition to this, there will be encounters that will limit the numbers of raiders that can take on a particular mob. Added to this, current encounters that already exist will be retuned to reflect this as well. I don't have specific information about which mobs/zones where this retroactive retuning will occur, only that it will.<br>
<br>
There are some other things that will be revealed over the next couple of weeks prior to the release of PoP that are pretty sweeping changes. I can't say if they will be considered to be for the better or the worse, but they will be different and will require some major changes to the way some encounters are handled including mobs that can't be pulled, but have to have a dungeon crawl style of play to get to them. <br>
<br>
Alot of the information we received was very non specific but there were also some changes to warriors listed and it was mentioned that there was a recognized need for greater warrior damage mitigation and also, unfortunately, that the price of this was going to be lower damage. It was not mentioned what form this would take, but that it would happen.<br>
<br>
For what it's worth, we will find out within the next two weeks one way or the other. Many of the changes will be implemented through patches prior to the release of PoP so that final playtesting can be done to determine if any tuning needs to be done by the PoP release, so expect further major patches in the next couple of weeks.<br>
<br>
One final thing in the realm of pure speculation. I haven't seen or heard anything about there being a softcap increase even with the info I've gotten from someone involved in beta testing. However, there's alot of things that seem to indicate that it will be going up. The AC of the items in VT makes reaching the softcap painfully simple and exceeding it commonplace. In addition, Verant has said outright that PoP will have the best gear in the game by a good margin. The've also raised the maximum possible stat cap through the new AA's. All of this, when taken together, leads to a strong suggestion that the softcap will go away, or at the least, be raised, otherwise there really is nothing in the way of increases in armor that they could do with the exception of adding alot of effects. We're already breaching the softcap without buffs on a regular basis even without the top gear...Food for thought anyways.<br>

<br>
if that's true then they may have done almost nothing to change the balance.  So it would keep monks from being able to tank an uber mob as well because a round of high output dmg from said mob would be more likely to kill them.  But in every other situation, such as exp groups, they'd still do far more dmg, mitigate just as well, and avoid better than plate classes.  So they would continue to tank just as well or better than a warrior while pouring out dmg.  Nothing would change about that screwed up situation at all.<br>
<br>
I suspect versus at least some PoP mobs, the AC softcap will be considerably higher or virtually nonexistent AC softcap on the players.  If they keep handing out this high AC gear and as reported it will get even higher though, then any zone not in PoP will continue to be messed up.  With PoP, the rest of the plate wearers who haven't hit hte softcap in all prior expansions and most or all of the chain wearers who have it will get there.  So if they go anywhere but PoP, they will mitigate just like that uber tank with 1700 AC.  That's crap.  It's all speculation though, I guess. We won't know til the expansion has been out for awhile how it really gets implemented.<br>

How can they possibly lower warrior damage any more ?

I started EQ when SoL came out (or thereabout)<br>
<br>
There now you know my background...<br>
<br>
First of all id like to say thx for the many comments on the monkey nerf in here. I had expected much more glee at the fate monkeys may be facing.<br>
<br>
(From the sound of the trolls at the monkeyboards the entire Warrior community is pointing fingers and lauging at us... but i guess only the bad seeds ceased the opportunity to pour salt in the wounds of the monkeys.)<br>
<br>
I agree with what everyone in here says basically.<br>
<br>
It was warriors/plateclasses who neded to be fixed.. not monkeys nerfed. The monks that are disrupting the ballance as i see it are the monkeys with 1450 AC and 4000 HP un/selfbuffed, because as a non twink monkey that started from naked lvl 1, I can assure you i dont stand up very long against mobs that require a raid sized force to deal with.<br>
<br>
As for monkeys holding aggro.. well, heh our agro depend on our dmg output. Warrior losing aggro to us while taunting is just wrong. the Taunt skill needs to be looked at. For sure!<br>
<br>
Im not all too familiar with the game mechanics when it comes to actual AC influence vs exp mobs and raidmobs, but i get the feeling that decreasing monkey dmg mitigation and increasing the avoidance will allow for even better survival vs uber mobs, since the common monkey AC is just too low to make a difference anyway. (im at 1040 AC or there around) But time will tell as the patch is released.<br>
<br>
The monks fears as to what will happen to our &quot;survivability&quot; when pulling... Well many say VI never intended for mobs to be &quot;pulled&quot; in the firstplace.. so i guess its just in line with &quot;the vision&quot; that we will have a hardertime pulling... Ways to work around it will arise im sure... (tag-chain comes to mind... Will require a few more monkeys in a guild tho, but...)<br>
<br>
And last point. monkeys soloability. Im 59.. as stated before... and im just now beginning to be able to solo a lower HP spider in Velks.. (example) so im stoked im even killing mobs that con dark blue to me.<br>
<br>
Twinked out iksar monkeys with fungi shoudnt be the standard against what monkeys are meassured... Im human and i have neiter fungi nor any other from of regen. That said i think the &quot;common&quot; monkey will agree that soloing is limited.. and hard.<br>
<br>
I know warriors dont have mush chance to solo either unless in very good gear.<br>
That im my opinion is wrong. Im somewhat of a casual to commited player. I average 4 hrs per night id say.. more on weekends less on weeknights. sometime i dont have more than 1 hr to spend online, and id like to be able to log myc favourite char, be it Warr, monkey, rogue or druid, and just kill a few mobs and still feel that ive spent the hour advancing my character. As it stands now, the classes with lesser solo abilities may not even bother logging in for just an hr... that in my opinion is sad. <br>
<br>
Since EQ is a multiplayer online game scocializing and grouping with others should indeed be promoted, but not enforced. exp in groups should be better than solo, to reward ppl who work together, but it shouldnt be the only way to do it...<br>
<br>
That said, i hope that any &quot;solo-envy&quot; that may be directed towards monkeys may be lightened up a lil. Instead i think actions should be taken towards giving all classes some degree of soloability.<br>
<br>
-edit- I dont have my epic yet either...<br>
<br>
<br>
-If you keep tanking ill keep die trying to pull.<br>

Trust me, even though you cannot get hit for any less by adding more AC do to the softcap, you can still take quite alot more damage if you have less AC.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 10/11/02 10:45:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udirtynaddog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dirty nad dog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/11/02 10:51:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1373.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Good patch</span><hr size=1> I will go ahead &amp; post my thoughts on the Monk Nerf<br>
<br>
Prenerf - Endgame monks can &amp; will con't pull &amp; tank level 75 mobs better then Plate class.<br>
Postnerf - Endgame monks will con't to tank level 75 mobs better then before, SK will pull better due to pure ac loss.<br>
<br>
Plain &amp; simple - Avoidance is much more powerful then AC verses those mobs because of the insane attack ratio.  Even with 2k ac, Warrior would still get hit for max dmg a majority of the time even with defensive.  A monk with VT gear would prob like the increase avoidance for tanking, because they are leaps &amp; bounds over the soft cap.  <br>
<br>
Easy solution make AC matter, VI doesn't need to give Warrior a 240 dodge skill, (which doesn't make since for a plate class in my mind) just a make real difference with between an ac of 1300 &amp; 1600.  It is just that simple.  <br>
<br>
Monks die enough trying pull ToV, HoT etc, esp in those 55-60 level range with average gear learning the ropes<br>
<br>
Decreasing ac, will hurt 99% of us where it really counts, pulling &amp; splitting mobs for our guild/group plain &amp; simple. <br>
<br>
As far as soloing goes, not ever monk has a fungi/t-staff/cof &amp; other godly high end loot to play with, fix ac &amp; let us get back to our jobs<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you DIRTY ENOUGH?<br>

This was the slogan (and still remains) the main slogan on the warrior boards. You wanna do your job; fine. We've been wanting to do our jobs since late SoV/early SoL. We've had no dice (thanks 125hp all/all items, thanks ND-3 being available to everyone, with warriors getting no boon with it over any other class. Thanks PE being avail to almost all tank classes).<br>
