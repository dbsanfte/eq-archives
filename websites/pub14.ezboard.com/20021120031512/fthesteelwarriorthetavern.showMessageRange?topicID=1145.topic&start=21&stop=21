<br>
1. Taunt<br>
2. Mitigation<br>
3. Scalability<br>
4. Variety and Fun<br>
<br>
I still enjoy playing a warrior, but I am starting to look at other melee classes with some envy at their variety and versatility. Being the best there is at what we do was always the trade off versus other melee classes.<br>
<br>
1. In my opinion, Taunt is actually the wrong name for this aspect of game mechanics. The idea that an otherwise intelligent opponent, that is able to recognize the importance of a healer to the group, for instance, would stop bludgeoning him just because you insulted his parentage is kinda ridiculous. Taunt and Hate are the mechanism in the game meant to represent one fact: Melee classes will physically insert their bodies between the enemy and the more vulnerable members of the group. In EQ, players can get in each other's way, but if a mob wants to go through you to get to the wizard, he will. Perhaps it was due to the possible problems internet lag would cause or the size of a mob, or whatever, but early in the design process, they decided that it was impractical to allow players to position themselves to limit a mob's movement options.<br>
<br>
In a more realistic combat situation, the mob would choose to continue to fight the warrior instead of the cleric healing him because to ignore the warrior could be potentially deadly to him. The warrior stands in his face with sharp pointy things that he obviously knows how to use very well. For an intelligent mob to disregard such an obvious danger would require a threat even greater than having 3 feet of steel plunged into your back. That is what Taunt represents. Not insults, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  but the ability for the warrior to make himself seem the most deadly threat the mob is facing.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Others may actually do more damage, or cast spells that are more important to the mob's defeat that what the warrior is doing, but it knows that death awaits it on the edge of the warrior's weapons if it doesn't focus its attention on the warrior.<br>
<br>
In reality, all classes should get a bonus when attacking from behind, not just rogues, but again, such a game mechanic would have had to been accounted for from the beginning and technology was more limited 4 years ago that it is now. Also, they decided to streamline the combat system and sacrifice realism in favor of content, a decision I tend to agree with. A game doesn't have to be real to be fun.<br>
<br>
In the previous round of melee balancing, warriors were the 'standard' by which other classes' damage output was judged, with rogues and monks intended to be higher on the list. That's fine, I can accept that. To correct the problems with Taunt, Verant needs to use that principle again. Warriors would be the standard for the ability to generate Hate, and they should be on top. Area Taunt is nifty and all that, but it should not be considered to be nearly mandatory that a warrior gets that as soon as possible. It should be used as intended, an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Area</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> taunt. But because warriors have been having trouble with normal taunting, it is mainly used as a once-every-15min-guaranteed-taunt. I don't propose any nerfing of that skill, but I believe it shouldn't be necessary to use it in that manner.<br>
<br>
2. Warriors are supposed to be the most heavily armed and armored fighters in the game, with an ability to take punishment matched by no one. Two things have made this less true that it should be, if they haven't destroyed this idea entirely at the end game: AC 'soft' caps, top end gear available to virtually all melee classes.<br>
<br>
There has been some talk against monks because of these facts, since in some situations, they can 'tank' as well as a warrior and do more damage as they do it. I don't agree that that is the case for most players, even at lvl 60. The problem only shows up, to that extent, at the end game, when monks and other melees get armor such a huge step above what is available to casual players. My guild is pretty small, though most of us are long time players, with multiple 50+ characters, and several lvl 60's are active. Our highest lvl monk is 60, and has just about the best armor he can get with our guild. A dozen players online at prime time is about average, and we'd need a nearly full turn out to get 24 people together for a serious raid. (we are also short on cleric power) His AC is around 1135 unbuffed, while mine is nearly 1300. So, at our level of play, there is much less of a problem.<br>
<br>
At the end game, (something I have no personal experience with) the problem many warriors complain about is the AC soft caps. That other classes can reach the same mitigation levels as them, even though the warriors have higher AC. Many are calling for warriors to have such soft caps lifted and to be put on a higher mitigation table. This makes sense to me, especially as long as top-level gear is usable by multiple melee classes.<br>
<br>
3. Scalability refers to how much having multiple players of the same class on a raid adds to the quality of the raid force. More melee classes are almost always considered helpful on raids (except perhaps some ultra-high AC luclin encounters), but you only need a 2-3 warriors to be tanks in most situations, sometimes even 1 is enough. Beyond that, other classes can add more damage output and/or more special abilities. It is not as bad as it was for some caster classes (shaman and necros especially with their dots), but when trying to maximize a raid's efficiency, there is less benefit to having more than the minimum number of warriors needed, versus adding some other classes.<br>
<br>
I only have a couple ideas on what to do here, which aren't really enough, by themselves. One idea I had was to lower the refresh times on the offensive disciplines, especially Aggressive and Precision. These two disciplines are trade-off ones, where a warrior's damage output is increased at the expense of their ability to tank. Currently, those disciplines have refresh times around 30 min, and they last for 3 min. Also consider Mighty Strike (all successful hits are criticals, or crippling blows if beserk), which lasts for 8 seconds with a base refresh of 1 hour. It looks impressive, but is hardly practical with such a long refresh time. Another idea, that would mostly be fun, but would also add slightly to the power of the discipline, is for Aggressive to cause the warrior to go Beserk in addition to its other affects, regardless of his current HPs.<br>
<br>
4. Warriors give up a lot of versitility and special abilities to be the best tank. Monks and rogues do more damage in addition to their special abilities, and hybrids have their spells and special abilities. The only truly unique abilities a warrior gets: innate criticals and crippling blows while beserk, and the beserk effect itself. We rely completely on grouping, we have almost nothing to contribute that isn't tied to our equipment, and if we aren't the main tank, some encounters get pretty dull. Even so, being a warrior is what I want. I'd rather be the best at something that have that kind of versitility and be watered down in other areas to compensate. That's why my main two characters are a warrior and a wizard. One thing I'd like to have, is something . . . impressive. I'll admit that I'm envious, maybe even jealous of paladins with Slay Undead. I see those massive attacks for 3-4k hps against undead creatures and just think, 'Whoa! Dude!'  Then I get a critical with my kick for 32 pts and feel less manly &gt;&lt; . So, here's a couple things for warriors to show off with:<br>
<br>
a) When warriors invest in Combat Fury (maybe limit this to lvl 3 of the ability if worried about balance), all their critical hits will be for at least the maximum damage of a normal hit.<br>
<br>
b) My current understanding is that only the warrior sees the messages when they Flurry and Rampage. All players should see, 'Olav unleashes a Flurry of attacks!' and have it be filtered along with criticals if they want to reduce the spam. Also, I'm not sure how often Flurry activates at it's max level, but I would think that approximately as often as a warrior's innate chance to critical would be appropriate, if it is currently less than that.<br>
<br>
c) Personally, I don't like the way the Rampage AA works. The ability to trigger it manually means that you can maximize it's effect by making sure it only goes off when you have multiple mobs in range, and that's actually pretty good, but one rampage every 15 min doesn't sound that exciting unless you're actually in an AE group, which is rare for a warrior. I would think that a triggered ability, with a duration of a few minutes, that would have the warrior 'proc' Rampage, at least a few times during it's duration, would be more appropriate. The fact that it's random would balance out the additional damage.<br>
<br>
d) An idea I had regarding shields, which I sent in to the Dev. Corner, is for 1h weapons a warrior can use to get an additional Bane-type damage when a shield is equipped. Paladin/Shadow Knight only 1handers have much higher damage/delay ratios than anything available to a dual wielding class to help balance them versus 2hander damage. If a warrior is ever going to use a shield, he needs a similar bonus. To simplify the code, so you don't have to go through and modify every existing 1 hander, maybe just make it so this bonus is a fixed percentage of the weapon's base damage. I think 50% might be about right. So, a 15/20 top end one-hander would become 22/20 when using a shield. This may not be all that realistic, but it goes toward solving the problem that a warrior would almost never give up the extra damage of an off hand weapon to use a shield, even given the bonuses that appear to be in testing. It also allows some one-handed weapons that are good for dual wielding classes, but way too low in ratio for Knights, even though they are listed on the weapon, to desire those weapons.<br>
<br>
In the end, being a warrior is about focusing your talents in one specific area so that you can be the best possible at it. As Absor explained in a recent post to another class board, it's not about a 'Zero-sum' rule, where you have to give something to everyone, it's about a real deficiency in the Warrior class. Depending on the level of play (both character level and whether the player is at the end game or not), Warriors are either not ahead of other classes in their role as a tank or not enough ahead to justify the sacrifices we make in versitility and variety. Class balance is an extremely delicate thing in RPGs of all types, whether pencil and paper, or on the computer. I have confidence that Verant will eventually address our concerns. How far in the future it happens depends, at least partly, on our ability to give them useful feedback without the whining and class envy.<br>

P.S. Maxxian, Bandage wound actually sounds usefull. Once you hit 201+ skill (happens at lvl 57 for us), you start binding for around 80pts per bandage up to 70%. At lvl 3 of the Bandage wound, this would give you 120 pts per bandaid up to 100%. (since you need first aid 3 to get it). That is actually faster healing than invigorate BPs, though you would need to have tons of bandaids or a pocket magician. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193443" target="_blank">
