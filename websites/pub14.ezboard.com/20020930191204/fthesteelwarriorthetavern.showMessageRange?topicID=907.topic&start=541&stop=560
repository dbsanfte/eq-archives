<br>
I started playing in April of 2000.  I have been a contributor to the Paladins of Norrath site since October of 2000.  I was there when paladins could not get xp groups.  I saw it with my own eyes.  It is not a &quot;paladin mantra,&quot; it is people speaking the truth about their experiences.<br>
<br>
This being the internet, and an EZBoard forum, it is easy for people to be anonymous.  You have no way of verifying whether people are who they say they are.  You must make a choice (with obvious exceptions):  believe the posters, or do not believe the posters.  It does not make sense to believe those who post things you agree with, and disbelieve those whose posts you disagree with.  Expressing doubt that I was &quot;there&quot; seems pretty pointless to me.<br>
<br>
I do wish that the warriors who read my posts would understand that many paladins support the warrior crusade for improvements.  But I don't think you will ever get me or other paladins to agree to making warriors the undisputed best choice for tanking.  A group that has a paladin to tank for them should not be put in a position where they are hurting their &quot;bottom line&quot; by not dumping him and grabbing the first warrior LFG.<br>

EDIT: perhaps ironically, this entire argument really has no effect on me personally.  I group with my wife, we level very slowly, and we have a RL friend who plays a warrior 10 levels lower than my character, who groups with us most of the time.  Our warrior friend is a real contribution to our xp group, even being 10 levels lower than me, and when he isn't with us, we see a dramatic increase in downtime, to the point that some places are no longer feasible for xping. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A> at: 8/20/02 12:21:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uiskandaralazeem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iskandar Alazeem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of the Battlefield</BR>STEEL WARRIOR Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 722<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/20/02 12:23:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=542>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thoric, my friend</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A group that has a paladin to tank for them should not be put in a position where they are hurting their &quot;bottom line&quot; by not dumping him and grabbing the first warrior LFG<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Do Paladins seriously think that the reason that during mid Kunark they had trouble getting groups was the fault of warriors' HP/AC/Defensive advantage?<br>
<br>
I don't!<br>
<br>
I think the reason really was because they also brought very little else to a group to compensate.   The class was seriously broken, but it wasn't just because of the tanking advantage of warriors.  I tend to think that the melee damage output diference between warriors and Paladins at the time was SO great, that even a 2nd group slot was given to a non-tanking warrior over a Paladin.  They also had the mystique of the exp penalty, and their spells were relatively shallow as their manapool was so limited.<br>
<br>
I'd say that even if warriors were given a decided tanking advantage over a paladin these days, which I don't necessarily see as an awesome thing, as balance is key, I STILL don't see a return to the days of Kunark.  The biggest problem was what little else they brought to a group .  <br>
<br>
The other issue was that there were MUCH more limited hunting options at the time, high level groups basically were limited to Howling Stones, Sebilis, and Karnor's Castle and to a limited extent Freeti, Guk King room.  Nowdays there's a whole slew of higher level exp zones which sit empty (mostly due to VI's inability to realize that a difference between exp/excitement/danger and LOOT is necessary to make a dungeon type encounter desirable).  There's 2-person groups, 3 person groups, there's Soloers all over the place, the world has changed dramatically.In Kunark, if a Knight couldn't find a group in one of those places, his options were to not get exp at all.  This was a problem, they weren't powerful enough to effectively solo, there weren't reasonable areas which made soloing a viable method of gaining experience, AND Paladins in particular sufferred from MULTIPLE issues, the least of which was their tanking ability in my mind, the greatest of which was their inability to provide anything in return (i.e. good spells, offensive abilities, decent equipment, weapons, and the list goes on).   <br>
<br>
Now the world is different.  Even if Paladins were in a group and not tanking, they make a viable healer (IMO Paladins are #2 healers in the game after clerics), they make a viable offensive damage dealer, and would EASILY be preferable over a 2nd warrior in a full exp group, they also have MANY more soloing options and non-conventional grouping options.  Hell, I'd go into Sebilis any day with a Paladin as the sole healer in a group.  IMO a Paladin is the BEST replacement for a cleric as if things go wrong, druids and shamans cannot res you.  Even with a 49 res, which I have NO problem taking, as it's not THAT much difference, it's better than any other non-cleric class.<br>
<br>
So, now the shoe is on the other foot, warriors have nothing else to bring to a group, other than tanking, and we simply want to be the most logical choice if that's the specific role that's desired.  We don't want Paladins to NOT be able to tank, but we DO want to be better than you by a noticeable margin at the only thing that we do.  We don't do anything else, our lives are one sided, but we want to be able to fight alongside you, not replacing you, but not taking the back seat either.  Doing this would not immediately back shelf you like I think you guys fear, as your offense is just about equivalent to ours, in some cases better, in some cases MUCH better, which is OK by me, and I think most other warriors, and that factor alone ensures you guys to not be obsolete as you were in Kunark, much less the multitudes of additional upgrades in the forms of manapool, aa skills, spells which mean something.  <br>
<br>
I do feel that warriors should be not just a little better at their one job than Paladins and SK's, but a lot better, perhaps not even necessarily through taunt but through mitigation.  I'd still like to see a greater flow of hate generating weapons, if that's the route VI chooses, even lesser hate generators (irritating blow +50 hate, annoying blow +75 hate, Kind of pissed blow +150 hate, angering blow +200 hate) and particularly, I'd like to see 2h weapons beling a viable option fo warriors as well by having some of the hate generating procs on those as well.   I also think that Taunt below 60 is broken, it SHOULD be able to work vs. even and higher con mobs, just as LoH is available for use regardless of what you're fighting, just as Backstab, spells, Feign Death, etc are ALL useable vs. Even con or higher mobs.   Lower chance of success..fine, no prob, but zero chance is retarded.  <br>
<br>
We want to be the best at what we do, by a noticeable margin, cause that's ALL we do.  We have NOTHING else which makes us valuable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwubaogoldenarmz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wubao Goldenarmz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/20/02 8:29:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=545>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   an odd thought ...</span><hr size=1> If warriors start to MITIGATE damage better, through, say a changed defensive table (ala monks increased offense abilities) ...<br>

<br>
That's your role.  If you are saying you don't like that role, that's fine, that role still makes you an Asset.  Sometimes a Paladins role is to Lay Hand the main tank, and then Act of Valor the main tank.  Most Paladins don't particularly like the role of dying to save the Main Tank, that doesn't mean it isn't sometimes a useful role.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;You will notice on page 23 about a parsing done where high-end knights outdamage the highest damaging high-end warrior of a high-end guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ones I saw were against undead mobs.  The parse itself is valid but it doesn't represent the entire end game.  NToV has no undead mobs, VP has no undead mobs, Vex Thal has no undead mobs.  While it's valid to look at undead mobs it's invalid to look at JUST undead mobs and call for a balance change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uiskandaralazeem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iskandar Alazeem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of the Battlefield</BR>STEEL WARRIOR Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 724<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/20/02 9:21:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=547>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.purgatory.net/alex/medion.jpg width=64 height=64></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: an odd thought ...</span><hr size=1> Nosfentaru, you might want to double check your facts - post 448 in the thread, page 23 if you view threads with 20 replies per page.

I'm not saying that the sky is falling because of that parse; I'm just saying that undead mobs have nill to do with these particular DPS calcs. <p><html><body>

<br>
This might well be true of a level 60 paladin with Wave of Healing, Wave of Prexus, Superior Heal, Celestial Cleansing, Extended enchancement, a Mana efficiency 3 focus item, Several flowing thought items, and some AAXP put into mana regen, Healing adept, and healing gift, but it is definitely NOT true of a paladin prior to level 59.  At 52 there is NO way I could come anywhere near the healing capability of a shaman or druid that was 5 levels lower than me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I do feel that warriors should be not just a little better at their one job than Paladins and SK's, but a lot better<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Then you disagree with my previous statement, that a group which has a paladin currently tanking for it shouldn't be hurting their &quot;bottom line&quot; by not ditching him for the first warrior that goes LFG in the zone?  If there's only one tank slot in the group, and a paladin is filling it, but warriors are a LOT better at tanking, don't you think that sort of thing would happen a lot?  I do.  A lot of paladins do.<br>
<br>
Is the reverse happening now?  (warriors being dumped for paladins?)  I doubt it.  Doesn't happen to anyone I know on my server, but then I'm far from high-end.  Maybe this whole issue regards balance not just at level 60, but at level 60 with lots of AAXP and high end items?  If so, a suggestion needs to be made which would balance warriors at that stage of the game ONLY, and not create a huge backlash all the way back down the level chain.<br>

If you have a paladin functioning as your only healer in a group, would you currently ditch him for a druid?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
A shaman?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
A cleric?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
If you have a paladin tanking for you, would you currently ditch him for a warrior?<br>
<br>
Probably not.<br>
<br>
would you ditch him for a shadowknight?<br>
<br>
Probably not.<br>
<br>
A paladin cannot effectively function as healer in a group until level 59 AT LEAST, and really not until after that (as I mentioned) when he has enough AAXP to make his heals much more powerful and his mana regen very nice.<br>
<br>
Against non-undead, a paladin can't really function effectively as a damage dealer in a group unless he's got several Aura of Battle items (for +atk), a primal weapon (for avatar, +100atk) and a few AAXP points invested into combat fury.<br>
<br>
So you see, paladins aren't really as flexible as you seem to think.  Despite our extras, we really don't do any role other than tank with any great efficiency.  And in xp groups, everyone wants maximum efficiency.<br>

Regardless of how weak you may see them, the ability to heal, lay hands, and buff are beyond the abilities of a Warrior. Thats fine though. Thats what you do and Warriors have known this fact since the beginning of the game. <br>
<br>
The addition of Luclin saw many knight only weapons break that invisible seal on the damage/delay ratios. It seemed every weapon found that had a higher damage than delay ratio was a knight only weapon. Now dont get me wrong, SKs and Paladins make damn fine damage dealing classes. But the abilities they already possessed were already pushing them well past Warriors in both DPS and Tanking. <br>
<br>
So now we have the knight classes pulling ahead of Warriors in the only thing we did. The one thing that made us what we are. Im not saying warriors suck. Im not bashing Paladins or SKs. But fact is fact. Warriors are not the master tanks we are supposed to be. Frod is right, damage mitigation needs to be upped for Warriors. Taunt needs to actually WORK for Warriors. <br>
<br>
I really dont care if a Paladin or SK has a higher DPS than me. But I do care if a group or a raid is going to give some thought to who should be the MA..a warrior, or a knight.  If a warrior is there it should be cut and dry what the answer should be. If no warriors are present, I think a Paladin or SK should be able to step up to the plate and handle it as well. But I do think a Warrior should be alot better in this area hands down. <p><center><img src=http://www.netset.com/~blazer/sig00c1.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhulanta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hulanta</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/20/02 10:25:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=551>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Frodlin, regarding your statements:</span><hr size=1> Make Taunt more viable in the 50s for warriors.<br>

Put warriors on their own damage table that has a small relative advantage until level 60.<br>

At level 60 make warriors tank considerably better than everyone when it comes to mitigation. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20383">Hulanta</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/20/02 10:52:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=552>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Frodlin, regarding your statements:</span><hr size=1> Repeating old news, I'm sure.<br>

Warrior strengths previously.<br>
<br>
High AC - some of the best (monk rivaled in this area though).<br>
High HP - the best in the game by a wide margin.<br>
Middle of the road melee - good but not superior.<br>
Defensive/evasive - the Main Tank maker.<br>
<br>
Warrior strengths today.<br>
<br>
High AC - but exactly the same potential as Knights/Monks.<br>
High HP - but the margin has slipped considerably.<br>
Middle of the road melee - but it has slipped in comparison by a significant margin.<br>
Defensive/evasive - the Main Tank maker, for now, but that may be fading given that fights are lasting much longer than 3 minutes on many boss mobs.<br>
<br>
Now, I absolutely have no desire to see the Knights lined up at the zone line all LFG with no hope of being asked to group.  Nor do I wish the Warriors to be replacing them at the zone line.  I don't think anyone can truely disagree that Warrior class defining territory has been eroded.  At least not with any credibility.<br>
<br>
So, if a seperate defensive table isn't the way to go (and I happen to think it is), then what is?  What would truely balance the situation effectively so that Knights can continue to tank well for group situations (which I happen to think a seperate defense table wouldn't hurt unless they redesigned all the mobs in the game, which they won't) while at the same time giving Warriors an area in which to shine for groups, since they won't want us for our good looks and defensive.<br>
<br>
Lets not talk AAXP, because AAXP should be an extra, not something you need just to be effective.<br>
<br>
Also, it should be something that allows us to continue tanking well against boss mobs, since defensive really is not going to cut it in fights that last 30-40 minutes or more.<br>
<br>
So, what do the Knights suggest?  Rather than just (at least some) saying &quot;oh no, you can't have that, you'll make us obsolete!&quot;, come up with some valid suggestions that really make sense.<br>
<br>
And don't try the &quot;you're fine just the way you are, nothing needs to change&quot;, because we don't buy it.  We play our class and we know what we know.  <br>

Warriors have been the only choice for a Main Tank.  They held that title for a long time...They don't want to give it up and they certainly don't want to share it.<br>
<br>
I can understand that, for the good of the game I can't agree with it though.  There should be a choice for Main Tank.  In EQ there are less roles then classes.  <br>
<br>
Enchanters share thier role with bards.<br>
Clerics share thier role with priests.<br>
Wizards share thier role with other damage dealers.<br>
Warriors were exclusively the main tank.<br>

<br>
Same with clerics and other priests - druids and shaman do share some healing responsibility, but you do not leave your MTs in the hands of anyone but a cleric (usually multiple clerics) in 99% of all cases. Also, shaman are generally more responsible for buffing the raid and debuffing mobs, while druids can fill in any number of spots. Clerics are much more specialized in the realm of healing.<br>
<br>
Wizards do share their primary role with other classes, but they do so in different ways and bring other tools (albeit a limited number of tools) to the table. Also, most every high-level wizard has a wide variety of spells at his disposal and very rarely is crippled by a mob with high resists, whereas melees are much more tame vs. mobs with high mitigation.<br>
<br>
Warriors don't do anything else but tank. We don't heal, we don't debuff, we don't feign...we tank. That's it. If we can't take damage - the one thing we're supposed to specialize in - better than anyone else, we're pretty much filler.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I'd be happy if there were more encounters where knights' and warriors' roles were effectively reversed, as it spices up the game a bit. By and large, though, I feel that warriors should be the best choices for MTs, at least statistically.<br>

<br>
I agree, and these are the advantages/disadvantages as I see the way they should be:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Warrior</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Advantage: Less overall use of healing mana (High HPs, High AC and better mitigation)<br>
Disadvantage: No reliable way of generating enough taunt, making aggro-control more of an issue<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Knight</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Advantage: Easy aggro-generation, High AC and good HPs<br>
Disadvantages: Less mana-efficient due to lower HPs and lower mitigation compared to warriors, making them more susceptible to damage-spikes<br>
<br>
This even carries over into exp-groups, with the superior aggro-generation of a knight a group can &quot;afford&quot; to kill stuff faster and use less healing mana. If the same group had had a warrior tanking, stuff would die slower - but due to the more efficient healing, the healer would expend the same mana healing in both groups. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions</a></i> <br>

<br>
For instance - Clerics and Druids have different healing roles as thier healing abilities are different.  Clerics are a required class, but if no druids show up you'd need more Clerics/Paladins/Shamans there to pick up the slack(depending on the encounter ofcourse).  <br>
<br>
Rogues pretty much just do damage - in certain circumstances they can be part of the CR team but not in a lot of the high-end places(Ssra, ToV, etc.,).  The role of a Rogue is very limited just like a warrior.  Yet rogues are not the best at what they do, Wizards in many circumstances do it better.  Sure Wizards cast &quot;spells&quot; and rogues &quot;attack&quot; but in the end DPS is what really matters.    Wizards certainly have much more utility then Rogues.<br>
<br>
There are roles in this game, either more roles need to be created or they need to be filled by more then one class.  <br>
<br>
As for my past.  I started EQ in the first weeks it went live( wasn't in beta).  Some of the major zones I've been to include:  VP, ToV(including North), Ssra.   Killed Doomshade, Dain Frostreaver, Kland, Gozzrem, etc.,  <br>

The point of my post was that the superior hp/ac advantage you keep on insisting the warrior class had pre Velious is simply not true, at least not to the extent that you'd have us believe.<br>
<br>
I gave you what my numbers were.  Why don't you compare them to some of the 60th paladins in small guilds and see exactly what the difference is.  Granted, there are much better gear out now, but I'd assume players in small guilds still have limited access to any uber loot which are mostly no drop anyways.<br>

Certainly, today it can't be argued that paladins lack in hps/ac in the end game, since they clearly don't, as Graal, a paladin, has posted the numbers that I hope you looked at. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usmushums.showPublicProfile?language=EN>smushums</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Steel Warrior Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 1212<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/02 2:10:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=558>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Frodlin, regarding your statements:</span><hr size=1> rogues != wizards.<br>

rogues are best at sustained dps, good for clearing trash mobs and perfect for exp groups.  fairly good against bosses<br>
<br>
wizards are best at burning down boss mobs, runners, and the ocassional trash mob when they have mana.  noone is close to rogues in sustained dps, except mabye a ranger with a bow and lots of aa.<br>
<br>
*There are roles in this game, either more roles need to be created or they need to be filled by more then one class. *<br>
i think the point people were trying to get across (for the last 28 pages) is that warriors dont fill their 'role' as effectively as they should.<br>
<br>
also, not every class *has* an essential role.  beastlords are getting their crack spells majorly upgraded so they're wanted more, and im sure they will be.  does that mean we cant live without them?  obviously not.  (only on test, check eq.castersrealm if you wanna know what upgrade)<br>
<br>
quite simply, noone has said that knights should have to tank like wizards...  noone is trying to take away their &quot;role&quot; as you call it.  warriors just want to be a little balanced, we dont want to turn into what knights used to be. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7023  target="web">smushums<a</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwubaogoldenarmz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wubao Goldenarmz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/02 2:31:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=559>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  that's kinda rude</span><hr size=1> &quot;If you have a paladin acting as a &quot;damage class&quot; in your group against non-undead, would you currently ditch him for&quot;<br>

<br>
You and other paladins agree that warriors need to be addressed and improved in some manner. The only thing you and others don't agree is the amount of improvement warrior ask to have over the knight classes. <br>
<br>
This should not be an issue for conflict. <br>
<br>
 Verant ain't some mindless drone that will succumb to our will and implement what we ask for.  Warriors could request they want to mitigate 200%, 50%, 30%  or just 5% better than every tank class. No matter what amount warriors ask, Verant will determine the proper one after some research, testing and so on. <br>
<br>
A lot of the paladins posting against any type of improvements towards warriors(like their own defensive table) are probably in the stage of the game where a warriors with similar level of equipment are still superior in AC, HP, Defense and DPS.  An improvement like a separate defensive table for warrior will seem absurd and overpowering from their point of view, since warrior are already quite superior to them in those areas at the current stage of the game they are part of.<br>
<br>
They have a point there. But Verant will not just implement from lvl 1-60 a separate defensive table so warriors tank 200% better than paladins in all stages of the game. They will analize the situation at hand,  in what stage of the game warriors are lacking, what exactly they are lacking and possible solutions. Taking in account other classes in that stage of the game and what impact these &quot;solutions&quot; to improve warriors will have on the game.<br>
<br>
Prior to Luclin high-end game ,  Warriors are the preferred tank for a raid. They have better gear, more HP and inflict more dmg than the knight class. Knight classes are still good viable tanks with a strong supportive role(tanking if it comes to that, ghetto mezzing/parking adds, stuns, buffs, heals). The knights have total control of aggro, they can peel the mob off a caster and position mob where they see fit, when they see fit. <br>
Warriors don't posses the same control over aggro as the knights. Warriors are dependant on procs and on the rest of the raid/group to allow them to keep aggro. <br>
The superiority of the warrior in the areas mentioned balance well with the overall utility the knights bring to the raid. A separate defensive table at this point might not be adequate since all seems balanced. Though taunt for warriors is still an issue.<br>
<br>
Through Luclin High-end game, Knights close dramatically or become equal or better to warriors as tanks for raids. Warriors no longer posses the advantage in gear since all high-end armor is shared by war/sk/pal.  The advantage of warriors in HP has narrowed down considerably to the points its irrelevant, thanks to 100  hp all/all gear. Warriors no longer are superior in DPS to knight classes. Knights still posses total control over aggro and bring great utility and spells to the raid/group. Warriors still lack control over aggro and loose all the advantages they used to posses. <br>
A separate defensive table at this point might be adequate since nothing is balanced.  At least this edge over defense might make up for the advantage lost in Ac/hp/Defense/DPS and the utility knights already were bringing to the table. <br>
 <br>
How is verant going to improve warriors so they do not unbalance some things in a stage of the game that are fine AND balance others in a stage of the game that ARE wrong? <br>
<br>
Lift the AC softcap and fix mitigation? Improve Warrior Defense through AA that can only be acquired at lvl 60? Implement a defensive table for warriors once they reach 60? Increase skill caps for warriors at 60?  Nerf the current all/all high end gear so warriors get the superior one to keep the edge in equipment? Add new gear with mods that affect only the warriors defensive skills?  Lower refresh of taunt? add some hate component to taunt?<br>
<br>
Thats up to verant to come up with solutions, put them into test, get feedback and throw them live IF they are viable. <br>
<br>
All we can do is make suggestions and hope SOMETHING is done to fix what needs to be fixed. Verant might take bits and pieces of what we suggest or maybe they will come up with a totally different approach. <br>
<br>
<br>
That some people come here to post how ridiculous they find our request, or how they totally refuse to see past the flamming sword that is up their arse, or how against they are towards any improvement to the warrior class due to the fear of not shinning as bright as they shine now, will make no difference. The fact is the high-end game is not balanced, Warriors DO need improvements/fixes to counter-balance the improvements every other class acquired.<br>
 <br>
<br>
This is a wake-up call for verant. We have to make some noise so they look our way and realize what is the current state of the warrior in EQ(specially the high-end game)  and where it is headed IF nothing is done to fix what is wrong. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Thats all there is to it. <br>
