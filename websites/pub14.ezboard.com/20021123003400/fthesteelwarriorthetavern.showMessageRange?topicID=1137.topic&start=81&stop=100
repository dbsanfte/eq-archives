<br>
With a CH rotation that's not gonna run outta mana, how much difference does 500hp...or 1000hp on the MT matter?  It doesn't.  Thus, there's non reason *not* to use a Paladin or SK (SK more so, if all these changes go live) as your MT.<br>
<br>
Oh...if I hear another person mention /disciplines when they go through their recitation of the advantages warriors have, I'm going to vomit.  How many times do we have to point out that the very vast majority of high-end fights last much longer than the 3 minutes of Defensive or Evasive?  Yeah, they're a semi-decent tool, but their effectiveness is reduced daily.  After all, why be defensive or evasive if you can put up a CH rotation that doesn't run oom?  To save mana?  Um...mana is infinite...why bother, maximize DPS.<br>
<br>
DPS...that is what raids are about...not how much damage you can do...but how fast can you do it.  I'm sure if you gave 6 warriors a neverending CH rotation, and CC'd the room for them, those 6 warriors could kill emp. Ssra...even though it'd take forever.  But we don't want things to take forever...that's why we like the damage output of rogues, monks, and new-and-improved rangers.  However, with a warrior tank, these classes (amongst others) have to practically hold our hand, and make sure we hang onto that aggro.  Every 15 minutes the warrior can smack AE taunt...but that's not a &quot;lock-the-mob-on-the-warrior&quot; solution either.  Give that knight your MT position, give him some KEI, MC3, Bard Song...and watch him grab aggro and hold it throughout the entire fight...without jolts from rangers, monks FDing, through failed rogue evades.  And think...what use is that warrior?<br>
<br>
We're handicapped.  That needs to change.  Shields won't do it.  Giving knights fancy new spells won't do it.  I've tried to wait patiently for our changes...our &quot;fix&quot;...but I grow more and more impatient day by day. <p>~Thak Havocblade<BR> Warlord of Brell Serilis<BR> Zebuxoruk~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaveenlucenthawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aveen Lucenthawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/27/02 4:21:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: So much for warriors being needed to lock aggro . . .. </span><hr size=1> TheHavocblade said&quot;<br>

<br>
Amen! That is exactly the trouble with warriors. Throughout the game, we have to constantly have our hands held by the people we group with so that we can be effective. <br>
<br>
I think this is our biggest complaint and our biggest problem. We have put up with it while we thought that we at least brought something valuable to the group. So did our groupmates. But how much longer will they continue to put up with this hand holding just so we can stand toe to toe with the mob when the other tank classes can do it on their own?<br>

THERE IS NOTHING NEW ABOUT THAT. K sorry for the caps but it has been said several times in this very thread. Since the FIRST sk got disease cloud at level 9 they have been able to out taunt warriors. There is nothing new about knights being able to aggro stuff.<br>
<br>
But of course since that 54 sk can out taunt you, then he should tank!<br>
<br>
Pfft please.<br>
<br>
The aggro spell isnt something SKs will be casting every 24 seconds... it is a 10 minute duration spell with a 9 minute recast.<br>
<br>
The aggro = dps thing is old, tired, and worn out. You can not up DPS at a raid any significant amount with somone tanking who had full aggro always. To be honest the only times when DPS drops is during tank transitions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uelmoricq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elmoricq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.multimania.com/mcduck/images/eq/ninja.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/28/02 5:31:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.multimania.com/mcduck/eq/elmo_title.jpg width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: sk taunt</span><hr size=1> On this point, I agree with Catrekill.<br>
Whoever is able to cast a spell is able to outtaunt a warrior.<br>
This is not quite a problem, this is a part of the game.<br>
<br>
If I'm right (if not please correct me), our role is to tank mobs, knights role (at least, one of their roles, I'm only speaking about aggro here) could be to help MT to tank and to take adds from casters.<br>
What we ask here is fix to help us in our jobs, because it comes to a point when a knight can do the warrior's job WITH the insane aggro control, and then we lose our only niche (and, at a larger extent, also trivializes the game).<br>
<br>
At this point, considering this, a fix would take time, but hell, we *could* wait if VI come here and post a list of what they plan to do (even if these are only thoughts), like they did on the clerics boards.<br>
Right now, we feel ignored by VI.<br>
Better, we feel (at least, *I*) insulted when Absor come with a &quot;all works as intended&quot; post.<br>
Maybe I'm wrong on this one, but that's my current feeling, and right now I am unable to change it. Not with these many casters/hybrids/priests changes, continuously putting us in a dark corner, without a word (not only a word, a whole post with arguments) of VI. <p><img src="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/mcduck/images/signature.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uelmoricq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elmoricq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.multimania.com/mcduck/images/eq/ninja.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/28/02 5:34:29 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uloydahfuriousheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loydah Furiousheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/28/02 6:44:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.tiscalinet.ch/sascha.kaestle/images/board_pic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: sk taunt</span><hr size=1> There are several problems brought up here smashed together into one. Let me try to separate them more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   1. Problem</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Warriors feel neglected by VI seeing all classes getting pretty nice upgrades over the several expansions we went through.<br>
<br>
The Last Upgrade: Honestly I cannot remember, probably taunt of 60+ mobs or 2hander damage bonus although this was not directed at warriors<br>
<br>
The Last Fix: Taunt fixed in CT<br>
<br>
Why has VI - short of AA xp and new items - never given the warriors something? We always get to hear 2 reasonings: /disc defensive and evasive + we are the basis of all the melees, everyone is scaled around us.<br>
<br>
Now what can VI do about this? <br>
<br>
First and foremost, get rid of disc defensive/evasive. We are sick and tired to be neglected any form of improvement based on something back from 2 expansions. Now see what you have left and define what you want a warrior to be.<br>
<br>
Analyze the classes along these lines:<br>
<br>
War: Mediocre dmg dealer, mediocre dmg mitigator, mediocre dmg avoider, mediocre taunter, no utility<br>
<br>
Pal: Worst dmg dealer, mediocre dmg mitigator, mediocre dmg avoider, best taunter, best utility<br>
<br>
Shd: Worst dmg dealer, mediocre dmg mitigator, mediocre dmg avoider, best taunter, high utility<br>
<br>
Mnk: High dmg dealer, mediocre dmg mitigator, best dmg avoider, high taunter (through pure dps), high utility<br>
<br>
Rog: Best dmg dealer, mediocre dmg mitigator, best dmg avoider, high taunter (through pure dps), mediocre utility<br>
<br>
Rng: High dmg dealer, mediocre dmg mitigator, mediocre dmg avoider, best taunter, high utility<br>
<br>
You should already notice that every class is best at something, except warrior class.<br>
My proposal if you want a warrior to tank would include new mitigation table for knights and warriors (after all thats what you've done for monks - their own dmg table). Take away parry from warriors and give us block (at a lower skill lvl then monks - this would set us apart from knights in the tanking department).<br>
Then add some utility. There have been quite some suggestions (look at DAoC for some ideas - one i would favor is intercept). And no. We don't need itembased utility. ITEM FIX = BAD.<br>
<br>
Second, please acknowledge that all classes as of now have surpassed the base class you always refer us to. We are sick and tired to be used as basis for all other classes. We have been surpassed in all territories, there is nothing left where warriors excel at, except hp and items. Please acknowledge that it is BAD when a class is defined by items. You will never ever reach balance throughout the game via items.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   2. Problem</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Our taunting is broken.<br>
<br>
I don't think we can ask for more there. After all there has to be some drawback. This is ours. VI hates MT strategy and that is the reason we'll never see a taunt with an EB like effect. Your only chance is to get one of the more rare weapons that hold aggro well. You will still rely on your raid/party to keep aggro in check but to a much lesser degree.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   3. Problem</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We do not stack within our current role. You only need infinite people tanking a mob and our dmg output does lack severly.<br>
<br>
On a raid or xp group there is only need for so many warriors (2-3 enough for ANYTHING in raids). To add to our stackability you could grant us a dmg mode we could switch into. Take away 50 % of our hp when we go into that mode. Something like &quot;Loydah has entered a state of massive combat furry&quot; You could switch in and out of this mode once every 5 EQ days. This would grant us superior attacking from behind a mob. How that is done i dont know. This is just an idea you could toss around. <p><CENTER>

<br>
Thanks for taking the time to test some things for us. I'd make a war on test to do it myself but the thought of leveling another character to 60 gives me the shakes.<br>
<br>
I was thinking last night, my guild was killing Diabo Xi Xin Thall, thats the one the silence, anyway, our MT dies, and I'm 2nd tank. Cant really use AE taunt there, no telling what it might bring, so getting agro is a real challenge, no procs, just my taunt button and the occasional agro spell from the our enchanters. It was a real challenge, making sure I had solid agro and I realized, I don't want taunt to be a gaurnteed agro generator. That would make the game incredibly boring. My entire guild had to work together in order for me to maintain taunt. Thats what makes the game fun for me, working together with friends to accomplish something.<br>
<br>
Sure I'd like to see taunt changed a little bit, maybe a 1% to 5% increase in hate list generation but I wouldnt want to see it changed to a gaurnteed taunt, that just wouldnt make the game fun anymore.<br>
<br>
Only real change I would like is for a the defensive disc removed and for wars to be moved to their own mitigation table. <p><p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12419" target="_BLANK">Arative</A><br>

1. Using my Lodi shield off my back, with no back item.<br>
2. Primary hand weapon was a SoD, changing out for Primal when Avatar faded.<br>
3. I'm a dark elf, my bash skill started at (9) and over the course of an hour raised to (27).<br>
4. I didn't have to hold aggro since it was just Nynne and I.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Result:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1. Well, my bash raised from (9) to (27).  Go me...<br>
2. The highest bash I noticed was for 39 damage.<br>

4. Took me three times longer to kill one mob (underbulks).<br>
5. Lost both secondary attack and kick DPS.<br>

I'll clean up the file and post it completely if you wish but it's rather large.  If someone could parse it out, that would be optimal and I could email it to you directly.<br>

From reading the SK boards, I observe that many SK's didn't really want nor ask for any of these +/-hate spells.  But that aside, I think that VI does have something in mind to upgrade the warrior class.  They have performed some magic lately for things that in the past they have said couldn't be done before (not warrior or class specific per se) because of the massive coding changes, yet they have come through.<br>
