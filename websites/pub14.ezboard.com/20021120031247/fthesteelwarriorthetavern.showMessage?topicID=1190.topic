The saddest part is that this particular guild is not at the high end of the raiding structure, having not even yet been to Ssra or any luclin encounters outside of perhaps Umbral, Servitor or Rhags, and Derakor is still a good kill. A recent addition to the board, Diomed, is their MT I believe. Or at least, I believe he's their main warrior.<br>

&quot;Subject: Tradition be damned...I just had to do it at least once.<br>
<br>
Had overkill on Derakor the Vindicator earlier today. I decided, &quot;what the hell, why not?&quot; and tanked him for the whole fight. Yes, I'm one of those SK's that believes there's 3 tanks in this game, not 1, although this is the first time I've ever tanked something Vindi+ level over one of our warriors. Tanking Vindi had been one of my goals ever since Velious came out. Was nice to finally see it done.<br>
<br>
--WARNING: NUMBERS AHEAD--<br>
If anyone's curious about this kind of stuff, I logged my tanking on him. Used a 4 second delay CH cycle, and I had 6081 HP. 4 seconds was about perfect... 5 MIGHT have worked, but would be pushing it really badly. Now, anyone who has killed AoW or whatnot would know that a 2 second cycle can be sustained for 8+ minutes easily. Fight took 4 minutes and 24 seconds (bit low on damage). Basically, once shields are in, SK's will be able to tank the vast majority of ubermobs just fine. A tiny innate mitigation boost to Knights would be nice... like 5-10% or so. Give warriors 15-30% innate mitigation at the same time and remove defensive/evasive. (End result: Warrior gets hit for 700, SK gets hit for 900, Monk gets hit for 1000. With shields this would do 2 things: Make Warriors the clearly best tank, but also make Knights a viable tank as well like they should be.)<br>
<br>
Never turned attack on because I didn't feel like eating ripostes. I tend to do this a lot as it gives me a clear bonus over warriors; I don't eat random 700 damage rounds while tanking. Yeah, the raid misses 50-60 DPS, but oh well. They'll live.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, on to the fight numbers:<br>
__Derakor the Vindicator__<br>
Total number of non-bash/kick hits: 355<br>
Total number of non-bash/kick misses: 251<br>
Max hit: 700 (Hit for max 55 times)<br>
Min hit: 225 (Hit for min 53 times)<br>
Average hit: 466<br>
Hit rate: 58.6% (58.6% of all his attacks connected. Dodge/parry/riposte/miss means the hit didn't connect.)<br>
Damage per second: 617.72 hit, 16.47 bash, 7.90 kick, 639.99 total<br>
Total damage: 165,550 hit, 3903 bash, 2063 kick, 171,516 total (ow?)<br>
Average Complete Heal efficiency: 41% (meaning on average, CH's landed at 41%, or 2493 out of 6081 hp. I had several land at 4500ish hp, too, though. If only CH numbers weren't displaying 10500 right now...)<br>
My gimpy 38 point damageshield (yeah, I know, I should have had a bard and all...) did *53* damage per second. A DS of 100 or more would really, really destroy Vindi.<br>
He rampaged 36 times over the 4.4 minute fight, coming to 8.18 rampages per minute. 36 quad 700 rampages is quite a lot of damage to be distributing on other people. Fortunately we had a rampage tank that stayed up the whole fight (Grats Ronak).<br>
<br>
I believe that's everything relevant for the numbers people. I'd be really curious in seeing other parses of tanking ubermobs, although vindi specifically (best comparison). Getting a good idea of exactly how SK's and Warriors without defensive compare on Vindi might be useful to know.<br>
--END NUMBERS--<br>
<br>
If anyone would like me to post the log itself, let me know. I just don't want to spam up the board if no one's interested. :P<br>
<br>
I'm really looking forward to the shield upgrade and getting harmshield. I enjoy both tanking and pulling, so it should be nice.<br>
<br>
Also, random comment to the SK's worried about shields &quot;nerfing&quot; our damage - Don't use a shield unless you're tanking. Only a select few people on the raid tank. It's that simple. Right now, I don't even turn attack on when I'm tanking something that requires a low delay CH cycle. When you're NOT tanking, you'll still have full damage with a 2H. Since shields are a general upgrade directed at tanks and priests in their entirety, I really doubt they'll count it against us for our &quot;class-specific&quot; upgrades, although harmshield has me pretty much satisified there. Once we have it, I'm considering pulling Aaryonar to HoT to kill him just for the hell of it. The fact it's entirely possible to do that should tell everyone something about how NIFTY harmshield is going to be. Lots of emphasis on that nifty. Shields will be pretty nifty for pulling too.&quot;<br>
<br>
And my later response:<br>
&quot;Subject: Gear...<br>
<br>
This is my normal gear: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=184832">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=184832</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This is the gear I used when tanking Vindi: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=237384">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=237384</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I used the onyxbrand (worthless weapon) because I still lack a decent 1handed SK weapon. My gear isn't anything spectacularly uber, but it's pretty respectable, with a severe focus on HP. I get over 1250ac raidbuffed so ac isn't much of a concern to me. All of my gear is obtainable by any guild that can kill Vindi. (EDIT: er...well...except the primal. forgot about that.)<br>
<br>
If I had extreme top-of-the-line gear and CS3/CA3, a 5 second cycle would be very easy to pull off..maybe even 6 seconds(considering we use 7 on defensive warriors right now, that's pretty nice.). Also, an SK could use a 4 second cycle on vindi comfortably until a minimum of around 5300 HP buffed. Could still be done at 5000 I'm sure, just kinda risky.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not going to go running around tanking every ubermob in the game now. I mostly just wanted to prove to myself it could be done with the resources we had, and get a parse of an SK tanking Vindi. Our guild is at the &quot;just-entering-NToV&quot; level (had a neat fight involving 2 flurry drakes and 35 people the other day...wee), so no, I haven't pondered trying to tank Emperor Ssraeshza yet. :P<br>
<br>
(EDIT: Oh, um, I also forgot to mention that I have run3, regen3, natural durability 3, combat stability 1, combat agility 1, mental clarity 1, and unholy horse. I've been 60 since velious came out, but I'm really lazy with the AA exp. :P)&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uguzmandivineheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Guzman Divineheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/3/02 2:29:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1190.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   bad idea...</span><hr size=1> well he tanked, but look at the numbers and u see he tanked bad ... <br>

<br>
As for taunt, I used to think significant improvement of it for warriors could really trivialize a lot of the game due to many encounters being set up for C Heal rotations, but as we can see, when SK's and Pal's can guarantee aggro for the fight without ever turning on attack, there is something very wrong.  And it's not like it's getting any better with the new line of SK hate spells on test.  <br>
<br>
I really hope there is something big going in for warriors and warriors only that we haven't seen so far on test, or this class is going to die a quick death in the near future.  I love my warrior, but i feel so incredibly useless right now.  Wish I had time to level up another class, but i don't, and I don't really want to either.  It's incredible how either blind/clueless the developer team is  - either that or they do understand the issues and are just very very bad at communicating it (i don't believe this last due to the huge amounts of info clerics ahve gotten recently). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 322<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/3/02 6:34:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1190.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: bad idea...</span><hr size=1> Well it all depends on what truly is efficient, doesn't it?  If the fact that he didn't even have to have attack on cut down on enough riposte damage, he may have actually been the more efficient tank to heal.  Having 800 more HP may be meaningless if you're using them up just on ripostes.<br>
<br>
And I think we've all ageed that holding agro on the main tank is the most important aspect of boss mob killing, isn't it?  That is, if the MT can be kept standing.  So, how much more efficient would it have been to have a Warrior MTing? Would it have warranted the drop in DPS that would have had to happen?  If you can kill the mob 30 seconds faster with the SK tanking, doesn't that pretty much counter balance most of the Warrior efficiency?  Once mana is no longer a major consideration? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufuloriancavestomper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FulorianCavestomper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Smithing Guru</span><br>  Posts: 924<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/3/02 6:54:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1190.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_eyes.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: bad idea...</span><hr size=1> Xus, I suppose my info on MS/Imm is a bit out of date, but I have yet to see anyone outside of JD / TMC / HL in NToV, so I apologize for that incorrectness. <br>

Still, a lot of people would have popped up and said 'Oh, so what if a SK tanks Derakor, they're probably using him to tank Aten Ha Ra' too. It changes the argument greatly for a NToV guild to not be using a warrior on fights that aren't yet trivial. <p><img src="http://strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Fulorian/fullsize/sig1.gif" border="0">

<br>
The point is that clerics have mana to burn on many/most of today's boss mobs encounters. Whether it's Vindi or Creator, modrod2, especially if stockpiled before hand, means massive amounts of cleric mana.<br>
<br>
Use that mana on a warrior= Use slightly less of a virtually unlimited amount of mana. Wizards et al cannot make the use of the unlimited mana clerics can, because a wizard with unlimited mana would steal aggro, while the healing aggro from the warrior is divided over 5 or so clerics.<br>
<br>
Use that mana (cast cheal on) an SK. Use more of a virtually unlimited mana supply. Wizards et al can avail themselves of the mana slightly more (dropping more nukes). Monks can use better weapons and spend less time FD'ing. Rogues can use better weapons and spend less time evading. The entire raids DPS is higher, with aggro still locked on the tank- A tank who can, in this thread, hold aggro on a Luclin Quasi-Boss mob with just spells and no melee.<br>
<br>
I'm ignoring that the just spells no melee portion might actually have the SK taking less damage then a warrior, even though if you accept the idea of the &quot;AC Softcap&quot;, it's obvious that's true- No ripostes equals less damage. Maybe not less damage then a defensive warrior, though...<br>
<br>
So what if we add defensive? Clerics use even LESS of a virtually unlimited supply of mana, which I guess leaves more for the wizards to not use, since the have to nuke less to not get aggro, the monks downgrade weapons or FD more, the rogues downgrade or evade more. Everybody gets bored, plus you have to time defensive so the cheal cycle can speed back up again. Once defe goes down, finally, the raid DPS, having been gimped for 3 miniutes, can switch to the non-defe warrior level. Result? Your 4 1/2 miniute kill is now 6, 7, 8 miniutes. Does that matter? Maybe not so much here, but on, say, a Ssra encounter it goes from 30 min fight to 45 or an hour.<br>
<br>
I've said it before. I'll say it again. Defensive is GOD... before you master Modrod2. Defensive is UBER... with small raids/guilds.<br>
<br>
And in higher end encounters, using defensive is about on par with a wizard manaburning himself instead of the target.<br>
<br>
I won't kiss Furor's ass- Nothing personal, I just don't kiss ass- but love em or hate em, you have to admit they can get things done. Same with Thot. And these guys are noticing the same things with Vex Thal mobs, which one would assume are rather tough, that I'm noticing with NToV and Ssra mobs. Namely, Warrior DPS is NOT what we were promised. The Warrior Tanking Ability is NOT what were promised in higher levels.<br>
<br>
Where does the real problem show up? Not so much in the soft cap, which is, IMO, not understood properly. (Seems more like mobs that show a soft cap are really just mobs that, if you attained high enough AC, would show the same results as normal mobs. If the highest AC In Game was 800, then Sebilis would be beyond the &quot;soft cap&quot;. If you could get 3k AC, you would be above say, Yelinak's ATK and see the effects of the higher mitigation. You can't, so we see a cap.) It lies with Modrod2, and to some extent, the lack of a clear HP advantage in higher end warriors and sks/pallies/monks.<br>
<br>
This leads to why we are coming up with odd ways to fix the warrior. Removing the &quot;softcap&quot; would have to be accomplished by re-tuning mobs with a lower atk rating, or massive, retroactive upgrades to Warrior AC. Yeah, if every peice of warlords had 100ac, then we would see Yelinak showing the effects of a softcap, but every other velious/luclin mob would be too easy. Removing the softcap in these areas is not going to be a quick and easy thing, and that means it's not likely to happen.<br>
<br>
Removing Modrod2 would be the perfect fix for this thing. VI doesn't nerf anymore, so not going to happen.<br>
<br>
That's why we are talking all this stupid stuff that warriors didn't have. Aimed Blows. Better DPS. Skill Based Group Buffs. Some sort of &quot;gimmick&quot; on par with SK's and Pallies spellcasting abilities. A reason, not nessacarly to have 10 warriors in Ssra, but at least 1! Because, right now, as the game exists, you get to a point where having even 1 warrior on a raid vrs just about any other class slows you down, provided you can effectively produce and use large amounts of modrod2s. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17853>Cyrz Bloodscale</a>

Ripostes alone cause us to take almost as much damage as SK's do just casting and tanking without Defensive, and when defensive dies... 3 minute blocks of being a hair better at taking damage than SK's followed by 7 minutes, 30 seconds of inferiority? SK's don't even get the damage spikes from ripostes and are more likely to live longer.<br>
<br>
I compared Xusilak's log to one of my own recent ones. He took 610 - 620ish DPS he said. I took 580. Mine was only a minuter shorter than his. And he said he was cut close a few time, with 4500ish health left with a total of 6000. At the time, I was pushing 7000 and lived by about 600 health on one CH. During defensive. This was before the CH number nerf, something to note. <br>
<br>
The chain was also the same speed as his, 4 to 5 seconds, due to 7 clerics being there any myself the only warrior, with no mages for rods, and it had to be kept at the speed for non-defensive the whole time. <p><img src="http://strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Fulorian/fullsize/sig1.gif" border="0">

I'm sure it concerns you, but the rest of us really think you are sounding like the baseball players when they threaten to strike.<br>
<br>
It's disconcerting, to say the least, that the shield upgrade that goes live on Wednesday is going to effectively remove all utility from warriors, but the fact is, the majority of warriors on most servers are still pretty excited when they take down the rhags, vindi, statue, tormax etc. We don't have, nor will we likely ever have the eb items as the game currently stands, nor will be see near 6k hp's. The fact that an SK can tank vindi, before the shields go live, is the reason I'll be playing my rogue from now on come Wednesday. <br>
<br>
This is no knock on the guys on the top end...we'd all love to be there. Most of us aren't, so the concerns of the 1-60 pre 45AA pt, never gonna see VT set are of much greater concern to us. The only reason I participate in discussions when the top end guys are complaining is that their woes are magnified, in this case, even more at the other end of the spectrum where we Don't have agro generating proc weapons available to us easily if at all, and where our hp range in the 3 to 4k unbuffed range. I'm in one of those &quot;family&quot; guilds you hear talked about from time to time, particularly because I don't have the time to dedicate to raiding that is required by most top end guilds. At 36 with 2 kids, I also have zero patience for the 14-17 year old powergaming, self absorbed, selfish dickheads that tend to be in much larger percentages in the high end guilds than you will find in a guild like mine. Smart mouthed 14 year olds don't last too long in my guild, and I like it that way. This isn't to say that i'm right, and anyone else is wrong, it's just right for me. <br>
<br>
So please...we're all warriors and cut from the same cloth. Let's not seperate, in this case, the &quot;high&quot; end from the &quot;low&quot; end...let's get the class fixed at both ends, in the middle, around the back, up top and all around. Let's not tell someone who doesn't take down the emporer every time he can that he has no clue about the problems of the uber.  The problem is with us all.<br>

I don't know whether a frostbringer is better agro than a fleshrgrinder. I don't know if Crustacean shell is better than your crafted armor. I am totally and completely out of touch with anything but the high end. Partially due to mudflation, and partially due to not having been that level for 2-3 years. If you asked me if warriors need fixing and my suggestions, they would be based on my ability to tank the end game mobs. They would not be centralized around someones ability to tank for an exp group in sebilis. Or to tank chardok royals, etc. It isn't that i dont *want* to know about the low end warriors, or the problems surrounding them, it's just that I think most of the higher end warriors are simply out of touch with the others.<br>
