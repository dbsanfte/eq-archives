<br>
With the scenario Dwelfin explained, there's not any substantive difference between a warrior tanking and a knight barring defensive.   You see, when a druid is primary healer, there's no real &quot;warrior hitpoint/ac advantage&quot; if a Paladin has all his spells.    It evens out because the Paladin has buffs that stack with Pot9, which cut out the &quot;warrior HP/AC advantage&quot; to pretty much nil.<br>
<br>
If a Shaman is doing the primary healing (for instance when duoing with the Shaman) the same, equally equipped Paladin actually has a hitpoint/AC ADVANTAGE over the warrior.   In other words, he's a better tank from a melee defense perspective, which is supposedly the warrior's &quot;balancing&quot; point, while retaining the huge aggro advantage.<br>

Graal you are painting such a bogus picture of knights, I have no idea where you are getting your info at. I have seen knights from NON uber guilds tank Rumblecrush, the same mob I have seen take out 4 warlords in 20 sec. I have seen knights tank minis in pos, I cant help but think you are full of a lot of hot wind my friend cause you are NOT talking about the average knight.

Ok, on a serious note though I still can't believe all the lower level people and non-warrior classes that are tearing into the guys that tank in elemental planes at level 65 with dozens and dozens of AA's.<br>
<br>
I mean I could understand if they just bought that account off playerauctions and obviously have no clue - but come on - they speak intelligently about their class and give specific situations as backup to their theories about taunt and agro.<br>
<br>
It's like this thread was started by a small businessman asking for tips on how to win over the biggest share of software sales in his local area... then Bill Gates posts telling him it's not as hard as it looks if you just do this, and this, and this... all from his own personal experiences.  Then some other small businessman down on his luck comes and starts bitching at Bill because he &quot;doesn't know what it's like down in the trenches working his way up&quot; or something.  I mean come on... Bill Gates wasn't born a billionaire, he had to work his way up and now he can share his secrets of success with other would be businessmen.<br>
<br>
Similarly (although on a far less grandeurous scale) we have folks here that are on both sides of the fence but nonetheless have IN GAME experiences far beyond our own.  They are trying to share their knowledge and experiences and are being shot down and poked fun at.  I know I would rather listen to the Bill Gates's of EQ than the folks who are still in my situation or even perhaps a bit lower on the totem poll of exp and AA's.<br>
<br>
Speaking from the point of view of someone that has come from level 61 to level 64 since he started posting here - I will say this... I do notice a VERY large increase in the reliability of taunt.  Do I have tangible hard copies of all the evidence ?  No.  I do however notice the compliments I am paid in group for my agro control and I do notice that folks remember me even though I'm just another Ogre War... nothing special about me really.<br>
<br>
I'm not concerned about statistics and theories or percentages or how things &quot;feel&quot;.  All I want is info and suggestions that will help me in actual in game situations.  While I have supplied example situations for argumental purposes to see the responses I did not want to see all the flame-fests and what not.  There is a great deal of info and knowledge to be gained from all these posts but anything of a flamatory nature that is not stated in a joking manner is very difficult to drudge/skim through in order to reach the helpful information.<br>
<br>
All in all a great thread and I hope it continues <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

p.s.  There was a mention earlier of a warrior that tanked an Ent and the druid was OOM at the end of the fight due to the fact that the Ent was unslowed.  Also, there was a comment that the druid heals negated the HP advantage of the warrior.  This is true.  However, where was the mention that the 1.5% less damage the warrior took would have caused the druid to be able to keep him alive where a knight would have been dead.  Also, where is the mention that the warrior did more damage to the Ent which also reduced the time it took to bring the mob down, and again, further added to the security of the situation.  I know it's not a full group exp grind situation, just another one of those situations that makes the WARRIOR stand out in the minds of the non-warrior classes that call the shots on who will replace the main tank.  This is becoming less and less about pure exp grouping efficiency and more and more about warrior image overall.  You don't have to impress the exp bean counters to get the groups every time - most times you just have to stand out in the crowd - being an ogre I tend to do that easily <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&lt;---Not lower level nor non warrior.  I am level 65 with 119 AA's, but I dont' pretend that things I face are &quot;the norm&quot; for warriors everywhere.  <br>
<br>
You talk about how you're complimented for your superior aggro abilities (even though it's impossible for you to be qulitatively &quot;better&quot; than someone else unless random numbers work different for you than others).  Doesn't the fact that other people notice that you're a warrior and comment on aggro control unsolicited indicating that many are &quot;worse&quot; indicate that there's a general problem?   It sure does to me.<br>

<br>
Over the course of  a year/year and a half or so there have been a vast number of changes in abilities/skills and the relative balance between classes. Stun, slow and heal aggro all have been tweaked and changed. For this reason it's hard to be sure that someones old experiences are totally accurate to the current situation. Also anyone who has advanced significantly into the elemental planes will be in an Uber guild - in all likelyhood that means those warriors were already 60 with a fair proportion of AA's and likely in SSra/VT gear when POP arrived. Geared to that level I wouldn't be at all surprised if their experiences are slightly different to those of us just now working our way up.<br>
<br>
I'm for once in agreement with Graal. The 1.5% difference in avoidance would have had little to no impact on that ent fight and very little visible difference in normal exp grouping. My disagreement with him is that (as stated above) in such an exp. situation I do not see defensive as an advantage of such magnitude that it truely warrants grouping a warrior over a knight (given the security knight aggro control brings to a fight). The long tradition of 'only a warrior will do' continues to colour peoples perceptions, unfortunately if (as I and others believe) that perception no longer has a solid basis, eventually people will twig to it (and are if you give credence to the threads on other boards). Therefore it's best to bring the subject up for debate before warriors truely lose their credibility....<br>

It would be somewhat like saying that Paladins get groups because of their uber healing skills with LoH.  LoH is a great heal, if you're only interested in having it available once every 72 minutes.<br>

Right. So, technically, based on your own admission, since some of the people that post here and disagree with you have more AA than you, are higher level than you, and have better gear than you, then based on your own statements, does that make them right? Wouldn't your own analogy make me correct and you wrong since I am higher level and have more AA? <br>
<br>
If you're ever taken psychology, you should know that specific examples do not make law. Hell, if you want, I can provide examples of how non-warriors MTed for us on AHR, Emperor, AD, Grummus, VZ, TZ, TT, etc. and lived.

There was a mention earlier of a warrior that tanked an Ent and the druid was OOM at the end of the fight due to the fact that the Ent was unslowed.

However, where was the mention that the 1.5% less damage the warrior took would have caused the druid to be able to keep him alive where a knight would have been dead. Also, where is the mention that the warrior did more damage to the Ent which also reduced the time it took to bring the mob down, and again, further added to the security of the situation. I know it's not a full group exp grind situation, just another one of those situations that makes the WARRIOR stand out in the minds of the non-warrior classes that call the shots on who will replace the main tank. This is becoming less and less about pure exp grouping efficiency and more and more about warrior image overall.

Paladins and Shadowknights can heal themselves enough to supplement the 1.5% avoidance advantage held by warriors in that group. So, there goes the 1.5% theory. The damage aspect; the warrior himself deals more damage than an SK  (non-casting) or paladin. A shadowknight casting offensive spells can easily par or outdamage warriors. Furthermore, both the paladin and shadowknight can keep agro glued onto them, allowing other classes in the group to do more damage (wizards/mages wouldn't have to hold back on nukes for fear of getting too much agro, rogues wouldn't have to evade or stop attacking, monks wouldn't have to FD off or stop attacking, etc.) The warrior on his own will deal more damage, but a Knight will allow the group do deal more damage because the fear of getting agro isn't there. This scenario is FAR from one where warriors stand out.<br>
<br>
Like people here have noted, warriors stand out in scenarios where defensive is required (not useful, required, big difference). Any spot that actually requires defensive wouldn't really be too good of an exp spot, since you could only fight 1 mob every 12 minutes. there are plenty of XP spots out there that don't require defensive.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Wilhelmm D'averam<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Overlord of the Apocalypse</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

The average knight has 700-1k hp less then any warrior in his/her guild. The paladin probably had healers that knew how to heal watching him~<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>With the scenario Dwelfin explained, there's not any substantive difference between a warrior tanking and a knight barring defensive. You see, when a druid is primary healer, there's no real &quot;warrior hitpoint/ac advantage&quot; if a Paladin has all his spells. It evens out because the Paladin has buffs that stack with Pot9, which cut out the &quot;warrior HP/AC advantage&quot; to pretty much nil.<br>
<br>
If a Shaman is doing the primary healing (for instance when duoing with the Shaman) the same, equally equipped Paladin actually has a hitpoint/AC ADVANTAGE over the warrior.

Assuming warrior hp = knight hp + 750 <br>
<br>
Tanking with a druid healer - Warrior will have p/botn (618hp). Paladin will have symbol of marzin, heroic bond, aura of the crusader (1467hp). Paladin will now have 99 hp more then warrior.<br>
<br>
However, this is a moot point. A druid will heal 5075 on a crit NI with marrs gift and all Healing aa's. <br>
<br>
As long as this does not heal the tank to full, it will take the same damage to reduce the tank to where another heal is needed. After the first heal, the hp difference is completly void.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tanking with a Shaman Healer - Paladin will have a 717 hp advantage over a warrior.<br>
<br>
However this means nothing, as long as the max hp of the tank is greater then the amount of damage the shaman can heal constantly (better healing coverage then CH given canni).  In addition, the shaman cannot use torpor/quies on the paladin tank, lowering the average/tick he can heal. <br>
<br>
<br>
The only time hp makes a difference is with a cleric, in which the warrior would have a 408 hp advantage.<br>
<br>
<br>
As to paladin healing, If the paladin is a tank, in a good exp group with constant pulls, the maximum amount a paladin can heal himself is a tad above druid/shaman BoR. It also will not stack with any other HoT, and requires giving up stunning twice a minute after the initial 8 minutes. <p><div align=center> I am<a target=“new” href = http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=429465> Sir Barraind Faylestar, Lord Protector </a> <img border=0 src="http://web.ecomplanet.com/SPEL4787/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/SPEL4787CustomImage039239.gif" />of <a target =“new” href= http://www.evguild.org> The Elitists and Vagrants</a><br><br><i>Don't "just play".

You're absolutely correct - the point I was originally illustrating is that Tanking an unslowed mob for any period of time (as was suggested as a way to offset poor initial aggro) is not a viable idea - even with my much vaunted /disc defensive.<br>
<br>

Exactly - and WITH slow defensive is unneccessary and there is very little extra provided by a warrior to a group over a Knight. The lack of aggro lock is in fact a strong disincentive as it means the slower may not be confident of slowing immediately (to help the group fight effectively) in case of pong.....<br>
<br>
Thanks for the numbers on relative hp totals - it's interesting stuff and there's no reason to disagree with it. All I would say on that point is, WHICHEVER way the buff situation turns out (Warrior &gt; Knight or Knight &gt; Warrior), 700 to 1k hps is no longer a major difference in tanking power when the mobs are hitting 3-500 a pop....The time delay between healing a knight and healing your warrior is going to be a few seconds tops - over the course of a fight that MAY equal one more complete heal over time for the knight. If I have to tank a mob unslowed to gain aggro then that advantage is lost and if I don't gain aggro before slow lands the mana advantage is likely to be lost in ancillary heals anyway...<br>
<br>
If i was playing a healer I would take full control over what a mob hits (and virtually no risk of heal aggro) over the cost of one or two extra heals any day....<br>

<br>
If you are given a way to ensure, or as sure as we have it with stuns, that you keep aggro through the initial few seconds of combat, given the other (though slight) advantages you have, why would most groups want to have a knight?  We do get extras (heals, interrupts, stuns or taps and dots) but give up quite a bit of one to do the other. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure if I know the best way to balance it where it would be more of a tossup for which was preferred, but I do think that going straight aggro manipulation is not the way to go about it.  The problem with this is that the issue lies nearly 100% with straight aggro generation. <br>
<br>
I do most of my grouping within my guild, and always see warriors getting tank spots and not having a problem. It could be because we know how to work with each other giving an advantage over normal pickup groups, but in many cases I do not see the issue as being that great.  <br>
<br>
I know there are problems on both sides seeing the exact reasons the others have, and I know I don't want warriors to be useless, but I dont really want to be back to 2nd choice tank when its the only role I fill, and I can imagine you do not as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dwelfnvhal>DwelfnVhal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/03 6:57:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: lol</span><hr size=1> All I can say is that currently I can tank or I can do nothing of major use. <br>
<br>
Paladins and SK's can and do get groups for what their other abilities offer to a non-optimal group - wether that's enough of a balance or not I can't say...but in the absense of a warrior Knights are now a perfectly acceptable alternative anyway. The reverse is not true. If a group has a main tank of any sort there is virtually no reason to add a warrior because he provides nothing 'extra' in a noticeable sense.<br>
<br>
Now here's the slightly wierd sounding bit. The role of the tank is NOT truely to be the very best at damage mitigation, his primary purpose (so long as he can survive with some amount of efficiency) is to ensure that the mob is hitting one target - himself. As such in a non-specialised situation, aggro control is far more important than mitigation. If we accept that fact then any change to make a warrior more acceptable in his old role has to deal with the aggro issue as it currently stands.<br>
<br>
The warrior has always been a class specialised around the one major role of 'THE TANK'. For this pre-eminence he pays a very high price (no spells, no means to travel faster than runspeed, no way to control adds, no 'get out of jail free' cards, near utter dependance on a group of other people to do ANYTHING worthy of note...) as things stand at the moment he has no major advantage in mitigation (outside of small peaks about 4-5 times an hour) over a knight and far less ability to control the aggro situation - no matter how well timed his taunts, how great the aggro on his weapons (not much use if the skill check fails or they don't proc).<br>
<br>
Whilst i can fully understand your wish to be wanted in groups, can you honestly say that it's fair for a class solely specialised around one function to be on the brink of marginalisation in that function?<br>
<br>
Warriors still get groups yes, but it's my contention that that is now based mostly on perceptions dating back to kunark etc. On anything but exceptional mobs a Knight fulfills the main tank role perfectly adequately. This whole thread was started by someone complaining at the way more and more people are recognising that fact and choosing knights over warriors leaving him with no role.<br>
<br>
Don't underestimate the impact that seeing this inability to do our job 'properly' has on us warriors either. Knowing that at some point in your exp session the RNG is gonna bite you doesn't increase ones enthusiasm, if the problem occurs at the wrong moment it may well cause a lot of disruption or even a TPW. Certainly playing with experienced friends minimises that possibility but it remains far more likely with warrior aggro.<br>
<br>
In the past, whilst that possibility remained frustratingly likely, it was a clear and neccessary trade off to have a tank that could take the beating - no longer is there that justification.<br>
<br>
Either the warriors role needs to be redefined in an exp situation or something has to change - unfortunately I don't see how warriors mitigation can be increased without totally unbalancing every encounter currently in game - to me that leaves aggro control as the simplest route to parity.<br>

This is very true Graal.   I find it the most unfortunate thing about this whole balance issue.   I think that Paladins don't bring enough on the &quot;non-tanking&quot; side to compensate for the loss of a tankling role, and that greatly disappoints me.    If VI ever screwed anything up EVER, it was the focus of Paladins on tanking to the detriment of their other abilities.<br>

Reality is, SK's actually stack much better with warriors than Paladins do because they not only have the ability to generate aggro, but they do a good job at targeting aggro on others.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dwelfnvhal>DwelfnVhal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/03 12:20:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Ok, fair enough</span><hr size=1> I don't see any way around this problem.<br>
<br>
 If we accept that groups only ever pick up a single tank then the Tank with good aggro lock is the choice thats more and more frequently being made (as it gradually percolates that Knights can tank just fine). If warriors gain any ability that brings them close enough to knights aggro control that people see it as worthwhile to group the warrior, then apparently everyone will drop the knights. <br>
<br>
We can talk as much as we like about giving Warriors  'nearly' as much aggro control as the knights but in a group perspective it's always going to be either 'enough control' or 'not enough'.<br>
<br>
There isn't a happy medium in this equation. <br>
<br>
Knights can tank just fine now, they should be able to get groups on a fairly even footing with warriors without an 'unfair' aggro advantage (at least once the myth of massively superior warrior tanking is finally laid to rest). <br>
<br>
The only way I can see this issue being resolved to everyones satisfaction would be to give all plate melee similar aggro control and expand their repertoire of abilities (Especially the warriors! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) so that they are viable in a group outside of the Main Tank role.<br>
<br>
Not that that's gonna happen....<br>

Paladins don't get groups for their secondary abilities, they get groups because the group needs a tank. Once you already have a tank, a paladin has little to offer beyond root parking.<br>

Add pacification to that list, surely? - came in handy when I grouped with a Pally in PoI.<br>

SKs might get groups for snare or FD pulling, but generally they get groups because the group needs a tank. FD pulling isn't really needed in most of PoP.<br>

Ok, you enter plane of whatever, Warrior LFG - every group in zone has a tank - you've just detailed above several extra things that occasionally get you a group - how many of those abilities do warriors get?<br>
