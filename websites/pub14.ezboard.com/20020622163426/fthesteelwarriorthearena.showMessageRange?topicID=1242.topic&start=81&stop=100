Conclusion: Hit Points are what counts for people when fighting Fungus Beasts. My assumption is that all creatures in the same level range are going to show similar results. I have yet to parse out another creature yet though.<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Actually no they don't.<br>
<br>
Look again at the results.<br>
<br>
In all test the mob connects 40% of the time.  We can therefore conclude that Avoidance is UNCHANGED at all AC values.  This fits the hypothesis that Thresher and myself have put forward - that all avoidance is fixed based on class values.<br>
<br>
But look again at the tests, there is a change somewhere between 1080AC and 975AC.  The Avoidance stays the same but the mitigation drops and you start taking 75 damage per hit from a consistant 69 (dude!)<br>
<br>
Again this fits *exactly* the theory.  THe mob is relatively low level and the UPPER cap for the mob is somewhere around 1000AC.  AC past this level has no meaning.  For a higher mo (and other sets of parsed results show this) the AC UPPER cap will be higher.<br>
<br>
This is the point missed by those promoting the theories that there is some fixed, permanent cap.  There isn't.  There is a cap which depends on the level of mob you fight.<br>
<br>
It fits the hypothesis and it fits the empirical evidence.  That's the basis under which you can call something a Fact on scientific principles.<br>
<br>
The theory predicts more.  Keep dropping your Ac till naked.  You will find that the Avoidance doesn;'t change.  The mob will always hit 40% of the time.  but the damage per hit wil continue to rise till at some point (and given the level of mob and my experience of other mobs this will be around 800AC to 850AC) the damage per hit will STOP rising.  This is the LOWER cap.<br>
<br>
(BTW, the existance of this lower cap is what lead some people, including myself, to initially believe AC had little impact *at all* because when Rubicite was the best armour in the game, people simply couldn't get an AC high enough to get to the LOWER cap!)<br>
<br>
Your parses are good and useful but they don't give the conclusion you seem to be saying.<br>
<br>
AC is impacting here, its just only impacting at the lower end because of the low level of the mob.<br>

<br>
the following image was generated with gnuplot, the data is from a logfile i forgot i left on, stretching from level 55 to nearly level 58.  this is all activity in that range, raids included, str from 180-255, dex from 100-180, various ranger ATK buffs sometimes, so on so forth.  it is my unfounded suspicion that these buffs raise the &quot;average ocurring minimum&quot; on the modal (eg DB + (DI * (10..20)) is more common than DB + (DI * (1..10)), and a model of 10 exactly is the most frequent).<br>
<br>
i wrote a quick awk script which produced the frequency of times i hit for each amount.  then used gnuplot to produce a graph.  on the X axis you'll see an amount I hit for.  on the Y axis you'll see the number of times i hit (anything) for that amount.  the results are not as evenly distributed as one might have thought.<br>
<br>
the slash data includes both a Short Sword of the Morning and the paladin Epic, Fiery Defender.<br>
<br>
the pierce data is /only/ a 30/37 velium type lance, which is what i used when i didn't need to bash prior to getting epic.<br>
<br>
the 'all' data is the sum of the two, it seemed useful at the time, but clearly isn't.<br>
<br>
the resulting area under the graph reveals that i'm a paladin.  film at 11.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mercenary.net/LoadedDice.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
you can see how the slash data is basically comprised of 2 sets of data organized similarly to the pierce data.  this makes the pierce data the most useful for visualizing individual hit distribution.<br>
<br>
so, paying attention to only the pierce data, note the 4 discrete zones produced.<br>
<br>
1) the preamble, a relatively large spike at what we calculate is the weapon's minimum damage.  i seem to recall some patch message ages ago that said we'd hit for minimum more often than missing now.  rounding up the not-quite-zeroes, i guess.<br>
<br>
2) the loading sawtooth.  randonmess isn't, very.  it seems either odd or even modals are statistically less likely.  i'm too lazy to figure out which.  note that the slope is 'generally up' and then 'flattens out' prior to the next zone.<br>
<br>
3) the average.  5,000 froglok scars agree, with any given weapon, if you hit, you're probably hitting for this number.<br>
<br>
4) the trailing slope.  a straight line (the jags in the graph in this area are too small to infer any meaning) down to your max.<br>
<br>
<br>
at any rate, i found it educationally amusing, since i was anticipating a bell curve.  i wasn't hoping to answer anything by posting, just offering a new avenue for someone more interested to continue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugimmelgreatheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gimmel Greatheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ckwmail.com/pictures/fologo.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 5:05:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1242.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.artemisgames.com/images/gimmel1trans.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ubermob tanking</span><hr size=1> Somethings that could still use looking at I think:<br>

The second zone, the &quot;loading sawtooth&quot; was what I saw and found was analagous to NPC damage. <br>
I'll repeat it, maybe it will make more sense now.<br>
<br>
The peaks during this zone occur at X values 1 through 20, with 20 being the modal damage itself (huge spike) in formula DB + X*DI<br>
<br>
The DI for PC damage is the weapon damage, in the right click info of weapons, divided by 10. <br>
The DB is the damage bonus that we all talk about, the one that's displayed on the right click info of weapons.<br>
<br>
The first, min damage spike is DB + DI, just like min damage for NPCs. The modal damage is DB + 20*DI, just like _max_ damage for NPCs. This agrees with the old formula modal damage = DB + 2*weapon damage, because DI = weapon damage/10.<br>
<br>
This accounts for hits in the off hand as well: the min hit is DB + DI. But in the off hand, DB is 0. So the min hit is just DI, which is usually just 1 because it is weapon damage divided by 10. But some weapons have high enough damage to make the min hit 2.<br>
<br>
There are some less likely hits in between the peaks, unlike NPC damage.<br>
<br>
So, your first 3 zones, except for the trash between the peaks, are analagous to NPC damage.<br>
<br>
Sorry if this didn't make sense the first time I typed it up.<br>

<br>
First assume NPC's act in most ways like PC's except they aren't level restricted and have some AI behind them.<br>
<br>
Second assume that the equation given for damage: DB + x*DI, where DB stands for Damage Bonus, DI stands for Damage Interval, and x is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), is the same for NPC's as it is for PC's.<br>
<br>
The mystery is X. Lets assume that X is a function of:<br>
<br>
- Class<br>
- a mitigation factor (ac)<br>
- attack value <br>
<br>
Lets assume class is some constant, the money question of course is, how do Mitigation AC and ATK relate? This is what has been asked since the dawn of time. <br>
<br>
Lets assume that Z = (1 - AC/Atk).<br>
<br>
AC = players Mitigation AC (best case right now is about 1200, which would be about 1750 displayed in inventory)<br>
Atk = Mobs Attack (assume 2000 is max)<br>
<br>
Z indicates how well (or badly) a PC can tank.<br>
<br>
Example 1:<br>
<br>
Best Mitigation AC = 1200<br>
Best Mob Atk = 2000<br>
<br>
Z = (1 - 0.6) = 0.4<br>
<br>
Take Z times the range, Z*20 = 8. Assume this value is your modal on the bell curve of X probability, you get the following modal hits using the equation provided by Steel Warriors:<br>
<br>
Cazic: 360 Damage per hit<br>
Yelinak: 300 damage per hit<br>
<br>
This indicates the best case tanking of the mobs above (no defensive).<br>
<br>
If Mitigation falls off, lets say to 1000, the modal values become:<br>
<br>
Cazic: 400<br>
Yelinak: 350<br>
<br>
Now take the monk class which probably has about 800 Mitigation AC with stellar gear, you have the following modals:<br>
<br>
Cazic: 440<br>
Yelinak: 400<br>
<br>
This is of course assuming both CT and Yelinak have 2000 attack. Those numbers are per hit modal values. Whats really cool is that you can figure out exactly what CT / Yelinak etc, atk rating is:<br>
<br>
Atk = MitAC / ((1 - (ModalHit - DB)/20*DI))<br>
<br>
Where MitAC is your mitigation AC<br>
Modal Hit is the modal damage done to you by the mob, from a log file<br>
DB is already provided for CT, Yelinak, and mobs in the thread<br>
DI is already provided for CT, Yelinak and the mobs in the thread<br>
<br>
Now whats really really interesting is you can use this exact same formula to determine what damage you do to mobs.<br>
<br>
Assume that Creator has 2000 mitigation AC and the best player character (while cursed) has 1200 ATK. Also assume that Z can never be less than 1, and you get:<br>
<br>
Z = 1, which means PC damage to Creator will be modal around the dmg bonus + DI which is 13 dmg (1hndr - main - 20 delay). Which means 50% (bell curve) of hits are 13 damage.<br>
<br>
This is verifiable with a log parse. But this seems true based on our fights with him.<br>
<br>
By the same token you can determine what the Creator's AC is by:<br>
<br>
Atk(1 - ((ModalHit - DB)/20*DI)) = AC<br>
<br>
Where Atk is your atk,<br>
Modal hit is your modal hit<br>
and AC is the Mobs Mitigation AC.<br>
<br>
Would be interesting to plug these into a few log parses and see what comes out. <p><font face="Arial" size="1"><a href="http://darkhorizon.angrybunni.org/Database/Characters.asp?ID=459&Style=Wyld">&#948;&#1112;&#953;&#1087;</a> <<a href="http://darkhorizon.angrybunni.org">Ðâ&#1107;&#311; &#294;&#963;&#1075;&#953;&#950;&#963;&#1087;</a>><br>

<br>
The above post (by the paladin) says that with and without armor he was hit 40% of the time. Suddenly we may have values for Combat stability, and Combat agility. <br>
<br>
It would also imply that all armor worn is ONLY Mitigation AC--and raise the question as to what kind of AC buffs are. As seeing how the mechanisms work, this would lead me to ask, which of the skills controls to hit, and which damage--I suspsect that To Hit is controlled by offence (much like avoidance seems to be governed by defesice) and damge is controled by the specific weapon skill.<br>
<br>
Aslo this would settle mob (and PC) attack and to damage ratings into a reletively intuative 10 * level (at max) pattern--though this may be a false linkage. <br>
<br>
We need soemone at 60th (naked no less) to go get hit on by a young kodaik and see if that 40% hit rate stays. <p><a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16294>Kailyn</a> <a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/> Longstride</a> Warlord of the North, <a href=http://pub69.ezboard.com/bunleashedeq>Unleashed</a><br>

<br>
The last posted set of results was taken from a mob that was hitting for higher than the previous mob.<br>
<br>
Tests 1, 2, 3 and 5 were taken against a weaker mob.<br>
<br>
Tests 4 and 6 were taken against a stronger mob.<br>
<br>
The difference in average hits for tests 4 and 6 was only 3.66 and therefore not a huge enough swing to prove or disprove. More tests need to be run.<br>
<br>
I personally think you may be onto somethinf Ed but unfortunately this data does not significantly back your data up, neither does it disprove it as they are small samples.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Gjin's theorum about the Z factor is interesting and a worthwhile avenue of exploration. I feel quite certain that a mob's AC and your ATK is compared in some way to get a range of possible hits and a modal.<br>
<br>
It could also be:<br>
<br>
/random 20 - [(ATK - AC)/1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  = z<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
(/random 20 + ATK/10) - (/random 20 + AC/10) = x<br>
<br>
These are also rough guesses and mainly just guides for possible working formulas where the numerical values can be swapped for whatever is found to be the case.<br>
<br>
The first case seems unlikely as it would cause either:<br>
 a perfectly uniform distribution (ATK=AC) or;<br>
 a uniform distibution in a limited range with the exception of either min (AC &gt; ATK) or max (ATK &gt; AC) values which would be higher to compensate for the missing possible x values.<br>
This does not fit our working model!<br>
<br>
The second case seems more plausible but probably not the final equation, more likely a stepping stone.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to when the Roleplay version of this comes out and we get manuals stating how to find out if you just and how much damage, Hopefully it is based on actual game mechanics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukaledan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaledan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/10/02 3:30:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1242.topic&index=88>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ubermob tanking</span><hr size=1> I think you can reproduce the graph of PC damage by the following system:<br>

K2% chance of hitting for DB + random(20) x DI (normal hit)<br>

K4% chance of hitting for DB + random(20) x DI + random(20) x DI x SF (bonus hit)<br>

Its the K4 region which is not present in MOB attacks. It forms a shallow bell curve on either side of the modal hit, implying it is formed from the sum of two random rolls. SF it the strength/level factor that accounts for high level ogres hitting harder than low level wood elves with the same weapon.<br>
It overlaps with the K2 hits, which explains the sawtooth pattern on the left side of the modal hit.<br>

what causes K1, K2, K3 and K4 to vary? Strength, level, buffs, AC, disciplines, debuffs, etc?<br>

what is the formula for SF?<br>

Interesting results.<br>
<br>
FYI, previous histogram analysis has generally showed a pretty flat distribution outside of the Minimum and Modal damage (much closer to your piercing results).<br>
<br>
What is intersting is that the Slash results show this distinct downward trend in the distribution.  That's fairly unique amongst the data I've see (for values *before* the modal, at least).<br>
<br>
Strange and such a large sample too.<br>

There is *very* little data on this.  In fact I can only think of one analysis posted to the Ranger Glade well over 18 months ago.<br>
<br>
It concluded that identical AC gains from Agility and Armour had identical results.  10AC by raising your Agility 50pts had the exact same effect on damage taken as 10AC from adding an Ac6 item.<br>

<br>
You're making the assumption that the negative effect of being overweight is actually tied to the gains Monks get from being Monks.  That may or may not be the case but whether it is or not it strikes me as a dangerous assumption.<br>
<br>
I expect it to be 100% Avoidance because we can see empirically that Monks get hit less.  That's what seperates them.<br>
<br>
In any case it doesn't *matter* because it is a fixed value the player can't effect.  And as we can see more and more clearly the &quot;concepts&quot; of Avoidance and Mitigation are UTTERLY IRRELEVANT.  Because a player can only ever effect Mitigation.  So AC is AC is AC in terms of what a character can do to effect their toon.<br>

<br>
You remember when we had Broca's thread on ac, and in the discussion we mentioned a warrior tanking Yelinak. Anyway, he got between 3-4% AC effectiveness for 100 ac added.<br>
<br>
Also you remember many many posts that say that only after adding an incremental amount of AC (usually 100) that a difference was made in actual effectiveness?<br>
<br>
Allright here we go ....<br>
<br>
Example Cazic:<br>
<br>
Warrior 1 Goes from a 440 (800 mitAC) to a 400 (1000 mitAC) modal hit on Cazic. This is an increase of 200 AC: which is 4.5% tanking increase per 100AC added. Ref. Yelinak post.<br>
<br>
The big scary last point:<br>
<br>
To go from a modal 8 to a modal 7 in X probability, use the following formula for Cazic:<br>
<br>
Modal 8 was shown to be 1200 Mitigation AC in my above post. To be a better tank and get your Modal to Modal 7, you need:<br>
<br>
(1 - AC/2000)*20 = 7 <br>
<br>
Solving for AC yeilds ...... 1300.<br>
<br>

The problem with this theory is that it doesn't produce anything like the damage histograms seen from players.<br>
<br>
I haven't seen a damage histogram from a mob, but I would bet my epic it looks something like:<br>
<br>
- a spike at DB + DI<br>
<br>
- equal value peaks at DB + 2 DI, DB + 3 DI, ... , DB + 19 DI<br>
<br>
- a spike at DB + 20 DI<br>
<br>
This is the same as that of a level 1 PC, who doesn't get any bonus hits - I guess mobs lack the stats or skills needed to get those.<br>
<br>
What mitigation AC does is change the relative height of the two spikes, and the flat area between them.<br>
<br>
For the fungus beast example posted earlier, we have DB = 31, DI = 5.<br>
<br>
If you have extremely high mitigation, you might get 5% chance of a normal hit, 5% chance of a max hit, and 90% chance of a min hit.<br>
<br>
That would lead to an average damage per hit of 43.<br>
<br>
With very low mitigation, you might get 5% chance of a normal hit, 5% chance of a minimum hit, and 90% chance of a max hit.<br>
<br>
That would lead to an average damage per hit of 123.<br>

Both. ATK controls your max hit up until a certain threshold. The absolute max hit for a non monk melee is 5.7 times weapon damage + damage bonus. The damage bonus would obviously be zero in the offhand. The max hit for a 10 damage 1 hander would be 68 in mainhand for a 60, and 57 in offhand for a 60. Maybe it is the same for monks, I don't know. Anyone have any parsed data that disputes this?<br>
<br>
I think that STR and ATK is what determines the frequency and amount of hits higher than mode. The generally accepted rule is that below level 20, a melee cannot hit for more than mode. This isn't actually the case. I noticed it first on my ogre warrior when he was level 18 or so, but he was hitting higher than that. With HoS and a STR buff stacked, he had 255 STR. He was hitting for 36 max with a 17 damage 2 hander. That is 2 more than the modal hit. He had those same buffs at earlier levels, but wasn't hitting higher than mode. I attribute that to the increase in atk from offense and weapon skill increases. I did not see hits higher than mode without the buffs however. <br>
<br>
I don't know if anyone can use that, but hopefully it helps. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

I need to see what assumptions you are making to get purely mitigation AC. If you don't know then that is fine and your algorithm is a hypothesis only. An avenue of exploration.<br>
<br>
As a note on avoidance vs mitigation AC.If we were to test a level x Warrior with full armour on (non-stat giving) and then with no armour on versus the same mob and the results were to show that mitigation was affected but avoidance was not then we can imply from this that armour has no (or an insignificantly small) effect on the probability of avoiding a mobs blow.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, we can NOT imply from this that {Mitigation AC = Naked AC} and therefore {Total AC - Naked AC = Mitigation AC}.<br>
<br>
The reason being that: a) Naked AC may be completely Mitigation AC still and therefore Avoidance AC may simply not be shown at all in the visible AC stats or; b) Naked AC may be a combination of both Mitigation and Avoidance AC. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usylphan2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sylphan2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 9:49:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1242.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hey Gjin...</span><hr size=1> Here is a very abbreviated version of the AC formula that's useful for this discussion.<br>
<br>
For War, Pal, SK, Dru, Clr, Shm, Brd, Rog, Ran (but not Monk), the formula is:<br>
<br>
Avoidance = A + (D * 16/9)<br>
Mitigation =  (B/4) + (D/3) + (E * 4/3)<br>
Displayed AC = (Avoidance + Mitigation) * 1000/847<br>
where<br>
A = a factor based on agility, ranges from approx. -24 to 75.<br>
B = AC from buffs.  Inspect the spellfile for details.  Skin Like Nature for example adds 55.<br>
D = your Defense skill<br>
E = equipment AC.  Add up the ACs of all equipment worn.<br>
<br>
It's all done with integers -- truncate the fractions at every point possible.<br>
<br>
Can I prove it?  Almost... proved it all except I'm not sure whether the (D/3) factor should be in avoidance or mitigation, or maybe it's a third, seperate, factor.  For casters the avoidance is the same but the mitigation uses different divisors.  That's why I've assumed the (D/3) is part of mitigation, because it's also different for casters.  Monks... well, monks are all screwed up by that weight limit thing.<br>
