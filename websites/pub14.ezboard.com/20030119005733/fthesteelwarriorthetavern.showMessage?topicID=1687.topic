After seeing some of the responses I realized that it’s completely unreliable for someone who has never played a class to rate it and that there needs to be some criteria to rate by.  With that in mind, I wonder if each of you would mind taking some time out to answer the following poll.  I plan to post the same poll on other class specific boards and post the results when I get them.<br>
<br>
Class Balance Criteria<br>
<br>
Answer on a level of 1-5 with 1 being the lowest  (not at all) and 5 being the highest (very much so)<br>
<br>
Ability to solo effectively.  Does this class possess the tools to solo with an acceptable experience/downtime ratio to make soloing a viable option for experience gain?<br>
<br>
Ability to make money with innate abilities-Does this class possess innate skills or abilities that allow it to make money from other players outside of the melee setting?<br>
<br>
Ability to make money through farming-Does this class possess the ability to farm items effectively enough to make it a viable option for making money?<br>
<br>
Group contribution- Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a group?<br>
<br>
Raid contribution-Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a raid setting?<br>
<br>
Self-Sufficiency-Does this class possess the tools to travel safely, get out of trouble or does it have to rely heavily on other classes for survival?  <br>
<br>
Desirability in Groups-Is this a highly desired class for groups?<br>
<br>
Perception of Class-How well is this class and the abilities of this class understood by other players?<br>
<br>
Equipment-Does this class have a good variety of equipment available to enhance it’s specific abilities?<br>
<br>
Expansions and Upgrades-Has this class received helpful new abilities/skills as the game has progressed?<br>
<br>
Overall-Is this class properly balanced?<br>
<br>

Pre-PoP things were really starting go nicely, but now, 60+, soloing is fubard.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ability to make money through farming-Does this class possess the ability to farm items effectively enough to make it a viable option for making money?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Yes, I feel we can farm very effectively, but not for anything worth more than 5k or so.<br>
3<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Group contribution- Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a group?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Variety of skills? Nah. Necessary in groups (esp in PoP, not so much pre-PoP)? You betcha.<br>
4<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Raid contribution-Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a raid setting?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
See above.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Desirability in Groups-Is this a highly desired class for groups?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Thanks to PoP, yes.<br>
5<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Perception of Class-How well is this class and the abilities of this class understood by other players?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
No one understand the true difficulties such as mob placement, weapon choices, gear choices, balancing hp/ac/etc. People see it as a hit &quot;a&quot; then the Taunt Button and you're set, which it isn't at all - that is probably 10% of all the things we do.<br>
I give it a 2 for pre-60, and a 4 for post-60.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Equipment-Does this class have a good variety of equipment available to enhance it’s specific abilities?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I'd say so...tho every does nowadays, we are certainly better off now with our 3 bags of clickies than with the few peices of Cobalt we had earlier.<br>
4<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Expansions and Upgrades-Has this class received helpful new abilities/skills as the game has progressed?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
After a rough ride with PAL/SHDs, I'd say our spot as the true blue MT has been very well solidified with PoP.<br>
4<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Overall-Is this class properly balanced?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
My only complaints are that I would like to have more abilities (triggered one and innate) to increase our DPS and viability in more situations, /disciplines 61-65, and a new damn level 65 title! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168211" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.imahosting.com/sigs/baadsignew.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:medium;">{52 Champion} <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168211" target="top">Baadan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> (Half Elf) &lt;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/bdragonmawguild" target="top">Dragon Maw</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&gt;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->{37 Necromancer} <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=54401" target="top">Azumaan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> (Erudite) &lt;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/bdragonmawguild" target="top">Dragon Maw</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&gt; </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baadan>Baadan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.imahosting.com/sigs/posticon.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/13/02 12:43:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khumak>Khumak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/13/02 3:10:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1687.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Class Balance Questionairre</span><hr size=1> Answer on a level of 1-5 with 1 being the lowest (not at all) and 5 being the highest (very much so)<br>

1 - At level 65 No<br>
<br>

<br>

3 - We would do fine farming certain trade skill supplies or very low end loot in low end dungeons.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Group contribution- Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a group?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
3 - Not really a variety, we can take hits and do mediocre dps for the group. But thats about all it takes to get a spot. At 65 we're pretty easily replaced with other classes to fill the 'tank' role while providing other services to the group we can't. We bring nothing unique to the table other than the ability to hit /disc def every 12.5 minutes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Raid contribution-Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a raid setting?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
4 - Harder but not impossible to raid without us, we're only really needed for certain Boss Mobs though, but easily replaced in most situations.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Self-Sufficiency-Does this class possess the tools to travel safely, get out of trouble or does it have to rely heavily on other classes for survival? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
3 - If potions and clicky items count. <br>
1 - If they dont.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Desirability in Groups-Is this a highly desired class for groups?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
3 - Most groups want a 'Tank', we are one of several classes who can manage this. We don't bring much extra to the table that would give us an edge over certain other classes if a choice has to be made between the two. There is more desiribility for the role we can play rather than us as the specific class who can play it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Perception of Class-How well is this class and the abilities of this class understood by other players?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
3 - Some people expect too much, some people don't expect enough. Depends on the situation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Equipment-Does this class have a good variety of equipment available to enhance it’s specific abilities?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
2 - Most of our best equipment availible to us is also availible to most other classes, doesn't set us apart or enhance our abilities any better than any other class.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Expansions and Upgrades-Has this class received helpful new abilities/skills as the game has progressed?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
2 - Promising abilities on paper, poor implementation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Overall-Is this class properly balanced?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
3 - Defensively too many classes fill our shoes as well (or better) than we can. Doesn't mean I think we need to be better defensively, means I think others shouldn't be as good. Offensively we have alot of abilities with good potential that are poorly implemented. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=160002"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimtag.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnimwit>Gnimwit</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res00jhn/gnimflag.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/13/02 3:32:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varaho1>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 1187<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/13/02 3:49:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1687.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Class Balance Questionairre</span><hr size=1> Ability to solo effectively.

Rangers can solo, but archery kiting is horribly slow and inefficient. At minimum, it requires cetain AA skills to be practile, but is still slow.<br>

Occasionally someone is looking to buy an item I can forage. However, I can make much more plat just killing mobs for loot than foraging tradeskill items to sell.<br>

Besides being a damage-dealing class, we have nukes, dots and some kickass buffs. If the tank is so-so about being able to hold agro, I can just pull out of melee range and shoot arrows for hours on end.<br>

On raids, we're a low-agro damage dealer class. This might not seem like much not having to heal someone regular is a big plus. When things got ugly, I have used my puiny ranger heals to keep myself alive or do spot heals [usually for casters.]<br>

Rangers have some itemization issues from Velious onward. Much of our gear doesn't even enhance our primary stats or is too weak in comparison to comparable armour for other classes. Ranger-specific spells have been farmed out to other classes via armour effects, with no compensation at all to rangers in terms of getting equipment spell effect of equal benefit.<br>

Kunark brought epics. They were great at the time but at this point are just holding rangers back from getting good weapon and non-weapon haste item upgrades. Planes of Power brought us some really nice bows, but we're generally lacking in other areas.<br>

Warriors in a Nutshell? <br>

1. The Class everyone wants to be until they played one than go log on their mains to re-equip their pet warrior.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2. Gluttons for punishment who feel nothing but sheer pleasure at stoving some poor critters head in with no care for personal gain so other classes can be better equipped and fight over the l3wts; and than go about their way.<br>

1. No. We are on the opposite spectrum of soloing.<br>
<br>
Ability to make money with innate abilities-Does this class possess innate skills or abilities that allow it to make money from other players outside of the melee setting?<br>
1. Warriors do not contribute any innate abilities that could be used to make money.<br>

3. At a certain point in a warriors life, they can effectively farm fine steel dropping mobs for a slow income.<br>

4. Tanking. <br>
<br>

3. Tanking, which doesn't require a lot of warriors<br>

4. Yes, for most groups.<br>
<br>
Perception of Class-How well is this class and the abilities of this class understood by other players?<br>
3. A significant number of players still do not understand how taunt works and how reliable it is. Same goes for agro management.<br>
<br>
Equipment-Does this class have a good variety of equipment available to enhance it’s specific abilities?<br>
5. Yes, equipment is the bane of the warrior class.<br>
<br>
Expansions and Upgrades-Has this class received helpful new abilities/skills as the game has progressed?<br>
2. Warriors are retarded when it comes to gaining new abilities / skills. We can't seem to learn anything new. The only upgrades that came with expansions have been changing the encounters to force the use of warriors. (which, as time goes on, isn't exactly proving true either).<br>
<br>
Overall-Is this class properly balanced?<br>
Sadly, Yes. In the scope of the game, warriors are balanced. I think of them as broken, but balanced. The things that make them broken are the same things that make them balanced. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=remorsedarqroft>Remorse Darqroft</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/16/02 12:26:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1687.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Class Balance Questionairre</span><hr size=1> Ability to solo effectively.

<br>
1 - Soloing non exsistant in comparison to other classes. We are only ahead of rogues.  Definately opposite side of the spectrum we NEEEEEEED groups<br>
<br>
Ability to make money with innate abilities-Does this class possess innate skills or abilities that allow it to make money from other players outside of the melee setting?<br>
<br>
1 -  What innate abilities? No KEI, No Rez's, No Ports, No Summon Corpses... unless its a trade skill you are refering to... however that wouldnt be 'innate' so I take that as a 'no'.<br>
<br>
Ability to make money through farming-Does this class possess the ability to farm items effectively enough to make it a viable option for making money?<br>
<br>
2 - Forget about farming quality items because we cant solo in the first place, so we're only left with Fine Steel farms and even then we lack DPS in comparison to other classes that farm those<br>
<br>
Group contribution- Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a group?<br>
<br>
2 - Tanking is all we offer with VERY poor 'innate' ability for maintaining agro so our &quot;variety of skills to offer&quot; are REALLY lacking though I give it a 2 instead of a 1 because tanking is darn important! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Raid contribution-Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a raid setting?<br>
<br>
3 - generally only 1 Warrior has a role the others just dps .. occasions you may get a chance to add tank<br>
<br>
Self-Sufficiency-Does this class possess the tools to travel safely, get out of trouble or does it have to rely heavily on other classes for survival? <br>
<br>
1 - no 'innate' invis or sow (unless RS3) or FD or mez or anything to that nature, that may help travelling around and encountering a problem<br>
<br>
Desirability in Groups-Is this a highly desired class for groups?<br>
<br>
2 - We only fill one spot ... Tank spot ... and now generally people are starting to notice its better to have a Pally / SK for grinds due to utility and AGRO (plays a huge part in end game) so divide the 1 tank spot in a group by three classes with us being on the bottom end of preference<br>
<br>
Perception of Class-How well is this class and the abilities of this class understood by other players?<br>
<br>
3 - Knowledge is average.. I think many forget about decent mob placing, and also that we have the /shield feature to help us out alittle... <br>
<br>
Equipment-Does this class have a good variety of equipment available to enhance it’s specific abilities?<br>
<br>
1 - EB items drop only off like 5 mobs or so .. IF that .. VERY poor progression of warrior items.  Anything good that drops tends to be ALL / ALL with mana so we get forgotten.<br>
<br>
Expansions and Upgrades-Has this class received helpful new abilities/skills as the game has progressed?<br>
<br>
1 - let me see after defensive in Kunark .. we've received AE TAUNT .. thats IT .. unless you want to count War Cry and IMPROVED War Cry, as well as improved Bind Wound also.  Opps forgot the /sheild *shrugs* .. generally not THAT great considering 75% dmg taken OVERALL<br>
<br>
Overall-Is this class properly balanced?<br>
1.7 - is my avg rating .. 17 points out of 10 categories .. this class is far from balanced I hate to say it, however my prediction is that things will get worse for the warrior.  Due to all these reasons I have decided to put my 65 Warr on hold while I re-roll a Shammy! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ..

Does this class possess the tools to solo with an acceptable experience/downtime ratio to make soloing a viable option for experience gain?<br>
<br>
1 - Only rogues are worse than us, and actually, they can be better against caster mobs because they have a higher dps. Of course, over 60 soloing is impossible unless you can snare kite or root kite (or charm). On a side note, we do have a war only 50% slow (with crappy dps to today's standard) weapon that allow us to ghetto group in our 50-60 days without slower.<br>
<br>
Ability to make money with innate abilities-Does this class possess innate skills or abilities that allow it to make money from other players outside of the melee setting?<br>
<br>
1 - We have nothing. On top of that, the days of warriors abusing NBG makes us the losers in term of cash in groups.<br>
<br>
Ability to make money through farming-Does this class possess the ability to farm items effectively enough to make it a viable option for making money?<br>
<br>
1 - The only thing we could farm can be farmed by others more efficiently. We need raid-size groups to get decent equipement except for the crafted ntov-level armor that was introduced late SoL.<br>
<br>
Group contribution- Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a group?<br>
<br>
3 - Tanking is our primary role. However, /shield, ae taunt, defensive do wonders for emergencies in groups, especially when we are there only for dps (which isnt too bad when we're in the back of the mob). I group often with a pally who does the main tanking and i bring to that group things i couldnt do if i had to main tank as well.  <br>
<br>
Raid contribution-Does this class have a variety of skills which make it valuable in a raid setting?<br>
<br>
4 - We really dont stack well. But on almost every raids, you dont have a choice of having a warrior to tank the mob until its slowed or defensive tank it until it dies. Once again, its not the variety of skills that makes us necessary on a lot of raids. Also, there's a lot of perception from the others that come into play. As long as people think we're needed for a lot of the raids, we bring something. As soon as they will realize a mob doesnt need defensive and pally have as much hp, our value will fade.<br>
<br>
Self-Sufficiency-Does this class possess the tools to travel safely, get out of trouble or does it have to rely heavily on other classes for survival? <br>
<br>
1 - We're the worst in that department. Thank god for PoP teleports. You almost need a cobalt bracer, a quillmane cloak, a pair of VS legs just to be able to do what other classes do in term of travelling around. And even then, we're more at risk than most of them because we have no way of getting out of there if things go wrong.<br>
<br>
Desirability in Groups-Is this a highly desired class for groups?<br>
<br>
3 - Pally and SK make for more efficient tanks than we do in groups. But people still want warriors for some reason in PoP so we are semi desirable.<br>
<br>
Perception of Class-How well is this class and the abilities of this class understood by other players?<br>
<br>
3- Most people have no clue how a warrior works. Most of them are under the impression we mitigate way more than every other classes, that we have more hp, etc... Most think that taunt works whenever we press it. More importantly, people have the false impression that we can move proximity-based-aggro mobs when they are unstunnable and sitting in the middle of the chanters AEing...<br>
<br>
Equipment-Does this class have a good variety of equipment available to enhance it’s specific abilities?<br>
<br>
3 - Warrior is the most equipment dependant class i have played. Even taking a break from the game for 2 month is enough to make you slip from main tanking often to being warrior number 10 in guild. We have a lot of possibilities in term of proccing weapons (i carry snare/stun/debuff/hate inducing/slowing/flash of light/rune/lifetap/tash/avatar proccing weapons). Its awesome for ghetto groups assuming the procs hit. Unfortunately, the ratio on most of these weapons is so bad you have to kill your dps to pray for a proc to happen. While we have a lot of variety, we almost have no choice toward the end game if we want to keep aggro. The variety dies somewhere after kunark/mid velious stage. <br>
<br>
Expansions and Upgrades-Has this class received helpful new abilities/skills as the game has progressed?<br>
<br>
2 - We received upgrades during velious through items as every other classes did too. SoL brought only AE taunt being useful (and only because it is our ONLY way to taunt successfully). We also received EB weapons because other classes were doing a lot more damage and we were showing the whole world how crappy we are at doing our 1 job. But this isnt really an improvement, more of a crippling blow for our class. /shield did try to give us tools to do more in end-sol/pop, but its only half usable because of the discipline and range limitations.<br>
<br>
Overall-Is this class properly balanced?<br>
3 - Its semi balanced. We are needed on raids (try raiding with 0 warriors) but we stack poorly. We are welcome to groups in most case because of historical reasons and false perceptions than true power. We are totally group dependant, which was fine until other classes were superior to us or close enough in every aspects. Then again, pallies and sk used to have no group at all, so i guess we shouldnt complain.<br>

i'm going to have to slightly disagree wich baadan on this point, though i think he has it mostly right in the rest of his post.<br>
<br>
warriors haven't gotten any upgrades, except a slight effectiveness upgrade in taunt, and one class ability (AE taunt).  we get some great AA (CA,CS,ND), but so does everyone else..  so pretty much useful class-specific upgrades has been nil.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/ssbbrothar/VeraOL2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
