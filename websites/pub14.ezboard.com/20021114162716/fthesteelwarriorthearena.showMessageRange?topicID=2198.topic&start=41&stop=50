<br>
The top couple guilds farm the heck out of ST.   Everyone has 1-2 primal weapons.   About the time a 3rd guild starts getting ready to work on ST, one of the top guilds release the sleeper.<br>
<br>
The result - Top two guilds got in weeks what will take the 3rd and 4th guilds months to do.<br>
<br>
The top two guilds are able to farm the heck out of Vulak before the 3rd and 4th guilds are able to handle Aary.   About the time that the 3rd and 4th guilds finally kill Aary, the top guilds complain that Vulak is WAY to easy and should be nerfed.   Vulak disappears.<br>
<br>
The result - Top two guilds have access to tons of top end items that guilds 3-4 don't have access two.<br>
<br>
SoL comes out.   The top two guilds have the gear/DPS to hand the tough Ssra bosses, so they get even further ahead.   Guilds 3-4 are still farming NToV, but without the opportunity to get Vulak loot.<br>
<br>
The result - The gap between guilds 1-2 and 3-4 grows even wider.<br>
<br>
About the time that guilds 3-4 are able to handle some of the minor Ssra bosses and guild 1 has moved onto VT and guild 2 isn't far behind, the resist changes dramatically increase the difficulty of these encounters.   Guilds 1-2 farmed these bosses before the changes and aren't really interested them anymore.   <br>
<br>
The result - Once again, the gap grows.<br>
<br>
With the recent ST changes and increase in power available in PoP, guilds 3 and 4 will now have the DPS (from more Primal) and character power (new skills to make up for lack of Vulak loot) to take on the  Ssra bosses.   But....the nerfs coming down the pike will make these encounters significantly harder than they were before.   Guilds 1-2 were able to farm top Ssra bosses and VT without any competition.  They are now fully powered to take on top PoP encounters.   Guild 3-4 are still going to struggle trying to kill Ssra bosses and even get into VT.<br>
<br>
The result - yep, you guessed it, the gap grows yet again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I guess from a business perspective, this all makes sense.   They keep things new and interesting for the top 1-2 guilds on the server.  They get many opportunities to get gear fairly easily before the encounter gets nerfed.   They are the CARROT.<br>
<br>
The rest of us see all these great new items show up on the different websites.   That carrot entices us to keep playing.   We keep thinking that someday, we might reach there too.   But the reality is that it will never happen.   I believe this is purposeful.   They want us to keep trying to reach the carrot, but they keep raising it and raising it to keep out of the range of 95% of the players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwandork.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wandor K</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 749<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 11:58:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2198.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The CH nerf will eventually be a WARRIOR nerf too.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Really? You have tried the retuned encounters? Frankly, I think this is bunk. I am in one of the 3-4 guilds on my server. Yes we are a bit behind the top guilds, but we are eons ahead of where they where when they got to ST, NToV, the 3 kings. Generally, the first time we try a mob, it goes down. We cleared NToV in 2 days the first time we went in. We didn't have to spend weeks learning NToV so we have been able to farm it more effectively. When we finally get a shot at the SoL ubers, we go in with tons of AAs, NToV AND a lot of SoL gear, and from the look of things, probably a lot of level 61-65 people. We will be able to tear through Ssra and then VT at a much faster rate than the top guilds did because we have more gear, levels, skills available to us than they did. The gap from guild #1 to guild #5 on any given server may fluctuate some, it grows at the beginning of an expansion, then quickly narrows toward the release of the next one, but it certainly is not getting considerable larger. <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial"><img src="http://www.bfdesigns.net/eq/wandor_sig.jpg"><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6102" target="_blank"><b>Moordian</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=353608" target="_blank"><b>Wandorfu</b></a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.exarch.net/"><b>Fusion of Flame</b></a></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udeloresmulva.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delores Mulva</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 1:08:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2198.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: the CH nerf.</span><hr size=1> Ainmer, changing CH and nerfing mod2 doesn't unbreak the game, unless by &quot;broken&quot; you mean &quot;it doesn't let me go AFK every 20 minutes&quot;. CH is still the most efficient heal in the game. CH is still the highest healing per second heal in the game (there's one paladin spell that'll be higher, but it has a massive recast time attached). So you'll still get CH chains healing the main tank. Nothing changes.<br>
<br>
What would change things is a fundamental re-working of encounters. A re-working that would incorporate features like the following, designed specifically to mess with a CH chain:<br>
<br>
(1) Massive AoE, relatively minor melee damage from an encounter mob. Trakanon was a good example of this. AoE healing is the primary focus of healers, not CH'ing a main tank.<br>
<br>
(2) Mobs which change targets frequently. Dain is a good example of this, and Emperor's hate debuff is another attempt at it. The Praeserti in Ssra do this well. Primary healing is fast assist heals, with CH only being used to &quot;top up&quot; people off the hate list.<br>
<br>
(3) Mobs which physically disrupt a ten second casting time spell, but not faster spells. Vyemm is a good examples of this. Use the slow nature of CH against itself.<br>
<br>
(4) My own personal favourite, a mob that procs a debuff that reduces max HPs and current HPs by a set amount. The debuff would not overwrite itself, and would be a frequent proc. The intent would be to reduce the maximum HPs of any person hit by the mob to such an extent that only fast heals or a ridiculously long CH chain could possibly keep the person alive. <br>
<br>
Imagine how primary healing would change if our current main tanks had 5000 fewer HPs than they do. Imagine how important aggro control would be if anyone below 5000 HPs hit by such a mob would be instantly snuffed. Imagine how such a mob would be damn near zerg-proof, and would force guilds to gear up on HPs before attempting the encounter. Best of all, as a guild progresses through PoP such encounters would actually have changed healing strategies. When the main tank has only 7500 HPs max, you'd use one set of heals. But once he's up around 13000 HPs max, you could go back to a CH chain or even eyeball-healing.<br>
<br>
You can also handle mod rods with the same methodology. An AoE 3500 HP reduction would make chain-modding a very dangerous experience (whoops, low HP aggro!), and would flat-out kill underequipped characters. If players having too many HPs is the root problem with CH and mod rods, then attack that root problem and stop trying to cure the symptoms!<br>
<br>
But I don't think you're going to see any of that. It would require too much work from the developers to create several encounters where different healing strategies would be required other than a CH chain. Right now, when I stare at the floor in VT as I do to fight lag, I can't really tell which mob we're fighting. Some fling, some don't fling, so there's a difference, but other than that it's all a CH chain of about the same size with roughly the same interval. They can change the HPs of the bosses there all they want, but they won't change that fundamental structure.<br>

I firmly believe that the uber guilds had an easier time than a_guild_06 that comes along.  Sure, they don't have spoilers and have the learn the strat themselves; however, they have the luxury of doing it.  On most competitive servers, you get one shot at a MOB and if you wipe, another guild is buffed and ready to kill.  Without competition, you can wipe for days on end, learning, refining strat, and still get the kill. It pays to be first.<br>
<br>
Today, on most servers, it's a challenge just to find a MOB that's up that's worth killing. <p>Zaboo Krusher<BR>

So, to cast CH every 15 sec (thats an insanely fast CHO) the cleric will be in the hole with 111 mana/15 sec - or 444 mana per min *with* max current AA skills and FT15. With c3 on thats around 10 mins for a well geared cleric. <br>
<br>
To cast once every 20 sec the cleric will last around 18 mins and at 27 sec (insanely slow) the cleric breaks even.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
you math is a tad wrong.  15 sec CHeals = 4 CHeals/min = 316x4 = 1264 mana spent/min<br>
<br>
70 mana regen/tic (1 tic = 6 sec) = 70 x 10 (10 tics in a min) = 700 mana/min regened<br>
<br>
1264 mana spent - 700 mana regened = 564 mana spent/min.  so you could sustane that for just shy of 8 minutes.<br>
<br>
now add to that a normal guild in 3rd or 4th place on the server.  clerics have more like FT2 or 3, minimal AA (usually goes to MGB first), and not always a beastlord or a bard to play mana for clerics and your mana/tick looks more like:<br>
<br>
30-50 mana/tick<br>
<br>
that's turns into 964 - 764 mana spent/min. which is slightly over 4 min to shy of 6 min before going OOM.  this is the situation many guild are facing and why this nerf is going to hurt the slightly lower tier guilds than the very top ones.<br>
<br>
now add to that, these guilds also don't have a mass of clerics in guild that the top guilds do.  they're able to do things with low healers ONLY because of the fact that MODRODs were available.  there was a nice chart i saw on the afterlife board i think that someone added in their modrod essay that showed how having 1 mage chain summoning rod2s is equivelant to having an extra 5 clerics on your raid.  that's HUGE for guild who don't have a multitude of clerics in the guild.<br>
<br>
i have a sneaking suspicion that verrant's &quot;retuning&quot; of mod2 necessary encounters won't even touch velious, as mod2s weren't even in game till SoL and all of velious had been conquered pre-SoL.  I also don't see them doing a whole lot on the encounters they actually deem &quot;requiring of modrods&quot; aside from knocking off 10% of the MOB's HP or slightly lowering it's DPS.<br>
<br>
Like everyone, I will just have to wait and see.  I think it's pretty shitty of them to release this game altering patch a week before a whole new high end expansion.  It's quite clever though, as it will give them their old &quot;we're working on fixing the new expansion and will get around to old stuff later&quot; excuse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwandork.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wandor K</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 752<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/12/02 3:28:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2198.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The CH nerf will eventually be a WARRIOR nerf too.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

You realize this doesn't change the fact that my guild is 5x better equipped going into Ssra than the top guild on my server was when they started right? We have tons of SoL gear, a lot more FT than was available at the time, way more AAs, and after Oct 21 we will also have higher levels.<br>
<br>
No matter how you slice it, the encounters are easier when you are equipped better. The first guilds into NToV where taking 3+ days to clear. It was weeks if not months before they where able to get that down to 2 days. We did it in 2 days our first try. They only reason we don't clear in 1 is to take advantage of the rules within our rotation agreement. How long did it take the ubers to get NToV cleared in 1 day?<br>
<br>
Another reason that the encounter are easier for us than the pioneers is that we have considerably higher DPS than they did. When SoL released, how common where 11/18 and 12/19 warrior weapons? My twink weilds these now and our MTs have better. You can also factor in huge increases in caster DPS as well. With dot stacking, better mana regen, focus items, and AAs the amount of damage casters can do now compared to SoL release is phenomenal. <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial"><img src="http://www.bfdesigns.net/eq/wandor_sig.jpg"><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6102" target="_blank"><b>Moordian</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=353608" target="_blank"><b>Wandorfu</b></a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.exarch.net/"><b>Fusion of Flame</b></a></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhaass.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haass</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 554<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/12/02 3:55:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2198.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The CH nerf will eventually be a WARRIOR nerf too.</span><hr size=1> That may be, Wandor, but the only thing that makes or breaks a fight is how long you can keep the clerics going, and with modrod2, that number was &quot;Infinite.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I believe a lot of guilds are going to have really hard times taking down things they took down easily before this patch.  Sure, with massive AA's, gear, FT, etc, you can make it easier, but that only increases your dps a few % while your clerics still run out of mana and you still lose.<br>
<br>
Time will tell tho.  Is your FT, AA, and gear enough to make up for the fact that your clerics WILL run OOM now?  I guess we'll see. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Veteran Haass Wolvesbane</a> <BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a>
