I doubt you can, seeing as even a hit of negative ten would still be damaging for most mobs (the damage bonus would be greater than the damage interval ten times over), but just knowing how mobs hit gives you a real advantage.<br>
<br>
I had theorized that perhaps PC damage worked in the same way - but it clearly does not. Hitting against about 5 different mobs, I scored over 40 different hits. So player damage is not so simple as DB + x DI....obviously Strength and Weapon Skill have to have some kind of impact on your damage.<br>
<br>
Now, I had heard that you could find your max damage using the following formula:<br>
<br>
(((STR + Weapon Skill) / 100) * Weapon damage + Damage Bonus<br>
<br>
So for my Throneblade of the Ykesha, that would mean<br>
<br>
(((176 + 185) / 100) * 33 + 11, which comes out to 130.13. My logs only show me as having hit for a maximum in the 120s range, but I haven't logged all that much data so this may well be true. Maybe I should go whack a few decaying skeletons and see if I get my max hit on them...<br>
<br>
In any case, I thought perhaps this formula could be used in some way. When used for a PC, the formula given for a mob's damage only gives the range from the player's minimum hit to their modal hit, around 77 for me. All the hits I'm scoring for 100-120 aren't accounted for.<br>
<br>
Also, I noticed that my hits were not separated in the same way that mob hits are. If a mob has a damage interval of ten, then they're going to hit for 30, 40, 50...etc, while my hits didn't have any constant interval. If your damage interval is truly Weapon damage / 10, then the throneblade has an interval of 3.3, and I was scoring hits for 31 and 32, or 110 and 112, which are too close together to be using that same formula.<br>
<br>
So my theory at this point is that there is another formula which includes something like that ((STR + Weapon skill) / 100 which is used to find your maximum damage, but that that formula is only implemented a certain amount of the time - perhaps it's random? :/<br>
<br>
Something similar to this was posted in the original post, although it put out the idea that perhaps there was a separate percentage for your min hit, your modal hit, your max hit, and the hit which took your strength/skill factor into account. I think it's probably more likely that the min/max hits are just randoms which end up being a 1 or a 20, though, otherwise I may just be saying the same thing in a different way.<br>
<br>
This is speculation, as I'm too tired to sit and try and figure out what the formula is.<br>
<br>
Also, please tell me if you guys already know how to find player damage, because I've posted to a dozen boards on the subject and still have no answers except for things about your ratio, etc. which stopped making sense past level 28. I've been very confused about this topic and I think parsing is boring (that is, trying to find dozens of mobs who are all the same level to kill so that your logs aren't skewed), so I've been trying to find someone who has a formula that makes sense....or just SOME WAY to find out what weapon will have a higher DPS by simply looking at the stats. I have about 8 different weapons on me now, some duel wield, some 2HS, some with procs, some with STR bonuses, and I haven't the foggiest idea any longer how I can tell which one is going to be best. <br>
<br>
Plus, why would I want to parse every single time I got a new weapon? It's far more efficient to just get a formula that I can use before I buy a new weapon.<br>
<br>

<br>
PCs work off the exact same formula as NPC, with one difference. We also get an extra random damage element that is dependent on STR and ATK.<br>
<br>
If you notice, your modal hit is exactly (20*DI)+DB. Your min hit is exactly DI+DB. If you use a high damage 2 hander and look at your damage histogram, you will see 1 peak at min, another peak at mode, and 18 peaks between them at intervals equal to DI.<br>
<br>
So basically there are 2 seperate random equations used to determine PC damage. Our base damage formula is the same as the NPC damage formula.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686">Graal MacBladefury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

While I do see 18 different numbers between my minimum and modal hits, my log was over a relatively short period of time...maybe 5 mobs or so. Now, my weapon was a Throneblade - that's 33 damage, 51 delay, the damage bonus on it is 12. That should mean that my damage interval is 33/10=3.3. Meanwhile, my minimum hit should be DI+DB, in my case 3.3+12, or 15.3 (not sure if that would round up or down) but my actual minimum hit was 21. My modal should be DI*20+DB, or 78, which it certainly was - huge spike there.<br>
<br>
Plus, having already seen 18 numbers between the modal and the minimum, 19 shouldn't even be my minimum....because calculating my DI as I would a mob, (Max damage - minimum damage)/19, we get 78-19=59, 57/19=3.1. (note that I used my modal hit instead of my maximum, as anything over the modal would be in the category of a PC hit which a mob doesn't get) And my DI is clearly 3.3, given my weapon....unless they round that down. So if my minimum is really DI+DB, or 3.3+12=15.3, then we've already seen 19 numbers between my minimum and modal.<br>
<br>
And that still wouldn't make sense, because my hits don't increase in increments of 3.1 or 3.3, or 3 or anything even close....I had hits for 19, 21, 22, 29, 31, 32, the list goes on....many of those numbers are less than 3 numbers away from each other. If my damage was calculated like a mob's damage, then my hits would be 19, 22, 25, 28, etc. I can show the logs, if anyone is interested. It's short and I fought different types of mobs at different levels, but that shouldn't matter for this experiment. If a PC does damage like a mob, then level and AC and all that shouldn't matter - that should just change the percentage chance of any given value for &quot;x&quot; being landed on. The 20 X values should remain the same<br>
<br>
So clearly, something is off here. I reinstate my theory, which is:<br>
<br>
PC damage works the same way as mob damage, with one exception. There is a chance that the PC will get a hit which takes into account his (STR+SKILL)/100 somehow. I believe that if that type of hit is scored, there is STILL a random factor, so that type of hit would actually change the damage interval for a PC. That would account for my numbers not going up by a set amount - maybe we are looking at two different sets of numbers, each going up by a different DI...one has the STR/SKILL factor involved, the other one doesn't.<br>
<br>
That would mean that when you score a hit which has your STR/SKILL factor involved, there is still a chance of getting a crappy hit, so your maximum hit is going to be reasonably uncommon...which it certainly is, in my case <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However I am afraid that something is off there as well, because I recieved 38 different hits and only 20 of them were in the minimum-modal range. If my theory was correct, then you would expect to only see 10 numbers in the modal-maximum range, but instead we see 18 :/<br>

Your damage interval is not 33/10, but (maxhit-minhit)/19, as stated in the original model. That adds on to your damage base of (minhit - damage interval), 19 additional times to represent your range of damage values. The frequency distribution within the range should vary based on the relative proportion of your attack to mob ac (presumably), but the values themselves shouldn't.<br>
<br>
By the way, you probably also need to filter your logs for the different types of attacks you have.

<br>
First you may not have ever hit your min hit. You mention this is a short parse...there is nothing to say you ever actually hit for min at all. Min hit = weapon damage/10+DB. That is your min hit. Trust me.<br>
<br>
You mention that you have 18 values between min and mode, but they don't all follow the DI. They won't! You seemed to have missed the part where I mentioned that PC damage is made up of 2 seperate random elements. <br>
<br>
EX. <br>
Swing1 = 4*DI(3.3) + DB(12) =25<br>
Swing2 = 6*DI + DB= 32<br>
Swing3 = 20*DI + DB = 78<br>
<br>
The thing you missed is that those numbers also have a second random amount added to them. Pick any 3 random numbers between 0 and 37*DI(valid at level 60 above a certain atk threshold) and add them respectively to those swings. The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>final result</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will not be a multiple of DI except by happenstance. <br>
<br>
EX. <br>
Swing1 = 25 + 7 = 32<br>
Swing2 = 32 + 6 = 38<br>
Swing3 = 78 + 5 = 83<br>
<br>
Does that make sense at all?<br>
<br>
<br>
It seems that the most common value for the secondary portion of damage is 0. Take a long parse with a 2 hander and look at the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>peaks</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> between min and mode. <br>

<br>
I made sure to not count any of my kick hits in my log, so that isn't a problem <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This excerpt is why I thought DI could be calculated that way:<br>
<br>
&quot;Effectively, the weapon's actual damage bonus is the same as my value for DB. The number that is analagous to the mob's max hit is the modal damage for the PC's weapon. Modal damage = DB + 2*(Weapon damage).<br>
So DI is equal to<br>
((DB + 2*(Weapon damage)) - DB)/20<br>
= (Weapon damage)/10<br>
And the min hit is still DB + DI.<br>
<br>
So, with my 30/37 lance, DB = 12 and DI = 30/10 = 3. So my min hit should be 12 + 3 = 15, which it is according to my parser.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks for clearing up that this isn't the case - I'll be sure to only do maximum-minimum/19 from now on.<br>
<br>
But this brings up a few questions.<br>
<br>
One, how do I calculate maximum hit? I've heard the formula (((STR+Skill)/100)*weapon damage+damage bonus) before, but I don't know if it's correct. It also would imply that there is some way that STR and Skill affects your damage....which it should, but none of the formulas so far have taken either number into account.<br>
<br>
Two, how do you round when calculating damage? I don't know if the game rounds down, up, or to the nearest whole number, and it seems like it would make a big difference when calculating a few things.<br>
<br>
Three, I don't totally understand you, Graal. Do you mean that after calculating your damage just like the game would calculate a mob's damage, it suddenly throws in a random number to add to that damage, from 0-37? You said 0-37*DI, but that would be a gigantic number to add on...and if it just added 37, my maximum would be my modal 78+37=115, and my maximum is larger than that - 123 was my biggest hit. So I don't understand how that 0-37 number is used.<br>
<br>
But at least it sounds like you know what I'm talking about and have some idea what the answer is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You can do that for mobs but if you want to do that for PCs you have to use mode instead of max. The DI <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>IS</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> equal to weapon damage/10. It is also equal to (mode-min)/19.<br>
<br>
Assume you have a 50 damage weapon with a damage bonus of 60. Mode hit(20*DI+DB) will be (50/10 * 20)+60...160. Min hit (DI+DB) will be 50/10 +60...65. <br>
<br>
Mode - min /19 = DI<br>
(160-65)/19=5. <br>
weapon damage/10=DI<br>
50/10=5<br>
<br>

<br>
Yep. If we look at the above weapon numbers (50 damage 60 DB) the weapon would hit for 65, 70, 75, 80....160. Once it has determined that part of damage, it then adds a second random element that ranges from 0 to a constant that is determined by level, STR, and attack. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You said 0-37*DI, but that would be a gigantic number to add on...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
37*DI is right for a level 60 melee that has past a certain atk threshold. What that threshold is I don't know, but I'm guessing it is at least 1200 atk or so, if not more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>One, how do I calculate maximum hit? I've heard the formula (((STR+Skill)/100)*weapon damage+damage bonus) before, but I don't know if it's correct. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Basically that is correct, at least it is close AFAIK. The problem is that it doesn't take into account +atk items and buffs. Looking at what I have posted above, we know that 20*DI +37*DI is the max that you can hit for at level 60 once you reach a certain threshold of atk. That is 5.7 times weapon damage. That number is a cap on how much +atk items/buffs can raise your max hit, and goes up slightly each level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It also would imply that there is some way that STR and Skill affects your damage....which it should, but none of the formulas so far have taken either number into account.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The formulas listed have been to show the possible values a mob can hit for. STR and atk do dtermine that max that a PC can hit for, but mainly they determine which of the possible values are hit the most often.<br>
<br>
Let's say you can hit for 5 values...<br>
<br>
low atk you hit for 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, <br>
<br>
high atk you hit for 5, 4, 5, 1, 4, 2, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, <br>
<br>
That is mainly what STR and atk do. They do increase your max hit up to a certain point, but mainly they just increase the chance you will hit for a higher value. Since most of this discussion has been about NPCs, STR and ATK do not affect the possible values they can hit for at all. They do affect whether the mob will hit mostly for min, or mostly for max, or somewhere in between.<br>

<br>
The AC number you see displayed on your screen is made up of 2 components: avoidance AC - which reduces the chance that you will be hit; and mitigation AC - which reduces the damage you take when you are hit.<br>
<br>
Avoidance AC is made up of defense skill and AGI, with monks having extra avoidance AC (~230?) for staying under their weight limit. Once you have capped your defense skill and AGI, you can't raise avoidance AC at all.<br>
<br>
Mitigation AC is made up mainly of the raw AC from items, with defense skill playing a small part. Mitigation AC is very similar to the attack given by STR and +atk buffs/items...it doesn't change what you can be hit for, but higher mitigation AC makes it more likely you will be hit for less. Adding more raw AC from items is the only way to raise mitigation AC.<br>
<br>
I posted above a scenario showing the effect of attack...mitigation AC works exactly the opposite.<br>
<br>

<br>
Early on in the posts there is a quote that says that DI should determine which disc to use, the lower the DI the less beneficial Defensive is… makes sense. Yet, further on in the same quote it introduces the ratio and uses the 0.14 as the determining factor which almost precludes DI altogether.<br>
<br>
Hypothetical Example:<br>
Assuming that evasive makes sense on a mob that has a DI of 15 and that defensive makes sense on a mob that has a DI of 50 you go through some sample ratios:<br>
<br>
     DI/DB = ratio that implies a disc<br>
<br>
     15/100 = 0.15 =&gt; defensive<br>
     15/300 = 0.05 =&gt; evasive<br>
     15/500 = 0.03 =&gt; evasive<br>
<br>
     50/100 = 0.50 =&gt; defensive<br>
     50/300 = 0.17 =&gt; defensive<br>
     50/500 = 0.10 =&gt; evasive<br>
<br>
What makes the 0.14 the magic number or was it the break-even point for a specific mob and does it really apply to all mobs?<br>
<br>
Eg.:<br>
Abhorrent hatchling                   40      11  .28     Defensive<br>
- wouldn’t this make more sense as evasive? (assuming you even used a disc…)<br>
<br>
Agnarr                               428    48.9  .11     Evasive<br>
- wouldn’t this make more sense as defensive?<br>

Use extreme examples and it becomes very easy to figure out.<br>
<br>
DB 1000, DI 1<br>
<br>
min hit of 1001 non defensive, max hit of 1020 no defensive<br>
min hit of 1001(1000.5) defensive, max hit of 1010 defensive<br>
<br>
Using /disc def did almost nothing to reduce the damage taken. If you assume that evasive will make you avoid 10% of those hits, it just saved you a ton of damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
DB 1, DI 100<br>
<br>
min hit of 101 non defensive, max hit of 2001 non defensive<br>
min hit of 51 defensive, max hit of 1001 defensive<br>
<br>
Using /disc def cut your damage by half. Using evasive would lower the damage taken, but not nearly as dramatically as defensive would in this case.<br>
<br>
Defensive is best when tanking a mob that has a high DI and low DB, relative to each other. Due to the fact that the DB cannot be mitigated at all, it is best to simply not get hit (use evasive) on mobs that a very high DB relative to the DI.<br>
