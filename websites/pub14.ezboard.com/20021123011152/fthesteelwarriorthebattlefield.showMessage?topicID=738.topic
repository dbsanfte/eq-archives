<br>
Hey there guys. I know we are not pullers so we don't get to see a lot of mob placements in many places but if you have a tank alt or whatever then you can. Mine is now 53 and when I go to some places I get scared silly. Like in the hole at the halfpipe. What the hell kinda pathing do them fiends and ele's and golems do down there. Out in that court yardish kinda thing. <br>
<br>
Anyway I am very interested in SG and wish to explore under the hut area by the WW zoneline where the sirene's are. Also when you zone in from CS in the water to the left, upper left, and right are tunnels. Upper left goes to the falls and the other two ways are less traveled. It is these lesser traveled areas I wish to go. With my tank and a good group that is. Has any of you ever been to these lower places? Somewhere in that place is a shimmering spirit who drops the &quot;wavecrasher&quot;. A nice lammy like 1hs'er with a 200dot proc with a 20% snare. He is my main target :P But there is still many things to get there in that underused zone.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any wisdom they can share with pulling there or what mobs are where? Any tips, details, anything is appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks <br>
<br>
I ask the same thing to you guys.  Any guides, info, experience you have with this place and how to get to our wavecrasher droppin mob would be appreciated.  Thanks <p><p><center>

<br>
Sirens Grotto<br>
<br>
A simple guide which will illustrate solutions to primary objectives of this zone.<br>
<br>
A few notes:<br>
This guide is written with the thought of using 1 solid group, not a several group raid.<br>
Seahorse, and fish see thru all types of invisibility.<br>
Other than named, all land based mobs, do not see thru invisibility.<br>
Any form of levitation does not work in this zone and it's considered a dungeon.<br>
Call of the Hero does work here.<br>
<br>
The first objective I'll explain is how to get from the Sirens Grotto/Cobalt Scar Zone line, to the Western Wastes zone line.<br>
Please look at this map *eqmaps.com*<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wansecure.net/test/sgtoww.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>
There are only 3 mobs in the way which see thru all types of invisibility, they are all lvl 53 Seahorse.<br>
<br>
The method to get there, is to pull the first two, mez one, kill the other.  When it's dead, kill the 2nd one, and move up to kill the 3rd.  <br>
<br>
These cannot be snared or rooted, and they're pretty difficult to mez using Dazzle, although I'd recommend it if your cleric/healer can keep you alive thru a couple resists.<br>
<br>
One thing to note, is that if you get too many resists, or are low on mana and have aggro, just get out of the water on the ledge.<br>
<br>
Once the 3rd Seahorse is killed, invisi up and follow the path on the map. <br>
<br>
When you get to the &quot;0&quot; be careful as sometimes there is a Swordfish swimming around.<br>
<br>
Follow the red path invisible and you'll zone out to Western Wastes.<br>
<br>
<br>
The next objective is to get to the ramp area of sirens.  <br>
<br>
The reason for this is to get chest quest gems (Flawless Diamonds, Black Marble, and Pristine Emeralds)  <br>
<br>
There are a couple methods to getting there, I'll go over the one we use.<br>
Please reference this map *eqmaps.com*<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wansecure.net/test/sg01.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>
You will need a swimming skill above 100 to ensure a death free passage.<br>
<br>
The first step, is to have an enchanter move to point &quot;1&quot; marked on the map, and target the first Seahorse.  Using Dazzle/GoK, mez this horse.  If you get a resist, then get out of the water, retarget, get in and try again until it's mez'd.<br>
<br>
After the first Seahorse is mez'd, move to point &quot;2&quot;, and Mez the 2nd Seahorse *Note: If mez doesn't hold, you can either get out of the water, or swim to the ledge along the path*<br>
<br>
You can kill them just as easy...although we don't bother.<br>
<br>
Once sitting on the ledge past the 2nd Seahorse, watch for the roaming Swordfish.  It will roam in a circle, sometimes changing directions.<br>
<br>
Once the Swordfish is on the far side, or heading in the opposite direction of you, jump into the water and swim following the path...the idea is to not get aggro on you until you're passing the two stationary sea horse.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wansecure.net/test/sg02.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>
Do NOT stop swimming until you get to the area marked &quot;3&quot; on the map.  When you get to 3, be careful as there is a mob close...but you'll be able to see it.<br>
<br>
Once there, you will have lost aggro on the two Seahorse chasing you...we usually camp to clear aggro just to make sure.<br>
<br>
Once there, re-invis and move to point &quot;4&quot; on the map.  <br>
It should be noted that points &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot;  and &quot;5&quot; are <br>
safe-ish camp spots.  <br>
<br>
Three mobs spawn just ahead of &quot;4&quot;, most of the time, they will not see thru invis.  <br>
<br>
I do NOT recommend pulling these.  <br>
Due to some serious pathing errors, it's more frustration than it's worth they will run all over, and you end up getting about 4 or so mobs all in one area and they won't pull...a real mess to deal with.<br>
<br>
Once at point &quot;5&quot; Have someone check down the hall to see if a mob that see's invisi is there.  If you have a monk, I'd recommend you getting aggro and training the mob along the green path on the map.  <br>
<br>
The mob will stay there and you will have a nice path without any mobs that see thru invis.<br>
<br>
If you do not have a monk or someone to FD the mob in that location, then you can move just to where the green path, separates from the red path, pause and recast invis, and move to point &quot;6&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Another method is to have an enchanter mez the Seahorse that typically spawns there, then invisi and go thru to the camp spot.  <br>
<br>
If you're unsure about the aggro, make sure you get to land, and camp to clear it.<br>
<br>
Due to pathing, you should have enough time to re-invis and move before getting hit.  <br>
<br>
*Note*<br>
If you get aggro with a land capable mob, then you will need to camp to lose aggro, or the pathing will eventually aggro a few land based mobs near your camp area, training you and killing your party.<br>
<br>
If you are not invisible and you get out of the water, prepare to fight at least two sirens.  At point &quot;6&quot; you are not in aggro range, and can CotH people in, or buff up.<br>
<br>
We usually invisi up to the top of the ramp...above the &quot;6&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'd recommend fighting from the top of the ramp down, as some mobs are enchanters and like to cast Gravity Flux, which will aggro everything in the room, causing either evac or wipeout.  We usually can clear the top tier, and 2nd tier before we get respawn.<br>
<br>
I'd not recommend doing Icy Servant other than if you're trying to get a wavecrasher mob spawn, and I'd recommend them solo (Due to AE dispell and DD)<br>
<br>
For a wavecrasher, if &quot;a shimmering sea spirit&quot; isn't wielding the WC then it doesn't have one.<br>
<br>
It should also be noted that high MR/CR is key here, as everything (ramp area) is a caster.<br>
<br>
If a mob gates, or drops off the ledge, evac and follow the above to start over...as a few sirens, a couple icy servants, and your party/raid will drop very swiftly.<br>
<br>
For every two tiers of clearing, we average one BP gem...or about 10 kills for a gem.  All drop about the same rate...meaning Melee, Priest, and Caster are just as common.<br>
<br>

JUST what I was looking for.  You have done these people here a great service and I still say the wave crasher is a nice update for a lammy frostbringer combo (replacing the lammy of course :P)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a couple questions though.<br>
<br>
- Just past point 3 on map is a break invis mob.  You said to reinvis and swim by this.  Now did you kill it or mez it?  The one past 3 that is.<br>
<br>
- you say &quot;If you do not have a monk or someone to FD the mob in that location, then you can move just to where the green path, separates from the red path, pause and recast invis, and move to point &quot;6&quot;.&quot;    --- Is that enough time to get an invis off before the aggro mob will get you?  If no monk and just past point 5 is an invis breaker should it not be killed?<br>
<br>
- You say once at 6 you can buff up n stuff.... And say to kill from top of ramp down.  Does that mean from the 6 down or to the east by them 2 maroon dots?  Is there more mobs there than just the two at top and three below 6?<br>
<br>
- Do you need an eb item to get through 2-6?  Or only parts throughout 2-6?  Or not at all?<br>
<br>
- Recommended Group level?  52+?<br>
<br>

<br>
I should note also that I play on Test Server...so sometimes things may change, so I've only posted what I've also verified on a production server as well.<br>
<br>
Just past point 3, there is mob...the reason I said to reinvis is that chances are the two seahorse you had to swim by to get to that point, are going to have broken your invisi.<br>
<br>
The spawns there are random mob types, so it could be a mob that sees thru.  Although pathing really sucks there<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We'd tried clearing them at first, and the mobs will get aggro and just run the other way, getting all their friends and pooling them together somewhere down the way...near where the green path starts...it's a real mess...so we just invisi past them.  If they see thru, you can almost always swim around them without getting aggro.  If you get aggro, I'd recommend getting to a safe spot and getting an invisi and camping to clear/reset the spawns.<br>
<br>
What we'll do is get to point 5, and get invisi and check the spawns, if there is a seahorse/fish where the green path spawn, someone will go around it...pathing is very bad in this area, and odds are the mob will just stand there...had aggro but can't path to you...<br>
<br>
If we can't pull the mob away...although we've always been either able to pull it away, or pull into the open area and kill, you can swim into the open area...along the red path after the green split, reinvisi there, and get out onto dry land.<br>
<br>
I should note that if you pull it into the open area...i.e. where the green pathing is...it's safe to fight there, but do NOT poke your head out of the water...or use pets...or you will aggro some Icy/Watery Servants, which will eat you for a snack.<br>
<br>
EB is required from point 1 until you get to point 6.<br>
<br>
Once you get to point 6, you'll be in an open room with some stone ramps that go up a few lvls.  We usually buff up at point 6 as you're out of aggro.  Once buffed, we get an invisi and head up the ramps until you're at point 6, but on the top most level.  <br>
<br>
From there we pull and kill...and start clearing the levels.<br>
<br>
As for group lvls, most of us were from 52 to 57 or so when going here... <br>
<br>
I think level would depend on how well your group works together.  <br>
<br>
I've done with with a 52 cleric, 54 enc, 52 mage, and 57 warrior...but I'd not recommend going in without snare/evac or some way to mez.<br>
<br>
There are more than enough spawns to keep a group busy there...and probably enough spawns to keep two groups busy...<br>

Only one roamer in the hall and is close enough to the zoneline so CRs are not a huge deal. I like to have 2 groups with 2 strong enchanters. Breaking the tower can be rough if there are named/multiple Icy servants up, but once broken it is easy to pull except for the pathing. The sirens can loose aggro even on a warrior pulling them so you need to babysit your pulls at times. There are 3 named sirens(maybe more) that can spawn here and they are all 61+. 2 good groups can handle them, but because of the gating and at least one can Cheal a wizard or two is nice to end a battle fast.(all named could be slowed with shammy slow) A shimmering sea serpant can also spawn here, but so far I have only seen the bard drums drop. In about 4 or 5 hours the other day we pulled out 3 EB shells(7th shawl), one ornate shell necklace(for the Sea dragon bracer quest) and 3 or 4 cloud shells (9th ring). Gem drops were 3 or 4 PE, 6FD and 8 BM. This place rocks for the BP gem drops.<br>
<br>
<br>
For those who have not been there in a while the sirens seem to be dispelling alot more than before, their slows land about 75% of the time even though my MR was 175+ and they have added a fear2 type spell that stuns/mezzes you for about 20 seconds, but has no icon on your screen and is not broken by you taking damage. I suggest pulling without symbol or you will bankrupt your cleric.<br>

<br>
Have someone go invis and check the 3 mobs at bottom of the well.  If none of them see invis you are golden.  Invis everyone go to the bottom of the well.  Look for the passage that looks like a cross.  Go through the cross passage and imediately surface.  Your are there done.<br>

And the most populated area of eles are on the extreem south end of zone in that hall with 4 rooms represented by 4 circles.  Supposedly 2 eles in each room.  You can see it on the bottom of his maps.  With an Ench that must be cake.<br>
<br>
How many HP's do the damn eles have though?

I ran past the molkor at zone in (if you stand by him he will break invis, but running by didn't) and then got in water, turned right and swam by the 2 horses un detected. Seems if you haul ass and don't doddle you dont get invis broke. After the two horses I hopped up on ledge. Went up ramp and another molkor was there just ran by it. In castle down hall was 1 watery. In next room there was 8 damn sirens in there. I stood there in room and was undected (a druid camo that actually stuck for a long time :P). After that room to the south was 1 bulthar on bridge. After him was a small room with another small room south of it with 2 watery's. I didn't go any further in but you can see on my map the last two watery's I encountered. After them, in each of the big circles south going east and west are the rooms with 2 eles in each supposedly. <br>
<br>
I didn't want to run the risk to see if Icy's break invis. What I already did by myself some would have called suicide. But I wanted to do it so I could better lead a group. Heck if you are scared one could camp that one lone watery at the entrance :P May get boring though. Wonder whats north of the molkor at the top of the ramp? It's a hall that turns and heads west....<br>
<br>
Here is the map I edited which shows the route I took turning right after zone in water.<br>
<br>
PS - remember this route is to lead you to the most concentrated amount of possible Shimmering spawns.<br>

<br>
We started the camp at the 4 &quot;white&quot; rooms at the very southern edge of the map.  Its alittle hard to explain but here goes...<br>
<br>
This are (4 rooms at southern edge of the map) is actually 2 tunnels connected by airpockets.  There is a water channel connecting all 4 rooms and another air channel above them connected at the 4 &quot;rooms&quot;.  The rooms are underwater and you can not move thru the rooms without aggroing mobs from the water.  these rooms have 2 spawns each with a few single spawns inbetween the rooms.  Icy/Watery are semi-rare spawns here and we never saw a shimmering mob.<br>
<br>
After a few hours camping I got an itch and started to explore the air/land tunnel above the water channel.  I found a path leading North, makes 2 180s and continnues north to a bridge and a castle.   In the north bound tunnel there were 2 rooms with only Icy/watery mobs.  First room (most southern) had 3 mobs and the room further north had 2 spawns.<br>
<br>
The second clearing of the 3 spawn room poped a shimmering mob with sword,  my wavecrasher.<br>
<br>
Based on my experience you need a spot that only spawns Icy/Waterys ie Castle area, tunnels i meantioned, or a similar place around the sirens.<br>
