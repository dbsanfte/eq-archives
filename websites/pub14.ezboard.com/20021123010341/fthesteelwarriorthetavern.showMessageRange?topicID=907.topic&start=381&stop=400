not sure best way to do it, double taunt AA skill sounds good.<br>
<br>
Warriors Hps/Ac(Who cares anyways) are fine, but with the 125 hp gear the small advantage they had is negligible. This seems to be where the problem results<br>
<br>
Warriors DPS is fine for their role<br>
<br>
Warriors should be the only ones to get defensive, as a Pally I don't want it anyways, don't need it, shouldn't get it<br>
<br>
I see a few main problems for Warriors:<br>
1. Hybreds can almost match HP/AC, not extremly behind dmg, and with each expansion spells get more powerful (Every expansion warriors almost loose effectivness in groups and solo, bucase spells must continually get upgraded.<br>
<br>
2. The above has caused warriors to become not essential. Warriors have not had to deal with being non-essential. This ticks some off, but probably not the end game type.<br>
<br>
3. It is so easy to twink a warr and PL to 50 that a lot don't know jack @#%$. This goes for every class. All the long term warriors I have ever met have little problem with aggro, with a few exception mobs. Too many bad players just want game easier, which it has already become.<br>
<br>
4. A non tanking warriors is a low DPS melee. But so is a Pally or SK, but we can still cast group benificial spells, warriors can't<br>
<br>
5. Due to the above points, for the first time warriors may not be needed/prefered for most encounters. Is this bad? No. However, warriors should be the masters of tanking. This is their job. I feel that they are no longer the masters.<br>
<br>
For PoP I like the idea of increasing DM, DA, etc through AA's, but if they do this they can not let other classes also increase. Let Pallies continue the Undead battleing, Rangers Archery , etc. Let warriors get 'tougher'<br>
<br>
Also I feel warriors do need something 'special' at level 60 in class AA just cause its cool to have em! Not sure what, maybe make them get slay will-o-wisp<br>

I'll stand with you guys on that any day.<br>
<br>
However, I also disagree that warriors need to be head-and-shoulders ahead of every other tank class in the game.  Unfortunately for paladins, we really don't have any amazing skills, and all of our vaunted &quot;utility&quot; can be covered by other classes.  Name one thing we can do that some other class can't do as well or better in a pickup group, please.<br>
<br>
The fact that we come CLOSE to tanking as well as a warrior makes us almost exactly as useful as a warrior.  If we were equivalent to warriors in tanking ability, there would be ZERO use for warriors.  But if we were only as good at tanking as, say, rangers, there would be ZERO use for paladins.<br>
<br>
And please do explain more about the Taunt problem.  Start another thread on it, so I can try to understand more completely.<br>

<br>
I WAS playing at the time. I DO remember warriors then. I also remember LITERALLY 75% of all hybrid mains being dropped in favor of a warrior/monk/rogue primary (the rogue epic was also to blame in large part).<br>
<br>
Ok, pure melee (warriors included) were incredibly out of balance then - as evidenced by the mass departure of other classes to them. So it's just about time you got back in line.<br>
<br>
You can't find a group? Aww, shucks. Tough crap. Paladins and SKs put up with the for 3 YEARS because of the exp penalty and the fact that they did half the damage of a warrior (there's a reason 2H weapons have been improved THREE times AND SKs/pals have had their melee upgraded and still aren't on par with warriors). So you've got it a bit tough now as PoP is about to be released. Frankly I couldn't care less.<br>
<br>
Raiding IS what EQ is about. The only reason to level up is to fight tougher and tougher things - and that means eventually getting to the top. And warriors are balanced just fine for raids. I've never seen a raid fall apart because there weren't enough Sks or paladins. But I HAVE seen raids fall apart because there weren't enough warriors and clerics. Given how necessary warriors are in the end-game I wouldn't call them blanceds - I'd call them overbalanced. Fine - they can make up for that by being less desirable in exp groups.<br>

<br>
I think the problem is right now, with taunt that is, from 51 to 59, a warrior has NO WAY to taunt a mob that is even or higher level then themselves.  The only taunt we have is with our weapons.  The taunt button does not work.  Period.  The Knights wouldn't notice this because your aggro comes from spells, so getting aggro on even/higher level mobs, isn't a huge issue for you.  *I* feel that if the taunt button was made to work better for everyone, it wouldn't benefit warriors at all.  Sure, we could taunt the mobs we can't now, but the Knights would just be better at it, thereby giving them too much aggro control.<br>
<br>
I've read this post from day one, listening to everyone's opinions, ideas is great.  I have played a warrior for the past 3 years, my current warrior is level 56 and from experience, taunting/holding aggro sucks at this point.  I've had to neglect my armor to keep my weapons up to date so I can hold aggro over the rogue/ranger/monk I normally play with.  Not complaining about my class, love my warrior, just think that to be able to do my job, I NEED to get rare weapons with specific procs, I think that's kinda bogus.  Knights run to their guild and buy a spell that gives them instant aggro.  Warriors get to pay several thousand PP, camp a rare weapon or just cripple their groups by their inability to get/hold aggro.<br>
<br>
I don't know how to fix it, wish I did.  But I guess like every other warrior out there, frustration does set in and gotta rant somewhere about it.  Generally, I think warriors aren't going to give up their class, not until we are totally useless and even then, I won't give up on them.  I'm a warrior.  It's what I chose to make in Beta, it's what I still am.  I've played other classes, but none compare to the warrior IMO.  I just would like to be able to do my job like I'm supposed to do.<br>

<br>
You are a hybrid!  Paladins are between a cleric and a warrior, meaning that you are not supposed to do anything better than any other class, but are supposed to be a combination of the two classes and a good combination you are.<br>
<br>
Somebody else mentioned that they had never seen a raid cancelled for lack of knights.  We have changed which target we were going to hit because of lack of paladins.  Paladins are great additional healing/damage and help a lot when doing a mob that requires a bunch of crowd control.  They can tank the extra mobs and heal themselves as they go, as well as root them to get some time to med a little.  Paladins are extremely useful.<br>
<br>
For experience, smaller groups are better.  I would rather have a group with a paladin healing (at 60 most experiencing encounters don't require a ton of healing, so why get a cleric?) because the paladin can do damage, do a group heal, do heals over time, throw in a LoH in an emergency and rez the party if needed.  I take pally rezzes no problem and happily.  90 or 96%  it's no big deal.<br>
<br>
Now, we are not here really to discuss paladins and how cool I think they are.  Warriors need to fill the tank role better than a pally because warriors cannot an experience group alive all by themselves at level 60.   <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20383">Hulanta</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uchavr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>chavr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/7/02 1:28:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=388>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Monks</span><hr size=1> So your saying that at lvl 51 taunt no longer works on mobs that are even or higher?  A lvl 51+ mob is untauntable till a warrior hits lvl 60?  If this is the case then a simple fix would be to roll back the mob taunt cap thingie to lvl 61+ mobs.<br>
<br>
That would mean warriors have the same taunt ability at 51 as they have at 60.  <br>
<br>
As far as monks being the best tanks.  I just don't see it.  When was the last time you were in an exp group and the monk was tanking?  Sorry, but it just don't happen.  I've helped keep monks alive and they don't bleed as bad as a ranger, but it's pretty darn close.  <br>
<br>
<br>
You mentioned the spells paladins have and the downtime when soloing can be made up with heals.  You failed to mention the fact that this costs mana.  Add in our sub warrior dmg dealing and it takes longer for us to fight.  Pre 59 we have to root and back up to heal.  Takes even more time.  If your able to get c2/kei at lower levels then yes, you can solo pretty good.  The instances of this happening though are a rarity.  Take a look at the zones that are undead.  Yes, paladins have gotten pretty good with undead since we got IoN.  If you look at the places where you can use it though, you'll see it's a very limited option.  I took into account the spells we get when I stated that warriors and paladins can solo about the same.  At 45 there are bp's war can get with a heal on them.  So both classes have access to free heals at that level.  Granted DW helm is easier to get.  War have greater selection of wpns at the lower levels by far.  They can adjust wpns to the fight more so then a paladin can.  Just trying to show you that it's not as easy as you want to think for a paladin to solo.  Yes we can do it, but until 59 we are still better off grouping.<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, the topic that started this conversation looks like class envy more then anything else.  If you were to make warriors into the super tanks your talking about then paladins will have no place in groups anymore.  If you were to select a few problem spots warriors have and concetrate on fixing what is broken, you'd get alot better response.<br>
<br>
Taunt is broken from 51-59.  Ok, fix it.  Just don't try to make taunt something that warriors end up being the best at.  That would skew the game.  Make it so warriors can get agro, but it still takes everyone working together to make sure the warrior keeps it.<br>
<br>
Gear selection is tuff.  Ok, fix it.  Make a few warrior only pieces that give them stats that don't benefit other classes.  <br>
<br>
Those two things there would help warrior's without hurting any other classes.   <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

I hate to phrase my topic that way, but it seems that's what this is turning into.  And I really didn't want that.<br>
<br>
Let me just share that paladins used to be in the position that they didn't tank anywhere near as well as warriors, and they didn't put out much damage, and their spells were nothing special.  In short, paladins had a VERY hard time getting groups, being useful on raids, or doing really pretty much anything.  Those who stuck with it are champions to all of us who are still levelling up, because they had to fight 10 times harder than the newer ones do to get where we all are now.<br>
<br>
And maybe warriors do need to be head and shoulders above paladins.  After all, we have gained a decent amount of damage output through better weapons, and through the 2hander upgrade.  We have several nice spells now that really do a lot for us, and our alternate advancement skills give us the option to improve ourselves in one of three different ways.<br>
<br>
I am always willing to admit that I don't know the real story of the high end, and that my questions are always intended to elicit a response that gives me more information than I had before.  Possibly, warriors do need better HP and Taunt ability now, due to the increase in utility that the paladin class has seen. <br>
<br>
Keep the discussion up, and maybe we can all learn something!<br>

Explain exactly the problems with taunt.<br>
-It doesn't work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Anything even or above your lvl is not gonna respond to it (lvl 60, barely creates aggro). So raids = need good weaps.<br>
<br>
What level does it become ineffective? <br>
When do you have to rely on wpns to be your sole source for taunt?<br>
- Day one. I don't mind not being able to instant taunt a mob higher lvl then me. Just it would be nice if it actually was effective. What I would like to see is us being able to at least taunt blues without hoping for our weapon to proc a couple times, and be able to use taunt on higher mobs with less aggro (makes sense, your lower lvl then him, the mob doesn’t think of you as large of a threat).<br>
<br>
I was in a group with a monk the other day killing in upper dogs in velks. Well he got aggro, I kept mashing the taunt key, and unless my epic'ed proc'ed about 3 times I just didn't get aggro. Now at that point I didn't care if he FD'ed to lose aggro since he wasted a lot less of the clerics mana, because he was taking a significant amount of less damage. On blue mobs, taunt should not be auto aggro, but should work with greater aggro then it does now.<br>
<br>
What suggestions do you have to make taunt more usable? <br>
-I truly don’t know what would help make taunt better. Raise the cap? I really do not know. I don't want taunt to cause instant aggro on any mob. Yes it should be less effective on mobs higher then us (again it doesn't do really anything at all right now unless lvl 60, and it still isn't that useful), but should be a lot better with mobs below our lvl.<br>
<br>
I would think giving a warrior his own defensive table similar to the monks offensive table would be helpful. Give us 10-15% DM or some other ability to take more damage.<br>
<br>
Your theory about us being the best all around at swimming or what ever isn't quite true. We're only good at one thing (we are supposable specialists). You guys are the ones that have tanking abilities and casting. <br>
<br>
The only reason we are still slightly preferred in xp groups over a pal/sk is because of our reputation. It hasn't been realized by other players that warriors have a fine line between them and the sk/palys.<br>

<br>
Wrong. Warriors need to fill the tank role EXACTLY as well as a paladin, or a shadow knight, after taking into consideration the extra abilities of those 2 classes, and considering the higher damage output of warriors. Warriors should not be preffered over the knights, they should be just as desired. Not less, not more. <br>
<br>
In the kunark and velious eras, warriors were much preferred for xp groups. Now, they compete on somewhat even terms with the knights for group spots. So going from 66% of the tanking spots being filled by warriors to 33% of the tanking spots filled by warriors may be a 50% reduction in warrior ability to get groups, but that is balance. If it falls below that 33%, then there is a problem.<br>
<br>
Maybe alot of warriors were spoiled by being greatly preferred as tank for a group over the knights for so long, I don't know. I do know that for most of kunark paladins and SKs were outright laughed at when looking for groups. <br>
<br>
&quot;group looking for tank&quot; <br>
&quot;I'm a 57 paladin&quot;<br>
&quot;I said tank, not paladin&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't think warriors have to worry about that happening to them anytime soon. There are some issues yes, but they are basically problems with broken game mechanics that indirectly affect class balance and not direct class balance issues. Fix those underlying problems and the issues go away.<br>
<br>
The reason monks can tank better than warriors is because of the broken AC system. As AC gets higher and higher, its benefits become less and less for each point added. This is true only of mitigation AC, which is the AC you get from raw AC on armor. Avoidance AC is a combination of DEF skill and agility. Monks also have added avoidance AC as part of being monk, assuming they are not over the weight limit. They can reach the same mitigation AC that a warrior can yet still have higher avoidance AC AND have more effective secondary avoidance skills like block. Essentially they can reach the same mitigation levels (and get the same average damage per hit) and at the same time have a much greater chance of not being hit at all. Top that off with much greater damage output and you have a problem. <br>
<br>
Nerf monks! 0=<br>

Like I've been saying: Fix the AC system and you fix alot of whats phawqed up in EQ. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

<br>
If you give war 10-15% more dmg mit then why take a paladin when a war is lfg?  War would once again be the only choice for a tank.  <br>
<br>
Taunt, on blue mobs make taunt have a chance to produce 1-10 taunt.  You would always do some form or taunt but not necessarily a whole lot.  On higher level mobs make it 1-5 taunt or so.  That would be about the same as when spells hit.  They generate a certain amount of taunt wether they land or resist.  Granted if taunt was changed this way knights would still be able to generate more taunt, but that isn't a bad thing necessarily.  It would allow us to continue taking care of casters yet would allow warriors to be better at taunting in groups.<br>
<br>
I disagree that paladins are better for groups then warriors.  When you add in total dmg taken/disc/dmg output and compare it to paladin spells you came up with a pretty even balance.  The taunt factor is the main difference.  If a group wants to make sure agro is constant then you want a paladin.  If warriors push to have a small adjustment done to taunt though I don't think it would set paladins back any.   <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

<br>
We have a variety of great ratio weapons, but we can't use them. Why? Because we need Taunt procing weapons with decent ratios &gt; over a godly ratio. Godly ratio's just means we are in competition with rogues/monks/rangers. Just won't happen aggro wise. Again you say why? Because the damage dealers will not only have our dmg/dly output and more, but the additional backstab/jump kick for more aggro then our dmg output. Thats why it is Necessary to have a aggro proc'ing weapon.<br>
<br>
Please explain to me what Disc makes us so much better in xp groups? <br>
Evasive? We get hit less, and we hit them less. <br>
Defensive? We get hit for ~33% less damage, but at the same time hit half our damage output. <br>

I was adding something about warriors in my above post - you're balanced just fine.<br>
<br>
Balancing a class is a measure of desirability in a number of settings: soloing, exp. groups, and on raids. Each class does any of those 3 things well, fair, or poor depending on how they're balanced. Necros rock at soloing. Warriors are a REDUIRED class for raiding (the same can only be said of clerics). So they're less desirable for exp. groups (again, the best exp. groups often have no cleric).<br>
<br>
If you warriors want to petition Verant to take away some of your desirablility at raids in exchange for desirability in exp. groups that's fine. That would be balancing. Just whining that you want to be better at exp. groups is just that: whining.<br>

Most warriors do not use /disc in exp groups. Each /disc has as much of a penalty associated with it as it would help or such a long reuse time for a short return ( /disc fearless ug )that one would be better off not using them in any exp situation. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170513">Varaho Carnicero</a>

<br>
What I do see is a lot of whining about how warriors should have the highest HP and AC and do more damage. Well while its only marginally better than Pallies and SK you still have that. That margine is all you should have since pallies and SK need to be nearly as useful or they would again be the joke of EQ.<br>
<br>
A lot of warriors making such statements never had to deal with the fact that your class was less desirable, like paladins as you probably would considered balanced in RoK did. Paladins and SK needed the upgrades that we got and so upgrading warriors in such a way again would just put pallies to that substandard class again and would enevitable cause them to get rebalanced.<br>
<br>
The only fact I agree on here are that warriors have no decent taunt and that needs to be fixed some how.<br>
<br>
My final point is that from my history with fantasy games I really hate the hybridization idea that VI considered balance when it first implemented the classes. Traditionally a paladin is just a sub group of the warrior so for the most part they have the same skills and same damage dealing/taking abilities but are far ahead when they get clerical spells. I admit that it can't work quite like that in EQ since every one would be an SK or a pally, heck even a ranger and warriors wouldn't be useful at all. Thus I currently think the methods of balance are fine and warriors are still useful and viable. Enough people still have the old image of a pre-buffed pally in there heads that they still take the warriors. Warriors are still useful in XP groups and heck since pallies can solo I tend to see them doing that more leaving room for warriors in groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 227<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/7/02 3:01:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=398>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Monks</span><hr size=1> Well, what I am seeing are some whiny Paladins saying 'we had it tough before so we have no sympathy'.  Also I see them saying 'we should be able to tank just about as well as a Warrior, heal just about as well as a Druid or better at high levels, additionally do crowd control, and hold agro better than a Warrior even if they have uber weapons'.<br>
<br>
I really don't think this needed to degenerate into a Paladin vs. Warrior issue, but the input from a number of Paladins seems hell bent in making it that.  How about this, since through AAXP, gear, and buffs Paladins can achieve about 90% of the HP of Warriors and the same effective AC, lets set up some AAXP for Warriors.<br>
<br>
How about an AAXP for Warriors that gives them the ability to Lay of Hands at 90% the rate a Paladin would?  And a group heal that does 90% of the value a Paladin would heal?  And a AAXP stun that works 90% as effectively as a Paladin's?  Lets also work in a rezz that gives back 81% exp (90% of what a Paladin's top rezz does).  That way we can not only have exactly the same AC as a Paladin, but have 90% of their spell effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Ridiculous you say?  Completely insane?  Granted.  But its exactly what you're saying Paladins should be able to do vs. a Warrior.  Effectively 90% of the Warrior's abilities PLUS spells up the wazoo.<br>
<br>
Oh but, you say, Warriors have Defensive and Evasive!  They're desperately needed for raids!  Sure, wonderful.  We don't use ANYTHING but those two disciplines on raids because if we need them we really NEED them.  So we don't even use disciplines most of the time.   And we only need them for about 5% of the encounters in the game.  But given the refresh time on so many other disciplines, you'll very rarely see a Warrior use anything but those two.<br>
<br>
And without them we're really no better at tanking than the Knights or the Monks (at level 60 with high end gear, don't even start about the low end stuff).  But hey, thanks for playing.
