Read on</span><hr size=1> There is a guild on my server who's guild leader is an SK, he desided that he could tank better then any warrior and decked himslef as such. It worked fine for Vindi or Dain etc, but when you start fighting mobs that hit a bit harder, while the clerics just couldnt keep up to the SK and the loss of the biggest advantage of defensive till the mob has been debuffed.<br>
<br>
This guild died time and time again to mobs my guild found trivial, yet they had and still have a far better class make up then us and gear is not far off. Finaly not too long ago he started letting a warrior tank and now they can actualy kill stuff.<br>
<br>
Warriors are bar none the best tanks in the game. Knights out aggro us but they fall behind us in hps and the advantage of defensive is a big one, Monks can take the hits better then any class, but their hps are like 2k or so behind us.<br>
<br>
The only thing that worries me is the new sheilds, if they go live it very much unbalances us, since we can not reasonably hold aggro with a sheild and Pally's/Sk's will then be takeing the hits better then us if we dont use a sheild. <p><center><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11531><img src="http://www3.sympatico.ca/webbdar/robok.gif" border="0"></a><BR>

That may not be what the poster intended, but that's the way it comes out. The fact is, it's a very small percentage of the people that fequent this site and that play this game that are ever going to see the numbers the top end guys are talking about. It's sort of like those idiot posters on Allakhazam who bitch about a weapon or armor and say &quot;at level 60 you should or will have better than this...&quot; which is a total bunch of crap alot of times.

<br>
Fulorian, one of us isn't communicating well. <br>
<br>
<br>
****EDIT**** Actually, I think I see the issue- I started by taking issue with something I think Guzman said, about how more efficent heals help shorten the fight. They don't. Unless maybe the less aggro and less mana usage by the clerics lets them cast nukes, something I don't often see. ****<br>
<br>
I can't be sure if you didn't read/understand my whole post, or if I just can't understand yours.<br>
<br>
Let me explain... no, let me sum up.<br>
<br>
Wars need buffed.<br>
<br>
That sounds to me like what you are saying- You used a cheal chain to tank Vindi, used defensive, and took a similiar DPS to SK. I will note that I said- With Modrod2, and you said you did with without mages. <br>
<br>
But basically you did a similiar fight and took 5% less damage per second (might be wrong, did it in my head), and had more &quot;irregular&quot; damage due to ripostes. That doesn't sound like you did a heck of a lot better then him, in fact, it sounds like he did better then you- More evenly distributed damage, because of no ripostes. Less likely a spike would kill him quicker then the next cheal lands.<br>
<br>
To be clearer, I'm gonna try to seperate the two parts of tanking out for the rest of this post- Absorbing Damage, and Taunt. You have to have both for tanking, and sometimes I use &quot;tanking&quot; to describe both, and sometimes to just describe absorbing damage.<br>
<br>
SK's absorb damage well enough that a cheal chain, especially one backed by Modrod2, can keep them alive.<br>
<br>
SK's taunt well enough that they can lock aggro on them, and let the rest of the raid do more DPS without getting aggro.<br>
<br>
Warriors, without defensive, absorb damage well enough that a cheal chain can keep them alive.<br>
<br>
Warriors, without defe, without EB, taunt well enough that the rest of the raid, if it watches aggro, can do less DPS, but still do DPS.<br>
<br>
Warriors with defensive, absorb damage extremely well. <br>
<br>
Warriors, with defensive, without EB, taunt well enough to keep the aggro off the cheal chain, and the rest of the raid, if it watches it's aggro, can do a small percentage of the DPS it is capable of.<br>
<br>
I cannot really say too much about WITH EB, since I haven't gotten an EB weapon yet, however, several other Warlords in my guild have it. Warriors with EB, defe or not, seem to taunt extremely well, to the point that, especially with Primal Avatar (proc or cast), even SK's have a hard time taunting off them.<br>
<br>
THAT is the problem I have with high end tanking. It simply gimps the entire raid to use a defe warrior on many boss mobs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is my most convincing arguement, for me. I'm putting my money where my mouth is. My warlord doesn't log on except by request, and my mage is a week away from modrod2, as long as I give up trying to solo in The Grey- Damned Quad Kiters. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17853>Cyrz Bloodscale</a>

Read on</span><hr size=1> Okay, while EB is very, very powerful, even now SK taunt is or is almost as strong as EB. The new changes coming.. eh.. tommorow, give SK's a castable EB. Now, unless this spell is dropped off Emperor Ssraeshzae or some endgame mob, it will be common as HELL. <br>
<br>
Warriors do not ding to level 59 and have a GM hand them EB. SK's already encroach FAR too closely onto a warriors territory, and have the utility for when they are not tanking, such as soloing. Why should they be able to buy a spell in the Bazaar for 500p, or off a mob for 50, when the weakest item a Warrior can get it for is 625k? Already, at I believe level 52 or lower, the SK's get a spell almost as good at taunting. <br>
<br>
I don't think any Warrior wants to deny SK's their glory. We rolled Warriors to tank. Not to stand back and watch another class do it just as well, then while managing to somehow scrape by at non-raiding, watching the SK shine there as well. They need a niche, not master of all niche's. <p><img src="http://strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Fulorian/fullsize/sig1.gif" border="0">

Read on</span><hr size=1> Don't misunderstand me Fulo, if you Read my New Take on tanking, assuming I wrote it cleary, I expressed my concerns with the NEW items, here I am just rehashing my reasons I feel warriors are ALREADY underpowered.<br>
<br>
Currently, for me, I felt I was valuble from about 1 to 59 or so. Right about there I found I was less and less valuble, and do not consider warriors balanced at the end.<br>
<br>
With the changes proposed, should they go live tomorrow, I beleive that warriors will be the premier tank for Off Tanking (Pop Defe, single cleric or druid(s) healing you, everyone else assisting the SK) and for a brief time after they get defe and before you master Modrod2.<br>
<br>
Castable Lesser Enraging Blow, for 50 mana, with 6 second recast (If I recall what I last read off Lucy.fnord.net), is a slap in the face of warriors. I say lesser because, again, relaying upon my ale soaked memory, Terror of Terris was 500 hate points, vrs 700 from Enraging Blow. I could have misremembered some numbers, or they could have changed since I last looked em up, but that was the approxiamate spell, and it shouldn't be.<br>
<br>
My hope is that VI has been listening, and has realized what has been happening, and the reason this patch has been put off, I beleive, twice now (Was on the 21st, then the 28th, and is now tomorrow?) has been they are working on adding something, anything, to make it desirable to have at least 1 (and hopefully more then 1!) warrior on a high end raid.<br>

<br>
like i said in the post, we had overkill (35 people to be precise, our &quot;normal&quot; vindi kill is 24) and it was by no means an efficient kill. cleric mana was hurting noticably since each cleric (had 5) was CHing every 20 seconds. granted, when you get to the high end luclin game where cleric mana is infinite and everything has 800 million hp, is slowed, and hits for 1000+, sk's will shine there since they don't need to eat ripostes, which are a significant portion of a slowed mob's damage.<br>
<br>
but if you want my opinion, VI needs to re-do things so there's 3 tank classes _at any level_ in the game, then give warriors a lot more diversity. better soloing, better grouping, better utility, etc. yes, i know most of you just want to preserve your &quot;main tank&quot; title, but frankly that's unreasonable and at this stage in the game, it's obvious vi is trying to spread out roles so there are no &quot;required&quot; classes. i don't mind warriors taking damage significantly better than sk's so long as it's not so grossly stupid like it was in velious. defensive was the ONLY way to kill things in velious prime, because there was no kei, ae mana, modrod2, etc..., so it was needed for mana to last.<br>
<br>
i think it's reasonable for warriors to take 70% damage, knights 90%, and every other class 100%. that's 10% mitigation for knights, 30% for warriors. if you use the knight numbers as the base-line, then warriors mitigate 22% of the damage knights WOULD be taking in that setup. that's a pretty sizable amount. that means AoW hits a knight for 1038 (causing him to be knight tankable, but only barely...), and a warrior for 807 (which is a much more comfortable margin of error).<br>
<br>
couple this with a much more diversified class setup(for instance, things along the line of the warcry idea would be nice.), fixing mob ac so dualwield/2h is in-line again, and warrior-viable shields...and maybe even throwing in a version of that &quot;intercept-tanking&quot; idea...and you'd be much closer to having a balanced, useful set of classes than now.<br>
<br>
one of the first things that needs to happen, though, is warriors need to realize that just because they aren't required for something doesn't mean their class is broken. i know someone's going to scream that they wouldn't even be required for AoW, but seriously, when was the last time a druid or a necro or a shadowknight or a beastlord was REQUIRED for something? it's an unreasonable mentality to have, and one that most warriors are going to have to accept is changing.<br>
<br>
disagree if you wish, i'm just an idealist that's hoping we can have EVERYONE useful, but NOT REQUIRED in the end. i'd be much more interested in having a good discussion about what we can agree on than arguing vehemently, though.<br>
<br>
P.S. the aggro spells on test are lame, stop mentioning them. i'd be happier if they just tossed them in the trash. note i can already hold aggro without turning attack on, and i REALLY DON'T want to turn into a buffing class that gets to aggroize the main tank every 10 minutes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uzumbukfleshcarver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zumbuk Fleshcarver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/4/02 1:54:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1190.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Bleh..I had a response typed out...but I said to hell with it.

<br>
I am very happy with that. I know that i will never loose my job to a SK.<br>
Unless a 7K+ just pops out of the void.<br>
<br>
Warriors have 1 advantage : HP<br>
<br>
When i take 500 DPS an SK will take 550-570<br>
When i have 7000hp an SK will have 6500<br>
<br>
When i need a 3 second rotation to be safe, an SK will need a 2 second.<br>
Guess what ? With a tiny lag spike i will survive. The SK will not.<br>
<br>
Mana is not really a problem. SAFETY is.<br>
And no other Tank besides the warrior will give you that safety.<br>
Cleric LD ? Launch defensive/evasive/furious<br>
Lag Spike ? 600hp more and a discipline available<br>
<br>
<br>
Ps: I do not say we do not need a boost in tanking.<br>
But SK will rarely get MTing spot unless agro is a problem <br>
(AL guimp out of range tanking).<br>
They MT better than us on agro, but they dont have that extra HP &amp; defensive caps.<br>
And those HP &amp; Caps make all the difference when things go BAD <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5132"/A>

THIS is the real Problem of the SK&amp;#180;s...<br>
they just can not accept the roll Verant had choosen for them ... <br>
They want to be Tanks or Puller. (go check the monk-board, u will find a thread there where they whining about not having insta FD as AA skill)<br>
<br>
But then again, when they want to be tanks, why did they started an SK and not a warrior? or when they want to pull, why didnt they start a Monk ?<br>
<br>
I only can speak about the highest endgame. There are several tasks for what SK&amp;#180;s are best suited. Its just NOT Maintanking an Mainpulling.<br>
<br>
Face it Mr. Shadow Knight, u will never be able to tank like a warrior without getting your aggroadvantage withdrawn, and you will never get Insta-FD without your abilty to snare mobs withdrawn.  Because it would unbalance the game a lot (or do you really think VI has no reason to cut warriors aggro?)<br>
<br>
Look what youre abilities are and use it. this is what every other class does. <br>

To my limited knoledge melee hit = decent chance of interrupt<br>
Vindic hits fast &amp; often i doubt he wont interrupt 90% of the time.<br>
Not counting stuns, and god knows we all get stunned.<br>

Ripostes HURT, but we still have a decent HP advantage and a small skill cap advantage.<br>

I would be really interested to get DPS for War/SK MT parsings on :<br>
Burrower (Slow &amp; Very hard hitter)<br>
Vindicator (Fast &amp; hard hitter)<br>
Exiled (Fast &amp; normal hitter)<br>
Dain (Ninja fast &amp; low hitter)<br>
XTC (Slow &amp; hard hitter)<br>
Cursed (Slow &amp; hard hitter)<br>

SK agro better, way better, but i think that if you parse the<br>
DPS taken for a 10 min fight  they will very almost the same.<br>
What we loose in agro, we gain in overall HP.<br>

vs. a real Bossmob (most are unslowable) a Shadow Knight wouldnt channel enough spells to hold aggro forever. he would need to swing his weapons as well.<br>
Enraging Blow is a huge aggro-proc.. but its scary to see how fast Rogues and wizards can catch up on aggro-list just with damage they make.<br>
<br>
Shadow Knights are Hybrids, which means a good part Tank and a good part caster. they will never be that effective like a pure caster and a pure Tank together (and they are always together on a raid)<br>
They have their niches, but not more, they knew that as they choose to play the class, now they should live with it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukildace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kildace</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/4/02 4:25:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1190.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeah, SK's won't tank anything decent..
