AA. If you don't, then AA &gt; 65. For people like Haass, me, etc. leveling past 60 just limits our experience with the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Something I can agree on, if you favor variety over efficiency anyway. Makes me kinda annoyed that there isnt a single palce outside POP where you can efficiently level past 60, but for me thats compensated by making an AA every 90mins or less in the new zones. <br>
<br>
Korak said: &quot;Therefore, I chose to encourage meaningful, intelligent commentary. Conversely, I chose to discourage illogical drivel.&quot;<br>
<br>
So me pointing out how a meaningful analysis of this problem would need to be conducted was illogical drivel? I never stated anything other then my own opinion on things, I never claimed to have proof one way or the other and I never asserted that my way is the right way for everyone. I did however say exactly how that someone with the time and inclination could prove it, one way or the other, and provided some anecdotal evidence on why I hold the opinions I do.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am admonishing the posters in this thread because they are trying to assert their &quot;rightness&quot; withut factual basis.&quot; <br>
<br>
This statement includes Haass who has provided no meaningful data either, just his opinions. I think im right, but thats just my opinion and I really couldnt be bothered putting in the huge amount of time proving it would take. You believe differently, and in your situation variety might be more important then efficiency in which case its probably the right way to go.<br>
<br>
Oh and 1 level is quite close to 5 AA, at least thats almost the exact ratio my groups were getting when I was grinding lvl 64 and 65 out with a group of 65 friends working solely on AA. If youre talking 0 xp in 61 to dinging 65, that is 4 levels (20aa), if youre talkign 0xp in 60 through to max 65, thats 6 levels (30aa). An AA point is the exact same amount of xp no matter which level you yourself are (its the same xp value at 51 or 65), and all the levels from 61-65 are fairly similar in xp cost. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143620" target="top">Zotha Farseer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.circleofeternity.org" target="top"> The Circle of Eternity - Veeshan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zotha>zotha</A> at: 11/25/02 10:32:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frodlin7th>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/25/02 10:24:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2437.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AAs or 65</span><hr size=1> Tanking:<br>

I'll try to make this as nice as possible.<br>
<br>
First off, mob DPS has to be included. There are too many factors that we can't calculate cause we don't know the formulas. The simple fact is that mob DPS is one of 2 figures that prove the point that level &gt; AAs. If you can't figure out a way to get the test identical, then don't do the test.<br>
<br>
Second, your DPS is also important because it illustrates the ability to overcome the defenses of a mob and how much that changes at different level differences. Some obvious examples would be fighting a blue mob, then getting one level to make the mob light blue and fighting it again. Then getting another level and fighting the mob green. The difference is vast and obvious, as I'm sure you all know, and that's only 3 levels.<br>
<br>
Third, Dumesh, AAs are AAs. Xp is XP. You either get 20AAs when you don't put your xp to leveling or you get 30. No 2 people will get 2 different numbers. It's a static xp climb. The consensus here is that the 5 levels equals around 20 AAs. No one is contesting this. I know for a fact that level 61 is exactly 3 AAs, so it looks like 20 might even be a slightly high number. This is the part where i would normally tell you off, but I said I'm gonna try to be nice about this, so I'll just stop responding to you now.<br>
<br>
Haas, you are doing the exact same thing that you say everyone else is doing. You're taking your thoughts and feelings on a matter, tossing in some HORRIBLY incorrect conjecture (levels only matter marginally, totally bullshit made up formulas you're using as a basis of argument, etc etc) and trying to defend them. It's not doable. If you want people to stop posting their opinions, then stop posting yours. <br>
<br>
And yes, I can throw stones, because if at any point I was guessing or adding in my opinion, I clearly stated it as that.<br>
<br>

<br>
The subject itself is totally redundant.<br>
<br>
What is it you want to level for? What is it you want AA for? Do you actually believe the two don't intertwine and more importantly aren't merely a means to an end?<br>
<br>
Some warrior that doesn't have time to level and is wasting his time instead on AA points benefits who and in what manner? Nobody in any manner or capacity, not even themselves.<br>
<br>
To have such a poor understanding of the game as to not know that the impact of 5 levels versus even 300AA points is STAGGERING. EVEN if at level 60 you could gain all your AAs up to the level 65 AAs. A level 65 with exactly ZERO AA's would still dominate you in every respect. Sadly, even AA's are limited by leveling within PoP so you will hit a brick wall eventually and have exactly what to show for it? Some parlor tricks?<br>

First off, no, I don't read castersrealm anymore, that site went into the crapper a long time ago, and it's not even accurate half the time these days.  Second, if you quote things without a source, yes, i'm going to question you, and no, i'm not being a @#%$, i'm asking where you got the information from. Don't get all pissy because I want to see where you got your quotes from, that's life.  You got information, tell me how you obtained it, or it means very little to me.<br>

And don't fuckin tell me I don't take what I say seriously.  I'm not gonna put up with that bullshit.  I'm asking a fuckin question and people can't give me an answer other than conjecture and non-numerical evidence.  Frodlin, thank you, I'm wrong, end of story.  Level up to 65 and tell everyone else too, and when everyone else does, they'll get the hell out of the zones i like to hunt in and will all be crammed into the dreadlands of valor.  And then everyone not in an uber guild will quit because there's no content for them at that level, which will in turn lead to less lag for the rest of us.

You can taunt mobs at 65 you can't taunt at 60. You can tank better at 65 then at 60 cause more mobs are blue to you, or less red. Isn't AoW 65?

No right or wrong answer in this case. Much unlike getting to 60 &gt; AAs.<br>
<br>
I decided what to do and maybe it can help some people in similar situations decide as well.<br>
<br>
Im getting to 60 then doing AAs until I see my guild getting further into content. Right now Im 57 and have been away from the game for a few months but I will be returning in a couple of weeks to level to 60 as fast as possible. My gear is mediocre for my level and my guild doesnt raid much. In fact or first PoH raid is coming up soon, so we still have much content yet to see. <br>
<br>
I was also questioning whether 65 is really worth or not in terms of helping the guild. I was trying to figure out if having lots of AAs at 60 was better or worse than being 65 with 3AAs. With lots of AAs Im able to get HP, better dmg mitigation, better attack, and with AE taunt an unresistable taunt. It seems that even though being a higher level will naturally higher these things, its not really necessary because while Im MA against something like Trak it wont really make much of a difference. That encounter was designed for a level 60 MA with no AAs. <br>
<br>
From what Ive been reading levelling past 60 really limits hunting spots for decent xp. I like many others enjoy hunting with guildies, If Im beyond 60 and hunting with guildies I will not be recieveing as much xp. I doubt Ill be in PoV anytime soon after I get back because my guild is not near that level. Nor is the DPS of guildie groups going to be near what it is for max xp in some zones.The choice was clear for me, its not worth my effort to level past 60<br>

<br>
I have come to view this discussion like this.  My guild cannot do the high end Luclin or PoP bosses.  We are instead looking at places like NToV and some of the lesser Luclin bosses as our targets.  Before luclin and PoP, there were you level 60 tanks who didn't have access to AA points tanking in NToV, ST, Tormax, etc.  I know that the 61+ levels carry some extra bonuses assocated with the higher level modifier, etc.  But since I won't have a PoV flag for quite some time, I need to make sure I can still be able to get good exp where I can.<br>
<br>
BUT, I would still love to see an analysis of weather a 60 warrior with AA's can out tank the 65 w/o the AA's.  Though I'm afraid it still wouldn't have too much affect on my choices. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=31658">Raun Stonecutter</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.swordoffate.com">&lt;Sword of Fate&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
<br>
Everyone knows this except the people who delude themselves into thinking how neat various AAs are. Sure, there are some particular AAs which are USEFUL, like Run Speed or AE Taunt, but nothing is going to affect your game more than your level.<br>
<br>
How much more effective is a level 60 at tanking a 62 mob than a 55? How much more DPS is that 62 mob going to do to a level 60 tank vs a 55 tank? This stuff is a no brainer.<br>
<br>
On the utility end, how much sooner will you get a group in PoV as a level 65 tank vs. a level 61 tank? By levelling you open up more grouping opportunities instead of sitting at the zoneline.<br>
<br>
Level up. It's the best thing you can do for yourself!  <p><p><center>

I have been taken over a 63 warrior in thurg/cobalt/SS mix (had baron title, so i assume somewhere between 6 and 18 AA'S) when groups looked for a tank in PoV.<br>
Guess what, reputation &gt; gear &gt; level &gt; AA (i only have 22 AA to my name yet, 4 yellow to ae taunt and back to full exp).<br>
<br>
I had a post on my guilds board where people were arguing that they need help with the trials for better exp in tier 2 zones.<br>
But guess what, if you have trouble passing the trials, dont go beyond 61, better even stay at 60 and try to improve gear and get some AA's while doing it.<br>
Especially tank classes who ask for help to pass the trials by inviting another tank shouldnt go to the trials.<br>
Do you expect easier mobs in the tier 2 planes than in the trial itself ?<br>
People in PoV will expect you to tank (and survive) an initial round of aggro without going down or having the group playing ping pong with the mob so you can survive.<br>
Mobs in PoV hit 400+ a shot and higher, in the Wastelands you will only see even or yellow cons at 61 that hit for 500+ and will take a caster down in no time.<br>
<br>
My personal advice to those at 60 or close to it:<br>
<br>
Try the trial of execution, if you can manage, you are ready for PoV.<br>
Don't expect to pass the first time (i got through on my 7th or so trial with a pure guild group 61 warrior, 61 chanter, 61 enchanter, 61 monk, 60 shaman, 63 rogue all in pre-NToV gear - partially WToV) as it needs some getting used to.<br>
Dont use F8 to target unless you have no mob in front of you left (i had a mob behind me targetted more than once and turning to find the right mob will take time for you and your rogue/monk).<br>
I had around the same hp when i passed the trial last week as i have now (after they fixed the bug with exe trial) and it was very easy for me and i only died the one time we actually passed the trial upon initial aggro on executioner. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65418">Gnomb Goodbasher level 61 troll warrior</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
1. Yes, it is a well documented fact that each AA point takes the same amount of XP.  However, that does not mean that the AA gain rate is the same for every person.  Nor does it mean that the xp gain rate is higher for a higher level person than a lower level person.  Since the change to xp that nerfed low blue xp (and enhanced xp for even and higher cons), the xp that mobX gives is NOT the same for everyone anymore.<br>
<br>
Killing a roughly equal mix of level 60 and 61 mobs in a particular area of Plane of Storms (the best xp spot I have access to that I have found so far, and all I am likely to have access to for the next month or two given my guild situation)... I can earn an AA point for every 36 kills, give or take one depending on the spread of 60 vs 61 mobs.<br>
<br>
The people grouping with me, including my level 62 roomate, and several 64s and 65s get AAs about every 45-60 kills (worse at higher levels).  This is because there is such a nice improvement on xp per kill for mobs that are white or yellow to you.<br>
<br>
Gaining level 63 or 64 or 65 doesn't automatically mean you gain AA faster than a level 60 or 61.  You have to have access to the best XP spots to do it.<br>
<br>
Now, all of that is totally unimportant if you are not me!  I am not trying to tell other people what their situation is or what is most efficient for them.  I have no @#%$ idea what their gear is, what places they can xp in, what mobs they want to/have to tank, what classes they group with, where their guilds are headed.  All of this matters in the short term.<br>
<br>
They people I am riled at are the ones that are trying to tell Haass, and me now, that I am wrong without knowing my situation and without having, or providing data to show that I am being inefficient, or that Haass' path is suboptimal... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>given the conditions he plays under</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>

You are passing efficiency judgements on the path I described for my self.  Yet, you have no basis to do so.  With the information (incomplete as it is) that I have, I believe I am making the most efficient path for me to 65 with the AAs that I want and need.  You, of course, are free to disagree with me, but I don't have to take your opinion seriously unless you back it up with data pertinent to my situation.<br>
<br>
Is 100% regular xp till 65 before additional AA more efficient for you?  I don't know, and I don't care.  You seem confident in your decision, so good luck.<br>
<br>

<br>
That is the whole freaking point.  I know I want (and assume most posters in this thread want) to be 65 with a full suite of defensive AAs and offensive AAs related to what weapons we have/like to use for our particular raid roles.  My job is to do damage, tank mez adds, and step in to occupy ubers for 6-20 seconds with no healing when tank transitions go bad because my guild isn't always on top of things.  I am no higher than 3 in the MT list for anything harder than Vindicator/Doomshade/IV... and I can't remember the last time we killed them (apart from Vindi if he is up when we go after AoW).  I am usually 5th or 6th in line to tank.  In otherwords, I don't tank boss mobs very much at all.  It isn't the most glamorous role, but it is one that I can fill very well, and it contirbutes to my guild's success.  We are not leading edge tier one... we just killed AoW for the second time.  Although, I can say we do 95 percent of our raids (including both AoW kills with 40 or less).  I have about 750 less hp from gear than the top two tanks in my guild, and I don't yet have ND3 or AE taunt.  Getting those things will help me tank better than getting level 63 in the same amount of time.<br>
<br>
Now, if I were a recruit to a tier one guild, a guild that was pushing the envelope in PoP, a guild that I could xp against level 64+ mobs in, I would go full out regular xp to 65 before picking up my AAs.  If I were the MT for my guild, I would be getting 65 first.  But, you know... none of those situations are me at this point.<br>
<br>
The two biggest points I wanted to make in this thread were that the aggressive attitude agaisnt Haass was unwarranted, and that more weight should be given to a characters' individual situation before slapping down the holy dictate that levels &gt; all, always more efficient, always better, kill the AA wanting infidels.  With the new scaling of xp based on mob level vs your level, that may not always be the most efficient path anymore.<br>
<br>
Finally, I will apologize for getting more riled that I should have.  There is no place for that, and it was unproductive and damaging to the community I wanted to foster.<br>

Get lvl 65 then do the testing on yourself again.<br>
<br>
From my parses as a monk I got less than 5% increase in damage dealing and less than a 5% improvement in damage taking ability going from level 62-65.  <br>
<br>
I remember when a lvl 60 pally deleveled to lvl 20 on my server before skills were reduced when you lost so many levels.  The guy would run around soloing Hill Giants with ease.  Don't tell me lvl &gt; all.<br>
<br>
The biggest reason to get 65 is because people believe it makes a huge difference.  <br>

<br>
Some AAs are pretty useless in the overall scheme of things. I think that some are very useful, AEtaunt maybe one of these. Im not wasting AA points on things I see little benefit in, I would much rather level.<br>
<br>
The biggest benefit I see to being 65 is being able to tank better purely based on being a higher level than a certain mob, or closer or even to it. This would help a lot in any given raid situation. The problem I see is that if youre 65 in crap gear fighting in a handful of zones available to you for regular it will get frustrating as hell. Im in a guild thats maybe 4-5 months from HoT so Im not looking at many upgrades unless I spend countless hours farming for plat to buy some RZ armor. <br>
<br>
Lets say I did have a flag for PoV, what would make me want to go there? I would get slaghtered in my current setup. I couldnt bring much of a guildie group there because there arent enough high levels to get a flag yet or even make a balanced group.<br>
<br>
I dont know I see great benefits to being a higher level, but if its to forsake some enjoyment in playing EQ Id rather AA until myself and others in my guild are ready to take that next step. My plan is to get AEtaunt and my AC to the soft cap before I begin to think about 61 and beyond.<br>

Wierdly enough, I am going to play devil's advocate...<br>
<br>
Haas,<br>
<br>
I actually look forward to your study.  Despite our disagreements, I think such a study IS worthwhile.  Do keep in mind that I will watch carefully...  you see lesser peeps have tried to &quot;prove&quot; how something isn't or is true and have fudged results.  If you are right we can all go do the &quot;deleveling&quot; thing... and I think we'd better all go /bonk SOE due to a rediculously silly plan.<br>
<br>
AAXP were designed to be lesser than XP.  With a few exceptions for &quot;utility&quot; and &quot;personal fun&quot;.<br>
<br>
Some points:<br>
-I am dubious in believing a deleveled level 20 can kill those giants &quot;with ease&quot;... The information is 3rd hand at best and a little silly.  Level 20 peeps don't have many HP, and the giants will hit very hard for a level 20.<br>
<br>
-Despite everyone's annoyance at SOE, their word is still better than no data at all.  If Haas can post some reasonable methodolgies, and peeps can reproduce it, then we have the proof to tell SOE they are wrong.  Haas was the one advocating &quot;proof&quot;.  Well, in all fairness, the &quot;Levels &gt; AAXP&quot; peeps have more proof than the &quot;AAXP &gt; Levels&quot; peeps.<br>
<br>
Last but not least:<br>
-If you are choosing AAXP over Levels to get something specific that you think is better than leveling now, then thats your call... (run3)<br>
<br>
-If you are choosing AAXP over levels because you think AAXP moves slower in 65 than it does in 60, then that is still your call, but experienced peeps are gonna feel its their duty to tell you that you are slowing yourself down.<br>
<br>
The sad thing is that people take on this &quot;I'll never get there&quot; attitude.  EVERYONE can get to tier2...  it doesn't take a tactical genius and Vex Thall gear to pass a trial.<br>
Indeed, while those &quot;uber&quot; guilds took skill, dedication, and practice to get where they are at this doesn't mean that ANY player with some motivation can't get there too.  <br>
<br>
Collect the information about the trial/mob/challenge, wheedle yourself the resources (classes) you need for your group, and go kick some tail.  Its how everyone else got there, and I tell ya... the number of 61+ newbies in PoV is staggering....  PoV is as bad for trains as Karnors ever was.  If they can do it, so can the experience peeps here.<br>
<br>
If you can get to tier2, the XP is not a problem...  65, AAXP up the wazoo, it will happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wandork>Wandor K</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 803<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/26/02 12:06:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2437.topic&index=135>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AAs or 65</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
Not true. PoV is not the end all exp zone, it is just the path of least resistance. There are plenty of camps in PoN and PoI that have great exp, just as good or better than the common PoV and PoS camps. The best part is that those camps are always open because the majority of people high enough level to fight there effectively are all in PoV.<br>
<br>
And please stop making it sound like getting into PoV/PoS is some great feat. Passing the trials is all about having the right group make up. The tank is totally irrelevant if you optimize the group to pass the trials. The only reason you even need a tank is to keep the executioner off of the damage dealers. Get a good group together and the trials are a joke.<br>
<br>
And to they guy who gets more exp than his 62-65 buddies ... grats on slowing your friends down and letting them PL you. Of course you will get more exp than someone higher level than yourself, since they changed exp you get a larger bonus when fighting the same mob. What you fail to realize is that a group of 65s can move to tougher camps with higher level mobs and kill them at a faster rate. Each person &lt;65 is slowing the group down and holding them back.<br>
<br>
The one valid point I have seen so far is regarding equipment. It is true, if you have sub-par gear then leveling to 65 is a waste of time because you will get eaten alive by PoP mobs. I would say that at level 60 you need to be 3800HP+ and 1200ac+ (unbuffed) to effectively tank the good PoP exp mobs. Doesn't take uber gear to get that, but you do have to have better than cobalt/crafted. Full Thurg or better with decent buffs are enough if you have someone slowing.<br>
<br>
As far as the level exp vs AA exp comaprison, tons of testing was done when PoP released and the consensus was that level 61 = 5.2 AA levels. It would be reasonable to say that level ing to 65 = 21 AA levels. IMO level 65 &gt; 21 AAs, particularly when you can rack up AAs at 65 make up the 21 AAs in just a couple of weeks tops. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wandork>Wandor K</A> at: 11/26/02 12:09:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zotha>zotha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/26/02 12:33:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2437.topic&index=136>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AA vs XP</span><hr size=1> Korak said: &quot;You are passing efficiency judgements on the path I described for my self.

<br>
Now my comment was about variety vs efficiency. In my experience of going from 60-65 (and doing a couple of quick AAs inbetween), there is no instance of mobs giving less xp/kill unless they happen to drop more then 4 levels below your level. Level 62 rock golems in Valor give the exact same amount of aa xp at 65 (blue)as they did at level 61(yellow), however going back to hobgoblins in nightmare (which are 59-60) gives significantly less xp / kill then they did at level 63. This simply means that you need to choose your kills more carefully. The reason the lvl 65s are getting less AA then you is because alot of the mobs in Storms are level 60 (possibly even 59, i froget). Every level 60 mob the group kills gives you significant xp gain, and the level 65 basically buggerall. Every lvl 61+ mob the group kills gives you exactly the same AA as the level 65 person. <br>
<br>
Hence, you have the choice of VARIETY (being lvl 60 and having more places to pick mobs from) vs EFFICIENCY (tanking better and doing more damage, but having to pick mobs carefully in order to get max value). Dont believe me? Kill the giants in storms with your friend and compare xp/kill.<br>
<br>
I dont give 2 shits how you deceide to progress, or if youre the 6th string tank for your guild, mostly I was just stressing that in order to be the most efficient tank you can be you WILL need to get level 65 eventually.<br>
<br>
There is no amount of AA which could make up for not being level 65, and its certainly not ~20 points, this is my opinion and the opinion of most other warriors who have hit 65 and have a large number of AA. You however are free to believe some loud fellow who has repeatedly demanded proof while providing none of his own. Once again.. opinion only.. dont care what you think.. or about your life story. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143620" target="top">Zotha Farseer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.circleofeternity.org" target="top"> The Circle of Eternity - Veeshan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dumeshuhlbelk>Dumesh UhlBelk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 354<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/26/02 2:33:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2437.topic&index=137>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://bellsouthpwp.net/w/i/wilsonua/Stare.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AA vs XP</span><hr size=1> Well, it appears we agree much more than we disagree.

Yes, 2 months from now, I absolutely want to be level 65 with ND3 CA3, and AET at a minimum.  I never intended to stop leveling or to contend that a levle 60 with those AAs was better in some way than a level 65 with no AAs.  The 65 is definitely more powerful.  I was merely trying to state that I believe I can get to my 2 month goal faster (given my circumstances) by getting the AAs first... since I have observed myself at 60 gaining AAs faster than my higher level party mates (even the level 62 ones).  I don't care that during the interim period I will be weaker than a warrior who does his levels first.<br>

In regards to people other then you leveling slower, it probably has something to do with the return of the hybrid penalty. That is to say that EVERYONE levels slower then us, since we have an inherant xp bonus for being a warrior. And, as someone earlier mentioned, XP is done differently then it was pre-pop. Where everyone used to get their xp altered to make it so that you all progress at an identical rate, now it's an even cut for everyone that is then modified by their XP penalty/bonus. So if you were to put a level 50 halfing warrior in a PoV group he'd probably be getting 3 or 4% a kill, at least (15% xp bonus <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  <p>Shelrabbi Hassida<BR>
