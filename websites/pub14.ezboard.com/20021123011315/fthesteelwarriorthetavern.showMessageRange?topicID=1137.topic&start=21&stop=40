<br>
Warriors rely 100% on their DPS and procs to hold aggro<br>
<br>
Knights don't<br>
<br>
A knight can hold aggro just fine without even turning on autoattack just by using their spells, a warrior doesn't have that option.<br>
<br>
Therefore, for a warrior, lowering DPS and losing dual-wield just to keep up on the tanking side of things is not a solution, because they can't hold aggro, while with a shield a knight has perma-evasive on and can hold aggro without any problem.  *that* is the problem, DPS comparisons are moot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucatrekil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Catrekil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/25/02 8:28:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> I think a warrior could hold aggro with 1 procing weapon, a shield (bash has taunt factor). *cough* snare glads, proximity aggro, taunt button!.

And what is with this perma evasive comparison, maybe I missed something but I havent seen any hard numbers on the damage avoidance gain from a shield. Its laughable to think that warriors will be replaced as raid tanks. Warriors have higher taunt, bash, parry, dodge, and riposte skills. Also higher hitpoints and disciplines to help lower damage taken for periods of time.<br>

1 procing weapon... Good taunt proc weapons are hard to come by..  snare glands=band-aid and totally unviable for day-to-day fighting or multiple encounters.. proximity aggro? doesnt work as well as you think.. taunt button?

I'll grant you that our higher cap on parry,dodge, and riposte skills will lend a slight advantage. HOWEVER.. higher bash cap does not meen higher bash skill.. What about the small/medium races that cant slam? think most of them have capped out bash skill? I doubt it. WRT to taunt skill see my previous paragraph  Taunt Button Don't Work. Higher HP's? it has already been stated time and again that a warrior with 255sta and ND3 will have about 400-500 more hps than a knight with 255sta and ND3 and PE (dont get me started on PE)  Now WRT disciplines.. 1st point  Do people realize that using evasive/defensive FURTHER cripples our DPS and by association or aggro capabilities. 2nd point... CH rotations make evasive/defensive almost moot.. Ask Furor what he thinks of these Disc (for those of you who dont know Furor is one of the most respected warriors serverwide) He will tell you time and again that they just dont use them. Besides with luclin encounters going 30,40 mins how does defensive/evasive help? it doesnt. All the non-warriors out there think that defensive is the holy grail.. well it isnt. <p><div align="center"><embed width="468" height="148" src="http://www.ameritech.net/users/amplified/SWSig.swf"></div><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucatrekil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Catrekil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/25/02 9:22:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   warrior / knight hp</span><hr size=1> The 425hp diff is with no gear factored in.

Furor has about 7800hp raid buffed.<br>
Dregor (foh SK officer) has about 6900hp raid buffed.<br>
Kreugen (one of the best equipped paladins that I can think of) has about 6950hp raid buffed.<br>

Must be easy for a knight class with spells and ALMOST the exact same stats as your average warrior, Im not talking about the dork who actually sits down and calculates his exact HPs and AC with all disciplines and AAs going and then makes some big mathmatical problem out of it.

If you aren't being sarcastic here, then you really helped to explain your lack of knowledge on this subject. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 276<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/25/02 11:22:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: omg you are right!</span><hr size=1> Well, I have to admit, I just don't see how they are going to work it so that a shield increases a Warrior's agro similar to his wielding a procing off hand weapon without giving the Knights the exact same utility.  And thereby making their agro generating the equal of a Warrior's before they cast a single spell.  Sounds like a formula to increase Knight agro generation through the roof, to me.  We'll see. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usmushums.showPublicProfile?language=EN>smushums</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Steel Warrior Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 1252<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/25/02 11:48:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: omg you are right!</span><hr size=1> he was being sarcastic because he already stated what his character is above in the thread.  i get the feeling you missed the point completely heh<br>

No i not in an uber guild but we are geeting ther.  Anyway again let em have aggro so they can die faster then, and as usuall a warr has to pick up the slack since the other melee is now dead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 652<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/26/02 9:30:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: omg you are right!</span><hr size=1> You could set the aggro for a fight using a rusty dagger in the offhand and a GLS in your main but it would be one crap-tastic fight =P<br>
<br>
And you seem to think that guilds will just let a shadowknight die well you know what if they can take the beating and help the guild <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> KILL THE MOB FASTER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> why should a warrior tank?<br>
<br>
People are not getting this point :<br>
<br>
On less than 100k mobs ( the ones defensive would last the entire fight with ) Raid force DPS &gt; any form of damage absorption.<br>
<br>
On uber hps mobs ( the ones that defensive is just a bump in the road for ) you only need to last for as long as it would take until the next cheal to last. That being met the best tank is the one that can who will generate the most aggro so as the mob can die faster. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170513">Varaho Carnicero</a>

DPS &gt; all.  Greater agro control = able to do greater DPS.  If you can keep the toon with the greatest agro control alive, you can jack your DPS up through the roof.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1137.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1137.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1137.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1137.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1137.topic&start=101&stop=101>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=1137.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showNextMessage?topicID=1137.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.emailToFriend?topicID=1137.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.threadControl?topicID=1137.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1137.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1137.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
