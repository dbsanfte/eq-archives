<br>
Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes.<br>
<br>
Some mistakes aren't that unbalancing and are safe to keep in the game and work around. Others can sometimes yield gameplay that turns out to be even more fun than developers even imagined, as ingenious adventurers discover unrealized potential in their abilities.  Yet others, even the best-intentioned ones, can cause an entire style of gameplay to shift dramatically in a direction that no one particularly enjoys.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, today, we need to address a number of the latter kind.  For that, we sincerely apologize. It is absolutely our fault that certain abilities have been allowed to grow out of control.<br>
<br>
In our last letter, we stated that our goal for large scale battles in EverQuest was never one of endurance contests. We'd prefer to actively return to the type of battles that everyone feels are more fun - Battles that require tactics and skill, as opposed to attendance and endurance.<br>
<br>
Due to some specific abilities as they exist today in EverQuest, this unfortunately isn't possible. The mathematics simply cannot be made to work. In extreme cases such as that, the abilities themselves must be altered.<br>
<br>
It isn't possible, for example, to ever make another fast-action, do-or-die-quickly style encounter as long as Manaburn exists in its current form, unless it is targeted solely at an entire group of people who have this ability, as it will otherwise be trivial to those who do.<br>
<br>
Likewise, it isn't possible to create encounters that must be completed in a certain amount of time due to mana consumption, when Rods of Mystical Transvergence provide an essentially unlimited source of mana. Every challenging encounter must also be challenging for the massive raid of people who have infinite mana, and the encounter then becomes undoable to those who do not have the infinite supply.<br>
<br>
Hypothetically, the only alternative to changing abilities such as these would be to inflate every other class up to the same tier of relative power (be it damaging power, or mana regenerative power), then inflate the rest of the world to compensate for the sudden rash of new found power. Drastic, world-wide changes of that sort, however, are a guaranteed way to do more harm than good.<br>
<br>
The time has come to address these abilities. Fortunately, after doing so, EverQuest as a whole, and the encounters in Planes of Power, will be able to be tuned for forces who are interested in active participation in the game, as opposed to those forced to sit through yet another 45 minute encounter with a single NPC, as became the norm in Luclin.<br>
<br>
<br>
* Manaburn. In addition to the problem described above, this ability was never intended to be a way for small bands of high level players to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more appropriately leveled people. While this was not the universal case, it has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it became a large concern in recent months.  The concept of someone looking to complete their epic quest via teamwork and overcoming the odds, only to have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small teams of players looking to profit financially from their power, quite frankly, is not a behavior that we wish the game to reinforce.<br>
<br>
In the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that their ability points have been refunded. Please make sure that you have fewer than 25 pooled Ability points.<br>
<br>
At that point, they will be able to purchase a new Manaburn if they choose, which has most of the power of the old one. However, the new Manaburn leaves a temporary effect on its target when used that  does not stack with other Manaburns.  The delay that we will be tuning on the Test Server soon will allow a single target to be manaburned no more frequently than once every minute. <br>
<br>
Hopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive short-term damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy powerful creatures with zero risk. <br>
<br>
<br>
* Rods of Mystical Transvergence. The description above shows how this spell has perhaps singlehandedly altered the balance of the end-game encounter by turning it into an event where the largest challenge is setting up a timed rotation of Complete Healing.  Once that is established, in many cases, the event is just as playable by leaving AutoAttack on, and wandering away to watch television. This does not make for stellar interactive content.<br>
<br>
We view Magicians as an excellent source of damage, especially with the many pet enhancements that have been made over the past year. To be honest, it is a more than a small shame that their full energies have been viewed as &quot;needed&quot; to be spent, full-time, purely on transferring their mana to others. Magicians are supposed to be the masters of elemental conjuration and highly respected as a damage-dealer, not the masters of mana transferrence.<br>
<br>
In the next update, Rods of Mystical Transvergence will be changed so that the spell summons an item that is still a valuable upgrade over the original Modulation Rod, yet does not provide an infinite amount of mana.  The idea of sudden mana gain spells is only balanced if there is a net loss over time to counteract the rapid infusion.  The initial version of the spell that we will be testing summons a Rod containing a single charge of 360 mana for 450 hit points, and can only be used by a person once each minute.<br>
<br>
In addition, the Rods themselves will be non-droppable, and spell will turn into a &quot;target based summon,&quot; such that the Magician summons them directly onto the recipient, as opposed to having to hand them out manually or create a stockpile on the ground.<br>
<br>
Since there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of mana regeneration is mandatory for the encounter to be beaten by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be re-tuned to shorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit points on the NPC in question.<br>
<br>
Again, our intent here is provide Magicians with a desirable secondary ability that would ideally be used before a battle, not an ability which essentially compels them to suddenly transform into a full-time support role, transferring their mana to others, as opposed to dealing damage. <br>
<br>
<br>
* Complete Healing. The concept of any class getting their single best, most efficient primary ability at level 39, has never sat well with most people. In the days of characters having a maximum of 2000-4000 hit points, the spell was absolutely not imbalancing. However, as time went on and characters progressed, now doubling that amount of hit points, it becomes obvious that the spell must be scaled back slightly.<br>
<br>
This spell has, over time, become the defining cornerstone of the Cleric class. As such, it cannot be altered significantly. Taking that into account, and given that those with the most hit points in EverQuest have yet to hit the full 10,000 HP cap of this spell, the spell will remain nearly as useful as it is today, by being reclassified as a spell that heals for 7,500 hit points, down from its current cap of 10,000.<br>
<br>
This will allow it to continue to be used as it has been in the past, while allowing for more dynamic types of heals to be introduced in the future. Making this change will allow us to providing more entertaining high-end encounters that require more active involvement than setting up a Complete Healing &quot;Rotation&quot; or &quot;Chain,&quot; then repeating the same motions until the Large Thing you are facing, eventually falls down.<br>
<br>
<br>
* Monk Defense.  Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  <br>
<br>
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; as far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br>
<br>
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br>
<br>
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem.  <br>
<br>
Monk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)  It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br>
<br>
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.<br>
<br>
In closing, we would like to again apologize for the amount of time that we've allowed these abilites to remain in their current state. With Planes of Power on the horizon, in order to make encounters that most people would consider &quot;fun,&quot; these abilities and class attributes need to be brought back into line as sane upgrades and logical progressions, as opposed to their current manifestations.<br>
<br>
We appreciate the many well thought-out letters that have been sent in on these topics and more.  As always, we thank you for playing EverQuest and look forward to seeing you soon in the Planes of Power.<br>

This let mages use the rods as a ghetto cannabalize spell to quickly restore their mana (as long as they had a healer... the net result of one rod being cast and then used was +260 mana and -900 HP). With the proposed change, it will cost more mana to cast than it gives back when you use it, so mages are left with no means to regain mana in an emergency.<br>
<br>
Targeted Mod Rod isn't that bad... player 1 sends a tell for a rod... mage uses /rt to target player 1 and casts the spell.  Presto - rod is on player 1's cursor and ready for use.  Only real nerf with this part is you can't have tanks hold spares and put a bunch on the ground before starting so you are limited on the amount of stored mana you have at the start of an encounter.<br>
<br>
As for the plate vs PJ thing. I think we all wanted plate tanks to be able to tank better than monks... but I don't think any of us wanted to see that come as a result of a nerf to the monk class. Would have much rather seen it come as an improvement for the plate wearers and leave the monks alone.  <p><table border="0" width="481">

Been spending most of my time lately playing my warrior alt.<br>
<br>
Been having a blast too. I can carry loot. I can do quests for items I actually USE. <br>
<br>
There's armor I can quest and ENJOY.<br>
<br>
There's weapons that I can actually think about upgrading to.<br>
<br>
There's like a whole progression thing here.<br>
<br>
Then there's my monk.<br>
<br>
My main.<br>
<br>
The character I've been playing since I got this game.<br>
<br>
UNLIKE most of the monks over at MB complaining about the UPCOMING patch, I've been displeased with what they did to my class since the LAST patch.<br>
<br>
Casters rape me.<br>
<br>
A LOT.<br>
<br>
Worse than before.<br>
<br>
I had what I thought were good resists. Then I went to Chardok. And found out the hard way they were NOT good resists.<br>
<br>
The next patch is going to take away what little ability I had to solo crappy crap XP giving OUTDOOR melee only mobs.<br>
<br>
Not finding much left to do with my monk, other than get mauled on pulls in planes or zones that are hard to CR in.<br>
<br>
I need me one of them famous Steel Warrior Tavern libations.<br>

Why? So far what really separate us from the rest of the tanks where /disc Defensive and our superior hps, making CH on us much more effective.<br>
Now with PoP you will see lv60 warriors that have currently around 6k hps jump to 65 level with close to 10khps with just a few gear upgrades, and if you just count with PlaneAA that provide hps a char with 6k hps can get to over 9k at 65 with just the PlaneAAs. However this increase in hps isn’t warrior only, so we will see all other tanks and probably all melees getting over 7500hps with PoP.<br>
That leaves the effectiveness of CH to be equal to everyone with over 7500hps.<br>
That means that the only reason left to have a Warrior as main tank is if its really needed to use /disc defensive. So all in all warriors do get the shaft on this one too.<br>
Thanks VI<br>

upgrading other classes just makes things too much easier.  mobs already die instantly on spawn it seems like.  upgraded players = bored players that kill everything too fast. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7023  target="web">smushums<a</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uorion61269.showPublicProfile?language=EN>orion61269</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/9/02 5:31:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1373.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New dev post, manaburn / modrod2 / ch / monk defense cha</span><hr size=1> WOW--You mean no more team &quot;steal your camps&quot; manaburn?Wizzies...<br>

Not an sk, Not a ranger, Not a Monk--<br>

Nope just us baby--In any game the warr always can take the most damage and dish out the most also, what makes this game so diferent that they had to screw with our class, so we are less desireable.<br>

Well talking on big encounters yes i do assume that. Do you have news of a better one?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You also assume that defensive and evasive will be the only significant advantages we will have on knights in regards to mitigation and avoidance. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
In regards to mitigation and avoidance well yes i assume that, nowhere i saw that the AC softcapt will be removed, as his almost all if not all knights on my guild have the AC on the softcapt allready, and has for AAs to improve both, well we and the knights all have access to it, and from what i saw with PoP AAs its the same. So, regarding mitigation and avoidance maybe you can tell me something i missed.<br>

Good point didnt thought of that, a light at the end of the tunnel, theres still hope for us.<br>
Actually the more i see it the more i see the real benefits for having a high hps warrior has main tank even with CH caped at 7500. <br>
Thanks for pointing that out.<br>

<br>
I'm liking the patch, but the tuning of hps is key.  Mod2 came out with Velious so the hps tuning will have to go back to the previous expansion.<br>
<br>
Come on, everyone with some time into EQ <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> knew</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Verant was going to nerf manaburn.  Wizards making 500,000pp in a week with no risk is broken - duh.  The only wizards who are wigging are the ones that really don't understand the game and economy mechanics.<br>
<br>
Monks were tanking FAR to well give their DPS.  Every experienced warrior knows this.  Why have a warrior in an exp group at all?  Monks pull better.  Do more dmg.  Tank better.  Looking forward, monks will be like paper tigers. weeee!<br>
<br>
I don't care about a 7,500 hps cap on CH.  Anyone with a little experience with EQ can predict that a new CH will be out in PoP - duh.  And, hps is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> still</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> golden unless count on getting a heal at 5% life.  I'm betting that today's 7,500-8K hps tanks are getting healed for around 4k-6k on average when tanking Seru.  If that is the case, they will notice ZERO difference from the CH nerf.  If they are getting healed for 7,501 hps (on average), they ain't beating Seru. <p>Zaboo Krusher<BR>
