<br>
Upon further consideration of the solution planned, monks in the endgame will still probably tank just as well as warriors even after the so-called nerf...<br>
<br>
Now why do I say that?<br>
<br>
Well, the whole idea behind Furor's original complaints was that monks took less DPS due to higher avoidance and equal mitigation.  This was true of course, due to higher block procs.<br>
<br>
Now, the nerf is supposed to reduce mitigation of monks, which it probably will across all levels of monks, while leaving their avoidance intact.  Sound good right?  Wrong.<br>
<br>
Basically, any high level mob in game, no level of AC will give you any kind of Mitigation.  We know this.  IE, doesn't matter what your AC is, Eom's, Seru, Emp, AL, etc will still hit you for max.  Right?<br>
<br>
So, what will lowering monk mitigation do?  Nada.<br>
<br>
We'll still get hit for about the same amount that everyone else is most likely.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, monk avoidance is going to remain the same.  IE, we'll still avoid 6% more than plate classes.  And still mitigate about the same as everyone else against those mobs, ie not at all.<br>
<br>
Translation, monks will still be rampage tanks.  Monks will still take less damage due to avoidance skills, maybe even less than currently if they beef up those skills.  We'll still do our normal DPS, except we might eat up some more of that precious healer mana.<br>
<br>
What will this really do to other monks?<br>
<br>
Well, this will probably leave monks soloing the same stuff they did before, still offtanking when necessary (as most high level monks will still be well above effective ac softcaps for experience groups), and still soloing.  After all, due to low monk hps avoidance really is better than mitigation, though a little more streaky.  Though, not like it's anything FD won't solve, right?)<br>
<br>
Sure, monks die a little more pulling due to avoidance skills not being applied when our backs are turned, but it's not like slower raids are a bad thing.  I mean, we all love long raids and longer CR's.<br>
<br>
In the end, what does this mean?  Plate classes are still relatively broken.  They still won't be any better off versus high level encounters.  Their taunt still sucks and they'll be dependent on EB and Hate giving weapons.  Verant has made alot of people unhappy.  And there's now alot more strife between classes.<br>
<br>
Good job Verant.<br>
<br>
And for all those who decided that cheering on the nerf of other classes was a good thing, well, I'm sure that you feel better now, right?<br>
<br>
All in all, looks like a win win situation for everyone.  I'm sure glad that Verant took this road instead of fixing actual AC mitigation above the effective softcaps.  Aren't you?<br>

Bingo. This doesn't do a thing for fixing warriors. All it does is divert YOUR attention from the fact that VI didn't do a damn thing to improve warriors or restore the balance of tanking power. Make no mistake, warriors are still broken as can be but knights are sitting VERY pretty. Their taunt still works, they mitigate the same barring our 3 minutes of glory, the hp gap between knights and warriors is as small as ever.<br>

Shadow Knights say they are underwhelmed by the recent agro spells they've received.  They also say all their old agro producing spells have been nerfed.  Paladins are saying that stuns no longer seem to produce agro like before when resisted.  There is some disagreement there though.  So over all, I'm not sure saying the Knights are sitting pretty is accurate.<br>

<br>
I think where the misconception lies is that monks should &quot;tank&quot; at all. A tank is a heavily armored, relatively slow beast that can take a punishing amount of damage and pays for this with a somewhat limited selection of firepower. Tanks do alot of damage, but not nearly the damage that non mobile emplacements do.<br>
<br>
A monk is not a tank, nor should he be. A monk is artillery. Artillery does shattering damage but is screwed if it actually gets hit. It's strength lies in not being hit, ie avoidance. <br>
<br>
The error lies with the conception that anyone besides knights and warriors should tank, period. Monks, like rogues and rangers, are meant to be stand off weapons that do tremendous damage at the price of an inability to take damage in kind.<br>
<br>
The problem is that because off the availability of armor that wasn't class restricted and had low weight, monks were approaching the mitigation abilities of the true tanks. In addition, they had superior avoidance abilities which, when matched with thier vast damage superiority, seriously overpowered them.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, with the ac softcap still in place, monks are still going to enjoy much the same survivability they always have had. They may not solo quite the mobs they did before, but I seriously doubt if you will ever find a warrior that will sympathise with someone who complains about a lack of solo'ing ability.<br>
<br>
Monks have needed to return to the niche the were intended to have for a long time...this patch will steer them in that direction. With some of the other upcomming changes in the next few patches and the addition of PoP, this gulf in tanking abilities should widen further and more firmly cement monks in the place they were originally supposed to occupy. My hope is that there will also be a widening of the difference between mitigation capabilities between knights and warriors as well. As I posted in another thread, there has been no direct indication that the softcap will be raised or removed in anything i've seen regarding the coming of PoP. However, there are strong suggestions, when other factors are taken into consideration, that this will indeed happen. There is going to be a major retuning of many current mobs before and during the PoP release. The release of information about the new AA's shows that the stat cap will definately be raised. There are also many items out there already that can be obtained from NToV and higher zones that already breach the softcap before buffs, with VT making it painfully simple. Verant has already stated that PoP gear and weapons will be the best in the game by measurable margin. Unless the softcap is raised, then there is nowhere to go with armor at all, which would make the gear upgrade pointless. Verant does alot of dumb things, but i seriously doubt they would introduce an entire expansion worth of gear that is completely pointless.<br>

Im sick of Monks and their punk ass ego attitudes and quite frankly it's a nice change to see them taken down a notch. Just posting this kind of message in a warrior forum shows how really freaked out the monk class in general is and I think they are scared. Scared of what? I think they are scared because they can no longer put down other classes and mock others in EQ because of their &quot;superior&quot; abilities.<br>

Im so glad this happened. I am sick of being mocked by monks and being continuously told I am crap because I play a War. THis is pure bliss.<br>

You know the difference between a monk and a warrior? Warriors are people who have accepted the short end of the stick and know we are underdogs. We know we must sharpen our skills in order to overcome our enemies and our disadvantages. We must hunt smarter because we do not have the luxury of pushing a button to avoid death. <br>
<br>
The real difference in our classes is not hp or any kind of bullshit stat. Warriors accept and triumph over our weaknesses. Monks whine and bitch about theirs.<br>

Monks have latched onto the wonderful low weight high ac/+hp all/all items VERANT placed into the game. This, combined with thier other defensive abilities has caused them to become a viable tank class in many situations.<br>
Ideally, warriors should have significantly higher ac / hp.<br>
Monks can get comparable ac / hp with the right gear. This wasn't much of an issue because of the weight penalty to ac for monks, until the advent of the mentioned ac / +hp 0.x wt items.<br>
<br>
What has me concerned is instead of addressing the issue of overpowered low weight items that sidestep a monks inherant ac/weight penalties, they 'balance' the entire class making those same items necessary to be an average monk.<br>
<br>
What I see, both as a monk and a warrior, they screwed up some items and now nerf a  class to balance it.<br>
So two wrongs don't make a right except on Norrath? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukhanktinga.showPublicProfile?language=EN>khanktinga</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 7:05:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An open letter to Warriors from a Monk... </span><hr size=1> The core problem with all class balance issues is something fundamental to the game: too many classes, too few roles. There are 6 classes for whom dealing and taking melee damage are central to their 'roles' in the game: Warriors, Knights, Rogues, Monks, and Rangers. (Beastlords and Bards' melee damage is at best half of what those two classes are valued for). There's just no way they'll ever be able to maintain a good balance between those 6 classes and still keep them unique. The pendulum will swing wildly forever between the classes, that's just the way it is.<br>
<br>
As for the monk problem being a gear problem rather than a class one, that's a no brainer. When I think monk, I think of a spiritual bad ass, in a loose and light pair of pants, slippers, and no shirt to show of his totally ripped frame. A  guy (or gal) with such a tight mind/body connection that he could kick your ass with a pair of chop sticks just as easily as the quarterstaff of ownage. But EQ being what it is: a totally item driven game, a character that should disdain material things as a distraction from his spirituality is instead just as reliant as any other class on getting the next better weapon or piece of armor if he wants to improve his fighting abilities.<br>
<br>
My own personal opinion and view of what monks should be, is that toe to toe with a humanoid-type enemy, a monk would be just as hard to kill as any other melee class, warrior included, regardless of armor. Of course, this 'vision' is inherently imbalanced. Quite frankly, that vision has the monk being better than the warrior in most respects, hardly something balanced for a class-based game. <br>
<br>
So we comprimise that ideal to have some kind of trade off. In exchange for the improved damage and special skills and abilities monks get, they are supposed to have the following penalties:<br>
1) be less able to take punishment for long periods of time (less hps)<br>
2) get hit harder when they do get hit (less mitigation)<br>
3)have more limited equipment choices (wt and leather-class items restrictions). <br>
<br>
Without all three of those penalties, monks become too powerful. It's that simple.<br>
<br>
Where did Verant go wrong?<br>
<br>
1) Monks are in the right place on the HP totem pole, IMO.<br>
2) There simply should never be an AC softcap that is so independent of how powerful the mobs are. Having anything over 1300 AC be useless against frogs in OS is fine. At some point you outclass a mob one on one so much that it no longer matters. But to have it mean little to nothing against mobs like Emp, or the AoW is just plain stupid.<br>
3) There should have been MUCH better supervision and oversight of zone designers so that items obviously too powerful for a class that is supposed to have item restrictions were never introduced in the first place. It should have been obvious to anyone that really knows the game that Low wt , high AC items usable by all melee classes, or even all classes would be unbalancing for monks. It had previously been the case that monk usable armor was always much lower in AC than the best armor available to other melee classes, but a few designers got lazy just put in all/all stuff instead of thinking out more logical armor sets.<br>
<br>
The best solutions, again, IMO:<br>
<br>
2) Completely retool the way mitigation is determined. It should compare the player's AC against the mob's attack value, or some other number associated with how powerful the creature is. You could still have 'soft caps' for when the character is so much more powerful than the mob that he is outclassing it in one on one melee when he has a group to support him. (i.e. is getting buffed and healed, has people to debuff the mob, etc.) So, there could still be soft caps for xp groups, or for fighting greens solo, but AC would always matter against the boss mobs. Also, the actual mitigation tables would be different for plate, chain, leather, and cloth classes. Then, having 1400 AC on a wizard could matter, but he would still mitigate less than a warrior with 1000 AC, or something along those lines. This would give the classes that now get hit for max 90% of the time now some more options for equipment, perhaps.<br>
<br>
3) Retro-nerf all/all and all melee/all high-end items that are the best armor pieces for armored melee, and are clearly too high in AC for monks.<br>
<br>
Verant should have some in-house programs that use their melee algorithms to simulate fights and come up with average dps numbers. If they don't, that's really lame. I'm no programmer, but as a scientist that uses custom written programs for simulations and data analysis, I can tell you that such tools would be easy to write for a professional programmer. Such tools would be 10 times more accurate than the best parsed logs. They could then use those tools to determine when they get the adjustments suggested in 2) and 3) right before even putting them on test, let alone on the live servers.<br>
<br>
I'm far from being a monk-basher. Friends in my guild have monks that are about where they should be in terms of tanking ability and damage without this incoming nerf. One friend was already thinking of setting aside his lvl 60 monk because his item upgrade paths required a raiding, powerguild playstyle he just doesn't like. This will put him over the edge, as he's already started to twink and plvl a SK to replace him.<br>
<br>
So, as a warrior, I fully realize that these were all Verant's @#%$ ups, but regardless of how clueless they've been in the past, they need to fix these problems if they want their other games to be half as successful as EQ has been. I for one, simply don't trust them to maintain star wars and EQ2 the way they should be. They will both probably be good games to start with, but eventually, they'll @#%$ them up if history provides any lessons. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193443" target="_blank">

<br>
because monks have 1500+ AC too. fixing the softcap would only hlp if warriors got WAY higher AC than monks.. and they dont&quot;<br>
<br>
Ill compair myself tothe top warrior in my guild. Me I have 1450ac warrior 1720ac. thats almost 300ac more. seems like remove of soft cap would of helped.<br>
<br>
Second thing I would like to point out is about items. No need to remove monk from anything. Pop be out real soon, just simple dont make godly all/all items(maybe they should just drop tokens so any class can loot and turn in for an item geared for their class) make class armor. Just dont make monks have the kind of ac warriors do.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucarnagh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnagh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/11/02 1:51:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1386.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An open letter to Warriors from a Monk... </span><hr size=1> It would take me a weekend with the EQ item database to completely overhaul the high end Monk itemisation and then a week to test it.<br>
<br>
It's not that big a deal. It's simply going through a list of Monk items and changing the stats where needed.<br>
<br>
People are once more appreciating some stats and resists in general. You wouldn't even get that much whining if in retuning high end Monk gear you gave them an emphasis on good stats and resist rather than large ac. Many Monks would welcome it, as it would give their equipment a more unique flavour.<br>
<br>
Bump some stats and resists on the mediocre Monk only armour in game and *shock horror* people might start wearing it again.<br>
<br>
Fixing the AC softcaps is a no brainer, otherwise you'll revisit this problem with other classes.<br>
<br>
There are simple creative way to fixing this problem that don't involve pissing off large number of people, and actually fix real problems rather than sympotoms.<br>
<br>
Of course that assumes you're interested in fixing problems rather than just slapping people down. <p><hr />

<br>
How happy would you be if they retroactively changed all &quot;monk armor&quot; to armor with 5 pounds of weight per piece? You DO realize it's not quite as easy as just changing the AC on them and raising stats and saves right? Considering most &quot;monk armor&quot; (read anything with low weight and high ac) is also utilized by other classes as well, the only real solution is to bump the weight on it from 0 - 1 to 5 - 10. Ok, problem fixed right? Well no, all of a sudden we have monks who wont be wearing this gear anymore cause of the way it's reducing their ac now. Ok, so they will just stop wearing it. Realisticly however, who is gonna be happy with monks banking high end loot just cause it weighs more now? Lots of people are gonna want refunds of their gear so to speak.<br>

As somebody who works with databases no I'm not.<br>

And how much deliberation does retuning a 60ac monk legging take?<br>
<br>
Nerf 1% or nerf 100%... I know which will generate less complaints. <p><hr />

It was only to point out that from day one we have been CAPABLE of tanking. What made us less likely to be chosen was our lack of hit points and taunt really. We still avoided more and mitigated almost as much we just didnt have enough hp at the time to make healing the monk efficient. Of course NOW its gotten out of hand since I, as a monk, can tank just as well as any other non super twinked warrior and the majority of my armor is TAILORED! Im going to hold off on freaking out until the changes go live personally. I just want to see how bad, (Its not a question of if, its a question of how BADLY they screwup) they break things and THEN ill start foaming at the mouth if monks start taking hits like a druid or something.<br>
