Me (at 52), a 52 cleric and 60 warlord fighting the vamp castle in TM. Warlord brought a named and we got a coterie add. I'm instructed to tank the add...getting hammered. The warlord yells &quot;Go evasive!&quot; I yell back &quot;what? i don't have that yet! should i zone it?&quot; He yells back &quot;type /disc evasive&quot; I do, go evasive, felt really stupid, but we survived )<br>
<br>
Now at 55, we did the Arena in Kael. We had one death so far (Ranger hehe) and we're having fun. Then the pullers go OH OH GET READY....here comes 6 huge gaints (normal ones, a couple cleric dudes, and others i can't remember since i only see their knees and below.) I'm the MT so i start the target messages, chanters mezzing/charming right and left, everyone /assisting and WE DID IT! All the pullers died tho and you should have heard them in guild chat when the giants were all dead. A most fun night and I felt good that I keep calm, called for the assist, didn't die, and also, if felt really good that I didn't really pay attention to my health because I had one of the best clerics in the game who I knew was right there healing me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uygnirthundersson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ygnir Thundersson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/18/02 11:38:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1250.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.oozbv.demon.nl/ygnir.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Fighting the general on this ledge... the first time we attempted it, we poofed when he touched a wall.

Overpulling in FG and getting 3 fungibeast... while duoing with PapaBear (~Eamonn).... at the end of the fight we lived, I was at 70% health and Eamonn at 70% mana.. at that moment we declared ourselfs Ueber and whent AFK to get booze.

Raiding the Tormax Room in Kael... raid force wiped out... except Myself, Eamonn, a bot-druid and a lvl 45 rogue.... we killed 2 giants and the freshly popped Veteran, looted silk &amp; chain sleeves &amp; got a wolf down, before the rest of the wolf pit warping on to us slew us......<br>

We were in the Plain of Air and they had just put in the patch that gave mobs Enrage so nobody really knew about it yet.  Don't remember which Isle we were on but we were doing the first boss that enraged.  I think most of us were in the 47-51 range.<br>
<br>
It's a hard fight and we've lost a few people, casters are mostly OOM, suddenly the mob goes enraged.  Within about 3 seconds while everyone's staring at their screen in disbelief wondering what the hell is going on almost every melee on the raid is dead.  I survive along with maybe a couple of hybrids.  Suddenly everyone is shouting HEAL KHUMAK!  I basically solo'd him the rest of the way after getting about 10 CHs.  That was the first time I felt badass.<br>
<br>
Most common quotes immediately after from the melees were &quot;WTF happened&quot; and from the healers &quot;OMG I've never seen so many people die so fast&quot;.  Trivial now but man was that a rush. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85547>Khumak</a><br>

I was in an uber guild for 6months or so and realised I missed my old guild (who I had left on good terms with).  <br>
<br>
I returned, was re-instated as an officer and applied myself to helping the guild move forward.  I had never fought VS but I had laid out plans on how to do him.  <br>
<br>
My guild (Moonlight Crusaders) had attempted him on 4-5 occasions previously without success.  <br>
<br>
I stepped in explained the plans, and on the first night he popped.  <br>
<br>
We went in and prepared with our allies and I engaged him - we owned him completely with 0 deaths, which started a landslide in the guild in terms of mobs falling:  VS farmed, Trakanon owned, Sev owned etc.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uthatkiagirl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>That Kia Girl</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/19/02 7:48:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1250.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/lgl525/nom.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> I have to say vindi too =p<br>

That left us with a 53 and 52 cleric and some druids.   I thought forsure we were going to wipe just cause these guys were the ones with crappy mana pools and little raid exp and here I am getting creamed by a mob no one expected.   It was a really fun fight and won with minimal losses although I got under 10hp twice when CH's landed talk about a rush hearing just about everyone say 00MANA and then a CH landing.<br>
<br>
I think other then that I would say that Single group Halls of Testing has got to be the most fun.  Vehament(sp) Wyvern's when you only have 1 cleric and a druid to do the healing is crazy and the fights last up to 10 min.<br>

All this as  the weak warrior I am.<br>
