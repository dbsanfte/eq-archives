<br>
I had planned a raid to fear with my guild and allies in order to obtain my ball of everliving golem.  i spent 2 weeks researching the zone, the mobs, and rounding up suport to go. when i got up thsi morning I was very excited about leading the raid to fear and was happy to see that 4 guilds had shown up and were coming to support my raid.<br>
<br>
Once in feerot and standing before the gate we began to make groups.  this is the time that an &quot;UBER&quot; guild noticed we were there.  they then proceeded to run 3 members inside fear and have them FD as soon as inside.  I was curious as to what was going on.  this is the time i recieved a tell saying, &quot;we are in fear, its camped&quot;  <br>
<br>
needless to say i was shocked/ how can you claim an entire zone with 3 people?  soon though, 1 by 1 more members of this guild ran past us and inside fear, where they suddenly had LFG tags on and were trying to get organized.  <br>
<br>
turns out this UBER guild wanted to kill CT and draco and were now clearing the zone so they could do it.  I was then informed that IF i wished, my raid would be allowed to enter fear as well and get some armor drops and such, cause they were useless to this guild and they didnt want them, however we must sit there and wait and would not be allowed to pull any mobs of our own.<br>
<br>
needless to say, with 3 people and a cocky imature attitude, this guild ruined my raid and all efforts to organize one. they began sending tells to my raid members telling them to leave, and some did.<br>
<br>
IS this what it means to reach lvl 59 and 60? that you own any zone and can force others out simply because you want 1 specific mob?<br>
<br>
I dont even know why I posted this...<br>

We'll just use the term &quot;IC&quot; for the one on my unnamed server. Those on the server know EXACTLY who I am talking about.<br>
<br>
Numerous times, people are setting up for an encounter. They see we have the force to do it, but do they do the considerate thing and say &quot;hey, take a shot, but if you fail we get ours&quot; , nope, they'll train you over and then rush the thing you were trying to kill.<br>
<br>
This attitude holds true for quite a few of the members of &quot;IC&quot;, but of course there are also a lot of good folks in it as well. <br>
<br>
This is what you call a guild with a bad reputation, and they are generally hated by the server for one reason or another.<br>
<br>
Is this how all the &quot;uber&quot; guilds are? Nope. Generally most are nice folks and will work with you. &quot;The alliance&quot; on my server as many know it is par with the guild previously mentioned, but yet they have a different attitude and I get along with just about all of them.<br>
<br>
Point is, you had a bad experience, high level encounters are a race to get to and kill before another guild can, however, this doesn't mean all high level guilds are going to be like this. <br>
<br>
What would I have done? I would have said we have the force and you haven't been camping it, get out of fear and make way for our raid.  I don't consider 3 people running past your raid force into the portal and FDing inside camped. You should have stepped on them as you walked through to the safe tree=P<br>
<br>
What are they going to do, train you with their monks? That's one thing I've found that GMs will indeed respond to, and you wouldn't be in the wrong if you went in disregarding the jerks and got trained by them. GM would kick them the heck out<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 425<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/29/02 12:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=597.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: my &quot;ALMOST&quot; epic piece</span><hr size=1> You got bullied friend.  Its unfortunate, but its going to happen.  When boss mobs like cazic are on the line, there isn't much some guilds won't do for the phat lewtz.<br>
<br>
You need to decide how you are going to approach the situation in the future, because it WILL happen again, if you lead raids against targets of any significance.<br>
<br>
As far as Verant is concerned, its whoever is there first with the forces to take the mob.  Although you can't really claim an entire zone.  If you had been inside fear before the other guild though, they would have had a tougher case to make.  Sitting outside the zone doesn't get you jack.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry this happened to you, because I've been there.  And it left a very bitter taste in my mouth.  All I can suggest is you learn from this and come up with ways to approach it in the future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uanielact.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AnielaCT</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 671<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/29/02 1:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=597.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.fortunecity.com/burnkelethin/picz/banners/blueface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: my &quot;ALMOST&quot; epic piece</span><hr size=1> On my server we have usually managed to make a deal if we are doing Fear and CT is up.

<br>
don't get pushed around. if a guild know they can @#%$ on you once and get away with it they will do it again.<br>
<br>
oh yeah, if you did go in and they tried to screw you over with trains and stuff, just /petition. sending a /petition in might be lame sometimes, but it no less lame than calling &quot;camp&quot; with 3 FD'd people.<br>
<br>
the higher up your guild gets the more of this you will see. there's nothing wrong with two guilds/alliances &quot;racing&quot;, it's just one of those things that happens.<br>
<br>
chalk it down to experience, unless your server has some sort of rotation this is the way it is. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22361 target="shemm">Shemm Tankdamob

<br>
Then about a month ago while in my same guild we were back in Hate,When we arrived no golems or any named were up..but we started clearing anyhow and as we went through golems started to pop...We killed Dread first..then during the process of Pulling Terror....All of the sudden CT pops and starts shouting and everything in the zone we had just killed respawned ...we spent the next half hour fighting non stop against the south wall clearing all the pops that had aggroed us..when all was relaxed we now had 3 fresh golems to kill for drops plus the broken golem...<br>
<br>
Someone had sent a tell to one of the higher on the food chain guilds that CT was up and we refused to leave the plane despite the other guild telling us they were coming for CT..We held our ground and we had the planes to ourselves...<br>
<br>
Guilds will take things away from Calendar guilds,Lesser guilds because the people in those guilds are out for fun,and are not the type to start training fights or shouting at each other so they just walk away and the uber guild wins...<br>
<br>
Stick up for yourself and stand your ground..if it means you all wipe and the other guild gets it anyhow..so what at least you tried instead of just walking away and letting them have it... <p>myrmidon \MUR-muh-don; -dun\, noun:

for those that are interested, i made a post on that guilds webpage.

obviously the mentality of these people is quite childish. and fearfully, there are more guilds like them on my server.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/umcdulldull.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mcdulldull</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/30/02 7:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=597.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Happy ending is possible~</span><hr size=1> I think you have done the RIGHT thing of posting on that guild’s forum instead of the server’s one.

<br>
A similar situation happened to my guild. The scene was Plane of Growth and the boss was Tunare. I must say that my guild leader/raid leader had done a good talk with the Uber_guild_01’s guild leader. There was obviously some politic involved and I wouldn’t know.  Eventually, we worked together and cleared the whole zone and killed Tunare. But of coz, they can finish the job without my guilds’ presence. We got to loot every armor dropped there except Tunare’s loots which was very reasonable (my guild wasn’t able to kill even Lord Bob at the time). It was a happy ending. <br>
<br>
As previous post said, thing like this happens all the time, interpersonal, communication and diplomatic skills could make the difference.<br>

Fear is a beotch to break and can lead to alot of heartache.  And it sounds like it woudl have your first break attempt.<br>

Look over the rudeness, go in, watch it being done, get some free loots, and they probably would have let you looted the ball as well.<br>

You should have proceeded with your break before they zoned in with LFG tags.<br>
<br>
Fear breaks are &quot;always&quot; nasty unless someone has tried, failed, and left before you.  While you were doing your wall break they would have had mobs to contend with.  Had they decided to zone in with their little LFG tags there would have been to much commotion going on not to train both themselves and you.<br>
<br>
In the end the &quot;uber&quot; guild would have beaten off all of the adds that were brought onto the raid, but your corpses would be &quot;IN&quot; the zone.  At that point it becomes a (/petition just got trained in Fear by uberGuild_01 please assist)<br>
<br>
GM's and Guides don't favor bigger guilds stompping on smaller guilds.  Especially in a zone that's over 3 years old.  You would have had a nasty little CR to deal with, but in the end you would have had your shot at Fear.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you have to resort to nasty tactics to beat nasty tactics, and sometimes you have to be the underdog that you are in order to win.  Next time stand up for yourself and tell your members to zone in, and take haste.  The guild coming in after you did. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193604" target=new><font size=5 face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color=darkred>Keelz Neversleep</font></a><BR><font size=2 face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><I>

If the Plane is fully spawned or close to full, the whole raid party can get wiped in less than 2 minutes if break in is not properly done. Then guess what? Instead of petitoning to GM saying you get trained, a more realistic solution would be Uber_guild_01 proceed into the plane, break in, CR and Res your raid party.<br>

Perhaps they just wanted to Kill CT and the other stuff was in the way.  I think if you might have talked to them, that they might have let you guys go in and clear the reg stuff and loot it, while they took out CT.  <br>
<br>
I was lucky enough to be in a pretty strong guild.  We went into Fear as if it was a zone, and just started clearing everything.  I think raiding chardok's king/queen was a lot more difficult than fear.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, we did it mostly for fun.  I dont think anyone was going in for fat loots or anything, and I think that other guild youre talking about doesnt care about the reg mobs.  It sounds like they wanted to beat the higher tier groups to CT and your raid was in the way.<br>
<br>
Next time talk to them and see whats up.  Perhaps they will help your raid clear the plane in exchange for CT rights.  Ive noticed that raiding the planes with higher lvl guilds is a lot of fun and so easy.  It might have made your ball easier to get, just my 2 cps.<br>
<br>
I do think that 3 FD monks is kinda stupid and sneaky.  Guess they were trying to play on the technicality of it.  Bring ure own monk next time = ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 450<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/7/02 9:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=597.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Happy ending is possible~</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I think if you might have talked to them, that they might have let you guys go in and clear the reg stuff and loot it, while they took out CT. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I'm very dubious about this.  When an uber guild is trying for CT their goal is to clear the complete zone as quickly as possible.  If I remember correctly CT will summon any mobs in the zone to his assistance so clearing it is vital (and if my memory is playing tricks on me, forgive the error).  Which means that an uber guild will pull as much as they can and AE kill it as quickly as they can, they don't want this to be an all day raid.  If done correctly CT will only be a few hours, from full zone spawn to completely empty.<br>
<br>
They might have been able to get the uber guild to let them pick up the trash drops, but the uber guild wouldn't have wanted them in the way while they cleared.<br>

They bluffed, you went for it.<br>
<br>
I agree that you should have just tagged along with there raid and got the ball if it dropped (I doubt any warrior in an uber guild would want epic, since it blows).   There is a decent chance that it wouldn't have dropped.  In this case, by going along you would have learned some valuable lessons about how to do Fear.<br>
<br>
As far as the suggestion that you make a deal with them, I doubt that would work.   1) competiton is pretty tight an many servers.  If another &quot;uber&quot; guild found out that CT was up, they might just start heading into Fear and not care about the deal you worked out.  2) by the sounds of it, you guys would have probably taken forever to clear fear.   As a member of a semi-uber guild, I think we would just start clearing once 8-10 people showed up and just keep clearing as others show up.  By the time we get a full raid force logged on and into Fear, the zone will be mostly clear.  We would probably be able to clear the zone twice as fast as a newb guild.<br>

<br>
After the initial raid decided that the raid had been blown by the uber guild, I organized a rag-tag group of people to go up and work with them to get a chance at armor/epic drops.<br>
<br>
Draco trained on camp twice during the next 45 mins, possibly due to the actions of some of the first-timers. I was asked to take my people out of the plane, and I did so. I asked to be sent tells on any epic items, and over the course of the next hour, two golem balls and two shaman tears were given to the original raid.<br>
<br>
The guild feels bad about running over the raid that was forming. They apologized for it on their website, and even used it as ammunition for booting someone out of their guild that they needed a reason for.<br>
<br>
I play in a lot of different zones that inspire competition. It is always hard at the beginning to watch someone do that to your raid.<br>
<br>
What you need to do is allow it to teach you some important lessons: motivation, mobilization, negotiation and communication.<br>
<br>
If you walk away with that in mind, it might just be the most successful fear raid you ever went on.<br>
