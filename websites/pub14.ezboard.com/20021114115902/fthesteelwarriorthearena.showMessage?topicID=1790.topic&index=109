<br>
It is a very nice AA skill, and maybe it shows how weak some other class AA skills are, but by no means should it be nerf'd just so that Wizard class AA can suck as bad as ours, or any other class.<br>
<br>
Can only speak for my server ( TM ), but I see very little change with the introduction of MB.  Our local MB team has only got Sev 1 out of the last 5 or 6 kills ( don't know about the others, ) but if the MB team does not get them, they still won't be up that long.  Everything dies so quickly on our server, that most guilds will jump at the opportunity to kill anything.<br>
<br>
The only other 'issue' I see people griping about is Risk vs. Reward.  People have tried to explain that there is 'risk' for a MB team; you either agree or don't.<br>
<br>
Can't believe there is six pages of this crap -- lol. <p><HR><center><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=10301"><img src="http://www.mammothworks.com/eq/images/sig001.gif" border=0></A><BR>

The major difference between 6 wizards and 6 of any other class combination is this: 1, 2, 3...BAM Dragon dead, loot up. There is no combination of character classes that you can name that would take out Gore or any other MBable dragon almost instantaneously. The minimal risk for MB wizards comes from their being able to land enough damage on the Mob to kill it before it has a chance to react.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, Glatius2, you seem to only be upset about the fact that the mob is dying fast.  You say specifically that is the problem.  You don't seem to mind that the mob is dying at the hands of 6 people, but that it's dying in a small amount of time.  I don't see the logic behind this.  What's the difference?  My 56 warrior can annihilate crushbone at a faster and more consistant rate than my 52 wizard.  That doesn't mean a thing.  It's still 1 person trivializing content that is designed for less powerful or a larger number of people.<br>
<br>
I'm going to keep coming back to this thread because the discussion intrigues me, but if this is the only opposing argument, there's really no point to further discussion.  We'll just have to agree to disagree (cliche, I know, but a fitting one).<br>

<br>
Bleh, I'm probably re-explaining something that has already been explained a couple of dozen times and still isn't accepted.  Well one more try I suppose.<br>
<br>
Okay, once upon a time Vox and Naggy were the top of the food chain.  They were the mobs every guild targetted themselves for.  It was a significant event the first time a guild successfully took down either of these two.  It was an accomplishment worth bragging about.  It was a source of pride.<br>
<br>
Then they increased the level limit.  50 was no longer as high as you could go, 60 was the new limit.  And suddenly these two mobs became extremely trivial.  It wasn't the intention mind you, merely a side effect.  The intention was NEVER that Vox and Naggy would go down like bags of wet cement.<br>
<br>
So Verant addressed it.  Those two dragons have been preserved within the game as stepping stones for guilds.  Its still a significant milestone in the life of a guild the first time they take down either of these two dragons.  As far as I am concerned, the integrity of the game is somewhat perserved.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to today.  And now we have additional mobs which are also stepping stones for guilds.  They also represent major milestones for the epic quests of several classes.  These encounters should still have some credibility left to them.  They should still be a source of pride for people.  Instead the mobs are getting used like a cheap drunk whore on a Saturday night.<br>
<br>
Instead of people feeling a sense of pride because their guild was finally able to help them get that much treasured epic piece, they're trying to scrape up the plat to buy it off one of the MB team.  Instead of a challange for up and coming guilds to rally for, they're capped shortly after spawn by roving bands of MB wizards.  Maybe not all of them and maybe not on all servers, but its happening.<br>
<br>
You can argue that a 1st or 2nd tier guild could easily do the same thing with almost as small a force, or even as small a force, but its not really happening.   The 1st and 2nd tier guilds are too busy rushing to take out the high end mobs.  They really can't waste the time being distracted by something like Gore when real mobs are up and available.   Not so Team MB.  Some of these guys live for nothing but this.  Others just see a chance for a quick plat, kind of hard to condemn them for it I suppose.  They're just doing what the game allows them to do.  But they can do it faster and with fewer risks than any other combination of characters.  Which is why they do it.  If it was hard, they would go off and do something else.<br>
<br>
And honestly, if some level 40 character showed up in Crushbone every time Crush spawned and killed him within moments, don't you think the players for whom Crush was actually a challenge might have a small reason for complaint?  Perma camping something that is so far beneath you just because you want the loot is kind of self centered, wouldn't you agree?  Other people deserve a shot at the content as well.<br>

Last time I checked, at least half, if not more of Team MB ( at least on my server, ) are in 1st and 2nd tier guilds.  In addition, 90% of the RoK dragon non-MB kills I've seen are by guilds who consider these dragons trivial.  I just don't see a difference for mid-lvl guilds -- they can race Team MB or bored upper level guilds who can't get to the upper end content of EQ quick enough.<br>
<br>
Either way, the dragons are trivial, and they tend to drop pretty damn quickly. <p><HR><center><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=10301"><img src="http://www.mammothworks.com/eq/images/sig001.gif" border=0></A><BR>
