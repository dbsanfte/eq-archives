<br>
Tank is 39, as is Cleric, and both are decently equipped.  I was just curious/seeking some advice on doing this, if I should even bother.  This is not my first character, but is my highest.  Ive heard this can be a headache, but I feel like it would benefit me greatly till I can at least get some AA into run speed.  Thank you in advance for the advice<br>

Basically you just have to kill everything in sight and hope you get to him before someone else does.  There are several rumors saying that you kill certain mobs to get him to spawn, none of which has been 100% proved(to my knowledge).  Best bet is to slaughter everything.  Not having a tracker is going to hurt you some as well.  I don't really know for sure, but since Run3 is now available I'm sure he is not sought after like he use to be.  But ya never know.  At any rate good luck to you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->[65 Overlord]<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=132589">Veteran Kilzalot Drachonis</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
I have got the AC to spawn 5 times, but only got the kill once (using my 51 wizzy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Dont know if these are set in stone facts, but they have always been a factor when i have seen the AC<br>
<br>
1. he spawns at night (game time) usually between midnight and 8am.<br>
2. every time i have seen him spawn i killed a &quot;sand mummy&quot; during the day (game time)<br>
3. killing EVERYTHING in the zone doesnt seem any more effective than killing just the undead.<br>
<br>
hope that helps, I have run 3 but jboots are still a great righ click item for raids when you are fighting mobs that dispell. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=42722"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mikil Vaevictus</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> ,Elder of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.shadowsight.com/banesidhe/">Bane sidhe</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->56 Leezard Warrior<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Lo, there do I see my father.<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> Lo, there do I see my mother and my sisters and my brothers.<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> Lo, there do I see the line of my people, back to the beginning.<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> Lo, they do call to me...they bid me take my place among them, in the halls of Vallhalla where the brave may live forever.</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=richardkent>richardkent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/19/02 8:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  yup, there is a way to spawn the AC in SRo</span><hr size=1> Well,<br>
<br>
Wanted to add you can spawn the AC, however it is not guaranteed that he will spawn.  It has been a long time, but here's the rough idea (first, let me dispell some myths)<br>
<br>
MYTHS<br>
1)  Kill everything in the desert.  This is totally wrong and unnecessary.  I have gotten 3 pairs of boots in the past and not done this.  As an example, if you keep killing all the spiders in the area you can get the giant spider (forget its name, look it on on allakhazam's).  Killing all the undead does not make any special mob spawn.<br>
<br>
FACTS<br>
1)  There is a tower that is semi-buried in SRo.  It is on the end furthest from the Dark Elf camp.  It is in a kind of trench to the side.  The Dark Elf camp and the two Orc camps are in a kind of ravine in a straight line, the tower is off to the left as you face the dark elf camp from the furthest end from them.<br>
<br>
2)  Inside this tower a single undead spawn appears.  It is always undead.  There is always one.  It can wander or be killed by other mobs (those damn madmen).  Also, people who think the 'kill' everything myth works sometimes spank him.<br>
<br>
3)  I'm hazy, but I think this undead spawns at 7am game time.  You need to kill the undead mob at 8am, not sooner and I think it must be before 9am.  I always killed it at 8am on the dot.  I might be confused here and he needs to be killed before 8am.  Just watch when he spawns, should be easy enough to figure out.<br>
<br>
4)  Ok, so now you've killed him at the proper time.  Now, sit on your hands for a while.  Come 5pm game time you should see another undead spawn in the tower.  You kill him immediately.<br>
<br>
5)  Sometime after midnight but before 7am (when the undead trigger spawns again) you MIGHT see the AC spawn.  However, if everything was done right, you will either see the AC or another sand giant (I think hussein is the alternate spawn, forget now) after midnight.<br>
<br>
6)  You'll know you have it right because the AC normally spawns in a few spots.  He likes to spawn (for me) at the end furthest from the dark elves, right near the orcs but towards the left corner (as you face the orcs).  He has also spawned an arrows shot away (350 distance arrow that is) closer to the dark elves, but on the same slope.  Those are the only two spots I've seen him spawn, but I'm sure there are at least one or two more.<br>
<br>
7)  How did I come upon this tidbit of knowledge?  A fellow guildmate that I helped a lot (help! I've died in howling stones, key is not soul bound, need someone to clear train at zone as well as a rez in 30 minutes before rez timer goes).  He said his girlfriend's ex was a GM on such and such server.  She was still friends with the GM and he became a friend and asked about the game.  At least, that is what he told me.<br>
<br>
So, that's all there is to do.  No need to kill the whole area.  I sometimes spank everything just out of sheer boredom.  However, I've not killed anything enough times to know they're not part of the trigger.  Like I've said, I've done this and gotten 3 pairs of jboots and I've also helped some guildies who got 2 pair in one night.<br>
<br>
did they get their 2 pairs in 90 minutes?  (eq day is 45 minutes)  No.  It took them 5 or 6 hours of doing this to get it to work.<br>
<br>
How could I possibly know this works?  Well, I've been there and triggered the AC in 45 minutes, twice.  <br>
<br>
Last disclaimer, I did this about 1 to 2 years ago.  I doubt it has changed, but you never know.  Personally, I'd say study the tower and the undead spawn.  Take note of when it spawns and so forth.<br>
<br>
Ok, last but not least.  If they undead trigger is killed at the wrong time, he won't spawn at the correct times and your cycle is screwed.  I've had newbies walk right up in front of me and kill the mob, even though I asked them not to (by newbs, I mean 55+ folks).  Oh yeah, it sucks, especially knowing the AC won't spawn and even more time will be wasted.  The undead trigger spawning at the wrong time is your 'hint' that you've done it wrong and that it will take another cycle before you even get a chance to do it right and spawn the AC.<br>
<br>
Now, if someone could tell me how to get the OOT Ac to spawn, I'd give them my first born.  I spent 200 hours there to get 1 pair of boots, including a few 40 hour weekends (you do the math on that).<br>
