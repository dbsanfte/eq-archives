<br>
Thank you Glatius.  Nice to think that maybe some people are seeing my points, and understanding them.<br>
<br>
The highest-end game is not something I can speak to, being as I'm only level 52.  But I understand from high-level paladins whom I respect that warriors do indeed have problems in xp groups at level 60 where everyone has high-end gear.<br>
<br>
I don't know what to do to fix that.  Improvements to taunt have been suggested, but I wouldn't be comfortable with them going in prior to level 60 if mitigation were put in to make warriors better than all other tanks.  Since a paladin at level 60 with a few AA points and some high end gear probably could be a group healer, I think warriors should DEFINITELY have their taunt abilities improved at that point, since paladins are able to fill TWO roles in xp groups at that stage of the game.<br>
<br>
Does any of that make sense?  I have a terrible head cold, and might not be making myself clear...<br>

<br>
Yeah, but the warrior has much better hp, better magic resists, and better avoidance skills.  Rogues suck at low levels.<br>
<br>
I've got a level 32 warrior that I group with a druid and a shaman regularly.  He's fun.  Wearing mostly crafted with some Crusty armor, wielding a wurmslayer and jagged longsword, he does fine.  As long as the group runs when I tell them to, we rarely have a wipeout.  And prior to 49 (when they can self-haste) paladins don't have very good dps output, so the warrior DEFINITELY kills things faster.<br>

What I think that you don't quite understand is that what you are referring to is part of the penality for being a class that is part fighter and part caster. You're not supposed to have the full functions of both the figher and the caster. If you get the dammed hybrid thinking out of your head, you can perhaps see it this way -<br>
<br>
If I walk into Sebilis and decide I am going to Disco, those frogloks are not exactly good but they are not exactly evil either. Considering this, I *SHOULD* prefer a warrior to a paladin because the warrior is an all purpose equally good against everything guy. While the paladin could do the job, I don't need any of his special abilities and the warrior is the better tank overall.<br>
<br>
However if I decide I want to go to the Crypt instead, which is full of nasty undead things, I should prefer a paladin over a warrior as the paladin should be a specialist in this area.<br>
<br>
When a paladin is viewed in this manner, one can say - yea, they should be complete badasses against undead things and just ok against other stuff, while the warrior is equal good against everything.<br>

<br>
Also please keep in mind that while a Shaman or a Druid can pretty much do all the 'utility' stuff that a Paladin can, a Warrior can't.<br>
<br>
If a Paladin takes our slot, we have no secondary attractiveness that will gain us a spot.  They won't invite us for our snare, our root, our stun, our secondary heals, our anything, because it doesn't exist.  If a Warrior is tanking for a group there is still room for a Shadow Knight or Paladin if a Druid, Shamen, etc aren't available.<br>
<br>
You usually want a snarer, right?  Shadow Knight, Wizard, Druid, Necro, or Ranger.<br>
<br>
You usually need a priest, right?  Shamen, Druid, Cleric, or in a pinch a Paladin (primarily at high levels).<br>
<br>
You might need an evacer, right?  Wizard or Druid.<br>
<br>
You need damage dealers, right?  Monk, Rogue, Wizard, are the best choices.  Then Mage, Necro, Druid, Warrior, Beastlord, Paladin, Shadow Knight.  Neither the Knights nor the Warrior are really going to shine in the damage dealing department.  Second choices at best.<br>
<br>
You need a tank, right?  Warrior, Monk, Paladin, Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
See we don't really have any additional functionality that will remotely make us attractive for a group if we aren't tanking.  If the tank spot is taken, there are MUCH better choices for damage dealers.  Neither the Knight nor the Warrior are going to be anyone's first choice.  If no other damage dealers are available they might take a Warrior over a Knight, but it rarely comes down to that, does it?<br>
<br>
If we can't at least shine in the tank spot, you basically are saying that where ever a Paladin or Shadow Knight is tanking, a Warrior isn't needed.  It also means the where ever a Warrior is tanking a Paladin or Shadow Knight MAY be needed if some other class isn't filling the utility spot.<br>

So your argument holds no water pre 15 now let me destroy it pre 50.  Take your class and go sit by the bizaar oh wai you'll tell me you're too poor to afford SoL and only have the basic game.

It may take 1 hour but if done nicely less and if done rudely sometimes even faster cause we just don't want to here the crap.  So now go and kill a few things and save up 200 plats and save up 30 dollors real money and buy SoL and go up there and slowly equip yourself for 200pp.  Then after a total of 22 hours you have level 15 and sufficent equipment to go grind exp 5x faster then us old timers ever did.  Then at the 40hour limit go back nn buy a few more items.   Inside of 2 months of steady play you will be wearing equipment and useing weapons most post 50's would have died for back in RoK.<br>

<br>
Warriors have stated concerns about holding aggro better in groups. If their aggro ability is increased as much as most have asked for the game will brake. <br>
<br>
What is a resenable fix I'd support a class type aa ability that gave you a 40% chance to get an insint double taunt when you press the taunt button. This is the most I'd give. Why? because taunt is barely an issue and PoP will release better taunting weapons.<br>
<br>
Odd thing is I've seen warriors roll on higher damageing lesser aggroing weapons when there is a ranger or rogue who could use it. That's akin to a paladin asking for a hate generateing weapon over any warriors present.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Aragir, since you seem to be the only reasonable paladin posting here (if I missed anyone else, my apologies, but the BS 7 and Chavr have been shoveling might have blinded me temporarily), let me address you with 7's post that you referred to.  <br>
<br>
Now, please be so kind as to tell me how you think warriors getting a better taunt will break the game and yet paladins with far superior taunting abilities should be able to tank nearly as well as warriors.<br>
<br>
If you're in doubt about hybrids' tanking abilities in the end game, take a gander at Triton's news page and see how they successfully killed Aten Ha Ro with SKs and Paladins tanking.<br>
<br>
And to address 7's last and still idiotic point, why would warriors roll on high dmg weapons?  High dmg weapons are one of the most reliable source of taunt.  Before SoL was introduced, I had no problem holding aggro with Jaelen's Katana in primary hand, a high dmg weapon (for the time) that had a 0 aggro proc of 80pts lifetap against any of the end game mobs (AoW, Tunare, Vulak, etc).  <br>
<br>
3 mobs in game currently drop EB proc weapons.  I think I can safely assume that none of the warriors 7 supposedly witnessed rolling on high dmg weapons belong to guilds that can kill these mobs (nor does 7 play the end game) since no uber guilds I know roll on drops.  So why shouldn't these warriors be allowed to help themselves taunt better?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sorm>Sorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/02 7:20:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warrior issues</span><hr size=1> Well put Glatius.

So that is the answer to every classes problem then isn't it..just go to a highly populated zone and Beg?<br>

When speaking of class balance you are to point out abilitys that verant gives you in order to accomplish your class task.I highly doubt that Verants Fine tuning of warriors pre 50 invloves them begging for weapons/items/armor <br>

I cannot beleive that you think begging for an item is a solution to a classes abilty.<br>

Says who? verant? nope, players have always thought that. Prerok monk could tank anything just fine. We lost this in rok cause every class got skill increase and armor increase(we got some to an extent by leveling). Also with the def discp warriors became the &quot;must&quot; have tank.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SoV: Everyone got new high ac items, monk had to get these cause we up till then got our ac by leveling, but since sov gave no new levels. But still with mobs being designed to have warriors use disc , the tank of choice is warrior. <br>
<br>
SoL: see sov<br>

<br>
No Xzander, they don't if you understand basic math, because you are thinking in terms of static numbers.<br>
Example.<br>
If a Monk had 2k hp and warrior had 3k, the monk has two thirds the hp of the warrior.<br>
After all the 125 hp items, say a warrior had 6k and a monk had 5k, now the monk has around 85% the hp of the warrior.  It gets even smaller with knights because of PE.<br>
<br>
Now, that 20% gain in monk hp is offset by what? A 50% gain in damage output since it now does 70% more damage than a warrior.<br>
<br>
Hmm...when you look at it this way, you see that it isn't as balanced as you would think.<br>

much higher ya say?<br>

&quot;Nah, the problem is as stated before, with all/all items the percentages get smaller and less significant over time.&quot;<br>
well first, dont think verant ment for wars to keep the exact same percentage of hps though out. Thing is every since you could put hp item on you lost the percentage. You best bet is to push for the stam cap (255)  to be removed/worked around and or the 127 cap on items. This would help every class, not just one or a small group and you would have every class backing you(even though warriors would get the most out of it).<br>
<br>
Another thought is ok get your % advantage in hps does that mean monks get their % advantage in skills back?Lets face it, thats where verant messed up. We use to gain our ac from skills and levels, since both have been capped for so long verant had to make us dependant on items just like every other class.<br>
 <br>
<br>
&quot;There wasn't a monk around in pre-Kunark who could mitigate damage as well as a warrior (i.e. hit the same EFFECTIVE AC). &quot;<br>
monk could easily hit 900+ ac before warriors, we had higher skill caps in everything. We really were the best damage dealers and best tanks(in a sense).

Huh?  So let me see if I understand your point.  Because skills don't go up any further, it makes perfect sense to you that Monks should get items that so completely close the gap in HP (AC always was narrow between Warriors and Monks) that given their better skill set and significantly better damage output than Warriors, that they virtually make Warriors completely undesired except for those occassions where you need defensive/evasive?<br>
<br>

<br>
completely close the gap on monk hp and warrior? still a good 1500hps+ in the gap there gap there. My sugestion is you fight for either them to work around the stam cap or expand it this away u get the most out of it(since wars have a higher nat stam and gain more per stam point) but would benefit anyone.<br>
<br>
&quot;significantly better damage output than Warriors, that they virtually make Warriors completely undesired except for those occassions where you need defensive/evasive?&quot;<br>
<br>
we have better damage output but I wouldnt say its this totaly huge amount that warriors have none.<br>
Those occassions when you need def/eva is like the whole end game, you know where all these items that have &quot;completely&quot; closed the gap on hps come from. Warriors are very much needed on raids, exping is another story but then this was about loseing ground at the high end game no exping, hell I seen a wizard tank in seb.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any other scraps you want to throw my way while you're at it?&quot;<br>
Scraps? reading a lot of these post some make it sound like warriors can't get into high end guild and that all these guilds have monks/palies/sks tanking and only one or no warriors.

Try not to be disingenuous when you try to state your case.  Monks freely admit that block works about 3 times more often than parry, even with the same skill cap.  <br>
