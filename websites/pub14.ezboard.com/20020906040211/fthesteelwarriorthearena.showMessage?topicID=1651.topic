First time playing, first toon rolled is my troll warrior.<br><br>I'm looking for some advise/ideas for my warrior.  I just hit level 19 and am wondering about a couple things......<br><br><br>I mainly use slash weapons.  Dual wield with 2 1hs.  I've gotten 1hs up into the 90's.  How soon should I be working on 1hb and 1hp?  2hs 2hb?  I've switched to 1hb in my offhand, but since it's so low a skill, I do very little damage which lowers my total damage output.<br><br>What type of weapons should I be using?  There seems to be so many weapons out there, I really don't know where to begin.  I'm not necessarily looking for the most uber, high damage weapon, I just want to be in line with the damage I should be doing.<br><br>Armor -  I don't even know where to begin.  Should I be at a certain range in total ac at lvl 19, say 200?  300?  400?<br><br><br>Aggro - I've read the posts about aggro and understand it's my job to get it, and groups job to let me keep it.  When we get multiples, should I be taunting all of them, or just stick to one at a time?  When an add breaks off and attacks a healer, I usually break and try and taunt it off, but I'm afraid of breaking a mez.  Any advise on these situations?<br><br>Thanks in advance<br>Thoon<br>lvl 19 troll warrior <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uroehm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roehm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will KICK YOUR @$$</span><br>  Posts: 455<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 8:16:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: General questions</span><hr size=1> Well...<br><br>Use whatever weapons are at hand. As a warrior, you will need all the weapons skills you can get. At this point in your EQ life levels come quickly but as they slow down you'll have the opportunity to work on them and bring them into line with your level. For example, I didn't use 1hb until I was in my 40's (and I am still working on 2hb =P hehe).<br><br>Wear whatever armor is at hand and always try to increase your AC. My progression (granted, I did this along time ago and there are other options these days) was tattered to leather to banded to bronze to crafted as the opportunity/cash premitted. After this you'll mix in pieces of Planar, Kunark, Velious Quest, etc. as the opportunity arises. Don't get overly concerned about your AC at this point, just keep working on it and it will come along.<br><br>Yes getting aggro is your job, but at your level you will suck at it and more importantly others will suck at letting you get aggro. Chain nuking casters and non-evading backstabbers will steal aggro from you constantly (and when the casters start getting hit they will run around like chickens with their heads cut off, just let them die it will hopefully teach them a valuable lesson to not move the mob away from the tank.) For now just taunt and bash (or kick) to get your skills up and to get practice on when to bash/kick and when to taunt.<br><br>As far as mezzed mobs, if you are the main tank pick you target and smack away. If you're a support tank, make an assist key in your hot keys that has /assist and target the main tank. When you use it you'll target his mob. Also type in /assist off at some point, this will assist without turning on autoattack.<br><br>Hope that helps. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9966>Roehm Ironwolf </a><BR>Warlord of the Tribunal<BR><a href=http://www.bladesofwrath.com>Blades of Wrath</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uronewindstream.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rone Windstream</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 8:44:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://evantine.homestead.com/files/Ronephoto.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: General questions</span><hr size=1> Ok this is from my experience,<br><br>Train in every possible weapon type. At your level you won't need them all but later you'll need all of them and nows the best time to work them all up. As you get higher in level the harder it is to start training because your that much more behind and will suck increasingly the lower your skill is. My advice is to stick with your slashers when you need to and use skills you want to work on when your in a group and not needed to do alot of damage (when your not MT). The longer you wait the harder this gets, when you get bigger your groups will need you doing damage or holding aggro.<br><br>Armor? Get whatever you can but yes stick with ac/hp gear. I made the mistake of going for all out str being the foolish newbie I was <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . I pretty much followed the same armor upgrades Roehm said. Your ac at this point is really of little importance so just get what your can and don't worry about what you should have at your level. Theres plenty of time for that later on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>As for aggro, thats your job so get used to it and keep taunt maxed out. Right now as Roehm said your groups will be sloppy and you'll find it hard doing your job. Not to mention your taunt skill blows :P And it's not much better now grr..I wouldn't worry to much about it right now, just keep your group alive. The more your progress the more your groups will rely on you.<br><br>Well it depends if you have a chanter or not. If you do, communicate with him/her and try not to piss them off to much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (in my experience chanters are often the bitchiest or edgiest people lol maybe its the stress of their job or something). With an enchanter use your best judgment to keep the group alive but let the chanter do his/her job. This usually means staying on one mob and telling your group to /assist you at all times. If you don't have a chanter then by all means yes taunt everything and keep mobs off your casters and healers at all costs. Remember, your job is to keep your group alive. <br><br>-58 Myrmidon ~Vallon Zek~ (PvP) <p><center><img src="http://evantine.homestead.com/files/Rone_sig_2_copy.jpg "><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uzytalius71.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zytalius71</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 9:26:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: General questions</span><hr size=1> HOTKEYS HOTKEYS HOTKEYS.<br><br>Make hot keys.  During a battle you dont have the time sometimes to be jumping around in the fight and typing away important info at the same time.  Some Absolute ones should be, Incoming, Assist Me, Taunt, Kick (Bash), Range (If using for pullin), I even have a targeting hot key, so people know from a large pull that has been mez'd what mob I SOON will be attacking.  <br><br>As with the enchanters, My experience with them is that they always die first in groups.  They will love you if you protect them and keep them from taken damage.  A simple way to prevent them from taken damage that many Non Warriors DO NOT DO, is wait for the mez to be broken by the warrior.  Once in your group, and if you have an enchanter, be firm in saying that no one attacks a mez'd pull until you taunt them for agro first. And until you Hot Key the Message to ATTACK, or assist me.  Sometimes, in the higher levels, it takes 2 taunts to break the pulls agro from the enchanter, so taunt twice, hit the ASSIST ME NOW, and then hit the attack button.  Simple.  You enchanter will be thankful.<br><br>   <p><a href="http://www..freeservers.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://zytalius.freeservers.com/images/image10.gif" border="0"></a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ujoaquinarmillaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Joaquin Armillaria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 12:18:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: General questions</span><hr size=1> Heh, well yes, I will agree Enchanters tend to be a bit edgy/bitchy...  Most will never complain w/ a fine tuned group.  I personally could care less if a mez is broken without a taunt, assuming it is by the MA and it isn't prematurely broken by someone not assisting.  The reason we get edgy/bitchy is because of people who don't assist when there is more than 1 mob in camp and people are breaking mezzes.  I can almost guarantee - those mobs will attack either: the enchanter, the cleric, the shaman and not the person who broke the mez.  That is where we run into problems, if the mob attacks the enchanter, this disrupts the enchanter's timing for mez refreshes, or getting slows/debuffs off, worst case - a significant number of interrupts/resists can get you a dead enchanter, although I prefer it is me getting attacked.  If the cleric is attacked, you can either lose the cleric or the MA if an needed CH is missed.  If the shaman is attacked, well chances are the mob is slowed and the shaman can handle it.<br><br>Anyway - not to hijack this thread - Zytalius makes some good points.  If you want your enchanter to be happy and not bitchy, just talk to them, ask them what they want you to do.  If they don't have a clue - get another enchanter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=237505">DagynDragynborne</a>, 52nd Champion of Fantasy<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=98023">Aliciana Auraquin</a>,58th Illusionist of Fantasy</p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uogbasherfiggbukker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>OgbasherFiggbukker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 12:44:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ogbasher.com/kitty.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: General questions</span><hr size=1> Pick the toughest mob, and stick with it.
