It won't affect my chances at a group either because I don't group anymore.  I've given up on trying to find them.  All I do is raid now.  That doesn't mean I'm satisfied with the way warriors are balanced with other classes though. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=472195">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

However, I'm not sure if this could be avoided by stuns but I definitely can assume that if it is avoidable by stuns then the stuns would have to land 100% of the time or the pally would most certainly be dead. I mean if a warrior can't withstand the damage spikes and he has the same AC plus better mitigation and more HP's than a knight class, then how could the knight possibly withstand the same onslaught ?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Im not so sure about this my friend.  A SK/PLD can easily offset this by snaring/stunning the incoming mobs and the mobs in PoV sure arent uber high resistant.<br>
<br>
When I was 1st getting used to PoV, especially DG camp, Id snare pull just about all the mobs in there (only the spiders are common as to not being snareable).  By the time the mob was at the camp, in general, malo/tash was on them and slow was either about to hit or had already hit it.  Furthermore, I group often with a 65 paladin and when I got an add (no chanter mind you), he woud simply stun the add once, mabe twice, get agro and malo/slow was soon to follow.  It was really easy.<br>
<br>
Like I said, at the end of the day, it doesnt make too much difference to me if they gave warriors more agro ability or not (just not equal, or even substantially equal, to knights), but Im not sure the situation described above is that much of an advantage for a warrior.<br>
<br>
I would like to add, however, your experience with the 63 chanter seem very interesting.  Im not sure what was going on, but I can assure you that even a knight class can have some pong on mobs if the chanter just tashes immediately.  Ive done it to myself even.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Make no mistake about it--I dont care what you do, a careless caster can take agro from any tank very fast if they are trying / being lame.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;p.s. Later on in the night I was helping 4 more guildies get flagged in trials. There was another group there that is very similar to the groups I have been in all 10 times I have beaten trials between level 60 and 64. That group failed all night long try after try. My group entered trials 3 times, and succeeded 3 times. The MT for the other group was a 62 Troll SK. He kept dying during the fight with the executioner and the rogue just could not tank him  <br>
<br>
The only time I ever died to the executioner was on a lucky string of hits he got back when I was level 60.<br>
<br>
Coincidence? Or could it be that the warrior really is a better overall tank and these extreme situations just bring out that point?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, but this really doesnt prove anything.  Furthermore, making a sweeping comment such as warriors are really better overall tanks is VERY bold indeed and many people will argue against the comment fiercely.<br>

<br>
A knight can hold aggro without any weapon at all.  They get aggro through spells.  Reducing their DPS would have virtually zero effect on their aggro control. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=472195">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

My point about that was that I was instantly hitting taunt when I saw the message that tash had landed.  Now of course every time he tashed (barring the one time I got a double attack for 334 each hit + a stun and another high damage round) he was pulling agro.  I was simply able to pull it right back about 9 out of 10 tries.  If taunt happened to fail I would /shield him unless I was in defensive.  Then I would just have to taunt more and the cleric would have to heal as needed.<br>
<br>
I was simply impressed by how often taunt was working - that was basically what the story about the 63 chanter was for.<br>
<br>
As for the stuns and snares working well at the DG camp - I'm glad you posted.  As I said that was my first time fighting there so I didn't know if stuns and snares would be enuogh.  Obviously they are.  Guess I'll have to try a different camp to find something as clear cut of an example of warrior tanking efficiency as the camp at the forest giants.<br>

<br>
Yes.  A SK/PLD could still get agro, regardless of DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;When we use the Windblade we are attacking very slowly which means less attention from the mob based on how many times you attack it per second&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, I dont buy this for a second.  For every person that you find that will claim that speed generates the most agro, I'll get someone to say DPS gets the most agro.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guys--please quit with the *warriors arent desirable* comment.  Come on now--its BS and you know it.  Warriors are totally desirable  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I have to agree with this comment, as my experience has been very similar.  Warriors as MTs can easily pong the mobs, but they are often able to get it back fairly quickly, both slowed and unslowed mobs alike<br>

<br>
Often can be a pretty relative term.  I find that maybe 80-90% of the time I'm able to taunt it back fairly quickly, in one or two taunts.  The other 10-20% of the time it takes longer, if I'm able to get it back at all before the slower dies.<br>
<br>
Now, if people think that Warriors bring enough to the table to offset the slower dying about 10% of the time, that would be fine I guess.  People have made it pretty clear they don't like it.  All you have to do is follow the posts of Clerics, Shaman, Enchanters on their own boards to see that they don't like it much at all.  In fact, the ones who seem to argue the most that Warriors do bring plenty to the table are Knights and a few Warriors.  Kind of funny that. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

Interesting.  Are the people you described below those same people who dont like it??<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You compensated for the difference between your SK and your Warrior friend and went merrily along. Some people can't do that. They're aggro understanding deficient. Some would say stupid. I would say they just don't understand aggro. Some people can compensate, but don't want to be bothered. They know they can keep the SK or Paladin standing with only minor additional healing effort, in most cases, and would much rather have the addtional aggro control. &quot;<br>

It's probably not 90% but it definitely works reliable enough to use it.  Just because the mob is aggroed on the Enchanter or the Shaman doesn't mean he is ready to attack again.  Even unslowed, if you're watching the mob closely, you can usually stick a taunt between the time mob aggros/summons the slower and the time mob is ready to attack again.  There's plenty of time it goes like this<br>
<br>
Shaman begins to cast a spell<br>
XXX yawns<br>
Mob says, &quot;You will not evade me Shaman!&quot;<br>
You taunt your target to ignore others and attack you<br>
<br>
Result: a happy bear that's sitting smack inside an enemy but not getting attacked.<br>
<br>
BTW, our kick stuns up to level 65 (maybe not 65, but definitely most blues), so if you're really paranoid, save your kick for the initial slow.  It lands about 50% of the time and it's not like that 35 damage kick every 6 seconds means anything for DPS.  It's not exactly a lifesaver but an extra second or two is sometimes all you need.  <br>
<br>
As for Enchanters, it's their own fault if they die because they've been given all kinds of tools to deal with aggro.  They get Boggle to deal with aggro.  They have Arcane Rune.  And if they actually care about aggro and mana efficiency, they have their dirt cheap root spells that dumps aggro better than just about anything in the game.  I have no sympathy for a caster dying because he couldn't be bothered to root a mob.  <br>
<br>
Are people so desperate to win favors from the mighty Enchanters that they'll cater to whatever whims they have?  I have had groups that actually killed slower by adding an Enchanter (cleric can't be nuking full time, and we lose a ton of DS damage due to slow).  I guess by your logic, it's my fault I can't hold aggro to a chain slowing Enchanter even though our group killed faster before the Enchanter was added? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=468916">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karthunk>Karthunk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 251<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/18/03 3:03:32 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: one more thing...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes, of course.

Then use AE taunt? It usually only takes 1 slow to slow an exp mob. How long does it take to kill a normal exp mob for you? 2 mins? So, lets do some math then.. 1 out of 10 times your taunt will not work. That means 1 out of 10 slows the slower will have to tank some. So, we have 9 fights where things run smoothly - 18 mins. What's that refresh on AE taunt again? ~15mins. What does this mean? That AE taunt will be up when you need it. If AE taunt isn't up then /shield the slower. It's all very, very simple. <br>
<br>
As far as DPS, I pump out an average of around 150-170DPS in groups now. Warriors are hardly a low DPS class with the right AAs and right weapons.<br>

What is your point?  Some people adapt and are okay with it.  Some people are unable to adapt.  Some people are able to adapt but find it easier not to.  Can you really deny that with a Knight more times than not the healer will focus solely on healing the Knight while with a Warrior that is far from assured?   Can you not see how people prefer not to have two or more targets to focus on for healing when given the choice in PoP where damage is so huge?  Can you not see how many people would prefer dealing with healing the Knight slightly more often, very slightly more often in many cases, than the Warrior when they can forgo having to heal the slower pretty much altogether?<br>
<br>
I've seen slowers die before the Cleric even had time to stand up and begin casting.  Granted, it doesn't happen that often, but it does happen.  You can't see how people might consider that more aggravation then they're willing to deal with on an ongoing basis?<br>

<br>
If those odds turned out to be correct I'd be happy but that's not been my experience.  Most groups I'm in the slower grabs aggro at least long enough to get hit a couple of times on almost every pull.  This is assuming they actually wait until I've engaged the mob to cast slow.  The only pulls where this doesn't occur are the ones where I get lucky and get an EB proc in the first few swings.  If they cast slow while the mob is still incoming then they get hit even more often because I have to rely on trying to taunt a moving target that I haven't hit yet.  <br>
<br>
If taunt works on the first attempt then that's acceptable because the heal the cleric tosses on the slower negates whatever tanking advantage I would have had over a knight so we're approximately equal in that situation.  If I have to taunt twice then the knight is more mana efficient than I am.  If taunt fails twice then I will AE taunt and I'll get aggro as long as the slower doesn't have low HP aggro.  Generally in this circumstance both the slower and the healer need a heal.  If taunt fails 3 or 4 times in a row someone is usually dead.<br>
<br>
So in my experience the absolute best case scenario for me is that every pull the slower takes 1 round of hits and then I get aggro for the rest of the fight.  This assumes that I have 100% success rate on taunt which never happens.  In that situation I tank about the same as a knight.  If I fail any taunts then a knight would have made a superior tank by roughly 1 CH for every failed taunt.<br>
<br>
If we're fighting stuff that requires defensive then I acknowledge warriors being the superior tank. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=472195">Khumak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

&quot;Whats your point?&quot;<br>
<br>
Simple.  You stated that people dont like to die, which somehow was loosely converted to being when taunt failed on its first try, estimated to be 10% of the time I guess.<br>
<br>
You also stated, in an earlier post, which I cut-n-paste for you, that some people cant compensate for the difference in agro control between an SK and a WAR.  I believe your words describing these people were, *aggro deficient*, and you claimed that others may call these people *stupid*.  So, my question to you is simple:<br>
<br>
Are the people who are mad at dying 10% of the time the same people that are *agro deficient*?  <br>
<br>
If so, some may say there anger is unjustified and should be pointed at themselves, not the game.<br>
<br>
Based on your comments, not mine, it seems to me that you want EQ to change to handle the *agro deficient* people, not because something is *broken*.  Maybe that is the right answer.  I dont know.  But one thing I can assure you of that it is a defenite balancing act and NOT an easy decision.  Too much in one direction, you are probably going to kill the knight classes.  I guess, this being a warrior board, that would probably not bother everybody though...<br>

You see----its comments like these that make boards like these an awful place to visit.  Someone like me, who doesnt frequent these boards much at all, comes over to just try and add some input, and they are disrespected.  Well, since few people like that, the substantially all of the thread becomes a *my dick is bigger then yours* conversation and all the good information gets buried between meaningless bullshit and insults.<br>

Oh, just to answer your question, yes, I understand the SIMPLE logic of what you are saying.<br>

No, you merely implied that anyone who didn't see things your way or didn't agree with you must be doing something wrong and was therefore a stupid bot.  I don't see things your way and don't agree with you, ergo you're implying I'm a stupid bot, regardless of whether or not you used my name.  Simple application of logic.

Then if you understand it, there is really no need to question it.  And regardless of whether or not people are to blame for their inability to control aggro, the fact of the matter is with a Knight it's not a problem.  With a Warrior it is.  People like things easy, not harder.  Warrior = harder.  Knight = easier.  The situation is unbalanced as a result.<br>

I think most slowers can take a couple licks just fine without the cleric ever needing to spend mana. Sustained damage? No. But they can take a few licks just fine.<br>

Dude--I could care less.  I was coming here to try and add a few thoughts from someone who is a reasonably good SK, but probably only an average shaman (bot).  Your 1st reply was a delight, the subsequent ones, however, have become more and more pompous and jerk-like.  I get the feeling you probably arent liked much on this board.  Who cares though, rite?<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, I dont see a *huge* problem.  Like I said in my original post, something must be wrong, cuz Im not a great shaman/chanter, and Im smoking regardless of if Im tanking or if its a warrior tanking.  Others, however, are having a problem and that is what Im trying to understand.  You, on the other hand, still havent answered my question--who is it thats mad?  The same people that you called *agro ignorant*?  You know damn good and well that if its those people, you have a problem in your argument.  If its not the people who are *agro ignorant*, then I want to know what this *new* group of people's problem is.<br>
<br>
And I find your comment that I need to be clear and respectfully highly offensive.  Before your rude comment, please point to me a SINGLE instance where I was rude or dis-respectful.  And as to me not being clear, I guess Im at a loss.  It seems very simple to me what Im typing, but I will try harder to type down to your level<br>

I have been main tanking in the OC/IC camps in PoV for the last 3 levels now and I have yet to have any party member deaths at either camp even one time.  I have also consistently been running out of spawns to pull before the repop cycle begins.<br>
<br>
Now that I have a strategy for fighting at EW/WW/DG I will also be fighting there without any deaths in my groups.<br>
<br>
I don't know what more there is that can be said - I'm a warrior with average gear and I'm level 64 with 2 AA's.  If others are having problems, try communicating with your group maybe ?  I don't know.  I mean I usually ask the cleric to please do a heal over time at the start of a tough fight if the situation warrants it.  That's about it though - I've never had to tell a player that was intelligent enough to make it through trials how to play their class efficiently when grouped with my (supposedly) gimp exp grinding class.<br>
<br>
If I can exp in the best exp spots I am able to get to without any offensive or defensive AA's and without a weapon that proc's any sort of agro, then am I to assume that I am in a tiny minority?  Once again, I just don't see the problem.  I mean maybe if they cut the spawn time in PoV by 1/3 or 1/2 maybe then I will see the exp grinding efficiency but until then I just don't see it in my own personal experiences.<br>

<br>
1. The claims of taunt &quot;working&quot; 80-90% of the time is simply put, and as gingerly as I can, an absolute lie, and without ANY evidence whatsoever.    You want to credit your grouping with primarily highly skilled players (In one person's claim), and with anecdotal potshots as to what constitutes a successful taunt on the other.   It's nonsense, and totally and utterly without any evidence.<br>
<br>
2. Any &quot;evidence&quot; is going to be hard pressed to find, aside from running &quot;taunt tests&quot; in Sanctus Seru, although I'm fairly certain that people who desire to feel good about their character selection will dismiss any REAL evidence as &quot;old world, and it works differently&quot;, which is AGAIN wihout merit.   There are NO &quot;speaking&quot; mobs in PoP which will allow one to run an unbiased test, so we're dealing with people who like to exaggerate their results, and credit their keeping of aggro with their class rather than with people who play and have a motivation to group with a warrior (in one case, mobs that are impossible for a non-warrior to tank, the other married to the cleric with whom you regularly group).  <br>
<br>
3. I call BS on the fact that one person in the Elemental planes tanking mobs for experience that can one-round or two-round a non warrior has any real clue about Tier 2-3 competitiveness for groups.   <br>
<br>
4. It's easy to simply pass off factual, realistic information based on in-game realities (i.e. for pickup groups, which don't happen while tanking 1200 quadders in the elemental planes), as &quot;board talk&quot;, when EVERY class board has at least one thread started by members of that class which states that &quot;Paladins and SK's are better tanks due to aggro control and a minimal tanking difference.   <br>
<br>
5. Asking for real balance, in a balanced way which allows warriors to generate a little bit of aggro in the early stages of a fight is NOT by any stretch of the imagination a bad thing, and if done properly, can resolve MANY issues simultaneously while not infringing too much on those who make aggro control part of their appeal.<br>
