We were MADE to be tank classes, although with fewer hp than a warrior and no taunt button. You see, even with the leather only restriction our ac bonus made up most of the difference between warriors and monks ac wise. Our higher avoidance is offset by our fewer hp, (in theory, although a good enough cheal chain erases that) In exp groups you have a choice when it comes to tanks, either warriors and knights who will have more hit points making for more efficient cheals and more reliable taunt, or a monk who has less hp and no insta taunt but makes the mobs die faster and has an avoidance to more or less make up for the hp difference. <br>
As for the get out of death free card we have, well, sks and necros get it too and even wth that ability I still have my fair share of deaths, after all, fd can fail. I think you will also find that on high end raids, monks have one of the highest fatality rates since they do the pulling of those nasty mobs. Dont get me wrong, fd is an amazing tool, but it hardly keeps us from ever dying. <br>
I honestly dont see what the problem is, monks have always BEEN tanks, and unless Verant nerfs us to high heaven we will always be tanks. Actually, strike that, I DO know what the problem is. Up until NToV and high end Luclin, monks always had the substantially lower hp than warriors and now that we can top over 6k buffed those top 3% of monks are making the other tanks nervous. Go ahead, BE afraid of those very few monks capable of reaching that mark. Just remember, the other 97% of all monks in the game will never be that good and although we can tank in xp groups just fine, we wont be taking mt spots in raids. <br>

<br>
 No, not SHOULD be tanks, ARE tanks. We were MADE to be tank classes&quot;<br>
<br>
Monk has gone such a drastic change that it's not even funny. You went from crappy ac and crappy hp and NO weapons to ... great ac (Velious), great hp items (velious + luclin), and obscene weapons (kunark + velious + luclin). The REASON you had such crappy items/ac/hps because your skill levels were OBSCENELY high (230-240 caps for weapons and defense skills compared to a warriors crappy 200.) and you had alot of token abilities (fd, mend.)<br>
<br>
Kunark attempted to balance it by raising alot of warrior skills into the 250 range, and to compensate monks for that, you got absurd ratio weapons (yeah, the class that was supposed to be have the least need for equipment gets the best equipment god what retards). Warriors still had a strong AC advantage, and a noticeable HP advantage, as well as triple attack (to give them a dps edge.)<br>
<br>
Velious raised everyones AC and everyone's damage output. However, high end kunark warriors were already capped on AC. Monks gained triple attack, began to close the hp gap with high end velious hp items, closed in on the softcap for AC, got their own superior damage table. However, since mod rod 2 wasn't around yet, neither was alot of FT, defensive was crucial. Yes, defensive is a CRUTCH to people with 7k+ hp now, but lemme tell you, you wouldn't have gotten to 7k+hp without defensive in the first place.<br>
<br>
Luclin really screwed it all up by putting alot of AA that should have been warrior only, into archetype abilities which alot of people share. On top of that, warriors got NO class AA that made them better at what the are supposed to do. In addition, lots more EASY to get hp items, ND3... the warrior 400 hp bonus meant alot when everyone only had like 1000-3000hp... it means jack sh!t when everyone has 2000-6000hp. Even MORE ludicrous easy to get AC items... the warrior advantages just don't mean much anymore.<br>

Yes they had less hp as well but even with the crappy gear we got we still had an ac that put us rather close to warriors in general. True, after kunark came out we got some rather nice weapons but we were one of the classes that didnt even get a set of kc level armor! What do you conider absurd ratio? My weapon is a drop from kc, a 9/18 ratio is hardly absurd, its a ratio of 2! Sure, when luclin came out all those crazy weapons came out but you see, not ALL of them are monk only, and MST of them are from uber mobs that the majority of the monk community wont se for another year! Also, there are an awful lot of weapons for all melee classes with very nice ratios.<br>
As for aa, you arent the only class to get screwed out of class aa. Monks got rapid feign. An ability that may help when soloing but on a raid if I am pulling and fd fails,  im dead no matter how much faster fd recycles. As for the other abilities, why SHOULDNT all tank classes get improvemets to their tanking ability? After all, isnt that what aa was for? Improvements? No, the REAL problem here is Verant stupidity in making all the nicest stuff all/all. The classes were balanced more or less fine untill all that high end crap started dropping. Until you started clearing NToV to start equipping alts warriors had the hp advantage and usually had the higher ac as well. Then knights caught up. Already a possibility because of their ability to lock down agro, the sudden increase in hp on them made them that much closer to valid raid mt choices. Monks followed after because we still have a significant hp difference but with mod rod 2 and all the ft gear and other casters mana dumping to healers and all the rest the hp difference is becoming less important. Its not even a matter of CLASS balance, its GEAR balance that is screwed up. Honestly, about the only things that will make a difference balance wise would be to remove that stupid soft cap on mitigation and remove the all/all tag from some of that gear.<br>

Absurd monk weapons? Tranquil staff, IFS, SoS. Those are easily obtainable by people who will actively camp it. You guys arguably got the best 'tank' epic too, but I'll refrain from turning this into an epic thread. <br>

Not all luclin weapons are monk only? You mean you have to share it with the gimp beastlord class? Oh god, that makes it ALL even.<br>

As for AA, warriors of any of the classes, should have gotten class specific AA that improved tank ability. Since we didn't, and everyone got some form in archetype, that's a major problem.

<br>
You had some intriguing points up until this statement. Nowhere in Verant's vision was it for monks to be tanks. Never. I'm sorry if people at Monkly Business are brainwashing you into thinking this, but monks pre-and post Kunark have always been straight up melee with high DPS. Certainly it's always been a fact that they conceiveably could be a tank if there were no other sks/war/pals in the group (note group, not raid), but that was the exception because you formed groups knowing that the monk would be the puller/dps person, and that there would be a real tank to absorb damage. <br>
<br>
Verant did not give you guys leather based armor with the assumption that you were meant to be tanks. Your defensive abilities are there to keep you surviving so that you can do a lot of damage. You were never meant to tank.<br>
<br>
If you WERE meant to tank, why on earth would anyone make a warrior? Seriousy. Monks do twice the damage of warriors, have the ability to mend, feign death, you name it. What do warriors ge--Oh just being able to tank. <p><p><center>

&quot;Monks are great TANKS and great pullers, so if there is another puller in the party take turns to keep things interesting.&quot; We were ALWAYS tanks, just never the best tanks. As for weapons, ill refer to the tstaff. Do you have any idea how freaking rare it is to see one of those drop in kc? It is so rare that it STILL costs 10k or more to buy one and thats a drop from a spot where people go to get exp! You could camp there for a month straight and see one single staff drop in the whole time. As for the other weapons, yeah, they are great, but what do you expect? We are damage dealers and our bare fists just dont cut it anymore. (pre epic) <br>
As for our armor, they AVE us leather because we were designed with a weight limit of 14, in the beggning) if we were to equip just a bp from a warrior they ould probably put us over the limit lol. If we WERENT meant to tank then why did they give us that rather nice ac bonus? After all, we OBVIOUSLY arent supposed to tank so what does it matter if we only have 900ac at 60? Oh wait, we are supposed to be tanks.<br>
I am really sorry some of you are so set in your misconceptions about my class that you cant acpt the evidence that is staring at you in the face. The fact of the matter is, monks=tanks. THATS why this new gear is causing so much trouble. Its allowing a class that SHOULD be lesser tanks than warriors,(but still tanks mind you) become very nearly as good or better than warriors. It is not a class imbalance, it is a GEAR imbalance.<br>

<br>
You made the claim that Monks had comparable AC to warriors pre-kunark... I say that's baloney, and not in line with reality whatsoever.  Then i challenged you by saying &quot;What armor did you have pre-kunark that compared to Indicolite&quot;....<br>
<br>
I dont' give a rat's tail what naked AC monks have at 60, which is a Kunark era level,  I wanna know what armor you had that was even remotely close to Indo which put you at level 50 to similar AC as a warrior.  Remember, level 50 was the limit back then.   <br>
<br>
I am arguing that you were NEVER supposed to be a &quot;tank&quot; in the definition of tank being the person in a group who's job was to have and keep aggro while the damage dealers killed it.  Were you supposed to be a tank, you'd have gotten this skill called &quot;taunt&quot;.  I'd argue that rangers were supposed to be better tanks than monks, much less warriors, Paladins, and Shadowknights.    They all have a means of gaining aggro where you don't.  Due to this, you were NEVER supposed to have your role as a &quot;tank&quot;.   What some pathetic writer in a blurb in a guide which devotes more time to dieties than class balance says is irrelevant.  <br>
<br>
Your premise that you were somehow with lower HP, lower AC, and no ability to GAIN aggro only to lose it, you were designed to be a &quot;tank&quot; is fatally flawed and has no real in-game basis.   You are, and were ALWAYS supposed to be a damage dealer with good avoidance who gets HURT when you get hit.  The gear imbalance is true, but it causes a game imbalance.   The fact that you wield crap from Kunark has no relevance on the fact that insane ratio weapons for monks drop and have since Kunark, as a matter of fact, the Rune Fighter's Staff has better Dmg/Dly than a warrior's epic.   This is NOTHING compared to certain VP weapons of 2 expansions ago, or of Khatars of today.  You are a damage class, and should be hurt MASSIVELY when you get hit, that's the concept behind a monk and has always been.  <br>
<br>
Just because you stamp your feet, make silly claims like that you had comparable AC pre-kunark, which was totally untrue, and quote a user guide doesn't make your claim right.   Monks aren't, weren't, and should never be &quot;tanks&quot;.<br>

I may not have been playing since Beta but I have seen the ac charts of prekunark armor. I wish it hadnt scrolled off the mb site already so I could point you to it but it showed how with the same top end type gear monks and warriors could have very close ac to each other. <br>
Your advantage is and has always been your hp and the taunt button. While I have zero problem holding agro off of casters I also have zero way to say, agro a mezzed mob off of a chanter when the spell breaks. The only other time I cant tank in an exp group is if for some reason we are killing stuff that hits for 100 or more a shot on average because I just dont have that many hp to do that effectively. All of my gear is stuff that a level 52 monk can accuire on his own in an exp group and in fact some of it is still sub par because I havent gotten around to upgrading it and yet somehow, I am still a very effective group tank. Are monks raid tanks? No, we are group tanks. Back to agro again for a sec. Have you ever grouped with a monk that WANTS agro? It is very hard to keep it from him. I have actually stolen agro from a 60 warrior in seb who was pulling for the group a time or two. Granted it ony happened a few times but I wasnt even trying to and some times feigning for a few seconds wasnt even enough to get the mob off me. I think thats fairly decent proof that monks produce more than enough agro to hold a mobs attention when we want to, Oh, and I was 51 at the time in seb with a trance stick kd combo so my weapons we actually fairly crappy for my level.<br>
If I remember the chart right I know we obviously didnt have a SET of armor like indo, it was all a hogepodge of gear gathered from all over and pieced together and sure, if YOU tried to wear it your ac would have sucked but when it was combied with our bonus it was actually more than enough to be an exp group tank.<br>
So in closing, id like to say that we are walking, talking, fighting piles of taunt in exp groups where you dont have to out agro a cheal chain and a shaman slowing on the inc call so we do more than enough damage to out taunt the rest of the group. Remember, im not claiming to be a raid mt, im telling you that like it or not, since the days of Kunark I personally have been an exp group tank so since its now going to be 3 expansions since then it might be time for you to get used to the fact. I dont need to post data and charts listing all the reasons monks are exp goup tanks, its obvious to anyone who looks, everywhere you go for exp you can have a monk tanking there for his group.<br>

<br>
Before answering the question, don't forget to take into account the stackability of warriors, our aggro difficulties (Reminder: taunt is used to get aggro, not to GENERATE aggro, we have nothing but proc and DPS for aggro generation), and our group dependence.<br>
<br>
But I won't try to stop your arguing, Dobbanz, because I think the more you post on this thread, the more you prove our point. <p><img src="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/mcduck/images/signature.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/18/02 8:44:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1200.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ac</span><hr size=1> I dont need to post data and charts listing all the reasons monks are exp goup tanks, its obvious to anyone who looks, everywhere you go for exp you can have a monk tanking there for his group<br>

That's correct, and my argument is that this SHOULD NOT be correct, and that the game was never designed with this in mind.   You were an offensive melee class who should have ALWAYS had a desire to NOT tank, which was one of the purposes for Feign Death, which is really the opposite of Taunt.<br>
<br>
Feign Death wasn't designed for &quot;pulling&quot;, that was a player invented thing, and it's pissed off VI since the strat was made.<br>
<br>
Again, I'm going to hold your feet to the fire and say... You have done little to nothing to &quot;prove&quot; your point that monks had equivalent AC pre-Kunark to warriors.   Fact is, they didn't.   The wieght limit was placed there to prevent that from occurring. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udobbanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dobbanz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 255<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/18/02 8:44:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1200.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ac</span><hr size=1> Well, when you consider the fact that monks ARENT within 500 hp of warriors, (thats knights) that kind of invalidates your post. Of course if you had read most of my early posts you would know that I have always been a suppoter of buffing up warriors. I AGREE that warriors should be the best raid mt bar none. MY only problem is with the occaisional warrior who wants to claim that I am not a tank. BTW, im here with an update. Although Indo armor finally put warriors at a higher ac in pre kunark days a top of the line monk could reach 950 ac. MORE than enough to be an exp group tank. Like I said, it isnt through some set of armor that I can just say,&quot;Shiverback puts us at 950ac&quot; its a mix of random bits and peices from all over the old world that allows us to reach that point. <br>
My belief has ALWAYS been that warriors should be better tanks than the other tank classes. Not enough to be really unbalancing but enough so that if it came down to a choice between a 60 warrior or pally,sk,monk you would want the warrior first. So im not too sure what point it is that you think I am inadvertantly proving of yours, all I am trying to do is establish the fact that even in pre kunark days, monks made good exp group tanks.<br>

What I object to is that they are in many cases a 'better' tank than an equally equiped Warrior.  And I know many Monks believe they are better tanks, just from reading Monkly Business.  And I find it impossible to refute them.  Most of the time, for most of the groups, they are in fact the 'better' tank.  Which sucks ass big time and just proves how unbalanced they are.  Because in additition to their 'tanking' ability they get several VERY useful abilities.<br>
<br>
Yes the taunt key is the major difference between a Warrior and a Monk.  If gaining agro is the concern though, who wouldn't use one of the Knights for better agro control since they do it so much better?<br>
<br>
So in the end you can have one of three tanks.<br>
<br>
Monks - Moderate agro control issues, high damage absorbtion, deals a lot of damage and has some other utility.<br>
<br>
Warriors - Modest agro control issues, high damage absorbtion, deals out moderate amounts of damage, and NO other utility.<br>
<br>
Knights - No agro control issues,  moderate to high damage absorbition, deals out modest amounts of damage, and significant utility.<br>
<br>
Monks are superior to Warriors in damage dealing and about equal on damage absorbtion.  Their damage dealing actually gives them solid agro control, but they have issues gaining agro initially.<br>
<br>
Knights have superior agro control and have little to no problem gaining agro initially.  They don't absorb damage quite as well as Warriors and their damage is equal to or slightly less than Warriors, depending on weapons used.  They do have very high utility though.<br>
<br>
So where exactly do Warriors shine?  Yes, I know, defensive makes us 'the' raid tank.  But outside of that, for normal groups?  Inferior agro control to Knights.  Inferior agro control to Monks, really, beyond initial gaining of agro.  About equal damage absorbtion to Monks.  Slightly superior damage absorbtion to Knights.  Grosely inferior damage dealing to Monks.  About equal damage dealing to Knights (sometimes less, sometimes more, many variables involved).  And completely inferior utility.<br>
<br>
Seems like many more minuses than pluses.  And in those few areas we do have pluses, they aren't major pluses.<br>
