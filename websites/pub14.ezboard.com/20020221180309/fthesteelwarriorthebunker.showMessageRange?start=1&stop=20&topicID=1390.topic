Need your thoughts.</span><hr size=1> I don't think Grimm was referrring to your post...<br><br>But to the habit of people to say &quot;yeah, yeah, XXX is in the game&quot; without having some hard numbers to back it up.... <br><br>I see two big problems with the concept of parsing out the &quot;effect&quot; of the AC cap...<br><br>First of all, it's almost impossible to control all the factors *but* AC... even the best cleric buff only adds what? 40 AC  Sure, all factors considered, one can buff their AC by over 100 points, without changing gear, but the buffs used to get that 100 points of AC almost all effect other stats, so you can't really pin down whether it's the AC or the other stats... and when you start changing out gear or levels *shiver* to test the effect of AC, you're making an even bigger difference.<br><br>Secondly, there are two entirely different types of encounters in the game.  There are your standard group encounters, and your uber mob encounters.  While I'm sure AC is a nice thing to have for group encounters, the overall effect isn't that great when you are only fighting mobs taht hit for 150-200... a 20% decrease in damage would be huge against a powerful mob, but against your standard mobs, it's not all that impressive. (And I can't really accurately say that it gives you that much, I havn't tested, and it's hard to tell without hard numbers and calculations, see Grimm above)  While AC probably *does* effect the uber mobs, the CH cycles must prepare themselves for the worst case scenarios... because of this, it is dangerous to rely too heavily on AC.. what if the tank gets unlucky and ends up taking multiple heavy hits in a row?  The clerics have to prepare for that sort of thing and heal a bit early anyway, so even taking less damage may not do anything but make the CHs safer....<br><br>Yes, AC has effects, are those effects _significant_?  What _is_ significant?  I don't know, I'm not really sure.  If someone has some hard numbers to post (against such and such a mob, with XXXX AC, similar/same agi/skill caps, took %% less damage than with YYYY AC) it would be interesting food for thought.<br><br>But, as Grimm said... if you can't give us numbers, just saying 'there's a difference, trust me' doesn't really help... 'test it yourself' is probably the best advice, but only because the actual answers are so fickle.<br><br>/shrug, just my thoughts.  I'm fairly unorthodox in my thoughts, but I remember the days when black pearls were worth 200pp ea because they made such good dex/agi gear... and now no one woudl be caught dead wearing black pearl jewelry, since it gives no hp/ac.  The game hasn't changed, but our superstitions have.  Anyone remember the anti-camp rumours? <p><IMG SRC="http://users.starpower.net/dmoser/images/Kaldayr.jpg" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=200></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugrimmlokk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimmlokk</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://grimmlokk.homestead.com/files/icon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 282<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/6/01 2:31:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1390.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AC cap.

You posted no numbers whatsoever, not even a number for the supposed cap, but you're all convinced.  Tanking Vulak and Vyemm has nothing to do with it.  The main N.ToV guild on our server usually has at least 12 clerics, that's why they were in the north wing first.  That would do wonders in being able to keep the tank alive easily.  This debate is about hard numbers and you fail to support your arguments with them at every opportunity. <br><br>Fortunately, with these new skills I will be running some tests myself.

I have never disagreed with Gorlab, but the constant &quot;test it yourself&quot; line and the lack of any empirical data from him and his cronies wastes all of our time whenever this debate comes up.  Rest assured, I will post numbers for whatever I find.<br><br>P.S.  I need a parser that works with the recent changes.  I have EQ Parse but the &quot;You have been healed&quot; messages screw up the calculations and count towards things they shouldn't. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45589">Aeryl Firebrand</a>, Warlord<br><a href="http://interealms.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=4080">Aeril Droigheann</a>, 59 Preserver, Semi-Retired<br><a href="http://interealms.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=11522">Aerul Cuinnsear</a>, 48 Rogue, Semi-Retired<br><a href="http://berglad.stormloader.com/">Undaunted</a>, Xegony<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugrimmlokk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimmlokk</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://grimmlokk.homestead.com/files/icon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/8/01 12:49:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1390.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AC cap.

I read kreugens post as well and there is a whole lot of things he did not account for that render his tests invalid.  That's why you have to test yourself and you cannot believe other peoples test results.  How do you know that Kreugan or I or anyone else did or did not account for various factors?<br><br>Level 60 warrior, 255 agi, buffs were kept 100% consistant throughout the duration of the tests.  Tested vs Yelinak, hes rooted so you can just walk up to him and he can beat on you while clerics chain CH you without danger of summoning if you don't attack.  We tested with 1250, 1350, and 1450 ac values for tests of over 10 minutes of data at each value.  AC was varried only by changing armor, buffs and agi were kept constant.  Yelinak hit and missed me the same for all 3 values (within 1.5%) ie avoidance did not change which is what I expect as I was attempting to keep avoidance constant.  The curve of damage (not actually a curve as mobs hit for distinct numbers only but you know what I mean) was consistant with all 3 tests, that is to say not skewed either to the high or low end nor a bulge in the middle.  Average damage per ac value was the same within 2%.<br><br>Go test it yourself.  <br> <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7197 style="text-decoration: none">Gorlab</a> 60 Warlord<BR>Tenakha 53 Druid<BR>Officer of <a href=http://www.keepersofthefaith.org style="text-decoration: none">Keepers Of The Faith</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udenardtsf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DenardTSF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/01 9:49:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1390.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AC cap.

Need your thoughts.</span><hr size=1> In a very unscientific test I quickly parsed two Vind logs just now.  The first was from 11-15 when I would have had about 1300 AC with raid buffs.  The second was from today when I had 1408.  Average damage per hit in the first log was 343.  Average damage per hit in the second log was 346.  This would begin to speak that Gorlab is correct.  <br><br>Now, as I've said several times, I never questioned your conclusion.  I questioned the presentation of your conclusion.  The simple thing to do would have been to list AC values with corresponding times hit, and average damage per hit.  But no, you insisted on telling everyone to test it themselves which is totally beside the point.  <br><br>There may be a couple things that you didn't account for though.  IIRC, Kreugan's tests were with the mist panther in Wakening Lands.  Your test was on Yelinak and my semi-test was on Derakor.  Do you see the differences in the strengths of these NPCs?  Yelinak and Derakor are of such a high level that their ATK rating probably overshadows any PC's AC by enough that it renders it moot after a certain level, which you have purported to be 1250ish.  Now, with the mist panther being exactly level 60, it's safe to assume that it's ATK does not follow the same guidelines as a so-called &quot;uber mob.&quot;  Therefore, AC does not reach a point of diminishing returns againts &quot;non-uber mobs,&quot; at least as far as the highest value that Kreugan tested.  This is easily recognized simply by memory.  I've been down in Sebilis doing juggernauts or shrooms at level 60 with some cobalt, an EB BP and Indo legs and those things can beat you up pretty good.  However, if I were to go in there with my current maximum of 1434 AC I would wager that there would be a significant difference in the amount of damage per hit that I take.  <br><br>Also, Denard, may I add that you are indeed super l33t for a troll and obviously too good for us.

Unequip your weapons, get some buffers and a few clerics and just set up a heal rotation until clerics are oom.  They won't get summoned because you're not damaging him.  I can't stress this enough, make sure your buffs are 100% consistant or better yet go in unbuffed.  You have to keep your agility exactly the same, so if you take off a warlords bracer you have to make sure that 7agi doesnt affect the test, etc.  Its hard to juggle equipment sometimes to get a good test.

Need your thoughts.</span><hr size=1> I am just standing up for my man Gorlab.  He doesn't need it however since he is one of the few here who will actually give legit and sincere information, and I'm tired of seeing people on these boards blast his conclusions because he never produces &quot;Hard Evidence&quot; when all he says is, &quot;This is what I've found, go test it for yourself&quot;.<br><br>The sad thing is Gorlab is trying to do a REAL favor to you all but you won't pay attention.  I know we've all been burned by other theories and rumors (Agi dex anyone), and you are afraid that if you skip on AC you will get burned later and regret it.  At the high end game that is a legitimate concern.<br><br>But you know, all the people saying he has no hard evidence have no hard evidence for any of the claims that 1400 ac &gt; 1250 ac other than Furor and most other guilds warriors having that AC on their magelo profiles or what have you, except these tests which Kruegen did which many people KNOW to be invalid because of the way they set them up.<br><br>It seems to me if you ask a question, then state, &quot;It seems clear that you will tank better at 1400 ac than you will at 1250ac&quot; you have already reached your conclusion.  Why are you even asking for opinions?  I am glad to see someone else actually took him up on his advice and did some testing.  <br><br>I have to say I asked Gorlab the same questions alot of people ask, I was an AC junkie, but I know from my experience of tanking Yelinak, Tormax, and Vindi that I can tank and live on the same complete heal chain that our 1450 AC warrior uses with an AC of 1250, and those mobs have the same atk or higher than any mob in NToV.  If you've really tanked any of these mobs and you listen to what Gorlab says you have to at least suspect that he is right. It didn't take me as long to realize that if I can tank those mobs and live and keep the clerics comfortable, increasing my HPs would only make the whole endeavour more effecient for them.<br><br>I said it before if you want to hedge your bets on this go both AC and HPs.

Need your thoughts.</span><hr size=1> Denard, <br><br>My last post in reply to you because you are obviously making this a bigger issue than it is. Yes I did make this statement, &quot;It's obvious you are going to tank better with 1400ac than with 1250ac.&quot; And you assume that by me making that statement it means I do not believe in the ac cap. How wrong you are my friend. <br><br>All I'm saying is that from what the game has shown us in the past and the rule passed down from warrior to warrior that AC is king, in a 150-200ac gap there is bound to be some advantage to the higher AC. Now at some point, within that 150-200ac range or whatever range of AC you're using, the level in which the advantage begins to even out would be the range of the AC cap.<br><br>According to Gorlab's posts, which are very good by the way, he tested at 1250,1350, and 1450 and showed that there was a minimal change at those levels. This would lead us to believe that there is a cap. Thus Gorlab's post turns out to be the type of input I was hoping to get out this thread. I never asked to see the logs or to be presented a dissertation on the subject. I just wanted folks to tell me what they're experiences were in testing or just the feeling they had from fighting mobs at different AC ranges. My original statement was made based on the information presented to me in the past. And if I was wrong I wanted someone to try explaining to me why, which Gorlab seems to have done.<br><br>Gorlab's post is a perfect example of what I was hoping to get out of this discussion. Instead you chose to jump on your high horse and try talking down to me with you l33t warrior knowledge. Dont worry, you taught me a lot. Mainly how to be an ass.
