Do you always play one in RPGs or were there other reasons?<br>I generally play melee classes.  Usually its a Ranger of some sort.  I actually got EQ in April of 1999 and started a Ranger.  But after some hours of play it was so hard and there was no documentation that I gave it up until Kunark came out.  When I started up again, I choose a Warrior because it told me that it would be the easiest class to play.  (actually Human Warrior was the easiest combo)  Since my past experience was so difficult, I figured I'd go with that until I got the hang of the game.  Heh, 2 years later I'm still going with it ).  <br><br>Q: When did you feel like you had &quot;mastered&quot; the warrior class, given the abilities you had available at the time?<br>Never.  I'm always learning and always getting better. <br><br>Q: What is your favorite weapon (for fun reason or whatever) overall?<br>What I'm using now.  They are the best weapons I've ever had.  Anything that taunts well and kills fast.  In my earlier days, I felt uber when I landed a Mithril 2 Handed staff!  That was my favorite weapon for a long time.  <br><br>Q: Name one item you ALWAYS carry with you.<br>A Flower of Fiona Vie that someone gave me long ago.  I consider it good luck. <br><br><br>Q: Was the warrior class the first character you seriously played?<br>Yes.<br><br><br>Q: I'm sure you have had plenty of fun throughout, but what particular moment really stood out that made you cackle evilly at your own power?<br>Well, I don't cackle evilly as a Warrior.  But one great time was when I got to tank Velk.  (I was never MT)  Getting beat on, the CHs coming in, the guild saying &quot;Go Drac!&quot;, it was a RUSH!.  <br><br>Q: If you could add one spell type or ability to the Everquest warrior class, what would it be?(just ONE hehe)<br>Hmmm.  The only thing I can think of off hand is to make some AA ability or just make a level 60 ability that all non-Ogre warriors can no longer be stunned from the front. <br><br>Q: Do you solo regularly?<br>No.  Its ineffecient even when well equipped, and boring.<br><br><br>Q: If you could trade your warrior character for any other class of the same level and relatively equal gear, would you?<br>No, I'm quite happy with my Warrior and I've worked hard for what he has.  I'd never give him up.<br><br> If I had to choose though, I'd probably a rogue or a monk.  Really you don't need that many Warriors on a raid.  In terms of melee damage, you really need well equipped, Monks, Rogues, Ranger, and SKs and Pallys to a degree.  But if I was going to trade in my Warrior it would be for either the highest melee damage dealer, Rogue, or one of the best pullers and damage dealers, Monk.  <br><br> <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127089">Dracillion of Qeynos</a><BR>Warlord<BR>Bertox</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/udracillionofqeynos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DracillionofQeynos</A> at: 4/4/02 10:26:30 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwarlordbalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warlord Balker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.mindspring.com/~goodonion/_uimages/BalkinRed2.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/02 12:05:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=628.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Interview with a warrior (grabbed from graffe's)</span><hr size=1> Q: When was your warrior born?<br><br>&gt; June 2000<br><br>Q: Why did you choose the warrior class? Do you always play one in RPGs or were there other reasons?<br><br>&gt; I chose the warrior because I like the idea of being in the middle of everything going on.  I like the &quot;Warrior Attitude.&quot;  An example of the &quot;Warrior Attitude&quot; at the beginning of March a friend scheduled a Chardok Royals raid, he sent a + Chardok mage down to King's hallway and CoH'd everyone down.  At the end of March I scheduled a Chardok Royals raid, the same mage was available to me, but I chose to do it the right way, the warrior way, fight down and kill everything that crosses my path, that, in my opinion, is the &quot;Warrior Attitude&quot; that I love.<br><br>Q: When did you feel like you had &quot;mastered&quot; the warrior class, given the abilities you had available at the time?<br><br>&gt; Hrmmm, I think I started grasping the concept of what a warrior is early on, tho, I didn't master the class until I was in my 50's hunting in Sebilis.

But, being careless, I forgot to move them back down below my regular food, and I ate 'em.  I'm also always carrying my resist gear, my Katta EB necklace, my bow/Idol of the Fallen, my T-Boots, and a bunch of runes for my wizard friend who likes to collect 'em.<br><br>Q: Was the warrior class the first character you seriously played?<br><br>&gt; Yes and No.  My very first character was an Ogre Warrior.  I got him to level 23 and quit playing because 1) I forgot to distribute my starting stat points 2) Ogre warriors are a dime a dozen, I wanted something not so common.  My second character I leveled to 46, a Druid.  I got bored with him and made Balker.  Balker is the first character that I haven't really gotten tired of.  Balker is not only the first character to break thru the level 50 plane, but also my first character to reach level 60.  From that stand point, I'd say he's my first seriously played character.<br><br>Q: I'm sure you have had plenty of fun throughout, but what particular moment really stood out that made you cackle evilly at your own power?<br><br>&gt; The first time a tanked The Enraged Golem in Fear.  I was level 55 or 56, I held agro through out the entire fight, and I lived.  Not sure, tho, if this counts as my power, or the clerics that kept me alive's power?  Either way, it felt great!!  Also, I had another &quot;Greatness&quot; feeling just the other day, I tanked Ixiblat Fer, didn't lose agro once, except when the tasher tashed and the slower slowed, they both died quickly.  After that, I held agro the entire fight until Ixiblat turned to run away.<br><br>Q: If you could add one spell type or ability to the Everquest warrior class, what would it be?(just ONE hehe)<br><br>&gt;  I dunno, this is a tough one cuz I kind of like the way the warrior is.  Maybe make some of our disciplines last longer?<br><br>Q: Do you solo regularly?<br><br>&gt; No.  I like grouping with friends and guild members.

Do you always play one in RPGs or were there other reasons?<br><br>I chose a barbarian first because I like the look and the fact that they are tall, like I am.  Of the choices, I almost picked rogue, but decided on warrior because I was feeling brutish that day.<br><br>Q: When did you feel like you had &quot;mastered&quot; the warrior class, given the abilities you had available at the time?<br><br>I felt like I had a good handle on how to be a warrior in my teens.  However, the game definitely changed as I got higher and higher in level.  MTing on mobs like Itraer Vius, King Tormax, and NToV dragons is nothing like being the master of low level dungeons.<br><br>Q: What is your favorite weapon (for fun reason or whatever) overall?<br><br>I really liked my Narandi Lance... It was a lot of fun, but not as efficient as my current weapons.<br><br>Q: Name one item you ALWAYS carry with you.<br><br>My soul bound keys are the only items always on me since when I die all my stuff is on my corpse.

Maybe on the Plane of War in planes of power that guy who has a weapon and a shield will have a combo useable by a warrior.  Would be neat to have it so they equipped together only -- for example a 27 damage/15 delay sword with Enraging Blow to ensure that all important hate list position and a shield that is like 250 AC, 500 HP, +15 Sta/Str/Dex/Agi/all resists.  That would definitely be worthy to wear over traditional 1hers.<br><br>Q: Do you solo regularly?<br><br>Yes.  I have soloed every level from about 14-60.  Not always for a lot of experience, but at least one blue of experience per level was earned solo.  Sometimes 3 yellows...<br><br>Q: If you could trade your warrior character for any other class of the same level and relatively equal gear, would you?<br><br>Nope. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20383">Hulanta</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/02 9:17:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=628.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Interview with a warrior (grabbed from graffe's)</span><hr size=1> Q: When was your warrior born?<br><br>Sept 1 2001 (bah so he is young <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br><br>Q: Why did you choose the warrior class?

One time a few weeks ago I was fully raid buffed, and bored, and went to hang out in Velks. Well, I was invis, and fell into lower dogs somehow. On my way out, I was seen, so I hit defensive and ran to castle... Since I didn't want to train Upper Dogs, I ran out the back way, through velks throne room. I hopped off CE and zoned out, but it was too late. Fully 2/3rds of the mobs in the zone were roaming around the bottom floor slaughtering everyone. About 30 deaths and5 survivors... After dying with laughter, I zoned back in, invis again, and sat out to watch the CR. Apperantly, velks two guards, the Crystal Guardian's, loved that zone in. They were stuck behind it. So every 5 minutes for half the night, they came out and killed a few people at the zone in randomly. One person in particular that I didn't like died immediately after getting res, before even looting one item.
