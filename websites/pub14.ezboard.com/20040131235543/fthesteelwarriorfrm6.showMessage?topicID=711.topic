Bring casters if you can, they'll have an easier time doing damage than melee in the long run.  Long fight, but I don't believe he summons, so it's easy to take a break and kite him around a little.  Watch out if you get a ways out of aggro, he'll super-regen on you (which with his HP is a large pain).<br>
<br>
As for spawning him, that's up for debate...I've cleared the castle for 6 hours w/o seeing Goldenrod which is the vamp that spawns him...and I've heard of Goldie spawning twice in 3 hours.  So good luck there. <p>Good travels,<br>

Druids are great for this fight...<br>
Necros' usually dont want to mess up their vampyre faction.<br>
Heratius Grolden is the PH for Vladius.<br>

<br>
He is on the top floor.  If he is not up, kill all the named in the tower and he will eventually.<br>
As soon as you Kill Heratius,  Vladius will spawn out on the ledge.  <br>
Vladius can only be hit by BANE weapons from Melee.  he has tons of HPS, but as stated he is not to bad with a decent group.<br>
He has a life tap of 1000HPS which he will use frequently.<br>
He have tried him with 2 groups of 52-55 level with a 61 lvl druid being the primary healer and caster. Not a good idea, but thats what we could muster. <br>
if we had a cleric he would have been ours.<br>
BTW if you wipe... He WILL camp your corpse.   <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://users.adelphia.net/~middletown/images/Custom%20sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Our camp spot was on the 2nd floor, was getting bored of waiting for spawns so i wanted to see how fast we could clear the tower. cleared the tower names and all in no time.  kept it this way for a bit, then all of a sudden i see this vamp just flying on the balcony, odd because of Trile the other named is always floating around the floor. I target him, sure enough its Heratius,  I told my friends to come up to the top floor quickly as i wasn't sure how long he would stay up. I tagged him and we proceeded to take him down easily.  I kind of jumped the gun on in, cleric was only 40m at the start and mage was 70ish.  Sure enough Vlad popped on the balcony. By this time I was at half health, and the floors had repopped.  I didn't have my vamp weaps on me to try it, kind of a bummer as this is the last piece i needed for the sheild.  All in all we cleared the entire tower for about 2hours, we were there a total of 9hours yesterday..  Will be more prepared next time. Got my vamp weaps from katta today ;P  Thanks for the info<br>

Sat there for 3 hours after doing the rest of the quest. No spawn.  Next day logged on (camped right on the balcony) full castle spawn.  Pulled the two vamps on balcony and heratius spawned while we were killing those two.  Killed heratius, Valdanov killed us.  Ran back to castle, started clearing first floor.  Valdanov shows up and we kill him.  We called in some help for our second attempt on him.  While we were medding on the hill outside castle. Heratius spawns.  So we work our way up there and killed him again.  2 kills in about a half hour.   <br>
<br>
  An important note.  Heratius drops the ashes also.  They have the same name.  BUT get them identified.  One id's as Heratius' ashes and the correct ones ID as valdanov's ashes.  So be careful if you see the ashes in bazaar for sale.  make sure you or have someone cast identify on them.<br>
<br>
  I also dont believe that valdanov or Heratius is KOS to the other vamps.  He could waste the castle easy.  Hope this helps <p><center><img src="http://img.ranchoweb.com/images/phalia/secretsig.gif"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dethvegi1>DeThVeGi1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/12/03 8:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=711.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_exp.gif" align=absmiddle>  Who has done this quest? i have some questions. </span><hr size=1> Thanks for the advice.

You can get this by killing guards and such in SSeru, also killing the Vamp in TM will give you faction..   By the time it takes Heractious to spawn you should have your faction already.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xylek>Xylek</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Jihn/fullsize/test5.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/03 6:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=711.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Who has done this quest? i have some questions. </span><hr size=1> I am 99% sure but I just want to double check. I got Heratis's ashes while helping a friend do this quest. They are Lore. So if I do see ashes in bazaar will I be able to buy the ashes even though they are lore if they are the correct ones? Ie can you hold both ashes at the same time, even though both have exact same name and are lore, as long as they are identified as different? <br>
<br>
I ask this because there is someone selling them in bazaar but I cannot buy because it says they are lore (I have heratis not valnovs on me already). So is this a  good way to check which ashes are which? Or will it not let me buy regardless which one it is?<br>
<br>
Thanks any help is appreciated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=folian>Folian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/03 8:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=711.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~jt1000/Draconis.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Who has done this quest? i have some questions. </span><hr size=1> i thought the ashes from VZ were no-drop? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=orion61269>orion61269</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/03 8:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=711.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Valdanov</span><hr size=1> Ok we had 3 groups trying to take him down.  We were unfortunately flawed.  When I went down cuz cleric didnt ch me, the rest got owned.  Horatious is easy, he is a straight up fight, nothing more than a named bat with lotsa hp, which has been posted here before.<br>
<br>
 Now as far as Valdanov, He is nasty and i was hit with his HT for 1k 4 times in a row.  A few more hits and one more ht and i was dead.  Make sure your healers are AWAKE and know they need to ch you alot if your doing him straight up.  Also a chanter chain runing you would help.  He is a VS type mob and not to be taken lightly.  I am not in an Uber guild but we can hold our own.(Not against this one though apparently --huh)<br>
<br>
We are gonna try again, as the time after that the quest was broken and he never spawned.  /petition and all that...I will post if we are successfull and what we did to add more comments to this post.  Its an Uber back item that will increase ac significantly.<br>
