<br>
In exp group just about any hybrid will do fine.<br>
<br>
I seriously doubt warriors can solo better than sk, rangers and paladins and even bards.<br>
<br>
Another thing is that warriors are just about the worst taunter in the game, actually scratch that they are.<br>
I got all respect for your tanking skills, but often you are not tanking because that hybrid just out taunted you.<br>
<br>
In pog raids my sk tanks a fair bit vs the other 5+ warriors, mainly cause even if i dont use spells my mace and shield just own the average warriors wepon taunt, sometimes i even wish i had evade because my wepon procs (vampric embrace) and taunts back over.<br>
On an average pog raid the only warriors who do the main tankeing own Epics, the rest, i would say 1/10 have the wepons to keep agro.<br>
<br>
But to be honest i forgot what the topic was about, i seem to remember it being the best tank, and warriors are the best eqpic mob tank, but probably draw with hybrids situational because of variouse skills.<br>
<br>
Often the warriors is not the best tank.. mainly because they cant keep agro, and if they cant keep agro they are not tanking, and if they are not tanking, if they are not tanking then they are not the best.<br>
<br>
Paladins/SK have genrallys the same AC as warriors at later lvs, paladins with there buffs, and sk with there own unique buffs that stack with every other AC buff, add that to shields and marginaly AC loss items compared to the warriors ones and actually SK/PAl have more AC than warriors. <br>
What they dont get is DISCS wich is the only thing that makes them tank better, Hybrid HP are not off by that much and there AC is not to far.. warriors are ment to tank VIA skill not items, and your discs are what make you good.<br>
<br>
Also note that defensive is going to be your main disc for tanking.. every warrior i see use offence dies on raids, because they want that last rush of glory, prey you got somone who cant tank till that heal hits you. (wich actualy is my main job, taunt from the warriors who use offence and get there ass kicked)<br>
<br>
Warriors are good, i playe many of them.. but they do get boaring.. i would play another warrior with a strong bunch of friends, as that passes the time rather well but they did get extreemly boaring when no groups are around. Also bear in mind just about any class solos better than the warrior, but warriors do well with partners so 2 man groups are rather viable.<br>

They're still the best tank in xp groups.  Most hps and ac...hence take the least damage and heal the most efficiently with ch.<br>
<br>
&gt;In exp group just about any hybrid will do fine.<br>
Yup pallys/sk's will do fine you're right.<br>
<br>
&gt;I seriously doubt warriors can solo better than sk, <br>
&gt;rangers and paladins and even bards.<br>
EQ != a solo game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;I got all respect for your tanking skills, but often you <br>
&gt;are not tanking because that hybrid just out taunted you.<br>
Then that's the hybrid's fault.  Hybrids taunt by spells...the hybrids JOB is to NOT taunt when with a warrior...so that would be the hybrid being a bad player.<br>
<br>
&gt;On an average pog raid the only warriors who do the main <br>
&gt;tankeing own Epics, the rest, i would say 1/10 have the <br>
&gt;wepons to keep agro.<br>
Then the problem is those warriors don't know how to evaluate weapons well.  See the recent threads here with people saying silly stuff like lams don't suck compared to jade maces. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;Often the warriors is not the best tank.. mainly because <br>
&gt;they cant keep agro, and if they cant keep agro they are <br>
&gt;not tanking, and if they are not tanking, if they are not <br>
&gt;tanking then they are not the best.<br>
I never have a problem keeping agro if everyone in the party is doing their job.  Now admittedly that shadow knight who keeps chain casting disease cloud and then complains that i'm not tanking well that's just the SK being a bad player.  But if the party displays competance I never have a problem tanking.<br>
<br>
&gt;Paladins/SK have genrallys the same AC as warriors at <br>
&gt;later lvs, paladins with there buffs, and sk with there <br>
&gt;own unique buffs that stack with every other AC buff, add <br>
&gt;that to shields and marginaly AC loss items compared to <br>
&gt;the warriors ones and actually SK/PAl have more AC than <br>
&gt;warriors. <br>
Not even close, compare kael quest armors.  <br>
<br>
&gt;What they dont get is DISCS wich is the only thing that <br>
&gt;makes them tank better, Hybrid HP are not off by that much <br>
&gt;and there AC is not to far.. warriors are ment to tank VIA <br>
&gt;skill not items, and your discs are what make you good.<br>
Again, if I, as a warrior, have higher ac, higher hps, and do more damage, and can keep agro without any problems.  Then its not even close really that i'm a better tank than a hybrid.<br>
<br>
&gt;Also note that defensive is going to be your main disc for <br>
&gt;tanking.. every warrior i see use offence dies on raids, <br>
Some mobs you go offensive on, its mob dependant.  Really the high level raid situation is a lot more skill and knowlege than you would think...you'll see when you get there what I mean, kind of hard to explain.<br>
<br>
&gt;Also bear in mind just about any class solos better than <br>
&gt;the warrior, but warriors do well with partners so 2 man <br>
&gt;groups are rather viable.<br>
If I cared at all about solo'ing I would have played a necro. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I play my warrior because i'm one of 3 classes that's actually needed on high end raids (besides the 1-2 of each class to be buff mule).<br>

hybrids can have the same ac to warriors due to ease of equipement, you see alot more hybrids in full or near full kunark armor than u do warrior.<br>
<br>
however get comparable armor (both full kunark) and warrior will have the greater ac.<br>
<br>
Warriors will have more hp barring hp equipment<br>
<br>
Warriors have disiplines but there not to spectaculer outside of raids due to long reuse time<br>
<br>
Warriors can have problems taunting, but mightystrike gets the mob on me 90% of the time, the other 10% is when the other person runs and the mob moves.<br>

The basic gripin was about how after the caps got lifted for a warrior his defensive and offensive capabilities are equal to if not better than a monk.  I disagreed with them heartily, to no end and no avail.  They beleived that a warrior could easily do as much damage as a monk, this I also disagreed with but they argued it anyway and presented some valid points.<br>
<br>
Debate and discussion was launched concerning discs.  Have ye ever read the paladin/ranger discs?  Harhar theres sum laughin for ya.<br>
<br>
All in all the monks there siad repeatedly:<br>
Warriors can outdamage monks, now, with current weaponry.<br>
Warriors are better or equal to monks defensive capabilities post 50.<br>
Rogues by far outdamage all melee types, they also have evade so they don't need to actively control aggro.  Monks FD, [the monks at monkly say] that FD is broken and won't work they way it should, [or the way they want it too?]  So the debate went...&quot;rogues outdamage us, warriors out tank/taunt us and can take more punishment, all we can do is deal damage and now we can't do that as well as most rangers, warriors after 50...&quot;<br>
<br>
Crock O crap if ye ask me.  The debate did however bring out some good points.<br>
Exactly what role do hybrids have after 50?<br>
Are monks underpowered after 50?<br>
Discs for hybrids laughable?  <br>
There was also debate about raids, several saying that the right number/mix or warriors and clerics could do any dungeon/area in the game.  I'm skeptical.<br>
<br>

The only warriors i've ever ever ever seen have problems taunting were either a) low level for the group, b) woe-fully underequipped for weapons (like using a lammy at 5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , or c) incompetant and didn't understand proximity's effect on aggro.  In a single group I have *never* had problems taunting.  At level 52 using a total junk weapon (sword breaker) I was able to taunt chef in sebilis just fine even with a 60 ranger in group with his epics and a 55 monk with epics.  The only time you have trouble taunting is when you don't know how to control aggro...that's a bad player NOT the class.<br>

hybrids can have the same ac to warriors due to ease of equipement, you see alot more hybrids in full or near full kunark armor than u do warrior.<br>

Baloney, hybrids and warriors in velious are both after the same plate armor for quests (ex: tov dropped armor). Its exactly the same drop armor they are competing for.&quot;<br>
<br>
He said Kunark.  No mention of Velious.  While Velious IS the same like you said, until that time comes MOST warriors are still in crafted and Hate armor while those same level hybrids are in almost full Kunark armor (usually missing ONLY their chest and legs).<br>
<br>
Our Kunark armor is WAY rarer to find, and hence WAY more expensive if you were to buy any.  I see other class's Kunark guantlets going from 1K on up to abou 5K... whereas the cheapest I've seen Cobalt guants go for was a straight-up Eboot trade (near 9K), and even then the guy was complaining that he wanted cash on top of it too.  And that's our most COMMON piece that drops. <p>--Hagus Bruichladdich.

<br>
Actually, I think who is the best tank is very situational. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ugaryen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garyen</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.houseofdarklight.com/other/g.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <b>/con's RED</b><br>  Posts: 399<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 1:24:43 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/classes/c_warrior.gif width=71 height=177></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Re one correction's correction</span><hr size=1> any tanking situation war &gt; sks and pals<br>

Although, it may give warrs a warm fuzzy to think that they are best in every situation, it is really naive to believe this.  Generally my warr makes a better tank in balanced groups.  SKs, however, are better where the group has no one to snare or you need an FD puller, for instance.  These are only two situations, I could make several arguments about taunting/taps/fear kiting, etc in certain environments/situations where SK would be better.  I am sure palis could make these arguments as well.  The bottom line for me is that I prefer to let my play do the talking when piloting my SK.  My SK has really never had a problem tanking in xp groups.  He has tanked just fine in Karnors, Seb, Chardok, etc, and sometimes  he actually has an edge over a warrior due to his versatility. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utalicmoore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talic Moore</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <b>is a Formidable Opponent</b><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 4:08:42 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/classes/c_warrior.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ac.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: warriors best tanks?</span><hr size=1> Tenakha, he was talking about KUNARK armor.
