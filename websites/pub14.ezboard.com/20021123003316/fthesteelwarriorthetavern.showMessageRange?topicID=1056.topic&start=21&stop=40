You've protected yourselves right into a few hard levels right at the very end. Every class has had their herdals. Welcome to the first you've had in far too long.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pull your head out for a moment and take a journey with me.<br>
<br>
The time:  Level 31<br>
<br>
The Place:  Dalnir<br>
<br>
The Event:  Warrior came &gt;I I&lt;  that close to being deleted.<br>
<br>
Why?  Well, you see, dying in Dalnir, and at those levels, being responsible for one's own CR, I had to make the famous &quot;Naked Warrior Corpse run&quot; from Firiona Vie to Dalnir.<br>
<br>
I died 11 times in a row in Lake of Ill Omen in the goblin caves on the way back, then when I finally did make it, got raped by a giant in Dalnir.   <br>
<br>
At my bind point, I met up with a Paladin who had also died.  We decided to make the run together.    As we were going into the cave of warrior doom, I got all nervous and jittery, and my Paladin friend had assurred me that all would be well.  As we were going through, it was like nothing.  Every mob got rooted and we just kept on trudging along till we got to Dalnir, nothing was an issue whatsoever.  It was easy as pie.   <br>
<br>
I looted my corpse and camped out, the next day arranged a port out, and decided I didn't care for Dalnir any more, and would find other hunting options.....so I went to Lower Guk....<br>
<br>
The same thing happenned to me there, on CR, I was raped repeatedly by green con frogs in Upper guk on the way down, with absolutely no way to avoid them or delay them whatsoever.   6 deaths that day, 12 the day before, 2 levels lost in 2 days and I was about to hang the warrior up.<br>
<br>
I'm glad I didn't, but to say that we haven't endured difficulties is as preposterous a statement as there ever was.   <br>
<br>
I'm certain that about every warrior on this board can tell you of &quot;naked corpse run&quot; horror stories, and guess what, we are the ONLY ones who have ZERO way to avoid this whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Granted, this is a facet of the early life of a character and doesn't have much bearing on the upper level game, but it's most certainly a hardship that we MUST endure, and it is a terribly difficult one at that.<br>

That truly sounds like a miserable experience.<br>
<br>
I think you would be surprised (I know I am) at how many paladins don't understand the concept of &quot;root 'n scoot&quot; as my wife and I call it.  In fact, MANY classes who can also root don't understand it.  I can't get my wife to mem root to save my life (she's a cleric), so when she runs somewhere by herself, she ends up vulnerable to this very same Naked death run.<br>
<br>
Still, I hope you took that experience as an indication that you as a warrior shouldn't be soloing in dungeons.<br>

But EK wasn't a high level zone, I figured I'd be fine.<br>
<br>
Until.  Until a hill giant spawned right behind me as I followed the path towards NK.  A hill giant.  Max level 39.  At least ten levels below me.  And it proceeded to whip my ass.  And there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it.  No sow.  No root.  No heals.  It was just a slow grueling death with no where to run.  Couldn't even make it to the guards in time.<br>

I'd assume warriors to be atleast half as smart as myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
I willn't go into the lower guk thing since the only reason you had trouble was because you didn't bother thinking about future exp.  I will outline a simple warrior death kit for all post 30 warriors.<br>
<br>
two back packs filled with the following each.<br>
1 a sense corpse rod.<br>
2 3 invis potions<br>
3 1 10 dose sow potion<br>
4 2 blinding potions<br>
Plus a low end 50pp magic weapon just incase greens are better off killed then ran from.<br>
<br>
The totaly cost of this death pack is <br>
just over 200pp.  In almost every case you willn't fully exhust even 1 kit.  <br>
<br>
Now you can problely do without the sow potion and just ask for a sow for cr.  Remember you only need the kit if you can't get ressed.   <br>
<br>
As for paladins never dieing crossing zones?  We have but since we know the power of spells we make sure we have what we lack.  i.e. sows potions and invis potions and sense corpse potions.  <br>
<br>
The reason to carry a weapon is it actualy does effect mob aggro.   Als last I looked slam/bash a mob would stun it giveing you three steps for the door.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways the corpse run argument was lame.<br>
<br>
As for tanking?  currently the war/pal/sk are so close in most grinds that there is no clear choice thank god.  Warriors usualy do more damage and pal/sk have more utility.  Tanking is not an issue and shouldn't be for group tanks.  In raids its situational.  Standerd rule of thumb is any boss mobs that are top end for a guild will require a warrior or a few warriors.  It's only after the guild has moved passed that boss mob that it becomes possible to sometimes substitute other tanks in primary mt role.  This too is balanced.  You get to MT the boss mob first and later on other tanks can do it.  <br>
<br>
<br>
To conclude.  Warriors aren't broken please don't fix them verant.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
p.s. I never debated someone and won the debate and asked for the loser to go away.  If they lost it was good to keep them as proof I was correct.   Warriors here asking me to leave only do it because they are loseing the ddebate.

You see, they already balanced the melee classes in SoV, then they added relative power to the other melee. is their a balance anymore? No it was destroyed. <br>
<br>
I suppose the reason why you do not warriors to be brought back up on par with the other melee is because your class has a chance not to gain even more power than it already has. I am sorry that is not how balance works you cannot just tack more power (relative or absolute) on to some classes and not others after they were already balanced and still say they are.<br>
<br>
But If you really do not want warriors to receive any more power I suppose they could restore the balance with some nerfs. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/9/02 10:39:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 10:44:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ROFL</span><hr size=1> HAHAHA,<br>

Losing the debate?  What that we don't agree with the fallacious premise that Paladins should have the same or close to the same defensive melee skill as a true specialist?  <br>
<br>
It's not a matter of &quot;winning or losing&quot;, it's a matter of having a different outlook on things.  I happen to feel that in the area of heart surgery, I want a cardiologist over a general practician.  In th area of transmission repairs, I want a certified tranmission technician over a general mechanic, and likewise in every other area I can think of, a specialist should always be preferred over a generalist (read hybrid, one who does it all).<br>
<br>
You on the other hand, seem to think that if the general practitioner has studied medicine, he should be doing heart surgery at a similar rate to the cardiologist, the mechanic in the gas station should be doing the transmission at the same rate as the transmission technician, and so on and so forth.  <br>
<br>
I happen to believe that in the absence of the specialist, a generalist is an acceptable alternative, or when generalist is preferable, such as in regular heart scans, and whatnot, then they're fine, but when you want the best, you call in the big guns.<br>
<br>
I feel the same way about Everquest, the warrior is the defensive melee specialist.  He functions in life solely to fill that one role, and when that one role is needed, he should be the logical choice.  In the absence of him, then a generalist would do a fine job, or when a generalist is needed, such as in hard to mez areas, undead areas, etc.  But when you want the best, the best should ALWAYS be the warrior.<br>
<br>
This is not a matter of &quot;winning or losing&quot; a debate, and anyone who supposes that he's capable of winning a debate about positions, has some serious ego issues, or some logic comprehension issues.<br>

<br>
Who are you to talk to me about how my class should be balanced?  Have you *played* a warrior to 60?  I seriously doubt it.  We don't need balancing in your eyes simply because you want to be us.  You want to have everything a warrior has, without giving up anything.  Remember the character selection screen?  You picked &quot;paladin&quot;, right?  The class that is a *hybrid* of the warrior and cleric classes.  Thus, you shouldn't be able to do the jobs of a warrior (damage, tanking) as well as a warrior, and you shouldn't be able to do the jobs of a cleric (healing, buffing) as well as a cleric...right?  I mean...that seems pretty irrefutable to me...not much arguement to be had.  Yet, you insist that you should be just as good, or at least very, very close as a warrior in dealing/absorbing damage.  Well...I'm biased, because I'm a warrior...but...you can take your irrational desires, and shove em where the sun don't shine.  Want to be a warrior?  Roll one up.  Want to be a cleric?  Roll one up.  Want to be a mix of the two?  Keep your paladin, and quit bitching that you're not as good at the specialties of your parent classes as those parent classes are.  Let's face it, at this point in the game, a high end knight is basically a warrior that has spells.  Is that right?  To you, it may seem great.  Me?  I'm pissed, because I struggle to fill a place...and oftentimes that place is better filled by someone else, because my class is broken.  Don't talk to me about 3 hours lfg for 3 days straight.  We've all been there, done that.  Don't talk to me about your life in Kunark...you've gotten your fixes since.  Don't feed me paranoid ramblings about your class losing potential group/raid slots because we get what we deserve.

Seventh, you came to the Warrior board and started putting down Warriors' opinions about the Warrior class, seemingly specifically with the intention to devalue anything we had to say in order to sabatoge any possibility we might get a bone thrown our way.<br>
<br>
You're a Paladin.  You don't want any changes made to Warriors because you feel that might undermine the strength of your class.  You have from the start taken the position that it is the Warriors against the Paladins and continue to have that position.  And you say we have class envy?<br>
<br>
If you don't play a high level Warrior in a guild doing NToV or better regularly, your opinion is based on a limited understanding of the problem.  Don't try and belittle us by saying we don't know how to play the game, because you haven't played with us, have you?  You have NO CLUE whether or not we play well.  Although you are pretty quick to run off at the mouth about all the things you THINK you know.<br>
<br>
As far as not buying trash talk, frankly you've done nothing but trash talk since your first post.        <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/useneebmatethius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seneeb Matethius</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/12/02 7:47:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqshaman.com/no/logos/NO-LOGO4.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ROFL</span><hr size=1> &quot;gimme 3 steps gimme 3 steps mister and you'll never see a me no more&quot;<br>

Thats good..thats something to look forward to when I am Level 60...but Guess what? I am not level 60..I have had troubles here and there since I was in my 20's holding aggro...<br>
<br>
Whats the answer to that? buy better weapons..Oh good yeah I will do that, on top of buying more and more armor so I can tank I also need to come up with 10 k for one weapon then come up with more for a second.<br>
<br>
I remember being in my 30's and having every other melee class taking aggro and having to go all out to get it off themselves simply because my Ykesha and BA longsword which is all I could afford then were nothing compared to rogue peircers and Monk weapons that were faster and did more damage then mine and were easier to come by..<br>
<br>
I now have a 10 18 weapon and a 14 27 that Myself and my incredible guild worked hard for me to get.I am by no means uber though specially since in any given xp group I can almost be guarnateed to encounter other melee near my level with epic haste and procs working for them..Ever tried taunting off of a rogue with a ragebringer at level 52? It is damn hard especially when the rogue has near same amount of hp/ac as you and can't be bothered to click evade cause there is no point..Same goes for monks I know every monk in my guild had their epic pre 55 , that combined with a haste item and some of the best weps per class damage wise and you have a class that screams aggro..and guess what? they tank just as well as I do in an xp group to..<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I simply will not accept the excuse that a warrior that cannot hold aggro is inferior.I assumed this game was for everyone but apperently if you want to be a warrior and be effective at lower levels you need to have a nice bank roll..That is bullshit.<br>
<br>
My ability in a game should not be based on how much money I can come up with ..especially now with the amount of level restricted items out there ,whats a level 40 warrior to do with weapons that he used to be able to use but no longer can?<br>
<br>
Makes me angry..reallly mad when people assume I suck at the game because my weapons are sub par to the next same level warrior standing next to me..It is Eliteism that drives the attitudes of people in the game and it mirrors things in the real world in such a way that the game disgusts me sometimes... <p>The Champion - <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=282318>Surlok Soulbain</a> -

This is the most ignorant answer to an honest post I have read in quite some time..Have you forgotten that at some point every person that has picked up this game was not immediately aware of ways to make money and the uses of certain items in the game..<br>
<br>
If I had 200pp in my 30's that I could blow on a CR pack over new weapons/Armor I would have been the happiest Warrior in all of Norrath.I don't think I realized that I could make money in Rathe Mountains till I was level 40 or so..not everyone is computer Savvy and reads MB I know this the guy that got me into EQ has never read a class board in his life but knows his way around the game just fine....<br>

If you want to make an arguement against something so be it..But do not assume that everyone has the knowledge of the game you may or access to the tools you may.I am willing to bet there are very very few brand new level 30 people in the game that know as much as some people in these threads assume they do..<br>

<br>
You're right, it sucks.  There are three factors that go into gaining agro for a Warrior.  Total haste, damage ratio, and agroing procs.  And guess what, Warriors have perhaps the hardest time getting all three.<br>
<br>
Haste is pure and simply a PITA.  Warriors are probably the class most desperate for haste just to do their job.  Not to do it more effectively, but just to do it.  How many Rogues/Monks/Rangers level up just fine with minimal haste until they get their epics?  They can perform their group function just fine without it.   Sure, things go faster if they do have it, but its not impossible without it.  How many Paladins/Shadow Knights hold agro just fine without significant haste?  Now put a Warrior in the group without reasonable haste and have the other melee have reasonable haste.  How well does that taunt button work now?   Like crap.  <br>
<br>
So either you get lucky on a drop someplace, and out roll all the other people in your pick up group for it, or you get lucky in a guild group and they award it to you, or your guild gets it for you, or you drop 30-100k on it.  Yikes, that sucks ass doesn't it.  How many classes can you name that will have to drop a minimal of 30k on a piece of gear just to do their basic job description?<br>
<br>
High damage ratio weapons, well they used to be hard to come by.  Now a days they are much easier, on that I think we can all agree.  But ratio alone seems to be mediocre taunt at best, particularly when grouped with Rogues/Monks/Rangers who have weapons of similar calibre and pump out a ton more damage as well.<br>
<br>
Finally, finding a weapon with a high agro proc at a reasonable price is just insane.  Most are a minimum of 10k just to get in the door, and these aren't very good.  There are a few that are reasonable, here and there, but they usually have pretty bad damage ratios.  So you can expect to pay HUGE amounts of plat for decent weapons, and the sky is the limit there.  Or you wait to get very very lucky with your guild someplace.<br>
<br>
And all this just to do something that a Paladin or a Shadow Knight can do with a vendor bought spell.  Seems kind of jacked up doesn't it?<br>

  Taunt is broken. Last night there was an incident where I had taunted no less than 5 times, the mob would not stick to me. The one with aggro was doing nothing to cause more and he did not have low HP aggro. What did it take to finally get it onto me? A weapon proc. True, taunt will at times work on the first try but all too freqently, I must rely on procs.<br>

<br>
I believe taunt works fine and I've grouped with warriors in full crafted and junk weapons and they did just fine.<br>
<br>
However I give you a tip for MTing on raids.  -would have thought one of you had mentioned this because of my death pact list but saddly you didn't<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> - <br>
<br>
When MTing on raids buy 4 blinding potions, will cost you 50ppish.  -if too much money guild can repay you-  <br>
Engage mob<br>
With in 4 seconds burn 3 of the potions they are instent cast.<br>
at hit of first CH or 13 seconds into fight hit the last one.  This should hold aggro on you til end of fight if you use the rest of your abilities too.  This is a cheap and low end tactic for taunting but helps with generateing hate.  Paladins have used FoL for the same taunt factor.  However be very careful if anyone out side pulls aggro off a blinded mob they will wonder away.  Almost every boss mob resists it but it still builds aggro <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Guilds repay their clerics and other casters for their costs.  Perhaps guilds should Look into haveing a murky vial fund too.  don't whine about the costs cause on raids the cost of stones an coffines far exceed a 100pp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 243<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/02 9:34:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: odd?</span><hr size=1> I'm sorry Seventh, but a blinding potion is not going to make up for no haste, crap weapons, and no agro proc.

I merely ment it as an aid when raiding.  I thought it was funny I never saw it posted by other warriors before.  I think it shows many players of all classes don't look deeply into how to squeek every advantage out of items and classes.  It more prevelent in warriors for the mere fact you are limited in your choice of options when engageing a mob and this breeds a tunnle vision effect.  But I've still seen it in every other class too.  fewest in the old broken classes only because they were required to try every thing inorder to get by. <br>
<br>
Lets face it the only way to truely fix eq would be to start over and the way eq2 looks I'd bet that willn't work either.<br>
<br>
eq vision should be a vision of 1 person who enjoys every class and gets the biggest pleasure out of haveing most people in every class happy and proud of their class.<br>
<br>
p.s. why do people hate nerfs? because vi did that do necros and they went from being the most dps class to among the least dps class.  That kind of total role reversal scares everyone.  Yet I'd almost welcome nerfs if true balance would be restored.<br>
<br>
Sorry I said the nerf word but it's my honest opinion.   We long ago agreed to never ask for direct class nerfs because nobody wanted it done to them  Yet in some cases it's the only real way to restore balance <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1056.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1056.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1056.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1056.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1056.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1056.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessageRange?topicID=1056.topic&start=141&stop=159>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=1056.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showNextMessage?topicID=1056.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.emailToFriend?topicID=1056.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.threadControl?topicID=1056.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1056.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1056.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
