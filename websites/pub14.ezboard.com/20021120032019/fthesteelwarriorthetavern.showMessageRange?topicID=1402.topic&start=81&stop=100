Maybe you ebayed a while ago and now some mellowed out dumbfuck owns the account, who knows, but your replys are sorely lacking in the pep and originality departments.<br>
<br>
I find it ironically funny that warriors are calling monks the whiners, when its been warriors whining since the start. I remember when no one wanted to be a warrior because they sucked ass. People whined, the made them better and all was good. Then Kunark came out and other classes got higher caps in certain spots, warriors started whining again. Enter Velious, more crying, same with luclin... I dont doubt that warriors will be crying about some gay crap when EQ finally shuts down. You guys are constantly crying about something about your class. Monks on the other hand have cried about very few things, and only when Verant announced its nerf time. But you bitches, are always crying, even when nothing is announced. If its not monks are better wah wah wah, its SKs taunt better boo hoo hoo, to rogues do too much damage and thier ac goes too high for chain classes compared to warriors... buncha pussies all wearing the same label. Steel Tavern Warriors. Make sure you bring your Whine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uantiuber.showPublicProfile?language=EN>antiuber</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/15/02 6:04:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1402.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www2.satexas.com/~tawdry/ofo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: DING!</span><hr size=1> Correct me if I am wrong Yuegou, but I think monks have always been on the recieving end of the gives and never really had any takes. Kunark you got weapons, Velious you got the Itemization, Luclin or melee balance you got a higher damage table. It seems the teachers pet class has always had it handed to you...except this time and look at you.<br>
Warriors, except for the levels at Kunark have been the standard at what other melee was &quot;supposed&quot; to be based on. In other words we aint been getting chit for free like you have.<br>
<br>
Let it go Yuegou...it doesnt sound like its much a nerf anyway not nearly as bad as it could have been. Try and regain some composure and a bit of your respect back...or not. <p><BR>

<br>
I ain't no Furor fanboy, but he's done a lot more for this game than you ever will.  You think he likes leading his rag-tag bunch of misfits into a broken zone to fight broken mobs to get broken loot day in and day out?  He's been doing that crap for years now, and you are still a sniveling loser.<br>
<br>
FoH beat Vox when no one thought anyone would ever kill Vox, they were figuring out the bugs in EVERY new zone 12 months before you even heard about it.  The reason why you think he's a @#%$ is that while he's trying to make problems known about uberzone01 that you've never set foot in, retards who don't know the first thing about the level of game he's at start bitching and whining at him, and I gotta say, I'd tell em to screw themselves too if I had to listen to that all day.  Let me make an analogy for ya.<br>
<br>
You spend all day, every day in Zone A.  you're the only one there, day in and day out.  You find some problems with loot in Zone A, you find some problems with Mob pathing and abilities in Zone A, and then you decide to start talking to people about it to get VI's attention that it's broke, and you get people who have never been to zone A at all saying :<br>
<br>
STFU, NO 1 CARES WHAT U THINK PLZKTHX.<br>
<br>
Now, I ain't a rocket scientist, but 3 years of that would piss me off too.  I'm not at Furor's level, and as such, I have nothing to discuss with the man.  He tells me VT mobs are broken, I say I had potatoes for dinner tonite.  I have nothing to contribute to the discussion he wants, so I don't take part in it.  Unfortunately, due to the marvel of the internet, every idiot, like yourself, can now pretend they know everything and start talking to Furor like they've been there, which must obviously annoy him.  He tells you to shut up, because you don't know what you're talking about, and the next thing ya know, everyone hates him because he hates anyone &quot;not on his level&quot;.<br>
<br>
Furor says monks are overpowered once they reach an AC level comparable to warriors.  Every retard level 30 iksar monk wearing dex/agi gear says &quot;NO WAY DUDE, WE SUCK,&quot; while every monk near Furor's level says &quot;ya, we are a tad bit overpowered guys.&quot;  The retard monks then come here to whine about how Furor and warriors got them nerfed.<br>
<br>
No warrior wanted monks nerfed.  Monks have their own avoidance table, we wanted our own mitigation table.  Period.  We never asked for monks to get knocked down, but if this is the answer that VI picks, then so be it.  Stop bitching at us and get the @#%$ off our board and go whine with your other retard monks on your new board they created for you losers to complain to each other about how badly Furor nerfed you, while the rational members of the monk community can continue their discussions in peace. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Veteran Haass Wolvesbane</a> <BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a>

my AGI is 150, my str 169, my HP is 1336, the only reason i want HP is for spells, but if there is better Resist gear than i'll sacrifice HP for Resists, <br>
i never plan on tanking after lvl 55 so why should i bother with hight AC/HP?? those are warrior stats, not a martial artists stats!!<br>
<br>
sure its the Items that have given us this ability, but i like to role play my monk, and right now, many monks RP like warriors!<br>
<br>
many moons ago i posted a question on the monkly board, about stealing aggro....one of the answers was to just beef up my AC and HP and become the tank...which is what i did, since i couldnt stand laying FDed for half the fights! <br>
<br>
since then ive done some thinking about Monks, we should never have been given the option to Become tanks....we should take damage on a good hit like a druid or Beastlord would! <br>
but we shouldnt get hit that often!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Avoidence! not endurence should be a monks trademark<br>
<br>
but that still leaves the question....when are warriors going to get the skill they need to do their jobs??<br>

I feel very sorry for You Yuegou, being abusive and even so far as threating bodily harm on another is bad enough but to do it over a post on a message board about a game?  Very distrubing, I cannot stress enough the level of concern I have for this individual and indeed his family friends co-workers and anyone that comes into contact with him/her.  I mean if Yuegou gets this riled up over a post on a board imagine what this person could potentially do in RL if U look at them wrong, or maybe by accident bump into them in a grocery isle.  Plse for the safety of urself and others seek immediate counciling Yuegou U really are just crying out for help I think by your actions on this board.

You can talk all the trash you want on the internet behind the anonymonity of your computer, doesn't mean you have the stones or the means to act upon it. <br>

<br>
If a monk and a warrior are the same level fighting the same mob along side eachother and they each are wearing the same gear. In this situation the warrior has more HP. I think in this case the monk might have slightly higher AC due to higher defense cap, but aside from that they should be the same.<br>
<br>
However, given that the monk has a higher avoidance, his lower HP and mitigation is going to matter less. While the warrior is taking more hits though less damage the monk is taking less hits altogether. I havn't done extensive testing in such a long time I don't know exactly how it evens out. But I would assume the best case senario would be given all these things, the monk should tank slightly less effectively than the warrior.<br>
<br>
I believe what fails the most is how avoidance and mitigation scale with ATK and levels. It should be that fighting mobs of higher levels and higher ATK avoidance (while starting out higher on the scale) curves down in effectiveness, where mitigation remains on a linear downward graph that eventualy overtakes avoidance by a slight margin. This however does not seem to be the case. More, at certain ATK ratings any level of mitigation seems to make no difference thus avoidance makes all the difference, which shouldnt be the case.<br>
<br>
This of course has not mattered as much to me as my three biggies. I want three things, one I want to be able to taunt, I want that taunt to have a 1 or 2 second duration of effectiveness (i.e. it WILL stay on me for that time even if afterwords will will turn back), and I want to be able to take more direct hits (mitigated damage) than monks.

I'll bet a thousand plats on it.  Sorry it just peaves me to no end when someone ten levels under the main tank brags of taunting better.  That kind of lvl differance is huge to a engaged mobs.  I used to be able to steal aggro off lvl 60's when I was level 53 when I wasn't doing much more then taunt and swinging and I'm a freaking paladin and this was early SoV against a freaking sk.<br>
<br>
Anyways as for the nerfs to monks?  It's a legit nerf.  Either that or move the decimal point on alot of gear 1-2 places to the right.  As for the def table?  Aya we need it but warriors/pal/sk need to be the only one on it and THE WARRIOR NEEDS TO HAVE A 15-20 POINT LEAD.

Great, good, you're probably still viable tanks. Excellent for you. But as bad as the warrior whining has been, we never had to create an entire forum just for the discussion of a whiff of a rumor.<br>

36 page whinefest?<br>
<br>
I'd rather have a 36 page thread, than a ENTIRE forum that had to be made from the MASSIVE whining, complaining and &quot;i'm quitting&quot; posts.

You, Yuegou, give the monk class a bad name.  Go back under the rock.<br>

Got beef?  Flame VI, use your /feedback command, email a developer, post on Developer's Corner.<br>

Other wise this will continue to be a flame fest, though atleast somewhat entertaining to read. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=31658">Raun Stonecutter</a> <a href="http://www.swordoffate.com"><Sword of Fate></a>

The others that are far enough over the AC softcap against most mobs haven't gotten nerfed because even with the behind the scenes AC reduction, they are still over the cap.  To me it's the higher end game where the main problem was, not the L30 monk compared to hte L30 warrior.  Verant has failed to address the issue for the high end game because their stupid softcaps are set so low on the mobs.  regarding yueg... he's a troll. don't feed the troll.<br>
