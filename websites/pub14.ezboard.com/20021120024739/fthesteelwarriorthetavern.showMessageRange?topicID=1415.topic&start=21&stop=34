<br>
But, I think you need to pay closer attention to the monks you're around, their gear, and their levels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Monks dont have the same bandage cap as we do<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Monks have the EXACT SAME BANDAGE CAP AS YOU. Until level 51.<br>
<br>
50 percent.<br>
<br>
So if you're hanging around with monks that bandage more than 50 percent, they are over level 51.<br>
<br>
Warriors BW cap goes past 200 at a later level than monks (I forget what that is, but it's in the FAQ here). BUT, that's offset in the Alternate Advancement abilities where warriors get IMPROVED bind wounds (and will likely get an improvement to the improved bind wounds in PoP). Warriors with their AA's spent in bandaging will seriously outbandage monks. Like that's really a big deal, but ... point is ... you will eventually bandage much better than the monks you hang out with.<br>
<br>
Anyways, it sounds like you really have problems with monks class specific abilities.<br>
<br>
Seriously, if you WANT to MEND, if you WANT to Feign Death, if you WANT to do all these things monks do, play a monk. <br>
<br>
ALSO, the ONLY monks to have regen are IKSAR. Human monks have no added hit point regeneration at all. They're the same as everyone else. So if you want to have amazing hit point regeneration while you mend and feign death, play an Iksar monk.<br>
<br>
And remember TROLL and IKSAR warriors have the exact same regen as IKSAR MONKS. So you TOO could have had that regeneration as a warrior.<br>
<br>
You chose to play a warrior.<br>
<br>
There are things you will do in this game that a monk will NEVER do. Like wear an AC 75 breastplate. Like TAUNT a monster. Like taunt ALL the monsters in the general area. Like have the Avatar of War beat on you for an entire fight. Like breaking 5000 hit points unbuffed, and 7 to 10 thousand raid buffed (PoP's gonna have some nice HP improvements to warriors, I'd hope).<br>
<br>
You've got a lot to look forward to as a warrior. Don't get hung up on monks who feign death when they get their butt handed to them. They're just monks. You're the tank in the big badass looking armor taking the beating. It's what you do.<br>
<br>
And don't worry about soloing. Because druids and necromancers certainly solo a hundred times better than any silly monk.<br>

<br>
The cries of nerf is kinda of sad since the only actual testing evidence available points to a status quo.<br>
<br>
The few monks that has reported the situation on tests reports a lesser mitigation (takes more dmg when hit) but also reports an greater avoidance (getting hit less) so the sum if about the same dmg taken per timeunit.<br>
<br>
All the super cries about Monks going to have caster mitigation and avoidance and will die as soon as a froglok as much as looks at them is based on &lt;drumroll&gt; nothing.<br>
<br>
The few reasonable voice from monks mainly on MB boards are trying to point at the test results to show that the only real nerf is sustained over time tankability of ubermobs (ie with lower mitigation monks gets more spikes in the dmg so that makes them less usable as main tanks, their role if test is true is that they do not loose any significant amount of soloability or rampage tanking).<br>
<br>
There is 20 monks thats cry wolf and hates verant for makeing them die on the spot as soon as a mob looks their way for any 1 monk that takes the time to read the relevant posts with facts instead of speculation.<br>
<br>
By that I dont think we warriors need to go to MB and poke at them because thats not constructive, we should focus on trying to help the warrior class instead. <br>
<br>
Warriors of today need a better stackability at raids so that even the 4th - 10th warrior feels remotely productive. Warriors/Paladins/Knight and maybe Rangers need to narrow the dmg gap that exists upto the top 2 classes (Monks and Rogues). Rangers still need an edge so maybe have melee dmg onpar with warriors which they might have and let their superior buffs/spells make up for the other 10-15% dps so a ranger does 10-15% more dmg than an offensively built warrior.<br>
Go back to the old 100/120/140 relations (sorry I forgot what knight were supposed to be melee dmg wise 90%?).<br>

<br>
Necro's and SK's get a version of FD that is necromantic in nature.  They way I see it, they use magic to make themselves appear to be a corpse, maybe with a little bit of stink and creepy-crawly worms and bugs thrown in for effect.  Think of them as Voodoo-type guys, doing stuff with zombies and the like.  Their FD is a supernatural sort of thing based on their connection with death-based magic.<br>
<br>
Monk FD skill is completely different.  Monks aren't based on real life oriental monks.  They are based on oriental monks of legend and from Hollywood and Hong Kong films.  One thing that you see in such films is martial artists, particularly ninjas and monks, who can slow their heart rates and breathing so as to appear dead.  Actually, I SAY that EQ monks are based on fictional monks, but I have heard that there are Tibetan monks that can actually do what I have just described and have done it on camera with doctors present.  Of course, if they had included all the stuff from such sources, then monks would be able to turn invisible, walk through walls, reduce their weight to nothing, walk around wearing a wet sheet in sub-zero weather, stop bleeding at will, and kill with a touch.  Monks basically have a very high degree of mind-over-body control that allows them to achieve fantastic things.  Mend is also based on this, by the way.<br>
<br>
Regarding mobility wearing clother/leather versus plate:<br>
<br>
A strong man who has spent his life wearing plate can be surprisingly mobile in it, especially if it is well made armor, BUT if that same man were to take off that armor and go around wearing cloth and leather, he would be even more mobile!  He would never be as mobile as the guy that spent his life studying acrobatics and the like though, even if the acrobat might suck at moving around in plate.  A knight in full plate doesn't just shuffle around like he was wearing a suit made out of lead, but he doesn't win any foot races either and he certainly doesn't go swimming.  In summary, plate mail doesn't turn you into a turtle, but it does have a limiting effect on what you can do.  Realistically, almost nobody, including monks, should be able to swim with their equipment.  If you were to have nothing on but a pair of swim trunks, and then strap a 5 pound sword to your waist, you would have a very hard time swimming, especially if you had to swim any great distance.  A monk with a 2hb staff, a bunch of bags and maybe a backpack or two, etc., etc., isn't going to be able to swim very well either.  But EQ is a game, where thankfully realism is suspended enough to let us have fun.<br>
<br>
In summary, trying to base what EQ characters can and can't do on real life analogs just doesn't work.  If it did, then monks would be the fastest running, highest jumping characters in the game, except for naked people going on corpse recoveries.  There would be no such thing as hitpoints.  In a real fight, if I stab you through the heart or dash your brains out with a club, the number of &quot;hitpoints&quot; you have doesn't really matter.  Get it?  <br>
<br>
I have to say that the person that started this thread is just trolling.  The title seems to be saying, &quot;Let's just stop arguing about this, okay?  Give peace a chance!&quot;, but the body of his posting basically says, &quot;We should all stop arguing about this because I am right and you are wrong and and also stupid and this is why and if you disagree with me, you are just being argumentative!&quot;<br>

<br>
But then you realize, if the game had these concepts in place it would be that much better :). Yea it makes more sense that you move faster naked. And if that was implemented, people would have an easier time retrieving their corpse naked. Assuming anyone still retrieves their corpses by running back to them at all.<br>
<br>
I don't know about monks being able to jump really high though, but I'd have to brush up on some old movies / etc. For the most part it seems people like to mesh ninja into their class. Monk-Ninjas, Rogue-Ninjas (gg class title assassin), etc. Yea, if you were a ninja from the movies I could understand you leaping buildings and running roofs, but I don't recall ever seeing monks leaping high. They are more mental than acrobatic (correct me if I'm wrong).<br>
<br>
Personally, I think weight affecting movement / swimming would be a cool concept. Although I do not agree that warriors would move as slow as some people think. I think people picture a lawyer in a suit of armor and how he would move when they think warrior in plate, when thats not the least bit accurate. Of course I also don't consider warrior the most plate-dependent class RP-wise, I'd give that title to the Knight, whom usually addorns heavy plate armor for looks more than battle. A warrior would be more of a plate / leather combo -- a balance of vital protection and ability to move around the battlefield. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uaielmankajiraliege.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aielman KajiraLiege</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/16/02 6:10:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1415.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fallenalliance.org/screenshots/downwpst.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ac.gif" align=absmiddle>  Let's shed some light on a common misconception...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Regarding mobility wearing clother/leather versus plate:<br>
<br>
A strong man who has spent his life wearing plate can be surprisingly mobile in it, especially if it is well made armor, BUT if that same man were to take off that armor and go around wearing cloth and leather, he would be even more mobile! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A common misconception perpetuated by Hollywood and ignorance of fact is that plate armor is exceedingly heavy and seriously limits mobility.<br>
<br>
That's completely wrong. Plate armor, since around 1270, has been lighter than any other form of armor. Correct me if I'm wroing, because it's been a few years since I studied this, but the blast furnace was invented in about 1270. Since that time, steel has been able to be manufactured in such a way to make it strong and relatively light. The main reason plate armor was the choice of the nobility and well to do was that it afforded you the same kind of protection that full chain/scale did, but at a fraction of the weight. In addition, full plate, if properly fitted and equipped, leaves you with nearly full mobility. I know this because I've worn it...both old armor and new armor (the old armor was, btw, better made and lighter, surprisingly). I've also fought in it at SCA events and RenFests. Chain is Much heavier and far more confining. I chain skirt (covers chest, shoulders, back and the upper thigh)weighs upwards of 60 pounds and that doesn't include helmut or anything to cover your arms. the weight of it is also carried squrely on the shoulders alone. A full suit of plate (chest, back, arms, neck, shoulders, wrists, upper and lower legs, boots,  and hands) weighs less than 50 lbs with helm (usually the heaviest individual armor piece) depending on the style and can be even less with a small helmut. In addition, plate distrubutes the weight about the body which makes it seem alot lighter too. I have seen guys vault onto the back of a horse wearing full tilting plate (minus helm) which is the heaviest grade of plate they ever made. There were also accounts of Knights swimming across rivers wearing full armor to get to or running away from battles in the past. As a point of fact, the heaviest individual pieces of a warrior's panoply has always been the shield, if he used one, with the weapon he carried being next. The only piece of plate armor that was ever truly heavy was the tilting helm used for jousting. Those mothers can weigh up to 30 lbs all by themselves...but then again, having a tree trunk rammed into your face at the double gallop speed in the lists sort of demanded that heavy of protection.<br>
<br>
Now...this isn't to say that plate is as light or unrestricting as monk robes, but it's certainly not that confining nor debilitating to your movement and sure as hell will offer a helluva lot more protection against edged/blunt weapons. <br>
<br>
Prior comments were made that they're magic pajamas...ok...fine. But I have a magic buick strapped around my body and the enhancement to your pajama's is no greater than the enhancement to the destroyer worth of metal i'm wearing...which still means the plate should Still mitigate much more.<br>
