<br>
God, every time I see a lower level (non-twinked) warrior, I think to myself &quot;Jeez, these kids have it WAY too easy, and have nothing exciting to look forward to&quot;.<br>
<br>
I remember when I was level 46 in full crafted with a 2 SSoY's stepping into Karnor's Castle for the first time and parking my butt there until I had Cobalt Boots, Cobalt Gloves, a Jade mace, and a Trident.  I remember frustration after frustration seeing Drolvarg Mantles and Kunzar Cloaks drop one after another, and finally emerging from Karnor's with the equipment that I desired....at level 54 ready to move into Sebilis, not leaving there until I had Cobalt Arms, and a couple of great weapons, and sprinkled with Planar armor (except BP after 30ish hate raids).   <br>
<br>
I remember vividly tanking Wurms in HoT with my Stonewood Mail, and looting that Tarnished Plate BP was godly.   I almost feel bad when I hear from warriors who are in the 40's who are wantng to know whether to get a Fleshgrinder or Frostbringer to upgrade their Lammy tha they've had for 15 levels, or whether to just go ahead and get a Swiftblade of Zek that's going for 50kpp in the Bazaar.<br>
<br>
Seems to me that some of the joys of hunting are gone when the spoils of your adventures are nothing but tradebait for anyone in your group, and low value tradebait at that.  The concept of &quot;Earning your way through&quot; is a concept as foreign as equipping stuff that drops from Exp giving mobs in today's lower level game it seems.<br>
<br>
I only wonder what is going to become of these guys when the quality of improvements begins to diminish and they actually have to fight for stuff that they'll put on.   Seriously, why go through the rigors of Hate and Fear when you already have Cobalt before even being able to zone into those planes?   It makes one wonder really.   <br>
<br>
I spent some time in tells with a lower level warrior who asks for advice from time to time.   It really saddenned me to hear that when I suggested that he park his butt in Sol B from 35-45 that he responded with &quot;Why would I do that?  It's way too hard&quot;.<br>
<br>
I dunno where I'm going with this, other than to lament the fact that another exciting aspect of the game, Improvement in equipment based on hunting is gone in what seems like for good.<br>

<br>
I remember when camping an item upgrade was the best feeling. I was so proud the day i got my crafted legs. I ran around showing them off to all my friends and how much the contrast was to the bronze armor i wore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   or the day i got dual SSOY's to upgrade my lanseax's! dungeon crawling was the most exciting time, dying with friends was a blast<br>
<br>
Today, everyone wants to PL to 60, take the easy, outdoor, boring zones day in and day out.<br>
<br>
It is disheartening to see the &quot;should i save up the money for full SS plate MQ, dual fleshgrinders and CoF for my level 13 warrior&quot;? The sense of getting upgrades on your own is the best feeling in the game for me.<br>
<br>
But, people play the game how they want. We all have different perspectives of &quot;fun&quot; and to each his own. All the gear in the world is nice, but it's your experience that makes you a good warrior.<br>
<br>
I always try to give advise to any warrior I see that wants to chat. I tell them to work hard, stay focused and have fun. The world of Norrath is very large. There are lots of stuff to see and do. Try to experience every aspect of the game and see the zones. Don't just take the easy route. We all want 60 with a billion AA points, but what's it worth if you miss the true game?<br>
<br>
I know this isn't really a &quot;The Arena&quot; type thread, but to all the up and coming warriors i'd like to say this : Don't get caught up in the experience grind. Levelling is nice, but once you reach the top in a few days, then what? going back and seeing the game isn't fun when it's not a challenge. Have FUN. <p><img src="

When I started playing someone with 2 names was powerful.   Someone with 2 yaks was uber.<br>
<br>
Now I wouldnt give a yak to a level one twink, the only use for a yak is to give to my pet.<br>
<br>
I rember killing decaying skellys for those cracked staffs =) ... 1pp each for my only character (wizzie) so that I could buy a snake fang. They came from some far away place called &quot;east commons&quot;.  I rember not buying root because I thought it would be better to get all my attack spells first =)<br>
<br>
When my brother made his first character I gave him 10 plat and recomened he start in qeynos (he wanted a ranger)  Because of where he started he was with other real newbies. <br>
<br>
Now looking back he so very very happy that he did that. He got to experance being a real newbie. <br>
<br>
Anyone createing there first character I would reccomend qeynos because it's so out of the way that you will see fewer high level characters.<br>
<br>
The characters I feel sorry for are the ones that follow the DL path. <br>
<br>
When you started did you ever think you would group with a level 50 that had NEVER entered a dungen?<br>
<br>
now that I have reached the 55+ range the last thing I want to do is need work all over again. <br>
<br>
So I twink. <br>
I twink a lot.<br>
At 49 my warrior has about 1150ac 2400hp (unbuffed)<br>

I know you had to fight with your fists until level 35 when you finally got a board with a nail in it from emperor crush, but what does that have to do with anything?  The game is different than it was 3 years ago, at all levels.  Sure 2 yaks used to be uber, but now the uber people are 100x more powerful than they used to be.  Only makes sense that stuff trickles down, but if anything the road to uberness is longer than it used to be. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6629>Brutul Vilesilencer</a><br>

Yes, it's disheartening to see these so-called warriors race to 50+ in a matter of weeks and have awesome weapons and armor, but most these uber twinks, level 40s with fleshgrinders and such, will fall thru the wayside and will never threaten the true warriors of Norrath.  School will come and we will see these warriors stipped and shelved, and their goods up for sale in the bazaar.  The rest of them will get their credit card bills back and wonder again, &quot;why did I pay $500 for all that plat?&quot;  The truth is, warriors are easy to play up to a certain level and our appeal draws, and will continue to draw, people that played other classes, especially people who are sick of playing a caster or don't want to solo anymore.  After that certain level, they will call it quits.  But in the chance that that twink does make it up to 60, what kind of guild do you think he will be accepted into?  Most likely not one that does ToV on a regular basis.  I'd like to see that warrior go into NToV and tank a couple of those flurry mobs.  No situational awareness, no knowledge of whats in store, no nothin'.  These guys don't represent the true warrior class, and your peers will know. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukeniden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keniden</A> at: 8/19/02 4:00:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwubaogoldenarmz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wubao Goldenarmz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/19/02 4:43:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   there's still stuff to camp</span><hr size=1> &quot;with the exception of Jboots I cant think of any item worth camping before 40, and thats a very fun part of the game &quot;<br>
<br>
Hmmmmmm ... not including keys, my warrior, who is indeed a twink, has camped/quested these items:<br>
<br>
Praetor's Blade of Debility (needed friends to help me with this quest, but isn't that what EQ's all about?) at level 35.<br>
<br>
Eye of Trust (for the range slot ... and for RP reasons, I like it better than a Goranga Idol when I'm not using my bow).<br>
<br>
Jeweled Quiver of the Hand (again, needed some help taking out the guy in Katta, but it was worth it).<br>
<br>
Gnollslayer (more help, this time in Paw ... hey, this thing about getting people to help you quest sure is fun ... and the gnollslayer is just a fun toy).<br>
<br>
Qeynos Badge of Honor (see invis is kinda fun, but the honor of doing this quest after starting out with my very first toon in qeynos carries with it a special meaning, and the completion of the THIRD badge actually dinged me 45, that was a great feeling ... now I'm working on rounding up some friends to go after Barducks as well as trying to get some pate made).<br>
<br>
Earring of the Solstice (again, TONS of help from friends to round up stuff needed. Just got this a couple of days ago, and was quite ecstatic)<br>
<br>
Rallic Pack (ran into the runner quite by chance one day, BARELY survived the encounter, felt it was an omen and finally went and did this quest on my own for the first time)<br>
<br>
Horned Beetle Mask (had been looking for this beetle for a long time)<br>
<br>
The bow I used up until very recently was made by my own hands. And my latest bow I bought from another fletcher after four failed combines on it.<br>
<br>
I dunno, I mean, there's a LOT of things for warriors to quest and camp these days. It's just, yeah, the game has progressed really really fast, and sometimes it's just easier to amass 1 to 2 thousand plat and hit the marketplace for your upgrades. The bazaar has made this even easier.<br>
<br>
But there are worthwhile quests to do if you search around.<br>

Of course, this DOES lead to the &quot;path of least resistance&quot; method of levelling (Oasis/LOIO/DS/ME/FG) method of easy outdoor levelling and a lack of the finesse that was learned by hunting in more dangerous dungeons.  You learn a LOT about mob behaviour, aggro, etc in dungeons that you simply do not confront in the &quot;outdoor to 60&quot; levelling path. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uzegog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zegog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/20/02 9:29:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.notnats.com/tinyzeg2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Today's Lower Level Warriors</span><hr size=1> I'm one of those lower level warriors you're talking about.<br>
<br>
Well, maybe not one of THOSE you're talking about, but I am a lower level warrior.  Level 36 atm, maybe level 37 after tonight.<br>
<br>
Most of my gear I've gotten through barter, bazaar, and a bard friend of mine that seems to have scrounging skills in the 200's.  I DO have a pair of cobalt boots from him, but those are only 'on loan' and can be requested to be returned at any moment.  I plan on getting my own pair, so I can return those to him.<br>
<br>
I have done some crafted quests.  I don't think I'm at the levels where I can camp for the really good gear yet.  Most of my stuff cost between 100-200pp each piece.<br>
<br>
Maybe I haven't been doing enough research, because I don't know of anywhere to hunt that will give me drops that are better than the equipment I'm using, though.  Most of the time it seems that when stuff drops, it would have been really cool about 10 levels ago.<br>
<br>
I know that a lot of that stuff USED to be supreme loot at the time, and would probably have been upgrading the stuff, but I think that has to do more with mudflation than the attitude of the new warriors.<br>

Just recently I was looking to see what is next in the line of my chest armor.  I'm using netherbian chitin right now, and I looked in the bazaar to see what's next up the line.  Looks like blackened enamel is better AC, although no stats.  I hope to take my friends to Lower Guk to see what that's like in a couple weeks.<br>
<br>
Anyway... I don't think the earn-the-equipment attitude is completely dead.<br>
<br>
Hmm... reading over my post I don't know if I added anything to the conversation... but there it is anyway.<br>

A month ago, due to a pickup group practicing NBG, I got cobalt gaunts in KC.  They were a hefty upgrade for me.  Its not dead, just in deep deep hiding. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 I started playing the game about 4 months ago. I am currently lvl 46 and play on the Drinal server.  I do agree that it is sad that there are these twinks out there who have gotten everything, but keep in mind it is not all of us.  I am not a twink. I worked for ever single thing i have.  I still wear a mix of crafted and crusty armor, and the reason i have these is because they are not expensive on Drinal. i quested the crafted armor myself with various groups, and the crusty sells on drinal for 200pp per piece, so its not that diffucult to lay your hands on.<br>
my weapons are a wurmslayer and a centi shortsword. it took me forever to get the money to get these which i swhy it has taken me so long to level up. I had to be out camping the coppers to raise money. i have spent the last 10 levels in Sol b getting my butt kicked and have now moved on to soloing the yeti caves in DL. so dont think there are nothing but wannabe warriors out there all twinked up and have nothing to do but level.<br>
young warriors have it easy? perhaps from your persective they do, however i dont think so.  you try competing for a group when your wearing crafted and crusty with low grade weapons (not that wurmmy and centi are bad, i love them and worked hard for them) and competing with the same lvl warrior who has MQ'ed his champions armor and can outdmg you as well.  which would you take into your group?<br>

the dungeon expo groups truly are gone, like you said.  i can never get a group in a dungeon because it is constantly full of 55-60's there for no other reason than to camp money and equipment they will turn around and sell the second they can funnel it to their mule in the bazaar. look at crystal caverns a great 35- 45 zone. always packed with 55's fighting with each other over the geos cave or wipeing out every orc in the zone to farm the acrylia. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufuloriancavestomper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FulorianCavestomper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Smithing Guru</span><br>  Posts: 898<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/20/02 4:47:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: oh and 1 more thing</span><hr size=1> Actually, they're doing it for Alternate Experience.

<br>
When the game started, I rolled up a necro.  He was 50 before kunark came out, 60 before luclin came out.  He was my only character.  I leveled him the hard way, doing the same crap you all speak of.  I remember saving cracked staves.  I remember camping treants from 22-31 because the 8pp and change they dropped was the only way to make decent cash.  400pp a week was a decent haul.<br>
<br>
My warrior is one of your &quot;twink warriors&quot;.  He was wearing cobalt and guardian from level 25.  Was dual wielding lammies shortly afterwards.  Now he's got 4khp and 1250 ac, decked in near full Fierce Heraldic and champs BP, with CT loot in some non visible slots, and 30 aa points.  I paid my dues. I've no reason to scrape for gear and wait for drops.  I'm a pretty wealthy man, for having played for 3 years.  It's not worth my time to camp a 2k item. I can make 2k faster than I could obtain said item by killing greenies.<br>
<br>
If you wanna camp your gear for some RP reason, great, more power to ya.  I scraped and scratched and crawled my way to 60 once.  I have no desire to do so again.  If you wanna do it, that's great.  Don't expect the rest of us to waste time doing it again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uazlanaicelander.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azlana Icelander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sexies Warlady in all o'Norrath</BR>     ...an da moon too!</BR>Steel Warrior Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 387<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/20/02 9:34:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ringofshadows.org/images/Azlana7.jpg width=96 height=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: oh and 1 more thing</span><hr size=1> Well, m'has two points o'view....<br>

<br>
this is exactly the situation i am in - i worked hard to get what i have right now, crusty / crafted mix at 39... all the crafted was quested bar the boots because i couldnt get a group together to go camp the quest item<br>
<br>
i'm currently sporting a centi ss / ls combination - i only have the ls because i traded 2 unused weapons and my only 2hs to a friend<br>
<br>
yes, it sickens me sometimes to see warriors lower than me running around in cobalt - especially when it comes to getting a group, but what can you do?<br>
<br>
where's the fun in twinking yourself to the point where levelling becomes trivial? i can see why some people just want to get to the high end game as fast as they can, but i have learnt so much by slogging it out level by level <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
i've been at the warrior game since luclin was released, and playing eq since august 2001 and i've never had enough money to twink myself anything <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
