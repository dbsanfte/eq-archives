There are some concerns about how much damage is being dealt by plate melee, and Warriors feel there is also an issue with taunt.<br>
<br>
So here are a couple of ideas for a correction.  I'm just throwing them out to get some feedback.<br>
<br>
The first involves a couple of new disciplines.  Along the lines of a Warrior's current aggressive and evasive.  If we say a Warrior's normal mitigation/damage output is expressed as 100%/100% and we say that a Knights normal mitigation/damage output compared to a Warrior would be 95%/80% (I grant that some may argue on the 95% mitigation figure of a Knight compared to a Warrior.  And others will argue that Knights aren't just doing 80% of a Warrior's damage in the high end, but for the sake of discussion, lets agree these figures are correct).<br>
<br>
Now the currently when a Warrior uses defensive, these values change to something like 140%/60% (that is, he gets hit for 40% less damage but does about 40% less damage as a result).  <br>
<br>
The new defense type discipline would be more along the lines of 120%/80% for a Warrior.  And Knights would get a version that is along the lines of 105%/70% (remember, these percentages are based on the Warrior normal 100%/100%, so the Knights would move from their normal mitigation of 95% to 105%, a 10% improvement in mitigation, while losing 10% in damage output).<br>
<br>
The timer on these disciplines would be five minutes and would last five minutes.  Basically, you could keep it active indefinetly, if you so choose, but it would require you to fire it off every 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
The second discipline would be offensive in nature.  What it would do is change these figures to 80%/120% for a Warrior and 85%/90% for a Knight.  It would have the same timer and duration as the defense version.  Meaning you could flip flop them every 5 minutes.   The offense disciplines would help put the damage dealt by the plate melee more in line with where it should be in comparison to that done by Monks/Rogues, but at the expense of mitigation.  This would be used by non-MT plate melee.<br>
<br>
The first would mean that a Warrior would be the best choice for uber boss mob tank, even in those situations where defensive isn't desireable, but in a pinch a Knight would work as well (hopefully).  It also means that given much superior gear, a Knight might be the better choice.  Certainly they would be a better choice than a Monk.  The second would help balance the current damage imbalance, but at a price.<br>
<br>
This would leave defensive alone, since there is a time and a place where its needed.  But it would also give both Warriors and Knights clear superiority as meat shields both in groups and tanking uber mobs.  It would 'balance' things a bit better, but not with a new defense table, but with disciplines only gained at level 60, where the imbalance truly begins to show.  Defensive has already shown it can be done, and it shouldn't take major reworking of code to do it.<br>
<br>
Final idea.  This would be a new AAXP ability for Warriors.  There would need to be 2 or 3 levels to it.  It would an ability you could fire off which caused the Warrior to proc an enraging blow type attack.  The duration could be set for 3 or 5 minutes and would refresh in something like 10 minutes.  As each level in the ability was aquired, it would proc more frequently.   The idea here is, not every Warrior in the game is going to be able to get ahold of enraging blow weapons.  But every Warrior in the game SHOULD be able to do their job respectably without them, this would be another tool towards that end.  And it would be no more trivializing to the game than allowing enraging blow weapons to drop to begin with.  If its not trivial with enraging blow weapons on a few Warriors, it shouldn't be trivial having more Warriors with a similar ability.<br>
<br>
This would also help counter balance the spell improvements that Knights are/will receive in the near future (I just can't believe that Verant won't be improving Paladin heals in some fashion). <br>

I just doubt they'll even consider giving us anything that has the faintest resemblance to an enraging blow proc without a great deal of work to obtain it.<br>
<br>
Perhaps an increase to taunt seperate from the AAXP ability?  Not sure what a reasonable fix would be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucyrzb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CyrzB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/9/02 2:02:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1242.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Suggestions for a plate melee fix</span><hr size=1> Here is my issue.<br>
<br>
I'm seeing SK's (Probably pallies too, but I see SK's more) who are able to keep aggro better then me, and the cheal chain, supported by modrod 2, can keep them alive.<br>
<br>
From NToV to Ssra, which is what my guild finds challanging and do-able.<br>
<br>
The SK's keep aggro better, which means the raid as a whole can up DPS, and kill faster.<br>
<br>
In fact, the faster kill, means that the SK sometimes actually takes LESS!! mana to heal then the warrior. Not less mana per second, of course, but less mana total, because the fight lasts much longer with a defefensive warrior.<br>
<br>
Yes, this means that warriors are better tanks when mana is an issue, especially if the fight lasts less then 3 miniutes, but that isn't the case, I see, in many NToV/Ssra enounters. Curse takes us betweeen 30-45 miniutes with a warrior, depending on who shows up, and we can shave almost 30% !!!!! off that by using a SK tank and more nuking (Ok, best case scenerio- Usually we only save a few miniutes).<br>
<br>
This is with a warrior with EB off AoW and the SoD2 off Cursed Cycle. (Sorry, drunk ATM, EB off AoW is Blade of Carnage, forget the named of the sword off Cursed cycle with the enchanter nuke).<br>
<br>
Warriors are NOT as good as SK's in higher end encounters, and will not be unless our taunt is upgraded in some manner.<br>
<br>
Yes, I realize, that upping our taunt in this manner might overpower us in terms of breaking into Kael or other encounters that more players are actually at in the game.<br>
<br>
Well, find a way to make us the best tanks in the end game without overpowering us in the almost end game, (assuming you consider Ssra and ST the end game, which really, it isn't, but from what I've heard, it gets worse past that), or find a niche for us that ISN'T where we are supposed to be the best tank anytime.<br>
<br>
Notice, I'm NOT saying invalidate SK's or Pallies as a tank class.  They tank (absorb damage) FINE, but they have a massive amount of taunt that we can't compete with.\<br>
<br>
Let pallies and SK tank EXP groups. Let them tank raids. I don't care about that. Just make it a toss up between bringing another warrior or bringing another pally to a raid. IE, I have 2 level 60 equally equipped equal AAXP point war or pally/sk on the same account- I want to be told, bring either, both add the same value to the raid. NOT don't bring the warrior, we don't need him.<br>
<br>
Right now, in the game I am playing, it is MORE desirable to bring my 53!!! Mage then my 60 warrior. I beleive that this is wrong. This is Ssra and NToV where people under 58 (In my experiance) are not even allowed normally!<br>

I don't see giving the knights that close of a gap to our mitigation, with that there would still be no place for a warrior. We need to be more than just a little ahead. A fine example of what I mean is look at how we are perceived, we are known for our /disc defensive because it puts us more than a bit ahead on mitigation. I feel we should always mitigate damage better as in a very noticeable difference to our knight friends or anyone else. <br>
<br>
Taunt I am unsure of how to fix this problem other than just make what we have actually work on evens and below and maybe diminishing returns as the mobs get higher. Then maybe increase the chances on higher mobs thru AA points.<br>
<br>
I also think our damage table should be looked at but thats another thread.  <p><BR>
