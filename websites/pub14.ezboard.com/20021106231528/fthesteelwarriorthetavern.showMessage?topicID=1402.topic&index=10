I agree *shiver* they need to do something about warriors.. but also, have you realized monks are a leather class? Well guess what, they are, now to my basic logic, Full plate &gt; weak leather armor, so why are monks tanking THAT damn well? They shouldn't be, simple as that.

The necromancers were picking fights with everyone, ranging from magicians to beastlords, and even their own hybrid class - the shadow knight.  And what have monks been doing?

Clerics: clearly stated problem and solution.<br>
Monk:~ we screwed up some items allowing you to become too powerful. We 'can't' recode those items so we're gonna 'adjust' your defensive capabilities to compensate and bring you inline with plate classes.~<br>
<br>
hmmm...<br>
<br>
How do you 'fix' items by changing a class?<br>
What happens if you don't have those items that make you tank like a warrior?<br>
So, now all monks need to get those things to balance themselvs?<br>
Do the monks without those unbalanced items tank like a plate class?<br>
<br>
Ya see where all this hubbub is comin from?<br>
I personally don't play at a level where a monk can outtank me without bein a decent twink, but I still don't see the logic behind admittin what the problem is and then changin somethin else to fix it.<br>

Its true, we the Warrior community have been in secret negotiations with the Verant development staff to get Monks nerfed.  In fact, it was us who orginally convinced Verant to itemize Velious the way they did just so when the nerf came it would be really painful.  <br>
<br>
You see we've always secretly hated Monks.  With their ability to pull a big ass train back to camp and then FD, claiming it wouldn't help anyone for them to die too.  We've always hated how many Monks would rather train the zone than FD, since that would require some actual skill.  We've hated how they pull agro off us and then complain about how 'the Warrior can't taunt'.  Its pissed us off no end that a Monk can pull agro off us simply by waving his hands near the mob's nose, after we've done everything up to and including sacraficing small animals to the gods of taunt to try and keep its attention.<br>
<br>
So we arranged with Verant to let you 'live LARGE' for awhile.  Because we really wanted the nerf to sting.  So we sat there and bided our time, watching your excitement as you got item after item that blew ours out of the water, and we smirked to ourselves, because we KNEW the nerf was coming.  We chuckled as we saw you tank mob after mob that would beat us into senselessness.  We smiled knowningly each time you said in group, 'Ah hell, I'll just tank it, the Warrior can't taunt worth a damn and I'm taking less damage anyway'.  Because we knew this day was coming.<br>
<br>
And so here it is.  Our deeply laid plans have finally, finally born fruit.  We let you monks soar to the heights of glory so we could revel in your misery as you were brought down low.  When this is all done you'll be lucky to out tank a level 10 Druid in mesh armor.  Orc pawns are going to be pushing you around.  Fire beetles will be telling you to get the hell out of the way, because they are coming through.  And you will cower in fear.  Hoping against hope that your FD button won't fail as you try and convince the gorge hound to go bother someone else.<br>
<br>
Our vengence, planned for the last three expansions, will finally put you where you belong.  And we are going to laugh our asses off.<br>
<br>
And if you believe a word of this, then you must also be one of those who also believe that it was always intended for Monks to out tank Warriors in 80% of the situtations.  You must be one of those truly gulible people that teleamarketers just love to get on the phone.  You must be one of those people who believed Enron when they said it was just a few rogue employees.  You friend, must in fact, be high.<br>
<br>
We didn't ask for Verant to nerf Monks.  And since when has Verant listened to us?  We told Verant we wanted them to FIX us, not break someone else.  Hell we even gave them ideas and suggestions on how to fix us, which for their reasons they chose to disregard.  Which is fine, they can do that.  But don't come over to OUR house trying to lay the blame at OUR feet because Verant decides to pull another one out of their *bleep*.<br>

Yes he said he had 3 warriors, no one of them were 50+ and he talk about *cough*taunt problem*cough*. Let me tell you something, taunt is fine before 50.<br>
<br>
He talked of a 53 warrior with lightsaber who couldn't take agro of him and succed with lammy ?? Of course we all know that lammy agro much more than epics....and of course we all know that warrior epic is soooooo easy that every random_53_warrior can get them. I won't even explain how stupid this is. <br>

most leather pieces would put the monk over his weight restriction of 13-22 stone! my monk wore mostly silk stuff ti'll he was about lvl 35ish, <br>
the monks tanking abilities come from avoidance, through skills like blocking and dodging! warriors get the same skills,  but with a warrior blocking is called parry!<br>
monks without these Velious/Luclin items wouldnt be able to tank much past lvl 30ish, simply because silk doesnt have much AC, and monks dont have many HPs, i have 1375 HP, and 950 AC! but im only lvl 44, i have soloed every level since 25! and will continue to so to 50ish<br>
<br>
this ability was given me by VI and its items! without these it would be much harder to solo! <br>
i can also tank...way beyond what a leather wearing class should be able to do,<br>
i wear mostly acrylia reinforced stuff, if i were to sell all my toys i wouldnt get more than 15k out of them!<br>
<br>
however even tho ive been able to solo almost everything dark blue to me since lvl 25! <br>
you will never see me tanking anything raid-able from naggy/vox on up to the sleeper!! it would be suicide!! <br>
<br>
the problem with monks having to tank started when they got the ability to steal aggro from warriors way to easily then whined and bitched about dying a lot...so VI answered in a way the should not have! by making insanely awesome monk useable items! they havent changed the monk class much since the beginning...theyve just made it easier to twink the monk class! <br>
what they should have raised the standard by which they judge every other melee class! <br>
there should be more warrior only items! <br>
they should get a higher taunt than any other class, by double or triple if needs be! <br>
it is my job to deal more dmg than any other melee class!  not take it! <br>
it is a warriors job to Take dmg!! while keeping a steady flow of dmg going! that is why they are called Tanks!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uyod4.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yod4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/13/02 10:12:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1402.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: wow</span><hr size=1> oh hi again. when you have finally passed second grade and get a pass in  punctuations you may come back here and bitch ya <p>Baga Anaraldor

The only real solution was to reduce the tanking abilities of monks.

<br>
Actually, it was a combination of both.  I knew monks were too powerful one day in Ssra back in earlyish Velious when the monk was pulling a snake, rather than bringing him back to the group, he stopped about 20' ahead and started fighting it.   This continued, and became the norm, not with one particular monk, but with monks in general, rather than actually pulling the mob and placing it at the warrior's feet, they tend to stop, and fight an undebuffed, unslowed mob, generally risk free, who gives a crap who's tanking?  Monk?  Warrior?  It doesn't matter.   THIS is a problem, and THIS is why monks are overpowered.   Seeing monks gloating about how they can tank as well or better than warriors, how &quot;screw it, if they can't keep aggro, I'll just tank&quot;, and so on.   Yes, you WERE overpowered in relation to every other melee class, and arguing against that is pointless.<br>

I agree that the problem was primarily one of itemization, but itemization tends to benefit monks through mudflation pretty heavily.   You see, monk only weapons and all/all armor on the market, with the exception of the Fungi Tunic is well, damn cheap.  Even lower level monks have an itemization benefit that cannot be overlooked.  The whole &quot;this is going to affect those who are at the highest levels only&quot; argument wears thin with me, as you get your AC bonus regardless of equipment and monk equipment is easy and cheap to get.  It's been shown here that monks with even generally crappy equipment can come close to the AC of warriors in good equipment, so the argument doesn't ring real true with me.<br>

I sense some exaggeration here, you're better off making your point through realistic examples than exaggerations and fabrication about how you could steal aggro from an epiced 53 warrior.<br>

I don't know about this.  While I agree that boosting the warrior would've produced positive results for the warrior, I'm not so sure how well the results would've fared for the game.

I agree with you, and I think we all tend to agree with you that stupid itemization has screwed warriors more than any other factor in the game, primarily because of warriors' unbalanced reliance on items as the complete source of their power as opposed to all others who have at least SOME non-equipment related power.<br>

I'll make a deal with you, you go over to Monkly business and convince your monklymates(tm) that people can actually have a brain even if their post count is low, and if you convince your monklymates(tm) that the equivalent requirement of having a 60 monk as a prerequisite to having a discussion about monks in elation to other classes in EQ (such as warriors) doesn't exist, THEN you can make nasty comments about how people are &quot;assholes&quot;.

Congrats on choosing the easiest class out there... I guess that speaks volumes of your intelligence and desire to choose the easy path so you dont have too rough a time when those complicated desicions come up, like spell casting. Keep hitting A and Taunt and you will be ok, warriors are a complicated class at higher raid levels, but when dipshits like you play the game, warrior is the perfect class. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Neither is inherently more difficult than the other, warrior HAPPENS to be pretty damn straightforward at low levels, and makes a pretty good n00b class.  I've found the Shadowknight to be the easiest low level class to play though.   Having said that, I'm sure Dan Quayle could pick any class in Everquest and play it, this game isn't overly difficult, and organization isn't even required till the mid 30's, and even then it's no big deal, it's not until you hit raid levels that you actually have to think about anything.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 893<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/13/02 11:31:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1402.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  VI will not fix Warriors</span><hr size=1> That is what you must realize <br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing AC to give it more meaning to adjust monk AC to have less mitigation. <br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing the problems with HPS to change the priest classes and healing spells.<br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing our taunt/aggro problems, to reduce spell aggro so that a few of the classes generated less.<br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing the problems with of being /disc dependant and then having said /disc's not last for an entire fight to reduce the amount of mana and burst DPS in the game so they could readjust fights.<br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing the Warrior to break other classes. <br>
<br>
We know our problems; we know why they are that way and pointed them out. We have tried to have them fixed, and in a sense failed. Warriors are not the people that need to be told this, we know. The people that need to be told this are the people at VI, they are the ones that go in and change the game, and we do not.<br>

I know that since the day I first got my dual weild/double attack I started having a very hard time NOT gaining agro. I think ive mentioned on another topic of how I at 51, in crappy gear and wielding a wus trance stick/kd combo, was able to occasionally steal agro from a 60 warrior weilding that Dain axe without even trying! Of course it didnt happen that often but remember, I was only 51 in inferior gear and weaponry and I was trying my best to AVOID agro!<br>
MY main beef is this insistence of people to call us a silk class. We arent any more a silk class than WARRIORS are! Sure, at lower levels before we can make any money we wear the cloth and silk armor because its all we can loot/afford. If you can think that far back and didnt twink yourself, I bet you warriors did too! Well, maybe you went from cloth to leather but the point remains. I am a non twinked monk. All of my gear I either bought from a tailor or quested for myself. My ac is 965 wearing all that leather and my hp is 1602, give or take. Does that really sound so overpowered? Once again I say, the REAL problem with monks only exists when you have supertwinks or uber guild monks in the best possible equipment. Im still nervous over what this mitigation nerf will do to me and other non twinked, non uber monks like me.<br>

<br>
Whats funny is people think that since thier are wearing plate, and monks are wearing leather, that the monks should get hit any harder. Yeah your 20ac piece of crap plate should do more for you than my 60ac piece of leather. Why do you think its 60ac from a fantasy point of view? Because its 20 feet thick? No you stupid fucks, its because its MAGICAL. When something is magic, who the hell cares if its plate, chain, leather or silk. It could be silk thats got the same properties as plate due to the magical nature. Mitigation should be based completely on your ac, not the type of armor you are allowed to wear. If my ac is 2000 with leather, and yours is 1500 with plate, I should take less damage, it shouldnt matter what class you are, AC is AC. 2000ac on a necro should keep he from taking huge hits alot more than 1500 ac on a warrior. Why, because ac represents how hard it is to get a good hit THRU, not ON someone, in the Everquest environment. Keep chanting &quot;but we use plate, you use leather&quot; like it means anything. Dont harp on the numbers I listed, I know 2000 ac is unrealistic, but its part of the point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uheugel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heugel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/13/02 5:32:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1402.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: wow</span><hr size=1> Everything I ever needed to know about you, I learned from this sentence:<br>

If I'm the warrior in your group, and I have to &quot;steal&quot; aggro from you, there is a huge problem.  Aggro management is everyones responsibility, not just the warrior.  <br>
<br>
Usually, when I come across people who don't understand that, I simply flick off the &quot;Auto-Attack&quot; button and let them decide for themselves how many times they have to get a rez before they learn to control themselves.<br>

MY TURN!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
a monk said this <br>
&quot;&quot;Ideally, monks are restricted to lower ac leather armor, but are trained to take a shot better than a druid. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE ON THE PLATE CLASS MITIGATION TABLES!!&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
lemme ask you a question.  I take a Catholic Priest, and a Navy SEAL, and i stand them next to each other. (priest wearing that black suit thingy with the white collar.  The Navy SEAL wearing a black business suit).<br>
<br>
I go to my car and pull out an AR-15, i shoot the priest in the leg, and i shoot the Navy SEAL in the leg.<br>
<br>
The Navy SEAL is trained to take a hit better than the priest.<br>
<br>
Does he take less damage. (each shot was identical) ?? (rhetorical question)<br>
<br>
They are both wearing cloth &quot;armor&quot; .. so i dont see how training has anything to do with it.  dont matter what you were taught, getting cut with a sword, or shot with an assult rifle hurts the same regarless of training, if you are wearing the same stuff.<br>
<br>
Hence, a Monk should take the same damage as a Druid when some insanely strong beast of a thing splits him over the head with a giant 2 handed whatever.  Or just from a spider bite (poison kills regardless).<br>
<br>
<br>
OK, now i take a Navy SEAL, and another Navy SEAL.  One of them in the same black business suit, and the other in full flak gear.<br>
<br>
I shoot each of them again with the assult rifle.<br>
<br>
The Navy SEAL in the suit well ... hes going to the hospital now.  <br>
<br>
The Navy SEAL in the Flak gear.  He looks around and wonders what shot his friend, as he calls the ambulance.<br>
<br>
