You sanred 20 times, he taunted 20 times.  You still had aggro in melee range, but if you left melee range he had aggro.  This means that your hate levels were siimilar.  Now if you are saying that the first taunt put him on top of the hate list and the next 19 weren't enough to make the mob switch off you in melee I can understand your thought process, but there is no way to determine which taunt actually worked.  <br>
<br>
I in no way believe tuant adds additional hate (other than possible movement to the top of the list) on the scale of sanre, but it does seem to provide another 10dps or so worth of aggro.  That isn't a huge ammount, but sometimes it is enough to make the difference.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=252504" target="top">Xath Carnage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xathcarnage>Xath Carnage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/14/03 8:32:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Taunt button usage</span><hr size=1> Quick Disclaimer:<br>

<br>
I'm going to try to summarize it very simply so we can throw it out and talk about it.<br>
<br>
The mob is beating on you, does this mean you are at the top of the aggro list?<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
It means you're on the top of the aggro list of the people close enough for the mob to beat on without moving his lazy butt.  But people further away could and likely DO have more generated aggro than you, there seems to be a point where the mob sees it as so severe that he needs to do something about it, like move or summon.   Summonning is a good thing in this case because it rids the world of another wizard and you can get on with your merry lives, but moving is incredibly bad.  Ping pong is a bad thing because then YOU are the one high on the aggro list but too far away.<br>
<br>
There seems also to be a time period after summonning that the rules of proximity are overridden.   In other words, for some short amount of time after you're summonned, you have TOTAL control of the mob's position, and can move him at will, he'll follow you no matter what.<br>
<br>
Any other time, you can be tanking a mob, and it's position needs adjustment, and you walk away only for him to turn and beat on someone else, because you seem to have crossed that &quot;hate/proximity&quot; barrier.<br>
<br>
OK, in this type of situation (where a lot of people are doing lots of damage from a long way away), it would seem that mashing is probably most appropriate because on a successful taunt it ensures that you are not only highest on the hate list of those close enough for the mob to care about, but actually places you above EVERYONE else.   In other words, adding numerical hate to you that you wouldn't have otherwise had EVEN IF you have the mob's attention.   <br>
<br>
In a situation where there isn't as much proximity (in tight quarters fighting, or standard experience grouping), it would seem that taunting upon loss of aggro is the most efficient.<br>
<br>
Anyone care to correct me?<br>

<br>
We did the same test 2 or 3 times ideally we would have had a mob that gave a msg everytime taunt was successful though, you are right. <br>
<br>
If I was not in melee range of the mob he was able to taunt succesfully on the first or second taunt everytime.  However if I stopped running and stood there he was not able to taunt the mob off me using 20 taunts. He was able to turn the mob if he attacked for one round with his fists though. So this tells me that one round of melee attacks with your fists adds more hate than 20 taunts. <br>
<br>
Taunt just matches your hate to the top person on the list. It is your attacking right after you taunt that actually turns the mob. I suppose this is why low delay weapons are good for warriors maintaining aggro.<br>

<br>
How is it that I can toss tash, get summoned, but not hit, because the melee are wailing away and getting hammered?<br>
<br>
How is it that a wizard can toss out, say, giant bane and get annihilated?<br>
<br>
-what is the effect of some spells for aggro?  Try to keep the numbers and equations low.  i r trull.<br>
<br>
How does proximity and sitting affect aggro?  Lets look at prox aggro.  If some fumdukker takes aggro off me, all I do to get it back is just sit down and voila! I have it.  Toss in a taunt, a hoof to da nadz, and off we go.<br>
<br>
Explain to me the effect of processing weapons.  The only time I am a masher, per se, these days is when I am tanking and the other side of the mob there is a raft of warriors and rogues with primal weapons.  The 'whose on the top' game goes, the aggro list is refreshed and changes all the time and my ability to maintain aggro is really challenged.  The old tricks like sitting, snarepot, disarm, pumice, etc etc all come out because my ability to maintain aggro purely by slugging it out doesn't cut it.<br>
<br>
What does something like AE taunt do and how does it differ and for how long?<br>
<br>
I haven't really seen these questions answered or factored into  your arguments.<br>

The ability for a mob to summon and attack are on two seperate timers. If the mob is slowed it would be possible for you to get summoned and either:<br>
<br>
a) have a melee taunt off you or otherwise generate more hate then you, or<br>
b) back away from melee range,<br>
<br>
*before* the mob's attack timer reset.<br>

Everything you do be it slash, kick, snare, tash, slow, nuke, etc... has some amount of hate that is generated along with it. Procs serve to do the same thing (although some procs actually lower hate).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What does something like AE taunt do and how does it differ and for how long?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
AE taunt, unlike regular taunt, will always suceed, and of course it hits all the mobs in some particular radius.<br>

Only through experience. Have someone tash or slow or snare a mob, walk up to it, don't attack, just hit your taunt button. After 10 tries if he doesn't turn on you then I think it's safe to assume that the mob is untauntable. After each try have the other person (the one who has agro) try and back out of melee range just to be sure that taunt failed. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viken>Viken</A> at: 1/15/03 11:52:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuggbarg>TuggbarG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/15/03 12:44:45 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://canflag.ptbcanadian.com/images/animated/provii/cf2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Taunt button usage</span><hr size=1> Good answers...thanks. <p>Tuggbar Gruntbar<br>

If if the mob doesn't see invis you can test it that way too.  I tested the new Cazic Thule this way when it first came out.  Invised myself, and walked up to the first few mobs tuanting away.  Tuanted at least 30 times.

Bad habit. <br>
<br>
But recently with this post I have shifted my style to only taunt when the mob turned. I haven't noticed a significant increase in holding aggro with or without mashing, which leads me to believe taunt shouldnt be used unless the mob turns away from you. I found that by not mashing I could control aggro much more easier. When a mob turned to attack the chanter Id taunt once and he would turn right away back to attack me. <br>
<br>
IMO I think taunt isnt a tool to BUILD / INCREASE aggro, it only serves to regain lost aggro.<br>
<br>
At any rate I think taunt is best used without mashing it every time it pops up. Mashing will not build aggro any more then hitting it occasionally. And you need to be able to hit taunt when the mob turns, so having it mashed all the time really does no good.<br>
<br>
ANyway just my 2cp. Mashing bad. Smart taunting good.<br>

Nope sorry if I am mashing the button continously at the beginning of a fight and the cleric does a CH when mob is just barely hurt, or wizard drops a nuke to early, taunt is usually not available so the mobs move right to the cleric or wizzie then you have to chase them and taunt them off.  It still works, I protect my casters but it takes twice as long to chase down the mob and retake taunt than it does to grab taunt back before they can move cause your taunt is available for use, immediately.<br>
<br>
As someone else said, <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But recently with this post I have shifted my style to only taunt when the mob turned. I haven't noticed a significant increase in holding aggro with or without mashing, which leads me to believe taunt shouldnt be used unless the mob turns away from you. I found that by not mashing I could control aggro much more easier. When a mob turned to attack the chanter Id taunt once and he would turn right away back to attack me<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I too was a masher till reading this thread and then I started waiting.  I think it works better if for no other reason than there is no chance you have to chase down the mob to regain taunt cause taunt was not available. Obviously if taunt fails you still have to chase them down and beat them senseless for their audacity.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Stay of me caster's</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Warlord Joddi aka Little Dove<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Doc's Pet Tank<br>

One would be when a chanter dies and a bard immediately mezzes 3 mobs to save the party. The second is when a chanter keeps 8+ mobs mezzed to save the party. The third, and my favorite, are very well placed taunts (I'm bias). <br>
<br>
For Instance, I pull a mob. I run back to the party, and stand next to the shaman (prevents ping pong). The mob reaches me and the party. 90% of warriors at this point feel an unresistable urge to start mashing the taunt button. Lets call it the Turge. The turge is an evil thing, a bad thing. avoid the turge. The turge is your enemy. The turge is also your casters' enemy. The mob reaches me, and i resist the turge. I look at my text window and see that my shaman starts to cast a spell. I know what that spell is. I know that when the shaman lands that slow in the next 2 seconds, the mob will turn from me to the shaman. but im ready. i resisted the turge. the very instant that i see that slow hit the mob, i finally hit taunt. The mob turns to me without ever touching the shaman. The mob looks to have done what amounts to a double take. He looked at the shammy and then immediately back at me. This is what you should see in your window:<br>
<br>
Shammy begins to cast a spell<br>
A mob hits you for x damage<br>
A mob bashes you for x damage<br>
A mob hits you for x damage<br>
A mob Yawns.<br>
You taunt a mob to ignore everyone and attack you!<br>
<br>
    How could i do this?? How could I land that taunt exactly after the shammy landed the slow? My friends, I resisted the turge, and taunt was ready to use when it was needed. I didnt taunt as soon as the mob returned. Why would I? I already have agro. And because taunt wasnt already spent for a precious 5 seconds, I was ready to use it as skillfully as a surgeon uses his knife.<br>
<br>
Half of this is about saving the shaman 2 bubbles of health because you didnt waste your taunt when the mob reached your party. The second half, my friends, is simple finesse. <br>
<br>
The moral of this story, is to resist the turge, and to anticipate the very second when that slow is gonna land, or any other large agro spell for that matter. With a group that knows what they are doing, I think the slow is the only time you can expect to so blatently lose agro. The turge is bad. its evil. Avoid turging at all cost. Your slowers will just love you for it.<br>

Well, there are multiples answers to that question but 1 key element is range.<br>
<br>
This coupled with other stuff, lead to this statement : The mob CAN be attacking you while OTHERS are on TOP of the HATE LIST.<br>
<br>
The exact mechanism behind that are still kinda unclear.  Could be with a separate list based on the hate list + the modifier like aggro spells, range, sit, snare, etc.<br>
<br>
This stuff is only visible to the tank when someone &quot;overaggro&quot; and the mob summon, pong or switch to another tank.  What is invisible is all the other time that that non-tank was close to over-aggroing but did'nt.  <br>
<br>
Now, we have to assume for now that a successfull taunt will put you on taunt of the actual hate list and not on top of the modified hate list.  This is kinda hard to prove but I'll think about it.<br>
<br>
With this single assumption, the best solution is to taunt all the time when you are tanking *mash*.  It is only worth it to wait for a specific spell when that spell is inc now or else you just lost a chance to gain enough aggro from a previous cast to prevent overaggro instead of taunt after the overaggro has happened.<br>

Who cares if there is one list, or there is a modified list. It doesn't matter if your cousins's middle name is george, and It certainly doesn't matter if on every third wednesday a third and fourth list is created just for the hell of it. All that matters is this: If you taunt, and the taunt is successful, and you are as close to the mob as possible, you will get agro. period. Beyond that very very simple fact, you have two choices left:<br>
<br>
1.) You can *mash* the taunt button while you -already- have agro, leaving casters vulnerable until it refreshes.<br>
<br>
a.) If its a melee that keeps getting agro, its his responsibility to stop taking agro, not yours to keep mashing taunt.<br>
b.) If its a caster that got agro, and they are moderately competant, they will see their mistake, and fix it.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
2.) Use the taunt button as soon as you lose agro. (the definition of the taunt skill.)<br>
<br>
Maybe its because im a gemini, or maybe its because my real name is Rob, but i believe #2 is not only the most efficient way to use this skill, but also the most usefull. *Mashing* taunt removes the little control you have and leaves it up to statistics. Saving taunt for when it needs to be used puts -you- in control of the situation, the relative control that VI gives you anyways. I see no other way.<br>

I understand what you are saying about proximity aggro. It is an excellent theory, and deserves testing. Get some friends and see if you can come up with something.  Until you can develop some evidence for this theory I am going to have to stick in the NO MASH camp.<br>
