I am going to try to be as objective as possible during this paper as I plan on using it for my Warrior Website when it’s done.<br>
<br>
Now, as an overview you will see me describe time a lot in this paper.  This is because time is the only real commodity that you have in the game.  You can be as powerful as the guild leader for Fires of Heaven. It’s just a matter of applied time to the game.  Anything that saves you time means you can get to that point faster.  <br>
<br>
First of all, there are 3 phases that warriors go through.  These are defined as <br>
Early Game (levels 1-10 roughly)<br>
Mid Game (levels 11-20 roughly)<br>
End Game (levels 20+)<br>
<br>
Now these phases are described here<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=123&t=001394">forums.castersrealm.com/c...3&t=001394</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
and can be researched further if you are interested in knowing how damage output is calculated though those levels.<br>
<br>
There are a few points that I will describe as points that we are looking in a warrior race.  There are some advantages that are truly useful and some that are not quite as useful.  Now every race makes a good warrior, its just that some races have advantages that others don’t.<br>
<br>
1 – Regeneration<br>
Overview<br>
This is a very useful tool.  This post will give you some good numbers that describe the effects of regeneration.  Regeneration saves time.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=123&t=001363">forums.castersrealm.com/c...3&t=001363</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Early Game<br>
During the early game regeneration is an invaluable tool.  The ability to heal quickly will allow for you to solo longer than other warriors, which will push you though the low levels quickly.<br>
Mid Game<br>
Regeneration is still a useful tool, but not as useful as it once was.  While it will not save your life it will help when you have not been able to get a healer in the party.<br>
End Game<br>
Regeneration is still useful in the high end game, but its more of a use to save ticks off the healers mana than a real lifesaver.  Regeneration is not really as useful for soloing as with you will have 2,000 – 3,000 hit points.<br>
<br>
2 -  Immune to Slam from the front<br>
Overview <br>
This is a good tool.  This advantage will allow for you pull multiple mobs and not spend your time spinning in circles while the enchanter gets the mobs under wraps.  This also increases your damage output as while another tank would be spinning in circles, you never stop swinging.  <br>
Low Game – Mid Game – End Game<br>
This skill will really have the same usefulness throughout your life as a warrior, so it is not worth mentioning any further. <br>
<br>
3 – XP Bonus<br>
Overview<br>
This is just a description that some races will level faster than others.  This is very important because if you can level faster than another race that is less time you must spend playing the game to get the character you want.  The only race to get a bonus are halflings, the only race to get a penalty are ogres, trolls, iskar and barbarians.<br>
Low Game – Medium Game – End Game<br>
This will really have the same usefulness throughout your life as a warrior, so it is not worth mentioning any further.<br>
<br>
4 – Bashing<br>
Overview <br>
It’s possible to ghetto bash to accomplish a very similar result, but if you do not have to spend time with the ghetto bash, then it saves you time and energy.  Ghetto bashing will probably eventually be beat about the head with the nurf stick eventually so while we will mention it, it will not be a substitute for the slam ability<br>
Early Game – Mid Game <br>
At the low and mid game, this is a useful skill because it will allow for you to stun your target.  This will result in the mob doing less attacks on you, and saving your healer mana.  As its takes time to get mana back, it makes your warrior more efficient.<br>
End Game<br>
Kick will eventually cause a stunning effect as well, making it a bit more on par with slam.<br>
The skill caps for slam are significantly higher than kick.  Skill caps have a direct correlation on your effeteness, which has been proven though warriors deleveling their characters and using superior skills on other opponents.  (note, this exploit has been fixed by Verant)  This means that slam is still better than kick even at the higher levels.<br>
<br>
5 – Warrior Stats<br>
Overview<br>
Some races get higher stats in the primary stats for warriors (Strength and Stamina) than other races do.  This significantly impacts warriors in the Low and Mid game, but has much less impact on the End for warriors.<br>
Early Game<br>
At this stage, the difference in stats is remarkable.  An ogre with a 150 strength is hitting on average for nine points of damage with his newbie weapon, while a gnome is hitting for 2 or 3.  The ogre is able to tear though his newbie zone, saving him time.<br>
Mid Game<br>
The high strength warriors still have a clear advantage through this phase.  The damage cap can actually be exceeded by warriors with a high enough strength, which not only will leave other warriors stunned in surprise, but will add to damage output and allow for faster leveling.<br>
End Game<br>
At this point, strength becomes less of an issue.  The bonus it gives in damage output becomes much less, and it becomes more of a supplemental stat than a primary stat.  It will allow for the warrior to carry more weight without being encumbered which is an advantage.<br>
Stamina becomes more useful at this level as a 50th warrior with a 169 stamina has 2400 hit points while the warrior with a 78 stamina only has 2050 hit points.  While most people will say that 350 hit points is not very many, it is enough to note down.<br>
<br>
7 – Vision<br>
Overview<br>
This is not much of an issue, but should be addressed.  The two races in focus will be dark elves, humans and barbarians.<br>
Early game<br>
This has a huge impact on the early game of an adventurer.  As light sources are hard to come across, most adventures will be struggling early in their career.  Even with a light stone it’s very hard to get by during the black of night.<br>
Dark elves, on the other hand will have an easy time picking out targets from far off at night, which increases their ability to level.<br>
Mid Game<br>
By this point, your guildmates and friends should be getting some infravision spells which make your life much easier.<br>
Again, dark elves have an easy time finding targets.  They also get the advantage of not being able to tell any difference between day and night when they are adventuring.<br>
End Game<br>
By this point, you will have gotten some items that will give you the vision of other races.  The only problem left will be when you are on corpse recovery and you will have difficulty finding your way through a zone to get back to your corpse.<br>
Dark elves, of course, have an easy time getting back to their corpse.<br>
<br>
8 – Style<br>
Overview<br>
This is the most important reason to choose your race.   If your race looks cool, and your happy with it, the rest will fall into place.  <br>
<br>
As a footnote, there are a few other skills which are due credit to mention, but do not impact your ability as a warrior.  <br>
Forage will grant a warrior the ability to easily find fruits and berries to make wine with.  As your sta bar does not matter when you have a STA of over 100, being hungry is a moot point.  Forage is also useful when its bugged by VI and you can forage cobolt armour when you are in seblis <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Swimming is nice, and helps the early warrior.  Most swimming skill can be gotten very easily by hunting in lake rathe or any area that has a great deal of water.<br>
Hiding is a useful skill, however warriors should be hiding very rarely.  Also as hide is not a guaranteed success, the usefulness of this skill is quite questionable.<br>
<br>
More to come later...<br>
