<br>
Wanted to throw something out there, which is an interesting concept.<br>
<br>
We see all the time &quot;New on Test&quot; yadda yadda, and then the standard speculation, discussions, posturing, and so on and so forth.  <br>
<br>
Also, we see from time to time some change that goes to live servers where people are going &quot;wtf?&quot;.  Unfortunately, when something goes to live servers, it's less likely to change/be altered, and so on.  I've seen some ponderings from VI from time to time expressing frustration over peoples' unwillingness to test things, yet complain about them once they hit the live servers, even to the point of offering certain &quot;incentives&quot; to those who spend a certain number of /played days on test.<br>
<br>
This got me thinking.... scary isn't it?<br>
<br>
Well, I think that the failure of the test server system is that not enough vocal people are playing on the server and actually &quot;test&quot;ing things, giving limited feedback on the poential changes.<br>
<br>
What the current form of &quot;test&quot; server has become is really twofold:  <br>
<br>
1. A server which is a &quot;Haven&quot;, a culture of being &quot;different&quot; from 'proddy' servers, less players who are more tightly knit than regular servers, less politics, less races, backstabbing, spawn jumping, yadda yadda.  This was affeced greatly during the &quot;great item wipe&quot; as tons flocked to Production servers after losing trust in VI that their rewards would remain theirs.  A new generation of &quot;testies&quot; has grown from the rubble, and it's again a &quot;haven&quot; server, just with lots of downtime, and the issues surrounding a server which is specifically designed to be for Beta testing tweaks, alterations, changes, etc.<br>
<br>
2. A place to go to for those who have main characters on production servers when either those servers are down, or to check new stuff out.   A lot of people have toons on test who are levels 1-9.<br>
<br>
The difficulty with both of these is that some people (myself included) REALLY want to help out in the testing of new ideas (such as the shield thing), yet our hands are tied, because testing how something would affect raiding, the high level game, delicate class balances, and so on requires one to raise a character to level 60 on that server, no small task mind you.  Well, it turns out that I don't really *want* to duplicate my efforts and take the time to raise another toon on the test server just so that I can help VI determine if changes have strengths or weaknesses, and I'm not really thrilled about having people who don't suffer from the same issues that I do on my crowded production server do it either.<br>
<br>
What *should* happen though is that players should be able to &quot;playtest&quot; on a test server using their existing toons in a risk free AND reward free environment, simply &quot;playtesting&quot;.  Mind you, this would change the nature of the server, and I don't think that it would be good for the server as a server, whcih is why probably a 2nd &quot;test server&quot; would be a good idea, but geez, why not go &quot;The following changes are on test&quot; and instead of us complaining about changes which we're unfamiliar with, let us experience those changes and give appropriate feedback while fighting *real* mobs, yet not advancing or losing any power on our regular servers?<br>
<br>
People are constantly complaining about the lack of high end content, and that it's &quot;not really just about the loot, just something to do&quot;.  Well duh, how about something to do being to log your guild onto test2 and try some of the changes, giving some feedback. <br>
<br>
I'm not advocating changing the current test server, because it does have it's purpose, but you'd get a LOT more valuable feedback if you let people test things for themselves without spending the time to raise another toon to raidable/high end levels.<br>

Kailyn - No offense but do a movelog next server split if you want more phat lewt. People seem to be under the impression that high end mobs aren't killed on Test by people who have earned their way. /chuckle<br>
<br>
I play on Test but I am not a Tester. Nothing I say or any feedback I give will matter. VI respects the game &quot;mystery&quot; (or at least they did for the two years I was a guide). If they still desire to have some element of surprise left to the game, they won't be asking just anyone to Test.<br>

I totally understand and appreciate your position of being there, and knowing much better than I do what the higher end is like on Test than me, I have some friends on Test and log on from time to time and yak it up with them.<br>
<br>
My understanding is that mobs stay up a LOT longer on Test than on Production servers (most raid level mobs are dead within 12-24 hours of a patch).  If I'm wrong, please point it out from your experience, as I fully admit to being a little ignorant on this topic.  What I'm getting at though is that there should be a mechanism which allows players to &quot;playtest&quot; changes and give feedback without the need to level a toon to 60 to do so on another server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ujustfive.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Just Five</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 297<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/3/02 8:45:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &quot;New on Test&quot;...Why this doesn't work</span><hr size=1> Frod - You haven't given one name of one of these &quot;friends&quot; so I wouldn't know how accurate they could be. <br>
<br>
Comparing a test patch to a production server patch is completely inaccurate. Folks doesn't race to spawns to beat out other guilds because <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the server is dropped constantly.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ONE, THREE... NINE, TEN, TWELVE TIMES A DAY and we are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> on the 1-20, like everyone else,</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> so how could mobs be up for days on end when the server isn't up for that long most of the time?<br>

<br>
Of course many people won't play heavily on the test server because of the risks involved with a server wipe.  And of course as Five points out, the down time seems excessive.  So who knows if this would attract more people to the test server.  And does Verant really want more people on the test server?  Because if they did, wouldn't they be coming up with these ideas? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/urobokeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RobokEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/3/02 10:39:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &quot;New on Test&quot;...Why this doesn't work</span><hr size=1> An entire guild was moved, recently, from my server to the test.

Apply to be a &quot;tester&quot; on a test server with most of the guide abilities. For playing at least 10 hours (number could be changed- just a random amount) you save 3-6$ out of the 12.50.  It would be limited to about   400 (or however many people on test there are) but It would be a WHOLE NEW server. that way people on current test won't loose their work.<br>
<br>
But then you get the morons that BS their way through the application and go and make an uber level 60 toon on the test server and run rampant on everyone there. Right now the test server is there for shits and giggles. &quot;Yay our server is down almost everyday! lets play here!&quot;. I know people like to play on the test server (for whatever reason) but there should be some Incentive to be a tester for verant.<br>

<br>
When they allowed live server players to copy over to Pendragon, it became a way to get two full respecs so you could be a l33t haxxor on your home server. &quot;Testing&quot; on Pendragon degraded into dueling in the frontier zones, and a huge influx of rude people with little or no respect for the locals caused me to quit (the first time).<br>
<br>
I don't know if it would be the same on Everquest, Five would be able to judge that more accurately than I do, but I suspect it would. On the same note, I think that the &quot;Test&quot; server should be just that, and perhaps some action should be taken.<br>
<br>
But again, my input means little, because I don't play EQ to test, that's what DAoC is for. The input of TEST players should be what is weighted the most in this kind of decision. Their lives are effected by it the most dramatically. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/cons RED</span><br>  Posts: 325<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/3/02 5:07:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &quot;New on Test&quot;...Why this doesn't work</span><hr size=1> I can see that.

<br>
Let's assume, for those true cynics who doubt, that Verant DOES want to make this a better game. Now lets say TALIC owns Verant and is in charge of everything.<br>
<br>
I'm having a hard time wording this, so bear with me:<br>
<br>
A single &quot;Test department head&quot; who receives all reports from &quot;class testers&quot; and pieces them together to see the full extent of a certain patch and its effects on gameplay.<br>
<br>
Class testers, one for each class, who are given free reign with items/level etc. These testers should be on the payroll for TaliVerant, as their testing is rather extensive. They should be able to have a 'testing team' of volunteers from the live servers who have extensive knowledge of their class. In the end, there should be enough people on this server to do high, low, and mid-grade activities to test the full range of patch-day alterations.<br>
<br>
A testing team, as mentioned above, of dedicated players who have proven themselves as worthy of the position. Individuals capable of playing their class in a multitiude of situations and able to rationally perceive the effects of nerfs/additions to not only themselves but OTHER CLASSES. <br>
<br>
After this, the patch could be sent to the current test server, where it could be tested by the general populace. A filter, so to speak.<br>
<br>
END PLAY TIME.<br>
<br>
At the moment, Test on EQ (and in DAoC, my ever-present example) is a place to pop in and &quot;see the new changes&quot; ahead of time, not a place to test. The truly dedicated to testing would make it onto the testing server, and those who wanted to check out things in a more leisurely fashion could log onto test. And in turn, this doesn't *really* harm the people on Test anyway, because of course the ones who wanted to test would make it onto the exclusive server.<br>
<br>
Now, beat it down, tear it up, revise it. Make a finished product out of my drivel, and send it to Verant when its been hashed out. I'm interested in seeing where you folks go with this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ujustfive.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Just Five</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 298<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/4/02 7:44:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reply</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Right now the test server is there for shits and giggles.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Glad hard working people on Test can provide some folks with &quot;shits and giggles&quot; while paying for our own accounts and playing in an environment that few have the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> maturity</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to deal with.<br>
<br>
How about this?  We could <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> gasp</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> stfu and go play the game, leaving VI alone with this issue.  VI doesn't care that some 14 year old boy wants to copy a character to Test for pHAt lewt.

<br>
I'll piss off about oh... 20+ people with this post. Guess what? Don't care. Lots o' folks think they are clever and oh! only they will think of new stuff. Get over it. There are many, many knowledgable people testing on Test, with many friends in first tier guilds across all the servers.<br>

That being the case I completely withdraw any comments I might have made implying that I would be willing to help TEST things from time to time, because that obviously is completely undesirable in any shape or form.

I think you're missing the point, Test server IS used for testing.  Not by the entire population of test, but there are certain people/guilds that do testing on test.  Test server is not another production server, but we have many of the same characteristsics, i.e. guilds, raiding, community.  Being able to copy over any level 60 character you want to test would destroy the integrity of the server.  Much the same way people being able to copy any level 60 they wanted to a production server would be.  <br>
<br>
The truth is, if people were allowed to copy their characters over to test, 99% of the people that did so would have no motivation to do actual 'testing'.  They would soon get bored, and either leave, or run around like a chicken with their heads cut off, doing things they could not do on a production for fear of the consequences.   <p><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3240">Bjorne</a> Warlord of <a href="http://www.primalbrood.org">Primal Brood</a>

The people I raid with are asked to test for GMs all the time (from the highest end raid content to the smallest bugs).  Hell, just last week I worked directly with a GM on five new bugs.  <br>
<br>
We don't hit every public message board under the sun crying bloody murder over every change because we don't have to.  We have a friendly, respectful relationship with GMs and as such have their ear when problems arise.<br>
<br>
Test is very top heavy with level 60s who raid in the end game as it is, there is no need whatsoever to add any more.  If anything, we need more low level testers.<br>
<br>
When we have problems with something, the GMs know about it.  Ultimately, everything's up to them, though.  Sure, we miss things from time to time, and some things may be fine on test but not work on live servers for whatever reason (ring of Vulak, for example), and some times a bug makes it live no matter how many times we bring it up (usually because it's minor and they don't feel it neccessary to delay a patch over), but the test server does far more good than we get credit for. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2819" target="_blank">
