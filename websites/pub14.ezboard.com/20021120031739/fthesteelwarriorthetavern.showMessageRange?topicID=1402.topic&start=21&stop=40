The only real solution was to reduce the tanking abilities of monks.

<br>
Actually, it was a combination of both.  I knew monks were too powerful one day in Ssra back in earlyish Velious when the monk was pulling a snake, rather than bringing him back to the group, he stopped about 20' ahead and started fighting it.   This continued, and became the norm, not with one particular monk, but with monks in general, rather than actually pulling the mob and placing it at the warrior's feet, they tend to stop, and fight an undebuffed, unslowed mob, generally risk free, who gives a crap who's tanking?  Monk?  Warrior?  It doesn't matter.   THIS is a problem, and THIS is why monks are overpowered.   Seeing monks gloating about how they can tank as well or better than warriors, how &quot;screw it, if they can't keep aggro, I'll just tank&quot;, and so on.   Yes, you WERE overpowered in relation to every other melee class, and arguing against that is pointless.<br>

<br>
I agree that the problem was primarily one of itemization, but itemization tends to benefit monks through mudflation pretty heavily.   You see, monk only weapons and all/all armor on the market, with the exception of the Fungi Tunic is well, damn cheap.  Even lower level monks have an itemization benefit that cannot be overlooked.  The whole &quot;this is going to affect those who are at the highest levels only&quot; argument wears thin with me, as you get your AC bonus regardless of equipment and monk equipment is easy and cheap to get.  It's been shown here that monks with even generally crappy equipment can come close to the AC of warriors in good equipment, so the argument doesn't ring real true with me.<br>

I don't know about this.  While I agree that boosting the warrior would've produced positive results for the warrior, I'm not so sure how well the results would've fared for the game.  There has to be a point where you go &quot;gee, if we increase this one by 10% and decrease this one by 10%, it'll have the desired result without so much negatively affecting the game.<br>

<br>
I agree with you, and I think we all tend to agree with you that stupid itemization has screwed warriors more than any other factor in the game, primarily because of warriors' unbalanced reliance on items as the complete source of their power as opposed to all others who have at least SOME non-equipment related power.<br>

I'll make a deal with you, you go over to Monkly business and convince your monklymates(tm) that people can actually have a brain even if their post count is low, and if you convince your monklymates(tm) that the equivalent requirement of having a 60 monk as a prerequisite to having a discussion about monks in elation to other classes in EQ (such as warriors) doesn't exist, THEN you can make nasty comments about how people are &quot;assholes&quot;.

Why is it then, that whenever someone starts playing EQ for the first time, people almost always suggest playing a warrior to learn the newbie ropes? It must be because they are so hard to learn. Your sig should say &quot;If Dan Quayle played Everquest, he would DEFINATELY be a warrior.&quot; I usually dont point out other classes as being crummy or easy, but since you decided to post a tidbit that hints monks are so easy that a dumbass like Dan Quayle would be one instigated my reply to you. Congrats on choosing the easiest class out there... I guess that speaks volumes of your intelligence and desire to choose the easy path so you dont have too rough a time when those complicated desicions come up, like spell casting. Keep hitting A and Taunt and you will be ok, warriors are a complicated class at higher raid levels, but when dipshits like you play the game, warrior is the perfect class. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Neither is inherently more difficult than the other, warrior HAPPENS to be pretty damn straightforward at low levels, and makes a pretty good n00b class.  I've found the Shadowknight to be the easiest low level class to play though.   Having said that, I'm sure Dan Quayle could pick any class in Everquest and play it, this game isn't overly difficult, and organization isn't even required till the mid 30's, and even then it's no big deal, it's not until you hit raid levels that you actually have to think about anything.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uvaraho1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varaho1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>will kick your @$$</span><br>  Posts: 893<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/13/02 11:31:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1402.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  VI will not fix Warriors</span><hr size=1> That is what you must realize <br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing AC to give it more meaning to adjust monk AC to have less mitigation. <br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing the problems with HPS to change the priest classes and healing spells.<br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing our taunt/aggro problems, to reduce spell aggro so that a few of the classes generated less.<br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing the problems with of being /disc dependant and then having said /disc's not last for an entire fight to reduce the amount of mana and burst DPS in the game so they could readjust fights.<br>
<br>
They chose instead of fixing the Warrior to break other classes. <br>
<br>
We know our problems; we know why they are that way and pointed them out. We have tried to have them fixed, and in a sense failed. Warriors are not the people that need to be told this, we know. The people that need to be told this are the people at VI, they are the ones that go in and change the game, and we do not.<br>

I know that since the day I first got my dual weild/double attack I started having a very hard time NOT gaining agro.

Of course it didnt happen that often but remember, I was only 51 in inferior gear and weaponry and I was trying my best to AVOID agro!<br>
MY main beef is this insistence of people to call us a silk class. We arent any more a silk class than WARRIORS are! Sure, at lower levels before we can make any money we wear the cloth and silk armor because its all we can loot/afford. If you can think that far back and didnt twink yourself, I bet you warriors did too! Well, maybe you went from cloth to leather but the point remains. I am a non twinked monk. All of my gear I either bought from a tailor or quested for myself. My ac is 965 wearing all that leather and my hp is 1602, give or take. Does that really sound so overpowered? Once again I say, the REAL problem with monks only exists when you have supertwinks or uber guild monks in the best possible equipment. Im still nervous over what this mitigation nerf will do to me and other non twinked, non uber monks like me.<br>

Wow, lemme see if I can explain myself again..<br>
<br>
Monks are a leather class. (the only pure melee leather class right? rogues are chain yes?)<br>
Ideally, monks are restricted to lower ac leather armor, but are trained to take a shot better than a druid. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE ON THE PLATE CLASS MITIGATION TABLES!!<br>
<br>
please read the previous paragraph again.<br>
<br>
Monks are not blessed with the pure toughness of warriors, so they have fewer hit points.<br>
So, monks are supposed to wear lighter armor with less ac, take hits like warriors while being able to dodge more cause they're restricted to, what 17 weight? But they can't take as many hits as warriors cause they're short on hp.<br>
<br>
Monks are supposed to be low ac / hp weight restricted melee.<br>
<br>
Now add a bunch of high ac / +hp low weight gear to the game and what happens?<br>

Unless of course VI manages to nerf a class while only affecting the people wearin a bunch of high ac/+hp gear.<br>
/rolls eyes. wonder if that'll happen?<br>

So, yeah Shelrabbi, I know what a mitigation table is. I think I understand why monks are on it. ya melon headed dipstick.<br>

<br>
Whats funny is people think that since thier are wearing plate, and monks are wearing leather, that the monks should get hit any harder. Yeah your 20ac piece of crap plate should do more for you than my 60ac piece of leather. Why do you think its 60ac from a fantasy point of view? Because its 20 feet thick? No you stupid fucks, its because its MAGICAL. When something is magic, who the hell cares if its plate, chain, leather or silk. It could be silk thats got the same properties as plate due to the magical nature. Mitigation should be based completely on your ac, not the type of armor you are allowed to wear. If my ac is 2000 with leather, and yours is 1500 with plate, I should take less damage, it shouldnt matter what class you are, AC is AC. 2000ac on a necro should keep he from taking huge hits alot more than 1500 ac on a warrior. Why, because ac represents how hard it is to get a good hit THRU, not ON someone, in the Everquest environment. Keep chanting &quot;but we use plate, you use leather&quot; like it means anything. Dont harp on the numbers I listed, I know 2000 ac is unrealistic, but its part of the point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ushikariiapoccalypse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shikarii Apoccalypse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>All in the reflexes</BR>Guardian of the Bunker</BR>STEEL WARRIOR Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1990<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/13/02 5:12:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1402.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.wingkong.net/Images/minijak.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: you dont make a warrior a tank by nurfing other Classes!</span><hr size=1> i think the funniest part of this whole conversation is that in the minds of some of the inhabitants of Norrath and Luclin <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WARRIORS ARE THE KEY CODERS OF THE GAME AND WE ARE THE ONES TO BLAME FOR THIS PATCH AND HAVE EXECUTED JEDI MIND TRICKS IN ORDER TO SWAY THE TIDES OF NERF IN OUR FAVOR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>

If I'm the warrior in your group, and I have to &quot;steal&quot; aggro from you, there is a huge problem.  Aggro management is everyones responsibility, not just the warrior.  <br>
<br>
Usually, when I come across people who don't understand that, I simply flick off the &quot;Auto-Attack&quot; button and let them decide for themselves how many times they have to get a rez before they learn to control themselves.<br>

<br>
Monk only weapons like what?<br>
<br>
Master Wu's Trance Stick? 7/18, not very good ratio. Doesn't proc much. Lammy has better ratio and currently is cheaper.<br>
<br>
Bear Fanged Glove? 7/19. Not very good ratio.<br>
<br>
Fist of Rock? See Wu stick. And people still charge too much for this in bazaar.<br>
<br>
Cane of the Tranquil? Heh, if you all loved the CoT so much, you could use it too.<br>
<br>
Fireclaw Talons? Baaaaaad ratio. Proc doesn't salvage it.<br>
<br>
Stave of Shielding? Maybe. But pallies can use this too, so it's not technically monk only.<br>
<br>
Knuckledusters? These are VERY good. Ratio is amazing. But by level 56, monk NAKED FISTS are this good. When they appeared in Kunark, they were really just a slight upgrade to what a lot of people were using and only for a short time.<br>
<br>
Whitened Treant Fists? I don't know too many monks that use these.<br>
<br>
Mythril Knuckles? Eh, 13/28 with a nice proc, but not too many monks use them. More a beastlord weapon.<br>
<br>
Adamantite Club? Usually sell for 12k on my server. Not quite cheap.<br>
<br>
Goranga Spiked Club? I see as many warriors with this as monks. Though the price is quite nice I will grant you.<br>
<br>
Zekhas' Katar, Gold Inlaid Ulak, and Kashek's Katar are pretty damn expensive, so I hope you don't mean them.<br>
<br>
Jade Mace? A warrior can use this if they so desired.<br>
<br>
Fighting Baton? A classic. Heh. If you were referring to the FB ... well, just nostalgia's gonna make me say, yes you are correct. Monks with FBs are insanely broken. But that's cause it's Fighting Baton and it drops off of lumpy goo! LUMPY GOOOOOOOOOOOOO I say!<br>
<br>
Or were you referring to 2handers? Because you know warriors have an amazing selection of 2hand weapons right now.<br>
<br>
Peacebringer, Imbued Fighters Staff both may be quite inexpensive, but for every Peacebringer I see selling for 6k on my server I see a black acrylia halberd for the same price. For every IFS for 10k, I see a reaver for 10k.<br>
<br>
And Tae Ew War Maul can be used by both classes.<br>
<br>
Tranquil Staff, which is usually the monk twink weapon of choice, is much like the Fungi ... NOT CHEAP.<br>
<br>
&quot;Even lower level monks have an itemization benefit that cannot be overlooked. &quot;<br>
<br>
The reason this perceived itemization benefit exists is simpe: Monk fists. Before Kunark they were some of the best weapons in the game. To get monks ON to the &quot;we need to upgrade our weapons as we progress through this game&quot; boat like the rest of the classes, Kunark had to introduce weapons to monks that would be better than their fists. <br>
<br>
Which means monks have consistently received weapons slightly better than other classes because when they were forced to start using weapons they had INHERENTLY already been using slightly better weapons.<br>
<br>
And warriors can get very effective weapons in their lower levels for very little cash due to the bazaar.<br>
<br>
Everything from Langseax for under 20 plat to Centi Longsword (a damage machine on ratio alone) for under 1500.<br>

MY TURN!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
a monk said this <br>
&quot;&quot;Ideally, monks are restricted to lower ac leather armor, but are trained to take a shot better than a druid. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE ON THE PLATE CLASS MITIGATION TABLES!!&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
lemme ask you a question.  I take a Catholic Priest, and a Navy SEAL, and i stand them next to each other. (priest wearing that black suit thingy with the white collar.  The Navy SEAL wearing a black business suit).<br>
<br>
I go to my car and pull out an AR-15, i shoot the priest in the leg, and i shoot the Navy SEAL in the leg.<br>
<br>
The Navy SEAL is trained to take a hit better than the priest.<br>
<br>
Does he take less damage. (each shot was identical) ?? (rhetorical question)<br>
<br>
They are both wearing cloth &quot;armor&quot; .. so i dont see how training has anything to do with it.  dont matter what you were taught, getting cut with a sword, or shot with an assult rifle hurts the same regarless of training, if you are wearing the same stuff.<br>
<br>
Hence, a Monk should take the same damage as a Druid when some insanely strong beast of a thing splits him over the head with a giant 2 handed whatever.  Or just from a spider bite (poison kills regardless).<br>
<br>
<br>
OK, now i take a Navy SEAL, and another Navy SEAL.  One of them in the same black business suit, and the other in full flak gear.<br>
<br>
I shoot each of them again with the assult rifle.<br>
<br>
The Navy SEAL in the suit well ... hes going to the hospital now.  <br>
<br>
The Navy SEAL in the Flak gear.  He looks around and wonders what shot his friend, as he calls the ambulance.<br>
<br>
Nuff said ... <br>

training has @#%$ to do with takin damage.  Leather dont protect like 2 inches of forge hardend steel. <p>Master Xith N'Shezbenon
