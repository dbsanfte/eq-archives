<br>
A warrior with defensive just would have prayed for procs in order to even *maintain* aggro (defensive = half our damage, ya know ?).<br>
<br>
And, moreover, *defensive* is different to *invincible*. With defensive, we lose life slower, that don't mean we do not lose life at all. In this situation, that would only have retarded the inevitable.<br>
<br>
Now, for the DPS, you should really compare your DPS with our, using 2Handed weapons.<br>
Oh, forgot to add, dual wielding for warriors is worse than most 2Hander, like a 44/44 that everyone now can have.<br>
If you add knights-only ratio weapons, you do the same damage as our.<br>
<br>
About tanking, once you reach the AC softcap (1250, a paladin in my not-über guild, that do some Mith. Marr smithing, has right now 1359 AC buffed), the only difference is the avoidance gap between Paly and Wars. Oh, and 400HP.<br>
So, yeah, you're about 90% tanking ability, stop blind yourself.<br>
You do not tank like us, not yet (if the shield thing goes in live I'm done, as PAL/SK will tank better than actual warriors), but the lack of tanking ability is rewarded by such a good aggro-control that mobs die faster because others classes can do their job without worrying too much about aggro.<br>

If you think Paladins aren't wanted or useful on a raid, you don't know the full potential of the class.  You might want to go back to Paladins of Norrath and really read some of the posts discribing how to play the class to its fullest potential.<br>

Paladins are not just a second rate tank with third rate DPS.

I find warriors are a very useful class, it doesn't mean you can't complain about what you see as shortcomings of the class.  Just because someone thinks they are uneeded or underpowered does not mean they aren't a good player.  I have read almost every post on PoN and I do play the class well, the class just isn't important on raids most of the time.<br>
<br>
I probably came off wrong in my posts, I love playing a Paladin, I wouldn't take another class if I had the option to switch.  The only reason I posted here in the first place was in reply to people that said A) Knights tank almost as well as a warrior and B) Knights DPS is about as good as a warrior.  Neither one of those statements are true IMO.  Give a Knight and a Warrior the 2h from emporer and the warrior will out DPS us by a lot, lower crit rate, lower weapon skill cap, lower offense cap, lower double attack cap.  We don't come even close to a warrior for tanking because of lower parry etc skills and no disciplines to help out.  This perception that Knights are 95% warrior is wrong, we are maybe 85% warrior at best.<br>
<br>
Paladins are a a mixure of 2nd rate tanking, 3rd rate dps and 3rd rate healing.  When you mix the 3 well of course you can do the raid some good.  Well played druids, necros etc all do the raid good too, doesn't mean you need them.  In 95% of the raids out there you could replace the paladin with another class and do more good.  Thats where the problem lies.  Its true for all non DPS classes, because DPS stacks, utility doesn't generally.  They are working on it for other classes, Knights just want them to work on it for us as well.<br>
<br>
Things won't be balanced until a guild wants to recruit every class, almost all high lvl guilds have more warriors/clerics than any other class and still want more, thats not balance. <p><a href =http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210569>Fraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</a>

Usually they have ample Warriors.  <br>
<br>
Seriously though, you don't really think that beyond about 4 or so adding more Warriors is particularly desireable to a raid, do you?  Most guilds would rather have damage dealers or utility at that point.<br>
<br>
If you group me and another Warrior together, you have two gimped characters that will do mediocre damage and quickly die to AE or collateral damage.  You group me and a Paladin together, and you get slightly less damage and both characters have a reasonable chance of surviving AE and collateral damage.  Replace the Paladin with a Druid or a Shaman, and the heals for me are better, but the damage is probably a little worse.<br>
<br>
I could easily envision a group setup for raiding that incorporated a Paladin in every group.  Beyond about 4, I would rather have Rogues or Monks over Warriors.  Unless tanking the Warriors add nothing but damage, so I would replace them with even better damage.<br>
<br>
Paladins think they need improvements?  Fair enough, you play the class.  But if you think you should be the equal of a Warrior in every way of significance or just the barest bit worse, and yet have all your additional utility as well, I would ask you what you think Warriors should have?  Because what I see is a class that wants the best of both worlds, tanking and utility.  While the Warriors are just asking for tanking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uennder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ennder</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/27/02 10:43:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=306>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: new on test</span><hr size=1> I'm not saying Knights should tank as well as a warrior, what I'm saying is that we don't, and all the warriors that keep saying we almost do, are wrong.  We are about 85% as good in melee as a warrior, from a dps and tanking stand point.  Plus there are some mobs we simply cannot tank at this point, like AOW etc.  <br>
<br>
I would like to see all plate classes mitigation upped, warrior and knight dps upped and knights given a utility that is wanted for raids outside of 3rd rate healing.  Monks and Rogues and to a lesser extent Rangers are too high on the dps scale at the moment.  All of the plate class are too low on the tanking scale.  All hybrids and most casters who don't debuff/heal are too low on the utility for raid purposes.<br>
<br>
I would also like to see warriors utility upped in groups, either from better mitigation/avoidance or higher dps, thats the warriors call but lowered in raids.  A Knight should be able to tank most mobs in a raid, warrior should just be a little better.  Knights should be in that MT rotation, but at the end of it, instead if I get aggro on an uber mob I'm dead... my hps are lower than a warriors, my ac doesn't really do anything, my avoidance is low because of lower capped parry/dodge etc skills and I have 0 defensive oriented disciplines to help the CH rotation get going.  No class should have a lock on any job.<br>
<br>
Paladins could have been useful with divine stun and ToK for stopping caster mobs from doing dmg through casting, but verant nerfed both of those so badly they are mostly useless, they also made most of the high end content immune to stuns making that ability useless.  Right now our niche is being able to do low end melee dps, heal non aggro dmg and off tank which we don't do any better than a warrior would.  Right now a SK more or less has no use but 2nd/3rd rate dps and maybe helping with the pulls a bit. <p><a href =http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210569>Fraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</a>

<br>
I can emphatically say yes.  I think that our heals and stuns and LOH etc are great.  I play the class because I'm a paladin, I'd play a paladin even if all I could wear was cloth armor and all I could wield was a splintering club.  But all of our spells and abilities are more than duplicated by another class.<br>
<br>
You want a backup healer for your group?  Get a druid, you'll get back spot heals, Damage shields, evacs, etc, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
Can a paladin contribute to his group in a raid?  sure he can, all classes can.  &quot;even&quot; warriors can.<br>
<br>
If you go to Paladins of Norrath, you'll see several threads about improving our healing, and one or two about improving our damage output (Marlowe has never been satisfied with the paladin class, there's always been one or another aspect of the class that he would complain LOUDLY about, but every class needs such a proponent).  If you go to our less-used forums (Alternate planes, etc), somewhere in there you will find a Thread entitled <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Innoruk Shminnoruk!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  This thread was started by a level 55 or so paladin who tanked Innoruk for his guild when the MT went down (forget why).<br>
<br>
Do you understand the signifigance of that?  It's a RARE occaision!  A paladin main tanked Innoruk and was EXCITED about it, so he came to post at PON about it.  A couple pages back in the General forum is a thread one Paladin wrote about hearing a group in Karnors Castle /ooc &quot;Group looking for a paladin!&quot;  Again, a very exciting development for us.<br>
<br>
Does this mean warriors should never get xp groups?  of course not.  Does this mean paladins want to keep warriors down?  No, it does not.  Does it mean that the paladin class has finally achieved a point where they are useful?   It seems to indicate that, yes.  Is that a bad thing?  From reading the steelwarrior forums, you might think so...<br>
<br>
I've said it before, I'll say it again:  Many paladins support improvements to the warrior class.  I am among those paladins.  I simply disagree totally that warriors should be 50% or even 30% better at tanking than paladins.<br>
<br>
Now I'm going to ramble...<br>
<br>
I group regularly with a 52 cleric and a 43 warrior.  I wield a Black Acrylia Halberd, and wear a Belt of Virtue (16% haste).  Valor of Marr (25% haste) is ALWAYS up.  I don't usually taunt, but I usually am the main tank for our little group.<br>
<br>
Shock of all shocks, if the warrior taunts, he can get aggro away from me, and KEEP it for a few rounds of combat.<br>
<br>
To your amazement and astonishment, he wields a Lamentation and a Smouldering Brand (wears an FBSS, has no other haste), and I think he does about as much damage to any given mob as I do.  He is a TREMENDOUS asset to our group, and my wife and I both miss him terribly when he decides not to log in for the night.<br>
<br>
His attack is in the high 900's, unbuffed.  Mine is not even 900, unbuffed.  Bear in mind, this warrior is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 10 levels</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> lower than I am.  In a few more levels, believe me, he'll be the main tank for our group, and with one or two equipment upgrades, I'm sure he'll be able to get, and hold aggro, unless I need to steal it for some reason.<br>
<br>
Some warriors who are posting regarding the changes on test and the state of warriors, and how to fix warriors in POP, are saying that warriors are BROKEN from level 1 to level 60 and need a change at every level.  I don't buy that, I'm sorry.  Other warriors say that all the major problems are only really surfacing at level 60 with lots of AA points and lots of high end +100 hp all/all items.  I'm much more inclined to believe that.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, other experiences I've had indicate to me that a level 57 warrior tanks much better than a level 60 paladin if both have no AA points and have comparable gear.  My wife has had to be main healer on a few small group raids where she's been able to make this sort of comparison, and she would much rather heal the level 57 (or even a level 55) warrior, than try to keep a level 60 paladin alive.<br>

I'd MUCH rather have a discussion with you than 2 sides screaming at one another from unmovable positions.<br>
<br>
Obviously, I'm going to need to disagree on the amount of difference between what should be a Paladin and a warrior's ability to tank, but I'd like to point you towards one of my posts in the Steel Warrior thread which dealt with mitigation tables.   I proposed a mitigation table change which was quite reasonable, which *happenned* to have put Paladins actually further up the line than they are now in terms of tankability.<br>
<br>
My position has *always* been that we must balance things.  In my estimation, Knights' tankability MUST suffer in relation to warriors based on 2 things:<br>
<br>
1. Their ability to control aggro exceeds that of a warrior.<br>
<br>
I don't see this as being a *bad thing* per se, I just think that there should be a *cost* to eaily obtaining aggro, and that cost should be a lower, a *noticably* lower ability to deal with the consequences of that ability to more easily manipulate a mob's hate.  I don't think 15% is enough, nor do I think 30-50% is reasonable, but somewhere in the nature of 20-25% is *reasonable*.  <br>
<br>
2. The spell lines of Paladins is really rather remarkable, in essence, alone, we may have 800ish more HP than you do, but our total HP is only shown in the red bar, whereas your total HP is shown in the red AND blue bars.  In other words, standing alone side by side, I may have 4200hp to your 3200.  Now, you cast Brell's, 2 HP buffs, and yours self buffed is now 3600 to my 4200.  Once battle begins, I have a ticker going.  Once my HP run out, it's over, I die.  You have LoH, which if I'm not mistaken will heal you about 3200HP, yet only once an hour, granted, yet it's still adding to your total HP pool.  You have some fairly serious healing that when added up, expending your mana on heals, leads to  having a LOT more HP than I at your disposal.   <br>
<br>
Certainly on raids this isn't something that you'd use often, and I understand this and agree with it.  I think that the &quot;plate classes&quot; *do* need an upgrade in mitigation, and I think that you *should* be able to tank in both exp groups AND many boss mob encounters.  Certainly at the highest end melee type boss mob encounters (i.e. AoW), it's not a crime to say &quot;gee whiz, we can't do this without a warrior&quot;.  I also don't think it's a crime to take your *good* tanking skills and utilize them on tough to control mobs (i.e. Green Flurry drakes are often tanked by Knights due to the slow and warrior issues holding aggro).   I do think that having roles i.e. CC tanking (CC=Crowd Control) which suit Knights best is a good thing.   <br>
<br>
What I *do* think though is that we DO pay a rather severe price for being a warrior in that we have nothing else to do but tank, we have no real options, and the fact that the Paladins who've visited this board have not acknowledged that, or have downplayed the importance of their spells/abilities is what seems to frustrate the warriors beyond belief.  At least it does me.<br>
<br>
Now, you make a VERY valid point about &quot;Warriors need to be fixed from 1-60&quot;  <br>
<br>
I also disagree with that notion.  Warriors from 1-50 are pretty damn good, well, except for the mid 30's-early 40's where they're kind of weak, but having played other classes, there's levels of weakness for all of them, and this is acceptable.  <br>
<br>
In the 50's, the issue comes up with taunting.  To me this is silly, and should be fixed.  Just as you have a chance to use YOUR skills when fighting a mob regardless of level, we should as well.   A rogue can backstab an even con or higher mob before 60, as a monk can hit them, as casters *can* land spells on them, yadda yadda.   Granted, the effectiveness vs. them is lessenned, and I understand this, but there isn't another class in the game where it is simply coded into the game &quot;This skill will not work because the mob is even con or higher&quot;.  Fine, make it less effective, but for god's sake, give it a chance to work.<br>
<br>
That's issue #1<br>
<br>
Issue #2 comes up in AA Land, where the 100hp all/all and PE has blurred the line FAR too much, and this has been discussed earlier, as has the pace at which good items for other classes vs. good items for warriors enters the game.  Itemization at the mid game is screwed up and at the end game it TOTALLY messed up.<br>

<br>
  Tuesday August 27, 2002<br>
<br>
SPELL CHANGES ON TEST<br>
A number of spell changes have hit the Test Server today.  A revamp of the stacking system has begun it's implementation into the spell data along with some further revisions of existing spells:<br>
<br>
    * Death Peace, an improved Feign Death, is currently available to Necromancers at Level 60.<br>
       <br>
    * Harmshield, a Divine Aura spell, is currently available to Shadow Knights at Level 51.<br>
       <br>
    * Ethereal Elixir is no longer a group spell, but a 75 foot area effect spell.<br>
       <br>
    * Dementing Visions has been upgraded to do 775 damage.<br>
       <br>
    * Glamorous Visage, Horrifying Visage, Calming Visage and Haunting Visage now have a casting time of 2 seconds, duration of 36 seconds and a recast of 24 seconds (they had previously been on Test at 10 min duration, 9 minute recast).<br>
       <br>
    * Ancient: Rytan's Dirge of Death has been added to the Bard song list at Level 60.  We have been informed this will not be going live.<br>
<br>
Note that these spell changes are only on the Test Server and may change further before going live, or not go live at all. <p>Binnamar- 51 dwarven warrior<BR>

I've gotten by fine with the all/all clicky shrink potions from FG that can be recharged - I keep a 10 shot in bank all the time. The things you are comparing to are convenience items, I make do without them so can knights.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and off tank which we don't do any better than a warrior would.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Offtanking is 99% about getting aggro fast so the mob won't wipe clerics or whomever else is using high aggro spells. Knights surpass warriors by a WIDE stretch at this ability, as they should.<br>
<br>
As for damage...<br>
<br>
Friend paladin of mine wielding a Goldenrod (40/32 - or 1.25 dam:del ratio) was killing mobs at the exact same speed that I was in Seru wielding either BoC (15/20)+Primal(13/20+15%dam from avatar)/BoC(15/20)+Jaelen's(14/19) - I'd say the speed in killing between the two setups should leave me well ahead of her, but it didn't - I do have flurry3, cf3, ambidex as well, she had combat fury1 or 2 at the time.<br>
<br>
I'm repeatedly seeing knights do exactly same melee-DPS on high end hunts than I am, their parses conveniently excluding the hidden benefit of group-healing and self-healing/dd that a PAL/SK can do.<br>
<br>
What we do agree upon is:<br>
<br>
1. Warriors should tank more efficiently than knights in any given situation<br>
2. Knights should aggro better than warriors in all situations (note, this sometimes make them tank better as well - think Grieg etc.)<br>
3. Knights should do less damage than a non-MT warrior, given same quality of weapons - except on undead, where PALs should do more damage than warriors<br>
4. Knights have spells, warriors do not<br>
<br>
The disagreement is really only on how much each of those 4 points should differ. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions</a></i> <br>

<br>
I agree.  And you present excellent arguments here.  Maybe 20% is a better figure than the 15% suggested earlier.  But let me address some other issues.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> we may have 800ish more HP than you do, but our total HP is only shown in the red bar, whereas your total HP is shown in the red AND blue bars<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This IS sort of true, I can't deny that.  However it would be an oversimplification to say that a paladin has his HP bar + X casts of Greater heal worth of HP + LOH value of hp.  We DO use our mana for other stuff than healing (stunning, self buffing, etc) and LOH has a few quirks that make it less than a guaranteed self heal (not a complete heal unless you spend AA on it, can go off on corpses or on mobs, some people have mentioned that after LOH'ing themselves, they seem to lose health FASTER than before).<br>
<br>
But you are correct, and we do have a potentially deeper pool of hp than what is listed in our inventory screen under hp.  You and I both realize this will not be true when Main Tanking, that under that circumstance we will not be healing, but only fighting and maybe stunning.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Certainly at the highest end melee type boss mob encounters (i.e. AoW), it's not a crime to say &quot;gee whiz, we can't do this without a warrior&quot;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This I whole-heartedly agree with.  In fact, because of the limitations on a warrior's ability to solo, I think that MOST high end raids should be situations where people look at each other and say &quot;where's the warrior?  we NEED him.&quot;  If that isn't the case now (it certainly IS the case in the alliance of guilds of which I am a part), then something definitely needs to be done to fix it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> the Paladins who've visited this board have not acknowledged that, or have downplayed the importance of their spells/abilities is what seems to frustrate the warriors beyond belief. At least it does me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I apologize that this frustrates you, but the point of downplaying our spells is that they do not place us in any &quot;essential&quot; niche.  Most paladins I know (because I don't really know that many super-high-end paladins) still think that warriors at least have their niche as Main Tank, whereas we do not really have an essential or even highly desireable position at a raid.<br>
<br>
I think what it boils down to is that paladins at my level of play find that warriors are REQUIRED for raids, but paladins aren't.  In return, paladins at my level can solo, or xp group very effectively, while warriors at my level can't solo, they can still group very effectively.  I guess it's just a matter of perception on my part, or lack of experience with the highest end game, because I can't see that warriors who are currently on par with me (level and equipment wise) need any adjustment at all.<br>
<br>
I do see that warriors who compete with level 60 paladins that have 230 AAXP points DO need something to improve them, if they are to retain their position as essential main tank.  But as I see it, that's a problem between a level 60 warrior and a level 60 paladin WITH AAXP, and should be resolved with AAXP or tweaking high end items.<br>
<br>
Hope that explains my position better.  If everyone feels the need to disregard me in the future due to my lack of &quot;uberness&quot; I'll be offended, but I'm used to it.  LOL<br>

Because prior to uber taunt weapons, most Warriors have a very hard time getting and holding agro, particularly in the 50-59 level range.<br>
<br>
I also think that part of the problem is that with massive amounts of AAXP, Paladins actually become significantly better.  It doesn't seem to scale the same for Warriors with massive amounts of AAXP.  They are better, certainly, but the gains don't seem as broad.<br>
<br>
And then high end all/all gear does seem to even the playing field even more, among all the melee.<br>

Monks.  Unless you're talking Vex Thal goodies, but I think those are all/all.<br>

Pretty minor point, but if you're flaming a class based on access to gear that gives them abilities not available to other classes, you could pick better examples.<br>

If you care to disagree and say that if a warrior wants dmg he should DW, go ahead.<br>
<br>
But the best way to compare two things in a controlled way is to have the least amount of variables,  DW Warrior VS 2h Knight isnt a fair comparision, when 2h War would probably outdamage DW warrior, and even if it doesnt, its not another needlses varable.<br>
<br>
And for the DMG Bonus thing, its little math, with DB firing more on 2h weapon due to the scaled DB, and 1h is static...I'll post some ratios to show it later tonight if you want, right now i'm Hungry tho.<br>
<br>
As for part of &quot;other factors&quot;<br>
<br>
DB does not get applied to offhand<br>
Offhand weapons dont fire as much as main. (Even with the Ill-named ambidexi)<br>

You ain't got a Niche 'cause yer a Hybrid.  You did realize that when ya chose yer character didn't ya?  Why do ya need to go runnin to VI when Yer dissatisfied with what you think your ROLE should be?  Pick a Class with a role if ya need one.  Don't use the fact that you do not to justify the fact that you should get upgrades.  When I first started this game (a long time ago)I chose a Class with a role. I'm tired of hearing whining about ROLES from people who were afraid to choose a role from the Beginning.<br>
<br>
Ya didn't wanna be a Wizard cause they were too weak.  Ya didn't wanna be a Warrior cause ya couldn't Cast.  Ya didn't wanna be a Cleric cause it's too boring.  Some people had the guts to do it.  Those are the folks who should get the Benefits.  ManaBurn is a good Example and So are the Healing Upgrades.  Let's see some Warrior Love now from VI! <br>
 <br>
Here is an Example of Hybrid logic; If yer half Rottweiler and Half GreyHound Ya should be a little Weaker than the Real Rottwielers out there and a little slower than the Real GreyHounds!<br>
