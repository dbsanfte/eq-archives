If so were they a Necro or mage ? I am getting so mad with the unbalanced warrior these days. After talking to( .....no beating my head against the wall )  SOE design staff I found that they know about the imbalance and are trying to get to it, but with LDoN they were overwelmed and had to put it on the back burner. They said their will be changes , but of course they would not say what changes or when. The only thing they would say is its real hard to do class balancing.  It seems simple enough to me. Take each class make it able to at least solo a mob close to its level and then it balanced.  Why is it Warriors can only solo liught blues when almost all other class's can solo dark blues. Keep in mind I am refering to a warrior with moderate gear not gear from plane of time and such. I am not asking for much just let me solo a blue and get 1% aa exp and i'll be happy to go sit some where for 10 minutes untill I am full health.  Of course twinked gear would cut that time down but you shouldn't need uber gear to do it. Wizards , druids, bards all kite gaining massive exp. Necro's and mages can solo with their pets. Paladins can............. never mind it gets me to riled to talk about Pally's ......  grumbles (critical hit for 5665)  @#%! slay undead. What would be so wrong to give a simple class like the warrior enough  endurance to withstand a fight with a mob 5 levels lower than him that can't even cast.  It ain't right!!!!    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=branamanstarbinder>Branaman Starbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/15/03 1:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3222.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://httpd.chello.nl/j.wensveen1/images/ofo2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Balancing</span><hr size=1> well, beside the fact that not each class can solo each type of mob, they are limited to certain types after all, they have to pay in time for their solo skills to. Luckily spells as KEI are available for casters to drop their downtime from 11 minutes after a fight to 6 minutes and then gear kicks in. Of course there are level ranges where the rules change a little.<br>
<br>
I would think that the Warrior would be best to solo Caster mobs, since caster mobs have less HP, a lower melee dmg output and they tend to spent time casting instead of hitting. All the warrior needs then is some good resists gear and a good stun proc / Bash to make sure the caster gets interrupted (an interrupted caster still has its mana so will cast again instead of melee) or resists the spells. <br>
<br>
Of course you have to find the right mobs to kill, you can't go up to just any caster mob and hope to live. After all, the same holds for wizards, they do not snare every mob and start kiting because 1 summon and their 700 AC / 3500 Hp buffed body is getting a serious pounding. (Those PoS frogs wizards kite sometimes put out 1600 dmg in an attack round, wizards that make the mistake of not watching out for those adds die fast.)<br>
<br>
Would a Regen buff, with the duration of KEI, that shortens down time like as with KEI and adds HP equal to mana as with KEI help the soloing melee?<br>

Or go to the bazaar and invest in magic resistance gear and a stun proc weapon. Again, same effect. Just that caster mobs seem to hit just about as hard as the melee mobs do.

<br>
Classes are becoming very balanced. The gear (buyable) that is available for the average player these days is substantially better then the gear that could be bought 1 year ago. The weapons have improved 200% and wielding a 12/19 can be done for under 4k. With a small raid force (20 toons) you can can get a 44/34. This however is not what makes classes &quot;balanced&quot;. Having 4k More HP and 800 more AC then the average caster is a good start. Plate classes where meant to keep x-mob off Jimmy the wizard, joe the necromancer, boby the ranger, and mike the rogue. <br>
<br>
With out a Plate class, many of these classes would be a fraction as effective. Plate classes are for the most part &quot;the backbone&quot; many groups, and although not substantially increasing DPS themselves, they dramatically increase the DPS of the group, by allowing other classes to go all out DPS.<br>
<br>
If you want the DPS of a rogue or ranger, then what would be the point of these classes? If you want the DPS of a caster, then give my necromancer 4k more HP, and 800 more AC.<br>
<br>
All classes have a purpose, and warriors unfortunately is not DPS, it’s to take the hits so that others may live. This is exactly why I started a warrior, I want to get hit, I like it.<br>
<br>
From a casters perspective, it is nice going all out, and watch 6 dots, do over 1200 damage a tick, and even nicer when you see the 3.2k Crit scroll down with all your DoT damage, but we would never be able to do that with out the warrior.<br>
<br>
In an average group, most casters don’t have the DPS that you are leading on to believe. As a necro in LDON, I get (dps wise) three spells. Horror: 430 damage a tick for 30 seconds. Blood of Thule: 340 damage a tick, and Neuro 1300 damage nuke that crits 15% of the time for UPTO 2600 damage. On single pulls with a chanter or bard I can cast assuming I have PoT9, and bst crack) two Neuros: 2600 damage + pet damage: 600-800ish (depends on pet). That is only 3600-3800 damage to X-mob. With no CC, Necros shine. We can root and rot the add, casting both Horror, and Blood of Thule, while nuking the other target (which is mana intensive), or agro kite add and use Horror, and Blood of Thule all the while Life tapping to compensate for any hits I may take (in a close Quarter fight).<br>
<br>
If you don’t think you do even half that damage, then you may want to go and parse your fight. This also takes mana, when casters are OOM, then how good are we? Melee have sustained DPS, that requires nothing more then haste, and two half decent weapons. <br>
<br>
As far as soloing goes... Yahh its a definite plus, a plus that requires at times multiple deaths. A plus that can be so incredibly boring, at times it is not even worth it. A plus that has been so nerfed, that the average half decent group gets 30 percent more EXP then us. A plus that has so few good spots, that you often find yourself talking in the auction channel, waiting on ricky the wizzie to leave, because they're is simply nothing else to do, and no other camps to go to. I guess its one of those cases that is &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot;. <br>
<br>
I am sure you are also going to play the &quot;you can farm card&quot;. Yahh so what. I need to pay for gear just like you. The big difference is, you don’t have to buy spells. Let me give you a rundown of what my necromancer has spent on spells: Funeral Pyre: 50k, Seduction of saryn: 13K, Touch of death: 10k, Undead mez: 5K, Blood of Thule: 60K, Saryns Companion: 12K, Children of Bertox 30k. 168k for 7 spells.<br>
<br>
But this isn’t what I came to the board for... I have a good idea for snap aggro, and how to make warriors more beneficial, with out throwing out the balance of the game woot woot.<br>

Never have been.  It is still the only class in the game that does not solo.  But in truth is losing its ability to even do his job effectively.  He stand in front of a group or raid and is suppose to take take the beating for all, deal damage and keep the mob on them.  Yes, same newer armor has helped on stats and hps, but we are also dealing they mobs with 300k hps, AE's, DD's, and rampaging every 10 seconds.  I have seen raids where it takes 6 healers in a chain to keep him in a battle and sometimes its not enough.  So what are the answers?  What do he want as warriors?  First I think I speak for many warriors on this point.  (1) Would we like more HP's, yes.  Are we looking for a hand out, no.  We can earn them through more AA's in percentages, but be reasonable with it.  First at lvl 60 allow to boost hps more than whats already there.  (2) Can SoE improve taunt, yes.  Again in percentages for levels and points, very doable.  (3) Damage, dps (my biggest issue) can SoE fix the sad excuse for warrior damage by our weapons, yes, if they wish too its easy.  Two simple choices could fix this issue and many tanks would be happy.  Augments are a start but more need to be in place.  Ones that improve the dam or dly of any weapon.  Augments for better procs to keep agro (taunts).  Now for the easiest and smartest of all.  Warriors should be able to use ANY weapon in the game except for class epics.  Nothing pisses me off more than a 41/25 1HS we cant use or even a 26/24 1HS.  If warriors had weapons to duel weld with that dam/dly ratio, maybe we would have a chance to keep agro while all you nuke happy 2-4k damage every 5-10 seconds casters with your high hp and high damages pets are beating the hell out of the mobs would  not be stealing agro. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Just a thought.  The fixes are EZ for SoE, if they would just look it them from a warriors eyes. <br>
<br>
Just so you know, I also play a Druid, Cleric, SK, Shammy, BL and Monk, so I know the balance is off...<br>

The fix is indeed simple - give warriors (and warriors ONLY) more HP/AC and something to gain snap aggro besides the ability to tell a mob &quot;Your mother is an orc&quot; and we will essentially be fixed.

<br>
Since I have heard about the &quot;balance is broken&quot; issue, I've been watching the Luclin LFG tool to see all the level 60s warriors doing the LFG thing. I get involved a fair number of times when trying to complete a group by adding a class - the hardest to find class is the healer, followed by the tank or the slower, the numbers are about consistant there. DPS seems easy to find. Perhaps on other servers there is a ton of warriors LFG, but I don't see evidence of the problem on Luclin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amnita>Amnita</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/18/03 6:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3222.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   SteelHeart, Learn your roll</span><hr size=1> SteelHeart, your post screams:<br>
1) you dont even know the roll of your class. It it to sit there and take the hits so that others classes may live, and do there job. It was NEVER to do damage.<br>
2) Your not the brightest star in the sky. You are crying about not being able to use every weapon, why cant all melle use every weapon, or even casters. In Real life I can swing baseball bat, and shank people with my switch blade... So why cant I in EQ... The answer is simple, its called balance. Paladins get bad ass one handed weapons because... they cant duel wield. <br>
3) You are not in a high end guild.. or even close to it. I would assume you are in a family guild where it takes a raid force to bring down a mob that can be one grouped in any guild in VT, or even SSRA. WARRIORS ARE NEEDED IN HIGH END GAME, things like defensive are needed. <br>

Which is why I am posting this message. I play a warrior and I am very disappointed in his abilities, even though I have some very good equipment and weapons. I, for the most part cannot keep aggro, or cannot get aggro back after losing it. That's the main problem with warriors right now. But sometimes, what with the dps and hp's of the mobs, that might be a good thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I might live a little longer. I have all my melee skills maxed for my level, my Ac is as high as I can get it, my melee stats are high but could be a lot better but thats not under my control. EQ has designed me to be a certain way, I have found out that you can up your Ac at the expense of your melee stats or the other way around, u can't have both. Now if I had 200 AA's it might be different, but I am talking about the majority.<br>
I have NOT been able to solo since level 15. A cleric is a must. A slower is a must, and possibly a mezzer. That's just for starters. What ever happened to the big bad warrior? Why must I have a couple of babysitters all the time? I also play  a necro, mage, BST, monk, and a cleric.<br>
So I am not unfamiliar with the other classes.<br>
I have soloed with my necro, mage, and bst. Balanced you say?<br>
Can't fight a lt. blue mob? why? cause I don't know the high end game? Come off it.<br>
I can't count the number of times I have been LFG and a lower level pally gets taken before me. Why is this?<br>
Let's see--He about equals my dps, He's close to my AC and HP's, He casts spells, and he can pacify. Why would the group want a warrior? I would pick a pally over a warrior too. <br>
Just to rant some more here, try taking on ONE mob in the planes. Their hp's are unreal and their damage output are simply awesome. Without good backup, my warrior dies rather quickly. Answer this question. If I am supposed to be the uber warrior that was first designed, how long would I last if that same mob happened to kill just one person of my group of babysitters? Balanced?<br>
I have seen a Mage solo a mob in the planes close to my own level. Balanced?<br>

<br>
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br>
<br>
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Warriors are NOT, have NOT, NEVER WILL BE a solo class PERIOD. If thats what you think balance is, then you are sadly mistaken. Aggro is number one for me. Any of you notice that it's really really easy to keep aggro during a Raid but sometimes in groups depending on what classes, its just friggin impossible. DPS is ok,  it can be improved but still...If your not doing your job at keeping aggro people might as well get another monk instead.  For the guy up there who said we dont have to worry about spells....true we dont.  You find me any spells you want,  and ill show you some War gear that I would like to have thats much much much more expensive. And back to aggro,  all that gear don't mean @#%$ if you cant keep the mob on you. Taunt is just a button on my screen that says Taunt,  other than that it has no real value, it's a big practical joke from sony. &quot;Hey gary... Lets give Warriors a button that says taunt, but in reality when they push it... har har, dur... It wont do anything,  HAHAHAHAH snort snort snort&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Every thing is RELATIVE for a War.  EVERYTHING!  Sony bottom line HAS to look at this from the standpoint of the guy thats not in a big guild, that doesnt have the disgustingly expensive equipment and weapons. That guy goes into a group lets say...PoV EC/WC,  Can't take the hits cause of his gear (Remember its ALL RELATIVE), Now he can't keep aggro cause his weapons suck, now he gets to stand there at 25% and watch his Cleric get spanked,  then the Shaman, then the blah blah....so on and so forth.  <br>
<br>
In conclusion....... Aggro....taunt......keep it! Period.  <br>
Gear- dont make the better @#%$ so damn hard to get for War's.<br>
Fire the guy at sony who developed the War, chop off his balls and feed em to him.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=574768" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-family:century gothic;font-size:medium;">Virodex XXXecutioner</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I when I SA I now my roll.  I am in not in a guild that can pull down AoW with a group.  I fact I would love to see that happen.  But I have been involved in his death more than once.  Your post seems to stay with the argument of &quot;more hps&quot;  and thats all good, most warriors would love to have them.  Hell yeah 4K hps to tanks, I don't see it.  Sony will never give that.  My job, your job and all other tanks jobs is that of one taking damage.  But my post was to say in order to take the damage you need to keep agro.  Two choices, maybe you are lucky enough to be taking on a major named and a druid can just root him by you while all others run to other side on the room, so you get hit, I doubt thats ever going to happen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   or you keep the argo while everyone else in out damaging you.  My fixes are to address the agro fix.  Keep the mob on us... 50K in hps won't get you or keep you agro.  Better taunts, and yes, if we can get usable weapons that help to keep agro better we can do our job, take damage.  We will never out damage others, but weapons that do 12-15 dam with some mobs and under heavy nuking is not enough.  So the easy answer would be to allow warriors to get to use any weapon.  Trust me if a caster wants agro he can take it from you.  If he is smart he won't.  I would even settle from some &quot;good&quot; augments that would increase our own weapons 3 - 4 dam, not the oones that are now available that give you +1 dam if your dly is under 19.  I am sure you have seen uber warriors lose agro from slows, nukes and once the ping ponking mobs goes array, it can get ugly.  Maybe raids have been lost over casters dropping like flys, why?  The tank wasn't able to get or keep agro.  HPs did him no good, 4k more isn't going to help him.  Give him an improved taunt, and some weapons that can get agro, then he has to do his job to keep it. I don't want it all, just something that will do what is needed, its all about agro. I am not looking to solo, if I want to solo I play my druid.  <br>
<br>
Any high lvl Monk can steal your agro off many warriors, thats not right, your are using 2 weapons, he is slapping the mob silly for more damage, hehe.  Thats balance.<br>

This is my possible solution:<br>
<br>
Warrior Class Ability: Improved Taunt, this ability is always on<br>
Requirements: 12 points spent in Archetype abilities<br>
<br>
3 Alternate Advancement Levels, 3 Alternate Advancement points per Level<br>
<br>
For each Level of Improved Taunt, a warrior will increase their chance of holding taunt no matter what.  Level 1 gives 2%, Level 2 gives 5%, and Level 3 gives 10% chance to hold taunt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Additionally give a Planes of Power ability that will further increase their ability to Hold Taunt:<br>
<br>
Planar Taunt (or any other name), this ability is always on<br>
<br>
Requirements: Improved Taunt Level 3<br>
<br>
3 Alternate Advancement Levels, 3 Alternate Advancement points per Level<br>
<br>
This ability will increase a Warrior's ability to hold taunt no matter what.  Each Level increases the Warrior's ability to hold taunt by 5% and is trainable at levels 61, 63, and 65.<br>
<br>
<br>
An ability that a Paladin/Shadow Knight gets is their Class ability of 1 Health/1 Mana regen.  Well, Warriors don't have mana but they should have more health.  Warriors don't have any spells to regen this health so they're required to be in a group with someone who does or have the right equipment or sit there and bind wounds.  A simple solution for this would be:<br>
<br>
Warrior's Spirit, this ability is always on<br>
<br>
Requirements: Innate Regeneration Level 3, Natural Healing Level 3<br>
<br>
1 Alternate Advancement Level, 5 Alternate Advancement points<br>
<br>
This ability further increases a warrior's natural regeneration by 3 Health per tick.<br>
<br>
<br>
I noticed that there has been talk of something in this direction so I decided to try and formulate a plan.  I thought this was a new idea that came to me but I see that it's been around for awhile <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mallakith>Mallakith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/03 2:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3222.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Comparisons...</span><hr size=1> sorry as another necro with a warrior alt I agree that plate classes are there to take hits and defend the robes..

We give our reasons why warriors are unbalanced compared to other class's and all I hear is ,&quot; Warriors are supposed to be beat on and have no other purpose but to serve a group. <br>
I think that a group is and should be a prefered method for gaining exp and loot but I do not think it should be the only way to reasonably gain exp for ANY class.
