Is it acceptable to single out one warrior in your guild, and do everything you can do deck them out in the best gear your guild can so they can be a better MT for you?<br>
<br>
I question this because a warrior who joined my guild (dubious aqusition) came in with better gear than any other tank.  They just won a vindi BP the other night, now they have their sights set on Vaniki for a Willsapper.  I have a personal issue that this warrior was merited BP over one who had been in guild longer, who is not so nicly equiped.  This second warrior has put in their time, MT'ing what they could, and doing everything they can to help out, and they have been in the guild a good time longer than this new warrior.<br>
<br>
Sorry, rant there.  So, is it OK to equipe one warrior with the best gear, leaving the SA's and TA's to wait their turn, or should it be done on a more equitable and fair means, kind of a NBG approach? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=31658">Raun Stonecutter</a> <a href="http://www.swordoffate.com"><Sword of Fate></a>

Prob is that u give him/her all the good loot and u end up having factions of peeps that feel used and abandoned. All should have a chance at the nice loot but obviously those who have been there for the guild most of the time should have dibs on the spoils of war.<br>
<br>
Besides...give 1 toon all ur guild can get...do u think that peep will stay in guild just to help the guild equip the rest of u while he/she has nothing to &quot;gain&quot; from the same types of raids?<br>

Its hard to be fair w/ loot..specially Bp's and weapons but u guys have to keep ur War's well equipped..cant count on 1 peep to always be there. when they dont show up then ur bak to where ya were b4 they joined guild and w/ no new loot to help ya out<br>

I think just decking out 1 tank is bad. You can do it to an extent, though.. Like say a 41% haste item drops, and yer MT only has like a 31-36ish% haste item than you may want to just give it to them because of the large impact it will have on their tanking abilities. Other than that, especially since practically everything good is no drop, its better to give things to the person that it'll upgrade most cuz it raises the whole guild's HP/AC/stats/whatever the most, as opposed to being a small upgrade to your MT. Besides that, people will start to get real pissy if they go for months without getting jack while they keep seeing you pile the 10-20hp upgrades onto your MT while it'd be a 100hp upgrade for someone else <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51736" target="_new">Quarg Poopybunz</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 280<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/11/02 1:05:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3858.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Equiping a MT...</span><hr size=1> If you can trust the MT to stay in the guild and work for the guild then get behind him and ride on his back if not you probably shouldn't have guilded him in the first place.<br>

You need 3-5 warriors in good gear and these need to play at a regular time, say 70% of all raids. At start this means giveing them +20 hp upgrades while dmg dealers dont get to upgrade +100 hp. <br>
<br>
If you have the option also deck out a pal/sk or two but once again you have to find people that play regularly on raids or its a waste of guild resources.<br>
<br>
There are some other classes that need to be given priority too like wiz/cle for mana pool and FT items.<br>

If you dont mind lagging behind though you can keep decking all the members but it will take alot longer before you manage to progress in encounters.<br>

It is logical if somone is trustworthy and attends 90% of raids then it is in the GUILDS best interest to equip him first. (it also helps if the MT in question shares his info with the GL and officers so they can log him in if needed).<br>
<br>
It is best to have 3 or so wars in the best you can get them and then start fitting out the rest of the guild.<br>
<br>
One war up there with 7500+ hps is better than having 10 people with 6k-6.5k hps.<br>
<br>
Having said that....if someone is a new addition to a guild and they stat looking for the best the guild can get from day 1...that is not a good sign. I would be carefull of new people who are in it just for the loot. Having said that..if that person is willing to moniter DN until vaniki is up and then ask for the guild help then cool. It is a different matter if he expects the guild to monitor the spawn for him so he can swoop in for the loots.<br>
<br>
If you have issues with a new addition starting to look for all the loots, then talk with your officers and GL. It is always a good idea to express your concerns before anything bad happens.<br>

From the sounds of it, your either a non-raid guild, or your a new guild just getting their feet under them (or atleast new to the high end game).<br>
<br>
I'm in a non-raid guild. We're a gaming guild, actually in 5 different games right now, strongest in EQ. Been around 5 years, so we're very very mature and have a strong family atmosphere. We actually let the raid leader make all decisions about loot awards, but usually on big stuff either I'm leading, or there is a committe.<br>
<br>
We do alot of things with friends, could say allied guilds I guess. To give you an idea where we sit, we've done vindi 10+ times, done rumble/Doom, and I've successfully lead the 10th Ring War twice now (new changes make it quick!).<br>
<br>
The let the raid leader award things works for us. We don't have any 7k hp tanks, but we do have 4-5 tanks ni the 6-6.5k range now, and for where we sit on the ladder (about to hit VP), that's plenty for us (and we'd have a hard time getting any tank to 7k hp without NToV Loot, which we haven't entered yet).<br>
<br>
For us, it's usually awarded based on Merit. Those who worked for it the hardest, been around alot, and it's the best upgrade for. Not always the case, but generally it works for us. <br>
<br>
But we're not raid minded. We raid 3-5 times a week as a guild in general with me leading most of em, and I can tell you, for us, equiping one tank (or even three) before any other melee wouldn't work. If we were raid minded, I could see how that could happen, but all these other guys who are in raid guilds have very valid and strong points on why to equip more than one tank at a time.<br>
<br>
If your a newer 3rd tier guild (think Vindi counts as 3rd tier action?), especially a smaller guild that has alot of help from outside the guild, I'd be very very careful about the 'playing favorites' scenario. for most gamers, it just don't fly. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=141811">Zantaer

<br>
he played nonstop, and he honestly thought it was best for the guild to do it that way.  i dont think there was really any greed involved.  his wife almost divorced him because of his extreme playing times, and he has a job again.... so he hasnt been on in 2-3 months.  when he left, we probly lost enough gear to equip 2 warriors because he upgraded a lot.  also, if he wasnt around, the guild usually didnt ever raid.  we were completely dependant on him, and even though he was on 18 hours a day, thats just not a good thing.<br>
<br>
guild almost broke up when he left (as it did the last time he took a vacation), but we got a new guild leader and went on.<br>
<br>
the point of all this rambling, is that equipping only one tank is a bad thing.  towards the end, i was catching him, only behind by 200-300hps, but i almost never play anymore either.<br>
<br>
spread out the love.  people are less likely to leave over loot, generally happier, and less dependant on one tank. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7023  target="web">smushums<a</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ubrutultarewmarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brutul Tarew Marr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Slayer of Whiners</span><br>  Posts: 786<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/13/02 3:42:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3858.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.blackcompany.cc/member_pics/45.jpg height=185 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Equiping a MT...</span><hr size=1> We used to have a &quot;main tank&quot; and it sucked.  It was actually a warrior had quit the guild and left his account to the officers.  He was always MT botted by one of the officers, and got merited a lot of loot for being &quot;main tank&quot;.  <br>
<br>
No matter how much people talk about not playing the game for loot, everybody wants nice stuff, and seeing the best gear go to the same person over and over is bound to cause resentment.  On top of that, you've got all your gear wrapped up in one person who could burn out (very common in those guys with huge playtime that get picked as MTs) or worse yet E-bay or go to another guild.  Yea I've seen people that I thought were hardcore for the company with no warning turn up on ebay hehe, or make up some lame excuse why they want to leave the guild and then show up in another guild a week later.  It sucks, but it does happen and then you're out your Main tank and have to start over again.  <br>
<br>
I think the ideal situation is to have 3 or 4 warriors that are more or less interchangeable...any one of them can show up to any given raid and be as good as the next guy, and then a few newer members that you can gear up slowly to replace the MT warriors when/if they leave.  Ideally, any warrior in your guild should have good enough gear to show up and tank effectively. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6629>Brutul Vilesilencer</a><br>

Problem is, as I see it, the people who's been around alot and working the hardest will almost always have better items in slot-x than someone who don't play as much making almost any drop a &quot;better upgrade&quot; for them (the ones who don't play alot) - that's why I like points more than merit (in theory). We're a split TZ guild that raids european hours so half our guild (the US contingent) would get horribly left behind on points if we started doing those, so we arent. Just keep faith in your guild leadership and hope they make the right decisions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions ~ Team Headstart</a></i> <br>
