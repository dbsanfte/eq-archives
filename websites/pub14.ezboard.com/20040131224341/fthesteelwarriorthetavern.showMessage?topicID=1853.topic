this i beilieve will help some understand teamwork on aggro.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So you're in a group in a planes zone, take for example Spiders group in Plane of Nightmares. <br>
<br>
In addition to the mandatory healer and slower, your group has a warrior. You know you can generate more aggro than the warrior so the slower won't be attacked when slow hits. You're both around the same level, and while the warrior can tank the mob better you know it will help the group if you tank so the slower doesn't die every 10 minutes or so. <br>
<br>
The warrior knows he has a problem with aggro in the beginning of a fight, where he hasn't had the time to generate aggro but during which part slow has to hit. He's annoyed with Verant, PoP, his class and life in general. This warrior is a guildmember, a nice guy, and you know you don't want him to quit cause else you get to tank Vindicator on the next raid. What do you do?<br>
<br>
I don't know if you've ever asked a warrior &quot;hey, mind if i tank?&quot; in group. In my experience, no selfrespecting warrior wants you to tank instead of him because it makes him feel useless. No warrior wants to be a dps in the group. <br>
<br>
<br>
How to give a warrior the hate he needs<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
A warrior's main problem with taunting happens right in the beginning of the fight, where the slower suddenly sees his hate spike above the amount of hate the warrior has had the chance to generate. Once the warrior takes aggro back from the slower, the fight usually goes fine. The problem is, you may end up with a dead slower in the beginning of the fight.<br>
<br>
Warriors can generate steady hate over time with weapon damage and procs. They can't generate bursts of hate, whereas a shadowknight can. I usually use clinging darkness for this purpose, leaving the newer hate spells unmemmed. In order to help the warrior, you need to know the following:<br>
<br>
1) One cast of clinging darkness generates more hate than one cast of slow. If the slower has to cast slow again (resist), the 2nd slow will make the mob jump the slower unless you have cast clinging darkness a second time. For simplicity's sake, let's assume that:<br>
<br>
- clinging darkness: 400 hate<br>
- resisted slow: 350 hate<br>
- successful slow: 300 hate<br>
<br>
2) A spell will generate hate whether it sticks or not. It will even generate hate if the creature is immune to that spell. From the slower's part, a resisted slow generates a little more hate than a successful slow. A shadowknight can keep his hate over the slower's hate if he casts clinging darkness at least as many times as the slower has to cast slow. I generally pull a mob by casting clinging darkness on it twice, this gives the slower a margin for two resisted slows (where i have 800 hate, and the shaman 700 hate). If i don't cast clinging darkness a third time before the slower casts his third slow attempt, the slower's hate will exceed mine and he will be attacked. Usually slow will hit on the first or second try. <br>
<br>
3) During the time when the shadowknight is casting hate spells to keep his hate above that of the shaman, the warrior will be hitting the mob to gain aggro. A shadowknight can cast Voice of Terris on the warrior, which will let the warrior generate 10% more hate. This is still not enough to avoid the slower being jumped on slow, but it is used later on.<br>
<br>
4) A successful taunt from the warrior gives the warrior an amount of hate equal to whatever the highest guy on the hate list has +1. You may have seen this in action when you're the tank, you have a warrior in the group, and the mobs suddenly pingpongs between you and the warrior even when you're chain casting darkness and you know the warrior has no possible way to generate as much hate as you do. That's a successful taunt attempt.<br>
<br>
<br>
How to put it together<br>
Either the shadowknight pulls, or he casts clinging darkness on the mob when it is being brought in by the puller. I prefer to be the puller cause it gives me more time to cast clinging on the mob. Ideally i will be casting clinging darkness on the mob 4 times regardless of who is the puller. This will give me 1600 hate, taken the numbers from my example.<br>
<br>
The slower can cast slow at his leasure if i have 1600 hate. On successful slow he's at 300 hate, on resist + success he's at 650 hate, even with 2 resists he'll be at 1000 hate when slow finally hits. This is quite safe for the slower. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, the warrior is taunting. He will have a successful taunt either before or after slow hits. If he can't taunt the mob off you before slow hits, the slower is casting against your 1600 hate and nothing can happen. If the warrior taunts the mob off you before the slow hits, the slower is casting against the warrior's 1601 hate, which is still completely safe. <br>
<br>
When you see the mob switch from you to the warrior, this is the point where the warrior just received hate 1 point above yours. The mob may pingpong between you and the warrior for a moment. This means the warrior got 1 point over your hate, but you hit the mob so it ponged back to you. In both cases, switch off autoattack to let the warrior outtaunt you for a few seconds. Don't switch off autoattack before this happens, the more aggro you have at the point when the warrior takes over the better. The mob may switch very early during the fight, it totally depends on how early the warrior gets a successful taunt. Your hate may be sky high, the warrior simply gets what you have +1. After giving the warrior a few seconds, switch autoattack on again.<br>
<br>
Because you generated so much hate in the beginning, the warrior now has a huge amount of hate as well. Nobody but you can pull the mob off the warrior for the rest of the fight unless you have some huge nukers in your party, so all you have to do is be careful with your own hate from this point on. I've never seen the mob get off a warrior after i cast clinging darkness 4 times and the warrior took over, and i don't get aggro back if i just autoattack and cast the occasional spear. You will want to cast Voice of Terris on the warrior so you can stay under the warrior's hate better. If the warrior can't keep aggro with Voice of Terris on him after he's taken over your hate and all you're doing is autoattack, you need a different warrior.<br>
<br>
<br>
Where does Feign Death fit in all this?<br>
You may be tempted to use Feign Death. The situation where you definately shouldn't FD is right after you pulled a mob to the warrior. I've seen shadowknights run the mob to the warrior and FD in front of him like monks do, to make the mob aggro the warrior. Sure, this works, but the warrior gets the mob with minimum hate and you can be certain your slower is going to get hit. Your job is to make the warrior start out with as much hate as you can, not the 0 hate from a freshly pulled mob. <br>
<br>
In my example, you may want to FD after the warrior's taunt gave him 1601 hate and you still have 1600 hate. In my experience, switching attack off for 2 seconds is enough to give the warrior a head start, and unless you completely overdo it you're not going to catch up with him anymore. I find it useful to keep myself on 2nd highest aggro in case the warrior loses aggro (eg. if he dies). <br>
<br>
Should you be forced to FD before the warrior has taken over your aggro (you are after all tanking the mob during the period when it's unslowed most of the time), the warrior will have to generate aggro by himself. But don't die for him, after all, you are still a shadowknight.<br>

Look, everyone knows how aggro transfer works, it's an awesome idea, and it'd be GREAT, except that the current mitigation difference is so small between warriors and shadowknights that it's not necessary or required, and a group is sincerely BETTER off with the SK just going ahead and tanking. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.hostmysig.com/data/fearsons/rohan.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=1853.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showNextMessage?topicID=1853.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1853.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/swaddreply.GIF border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.emailToFriend?topicID=1853.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.threadControl?topicID=1853.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1853.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1853.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
