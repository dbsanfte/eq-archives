valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: rip</span><hr size=1> Warriors set the standard.  They are 100.  Balancing started to happen.  The hybrids were at 40 or so.  Now hybrids are at 100.  Warriors see this as them losing power.  All that really happened was the huge gap between them closed.<br>
<br>
When adjusting anything to do with mitigation include the knight classes along with the warrior class.  We are the only tanks in the game.<br>
<br>
Someone posted that warriors only bring tanking because their offense was well below the other melee.  Thank you for proving my point about paladins.  We have even less offense then warriors.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer to not be the main tank in a group.  It's not what I enjoy doing.  Sadly there are only two ways I get in a group though.  The first is because of friends/people I've grouped with before.  People know me and know I'm a damn good paladin.  This is probably the majority of my groups now a days.  The second way is when a group is looking for a tank.  Usually in these groups I tank as long as it takes to get a warrior in the group and then let them take over.  At that point I do what I enjoy doing most.  All sorts of different things.<br>
<br>
Before the upgrades luclin brought to us I didn't get groups that needed a tank though.  The only time I got in a non guild group was when there was no one else left lfg in the zone.  I had to be in guild groups and then would meet new people that filled in the holes that developed.  Once these people got to know me and how I played I could get in groups with them again.  It was a very long and drawn out process to make connections in such a way to get a group.<br>
<br>
I fear that if the tank label is once again removed from paladins things will go back to the way they were.  If you ask for adjustments to warriors make sure knights are not left out when it comes to tanking.  <br>
<br>
I can't convey to you the way it used to feel to play a paladin.  I can not get you to understand the frustration one felt some days.  The only reason I got groups remotely easily is because I could eek out every last trick from my class.  There was no other option for me if I hoped for people to invite me again.  Finally though I don't have to be frustrated anymore.  My class has finally come into it's own, and it's only a matter of showing people that paladins are no longer the black sheep we once were.  <br>
<br>
Then I find out about this thread and start reading.  I see warriors saying that paladins are getting groups all the time.  I see warriors complaining because paladins are being picked now for one of the 6 spots in a group.  Warriors are saying they've been left behind.  They are no longer useful.  Warriors should be the only viable option for a tank.  No one else should be able to encroach upon this holiest of holy spots.  Yet, they totally neglect the fact there are 3 plate/tank classes.  They ignore the fact that we are tanks too.  That if warriors are made into the best options for tanks, groups will no longer want us knights.  You say we have utility and that tanking isn't our only option.  You forget that there is almost never a group looking for a utility class.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Do warriors need looking into? Maybe, I honestly couldn't make that opinon.  I am an expert on paladins.  That is who I am and what I know.  When I tell you that placing warriors definitevly above paladins in tanking, again, will hurt us severely, then trust that I am right.  Find a solution to your problem that will not hurt my class along the way.  <br>
<br>
Finaly, remember this.  Even with all the balancing and things done for paladins there is one true statement.  Warriors are still better tanks.  The difference is Paladins now bring enough other things to the table to offset their weaker tanking ability.  Finally we have become even in desirabilty to groups, and now you want to elevate yourselves again. <br>

Because right now, Chavr, you sound like a broken record.<br>
<br>
Paladins <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tank worse than a warrior, and considerably so (I believe VI stated 80% of a warrior) - just as well as they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> heal worse than a cleric.

If you are only 1% better than the next melee, you are STILL better. Point is, everyone is freaking out about Super Monks and Godly Knights, but really...there are a handful of them at BEST on any given server. So there are 2 Monks and 3 Knights on your server that are better than a 60 Warrior? So f*cking what??? Are they fighting with you over every xp group/raid you try to get into? And NO, there aren't going to be hundreds of them in the next few months. Those that are Godly are going to be rare. Why? Warriors usually get the best gear first, and if you don't...thats between you and your guild (or your DKP). <br>
Hybrids are just fine. The Melee classes are the ones that are screwed up (Warrior-Monk-Rogue). Rangers and Rogues own DPS over Warriors..but wear Chain and have far fewer HPs. Monks are the sh*t when it comes to avoidance (which is a game design flaw). Knights are close to Warriors but do less damage. And they Do have less Hps. Not as less as a Bard-Rngr-Rogue, but less. And the object of the game is to do damage to the mob &amp; kill it (raid or xp grp) before it kills you. Currently, Warriors &gt; All for Hps. It shouldn't be too hard to code some Mobs to have thier own damage tables relative to AC (damage mitigation). Some zones like CT-Deep-Acrylia Cavs are very Warrior-friendly. Other places, its fine to have a Knight or Rngr to MA for Xp. Never should a Monk MA, regardless of thier mitigation. Lack of any triggerable agro is what disqualifies them. As an example, take a lvl 51 Shammy into Pit Spiders in Velks. I would rather have a Ranger or Knight MA to keep the resist agro null and void. But that is an exception, the rule is generally to get a Warrior and appropriate levels around them. *Note: If any of you wish to quote anymore, post the whole quote...stop taking sh*t out of context*<br>
<br>
Now, to get back to the original theme of this thread: I see no reason for Offense/Defense upgrades to Warriors. (/duck) What I DO see a need for is some utility based in the offensive/defensive realms. Don't want to have Warriors replacing any other classes, as no other classes are replacing them (contrary to popular belief). Some long duration Stuns/short duration Debuffs could be some cool skills under offense. Some improvements vs certain weapon types (higher mitigation or avoidance vs 1hb, 1hp, ect..buy em in AA) could be some cool defensive skills to implement. Try to think of something besides just jacking up the scale of a game that is currently f*cked up. All you would get then is a game thats f*cked up with higher numbers.<br>
<br>
No More Pally Vs. Warrior crap! Get this thread back on track peeps...<br>

With equal quality gear, in XP groups :<br>
- Paladins/SKs handle mobs better (aggro management), and tanks almost like a warrior... And almost is, for paladins/sks that know to play, very near of warriors' tanking capacity.<br>
- Monks have some problems to initiate aggro (only the first swings) but he can aggro well only with their damage output (and their insane weapons that proc stun like hell), and they tank better than warrior. With equal gear. Not that they absorb damages better, but they take less hit. The only problem is that a monk is more difficult to heal than a warrior (monks' hp diminution are quite erratic). That's all.<br>
<br>
On raids :<br>
- The only advantage to warriors over other tanks is 2 disciplines : Evasive, and Defensive. Their duration is about 3min. On Luclin mobs, 3min mean nothing.<br>
- I'm curious to know how many warriors are MT's so they have to use defensive/evasive, and how many are only damages dealers, so they have *NOTHING*. I am lucky : I am MT.<br>
- With godly weapons (for instance, the 1HB 40 damage, 35 delay, from Grieg's End, easy to get for a non-Vindi capable guild !), damage output for paladins (I don't know well for SKs) is almost... or maybe more than warriors one. *with equal difficulty gear* (try to list warriors' only weapons dropped on mobs that are on the same difficulty than for paladins' one, and take a good laugh).<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong. I don't want damage increase. I don't want nerfs on other classes. I don't want to be able to solo some dragon.<br>
I only want to do my job : to be the meat shield and actually to have tools to assume this role.<br>
And I want to be UNIQUE. I *WANT* to have something, even if not really useful (like criticals before AA), that makes a warrior not only an ersatz of a paladin/sk.<br>
Now, our class ability only resume to this : Defensive. <br>
And this is quite sad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Hell, I think I would have been more happy with a useless class specific AA skill, like to be able to summon beer at will, rather than to have the impression to be slapped in the face when I see things like &quot;bandage wounds&quot;.<br>

There are not 2-3 paladins on any one given server bigger than warriors.  <br>
<br>
My friend paladin who I gerouped with has 3600 base hps, he is not uber.  He is wearing full SS armour, has some decent weapons and miscellaneous stuff.  <br>
<br>
As a contrast, I have full warlord (NTOV) armour excluding bracer(champions/SS), Helm(SS), BP(Cobalt), I duel wield epics, have a CoF and some decent supplimentary stuff.  <br>
<br>
He has 200-300hps more than me. <br>
<br>
He is not uber, I am considered to be more uber than him. <br>
<br>
If we are 1% better than any other tank, then we are still better ? Sure we are, but you are so single minded as to not realise.....HELLOOOO!!!! We dont get FD, we dont get celestial heal, SOW, Snare, DoTS, Ressurection.  <br>
<br>
EVEN IF we were 1% better than everyone else at doing OUR job, I would personally have a paladin anyday of the week.  They hold aggro better anyway and can heal themselves.<br>
<br>
What class are youagain ??? You mention zones such as CT are much more friendly for warriors.  <br>
<br>
Question:  Have you ever been a warrior in CT ? <br>
<br>
Allow me to demonstrate a warriors life in CT...Puller brings something in(could be warrior), cleric heals - aggro to cleric - warriors fights for aggro off cleric - cleric DAs, warrior has aggro, Ench tashes and slows(if you dont have a shaman), mob goes for enchanter and bashes ench until it has around 50% life back.  Warrior finally gets aggro when mob at 50% then it ping pongs between the melees(and possibly cleric). <br>
<br>
This equates to around 40-50% of the overall warrior's point of view in CT.  <br>
<br>
Granted I dont have brilliant weapons, but they are better than most of my level.  So, if I have trouble what about a warrior with &lt; weapons than me.  <br>
<br>
Sorry bud but your FoS (and I have provided you with enough evidence to support this)<br>

<br>
Completely incorrect.  Sorry.  The point is not to make Warriors the ONLY viable tank class.  Paladins and Shadow Knights will still retain their status versus the mobs.  The point is to make Warriors significantly better at absorbing damage that if you have a Warrior and Paladin standing side by side in exactly equal gear and you need someone who will main tank, you'll pick the Warrior.  Because thats all we do and all we can do.<br>
<br>
If we can't do it significantly enough better than the Knights  and Monks, then why have a Warrior when you can get a Knight with their additional spell abilities?  Or a Monk with their additional pulling abilities?<br>
<br>
Granted, Knights probably get the majority of their groups because of their ability to tank.  But the point is they CAN do other things.  A Warrior can't.<br>
<br>
So yes, all other things being equal, a Warrior should clearly be the better tanking choice.  But Knights should still be able to do the job.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uthorena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 10:22:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=428>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  dont understand</span><hr size=1> I really don't understand the warriors complaint.  <br>

<br>
Basically, what I am saying is that it becomes vary situational.  At the level 60 with lots of aaxp part of the game, pallies are great healers for zones where the mobs do very little damage because they can tank AND heal.  If you have a shaman with torpor, the pally is probably not needed for healing, and maybe a warrior is a better choice, or a rogue, or a monk...  <br>
<br>
I have ALWAYS believed that you can throw any 6 players of any classes of similar levels together and get decent experience in some zone (exception being 6 clerics).<br>
<br>
Duoing with a pally is pretty good experience.  Duoing with another warrior isn't nearly as good.  Duoing with a monk makes me feel pretty stupid because the monk can tank weak mobs much easier than I can.<br>
<br>
Pallies can be tanks for groups.  But they can also be the crowd control for a group.  Or they can be the group's healer.  Or they can be the damage dealer if undead is your target.<br>
<br>
Warriors can be tanks for groups.<br>
<br>
Because of this distinct difference, warriors do truly need to have an edge on tanking mobs.  I don't mind seeing pallies being the tank for a group.  But I should be better at it since I can't do crowd control or be a group's healer.<br>
<br>
I am one-dimensional.  I chose it.  I wanted to be a tank.  I wanted to be the one taking the beating.  <br>
<br>
Pallies CHOSE to be multi-faceted.  Pallies knew when they became pallies that they were going to have spell casting abilities.  They knew that they were going to have some advantages versus undead.  They had to have known that since they had these advantages that their tanking ability would have to be less than warriors.<br>
<br>
Warrior vs Paladin should be a dead issue.  Both classes chose what they would be.  The only difference is that besides some extra hps, warriors are now not that much better than a paladin for tanking.  If my cleric can sit there full mana in an experience group and start nuking like crazy to ease the boredom on an experience grind, then it doesn't matter if I am tanking or a pally. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20383">Hulanta</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 11:19:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=430>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  ROFL</span><hr size=1> &quot;If paladins are so overpowerded how come when sleeper key time comes several warriors will have keys before paladins. &quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps for the following reasons?<br>
<br>
- Warriors will generally GREATLY outnumber Paladins<br>
<br>
- BECAUSE Warrior taunt is screwed, warriors need as much prosthetic help as they can get to generate aggro, and Avatar helps this<br>
<br>
- BECAUSE warrior defense is not up to par, dead warriors are a fact of life and backup tanks need the same prosthetic help as above to maintain taunt.<br>
<br>
Warriors don't get primal weapons because of strict DPS additions, they get it because Avatar helps us in maintaining aggro by adding +100 Atk, and Maxing proc possibilities.  In ohter words we get it because we're broken as a class.<br>

And I am not a Pally, btw. I can't stand the Knight classes for playstyle. I love the classes in a group, just like other classes. But I could never play one, they can't dual-weild. I am leveling my Warrior, so I am not just some troll here to b*tch. I have seen a decent chunk of the high end game, and know what is in store for my Tank.<br>
<br>
And your CT story...obviously you played with some peeps that don't know how to manage agro. I was MA there for a bit (60 Ranger), and could hold agro fine, but was dying or running the group lom. Once we got a Warrior in the group, we mopped the place. You see, you don't HAVE to tash-slow immediately if you have a Warrior with better than Cobalt bp *cough*. Nor do you have to worry about Heal agro on Cleric if Cleric knows when &amp; what to heal with.<br>
<br>
You think this game would be any better if a Warrior could just Taunt &amp; hold a mob while debuffers/damage dealers just waxed it?. The AI in Everquest is stupid, but its not completely retarded. So as to me being FoS, get a clue...and some gear.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this thread should be about adding utility/fun to the Warrior class, not complaining about other classes abilities. It seems very easy for critics to freak out on other melee, yet offer nothing to the debate on what Warriors could gain. Other than just upping the offense/defense/agro scale....which is not a solution. It would just be a continuation of the same problem.<br>

<br>
Well said!  I agree, and I think most paladins agree, that warriors should have an edge on tanking.  I think mostly we are just arguing over the degree of superiority your edge should provide you.<br>
<br>
Bear in mind that a generic paladin, level 52-58 can tank for a group moderately well.  Depending on gear, he might be able to do almost as well as a warrior.  At 59 paladins get nice spell that will help them out tanking, and at 60, most paladins start to invest in AAXP.  HOWEVER, and this is pretty important, a paladin doesn't really become a threat to the warrior as group tank until he invests in several of the Melee Archetypal AA skills.  And a paladin can't really own the role of group healer until he has several Priest Archetypal AA skills.  Before that point, the paladin is similar to a warrior a few levels lower, but who can contribute some mana to the group.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I don't want to take away from the core point, which is that most paladins agree warriors should be able to tank better than us.  But the consensus is that warriors shouldn't be A LOT better than us.<br>
<br>
Fixing Taunt and mitigation seem to be the two things that really ought to be done to straighten out the high-end game.  <br>
<br>
Would a gradual decrease in the delay of the taunt skill to 2seconds at level 60 help warriors enough?  What about the oft-suggested &quot;armor mitigation factor&quot; where damage taken is modified based on armor type (heavy plate, light plate, chain, etc)?<br>
<br>
Perhaps these two in conjunction could boost warriors to a point where they would be happy without leaving paladins in the Dark Ages of Kunark again.<br>

<br>
or something like that *smiles*<br>
<br>
It's just like when Verant nerfed (or fixed) the extra regen trolls and iksar got from AA points. Were lots of angry trolls and iksar posting that they were meant to be x % better and now they were just ending up the same after having thought they were making the 'smart' choice<br>

maybe its time you feel a little bad after 2 years of feeling smug at making the 'right' choice<br>

<br>
&quot;I really don't understand the warriors complaint. <br>

You guys are still the best tanks in game. Your skills are higher in offensive and defensive. <br>
<br>
Take a paladin and a warrior in seb<br>

60 warrior full ss gear epic<br>

<br>
Warriors have trouble getting agro but fact is you pay for that difficulty by having higher hps ac and dps. <br>
<br>
If paladins are so overpowerded how come when sleeper key time comes several warriors will have keys before paladins. <br>
<br>
Sorry warrriors are still the best tanks you may have trouble getting and holding agro but you have skills that offest that difficulty. The only difference now is that when the group is generated next time and that warrrior isnt around the paladin can fill in. When groups start taking a paladin 5 or more lvls lower then a warrior that is avaiable then you can complain.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
THE COMPLAINT ISN'T THAT WARRIORS SUCK AT TANKING NOW, IT'S THAT IF THINGS CONTINUE ON THIS CURRENT TREND, WARRIORS WILL HAVE EVEN LESS VALUE THAN THEY HAVE NOW! Jesus.<br>
<br>
Why the hell are paladins/SKs upset? We're @#%$ asking for an upgrade to PLATE CLASS (hello, ring a bell?) mitigation tables. <br>
<br>
Warriors (for the most part) aren't complaining about SKs/paladins being more preferable tanks, but rather monks.<br>
<br>
How many god damn times is the same tired, old &quot;but you have defensive discipline!&quot; argument going to be used? It holds no weight.  The fact of the matter is, warriors have far outgrown the use for defensive and evasive. They should be removed from the game, and a SEPERATE mitigation table for warriors, SKs, and paladins should be implemented.  Any tank class that can wear plate should benefit from this, though paladins/SKs to a slightly lesser extent than warriors.<br>
<br>
And then there's taunt, and I found this quote very amusing:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry warrriors are still the best tanks you may have trouble getting and holding agro but you have skills that offest that difficulty.&quot;<br>
<br>
We have skills to offset that difficulty? Oh, you meant BANDAID FIXES? How very silly of me! What skills were you referring to exactly? AE taunt? Chuckle. Warcry? Laugh.<br>
<br>
Warriors should never have complete control of agro, but we should at least have some ability to garner agro aside from holding hands in a chanting prayer vigil, hoping, begging, PLEADING to the powers that be that we can get the attention of Ssra Snake_00.<br>
<br>
Did I state that taunt doesn't work on mobs above level 60? And that this is AFTER it was upgraded back in Kunark? It SHOULD have a chance, however miniscule, to help the warrior get the mob on him, no matter what level it may be. As it stands, we rely on lame ass enraging blow weapons or using AE taunt, a skill that was NEVER intended to be used in the way it is now.<br>
<br>
And let us not forget that for every all/all +100 to +125 hp item released in this game, we narrow the gap in hitpoints.  A gap which, mind you, is the ONLY thing that seperates warriors from other classes at this point.<br>
<br>
You can't say we have higher ac, because we don't, thanks to the AC softcap.<br>
<br>
You can't say we take hits better than other tanks (monks specifically, and yes, I DID call monks tanks)because we don't, once again, thanks to the AC softcap.<br>
<br>
So the only thing we have going for us right now is pure, raw hp, and, my friends, that divider comes closer to cracking every expansion that has been released. Unless we receive some type of upgrade now, or actually get a designer that KNOWS what a warriors' job is in EQ, we may very well be seeing what is becoming the uselessness of the warrior class (and to an extent, knights as well). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwolf362.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wolf362</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 1:54:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=436>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_die.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The State of Warriors in EQ</span><hr size=1> well, as to all the above post, I play a pally and I prefer warrior tanking over me, why so that if a caster gets aggro I am free to rip that aggro off them, also yes I can see your guys taunts need some help, but if I see a LFG warrior and we have room he gets on list and or gets in group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ufrodlin7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 2:05:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=437>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  !</span><hr size=1> &quot;Warriors (for the most part) aren't complaining about SKs/paladins being more preferable tanks, but rather monks.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am!  I'm complaining about both.  I'm complaining because monks shouldn't be able to take hits anywhere near as well as we do, but ALSO because Paladins and SK's (Sk's to a FAR lesser degree than Paladins, because SK's didn't get the upgrades that Paladins did, and because of the disease cloud aggro nerf) have a power base that when summed up in far greater than the agregate total power base of warriors.  <br>
<br>
Someone pondered earlier about what would happen if Warriors got in essence the spell side of Paladins at 90% effectiveness.  I thought about that, and it amazed me how much difference there really is in aggregate total power bases, and how on this thread alone, Paladins are trying to narrow it down to such a degree that it's irrelevant.  Let me give you a clue, it IS relevant, it IS power, and it VASTLY exceeds the power of warriors.<br>
<br>
If your DPS is approximately 90% of a warrior's, which I doubt, as Paladins DO get better weapons, and the argument is that you should be equivalent in tanking skills with warriors, which I find utterly preposterous, or even 90%, then do you REALLY think that only 10% of your abilities are in the hybrid specific abilities, or spells/Skills?   I find that laughable, and disingenuous on your part.   <br>
<br>
So, what should warriors HAVE to compensate for the following?<br>
<br>
Lay Hands<br>
Heals<br>
Buffs<br>
Self Haste<br>
Resurrection<br>
Root<br>
Group Heals<br>
Slay Undead<br>
2h Bash<br>
100% fear immunity<br>
<br>
What warriors DID have:<br>
<br>
Crits/crips (gone)<br>
Higher AC (gone)<br>
Better Gear (gone)<br>
Higher HP (still there, but the gap has closed)<br>
Disciplines (Still there, but their usefulness is diminished)<br>
Dual Wield<br>
Kick (Disappeared with the advent of 2h bash as a difference)<br>
<br>
So, it's 600 HP on average, and Dual Wield, and /disc defensive?  That's the tradeoff?  If you think that's &quot;fairness&quot; or &quot;balance&quot; you're full of it, that's imbalance in it's entirety, and for you to say that by giving us a mitigation boost that YOU shouldn't get to compensate for the non-disparity in class specific armor is simply wrong.  A full mana bar is nothing but &quot;reserve, allocatable hitpoints&quot; which you have and we don't.<br>
<br>
So, answer the question, what SHOULD warriors have?  Do you REALLY think that warriors should have what they have to compensate?  600HP, Dual wield, and /disc defensive?  Do you think that warriors should have a little bit more?  If not, please explain how the power difference can be justified. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uchavr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>chavr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 2:47:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=438>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_rip.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: !</span><hr size=1> you've left out some things warriors have.<br>

It is the opinons and ideas of people like frodlin that sadden me.  These are the people that can't stand the thought of another class being competitive against warriors for groups.  Thankfully verant has ignored selfish opinons like this and from this point on so will I. <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

<br>
And don't put words in my mouth, or attribute greed to ME.  I NEVER said that warriors should be irreplaceable, just the logical choice when it comes to Melee tanking, the first choice, the best.  It's all we do.<br>
<br>
Your little points spread inlcuded only 1-2 things that were really valid, the rest were nothing but stretches... Broader choices?  WTF is that supposed to mean?  That we can have MORE stuff that's inferior to yours and we're supposed to be happy?<br>
<br>
The &quot;Spell Effects on Gear&quot; argument is about the most pathetic I've seen.  If having spells on gear that you're not supposed to naturally have is a big issue, how come so many Paladins camp Stormfeather?  The ONLY spell effect which we have on gear which you don't is Invis, but guess what...that's now covered too.  You don't believe in weapons procs, or gear effects?  You never used a DW helm?  Eyepatch of Plunder?  Monks can't summon 100% weight reduction bags full of throwing hammers?  Warriors are one class who gets spell effects on armor, AS EVERY OTHER F*ING CLASS ALSO DOES.<br>
<br>
Newsflsh...Triple attack is nothing, period, it's nothing.  It's a proc, like any other proc, it's entirely unreliable, and rarely does it have any substantive meaning.<br>
<br>
Your only credible points were &quot;key Parts of raids&quot; and &quot;Higher Caps&quot;... I left those out.  The rest are nothing but intellectual gymnastics.   Now, I'll agree that I didnt' put those in my list, so put em in there.  Do you STILL think that that is &quot;balanced&quot; with your spells/skills?  <br>
<br>
Oh, and throw out any disc other than Defensive and Evasive because they're all garbage, and meaningless.<br>

You want DPS, get a Rogue and/or a Monk.<br>
<br>
broader range of wpns - Which we can't use because we are forced use a very small selection of weapons because our taunt doesn't work for @#%$.<br>
<br>
broader range of gear - In what significant way?  List some examples, because from where I sit there is no SIGNIFICANT difference in the high end gear attainable.  We might get some toys that Paladins don't but that's what they are, toys.<br>
<br>
higher avoidance caps - Yeah, you're right we do get slightly higher avoidance caps.  But not as high as a Monk's.  And this means what exactly?  I would gladly trade the higher avoidance caps in exchange for being able to heal myself while fighting.  Or even to be able to stun reliably.<br>
<br>
multiple discs over multiple levels - Which we don't use because of the GD refresh time and the fact that we may need Defensive or Evasive.<br>
<br>
A MAINSTAY FOR RAIDING FORCES - Yup, defensive makes this true.  And no other reason what so ever.  Our three minutes of glory.<br>
<br>
spell effects on gear - Minor enhancement.  A nice to have but not a make or break.  When was the last time someone included a Warrior in a group because of the heals from his Cobalt BP?  And things like BP of Fiery Might are also Paladin useable.  And how many Warriors actually get these things?  Compared to how many Paladins get heals, roots, and stuns?  Get real.<br>
<br>
triple attack - Fires off every once in a great while.  I doubt people include us in groups because triple attack might fire. <br>
<br>
did I mention the whole KEY PART OF RAIDS thing? - Yup you sure did.  Thanks for bringing it to our attention, because we were completely unaware of it.  Of course this could very well not be the case once PoP comes out.<br>
