At 50+ we bordering on owerpowered now.

Fact is now at 54 i would prefer to have another warrior in group with me over any other melee class. Fact is that group of 2 warriors, druid, enchanter, shaman, cleric, can do anything they want in Sebilis and fight to any area fast but when same group replaced 1 warrior of lvl 53 with ranger of lvl 55 they could not do most of same things.  <p>      &nbsp &nbsp<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="red"><b>Champion</b><br></FONT>

Post 50 Warriors really come into their own, in fact they have matured into what they should have ALWAYS been in my opinion - The Masters of Battle.  I retired my Warrior about 6 months ago, but after seeing the way they perform in the higher lev Kunark zones I dusted him down and I have started playing him again. These days no tank can perform like a Warrior - sure the journey there maybe be painful, but well worth it in the end I think !<br>

<br>
Well, things are different now. The higher in season ye gits, the margin o' difference gits wider and wider. Over time, yer AC, HP, Magic Resist, and higher skill caps surpass any other class by a significant amount. And soon whut wuz only a subtle difference that gave groups reason to PREFER us becomes an obvious and noticeable difference that gives groups reason to NEED us.<br>

The more trainin' ye gits, the more like a true Warrior ye become.

Last night I logged on as my warrior for the first time since the last patch. I decided a little tes mach gnoll sounded like a good breakfast so I head over to SK and do my usual shout &quot;25 tank lookin for gnoll/PH group&quot;. As I expected I got a reply in a few minutes. What I didnt expect is what the reply was &quot;What class are you?&quot; i say warrior &quot;sorry, were waiting for a palli or ranger&quot; Ok, I figure there just freaks so I shout for a few more mins finally I get another one, same question. But this time I ask for a reason &quot;we need someone that can heal themselves up, sorry&quot;. Now I'm pissed. For the next two hours I couldnt find a group, ended up solo'ing rook's. So I get curious what the hell is different and go out to a few message boards. After reading the posts about the pallie/sk/rngr mana buff up it dawns on me whats happened, in one fell swoop verant has made me &quot;less desirable&quot; to a group, to the point where I couldnt get in a group. And why should a group want me? Pallies with a good 2hs can do close to as much damage as me with the added bonus now that they have the  same mana as a cleric! And don't tell me crits make up for it, with my axe I get one every 4 battles or so. And a pallie my level has 40 less hp's, and the couple I asked had better ac too. WTF?! Maybe if I could afford a yak life would be different but right now I feel as usefull as a OOM pallie  =(<br>

Does any of you get bothered by damage disparity between a warrior and a mob?  Maybe at 50+ we get more powerfull but not there yet.  Here is a few suggestions.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1. Improve the damage on the warrior some. I should hit at least as hard as a damn greenie. <br>
2. Make sure criticals hit more often and cripples as a random hit instead of beserk only. I go through several fights without a single critical. Yes, I had a shaman buff my dex, and it was still pathetic to a point I told him not to bother with dex buffs. Rogues get several backstabs in a fight and I get zip one the critical.<br>
3. Give us a new fighting skill at 45.<br>

Its a point where other classes already got their perks but we do not blum till around lvl 30, and alot of people who new to game do not realise that and forget to make warrior frieds, which results later in high lvl guilds of druids necros and some rangers paladins that spend all their time lookin for warrior to recrute. At lvl 25 is your time to find your stady group that you going to play with for next 20 lvls at least. You need to realise your price, warrior, cleric and enchanter are 3 essential classes that everyone needs.

With a wurmslayer and an fbss I finally now do some decent damage. I rarely have trouble taunting anymore. Before the fbss, even with wurmslayer, or 2 yaks, even with a speed buff, I was having trouble taunting the mob off casters.<br>
I still have trouble taunting a mob off a hybrid if they've snared or stunned it. They do take more damage than I do, at least.<br>
I'd like to see crippling blows be a LOT more common once we drop into bubble 2. With Complete Heal being the most efficient way to heal us, it makes little sense for a healer to keep us in the red when crippling blows are few and far between. Maybe my luck is just bad, but I've never seen a good crippling blow- my crits are much better. I've done 95 normal damage with wurmslayer, 156 crit, and maybe a 117 crip. That's with a dex buffed to 150+.<br>
The other point I agree on is a combat skill at 45. As it stands we get zip from 35 (the useless disarm skill- disarm a mob and it does the same dmg, and you possibly lose the loot) to 50+ when stun kicks &amp; disciplines arrive.<br>
It is a good time to up skills you've neglected, but another defense skill would be nice. Or instill doubt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
It kinda irks me that bards, rogues, and monks can scare<br>
a critter more than a snarling juggernaut in dented plate armor wielding a bloody axe. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Guess I am kinda bitchin, but it just irks the hell outta me. Maybe it would be different for me if I could afford a fbss or any of the other uber loot mentioned but gotta settle for the puny little axe of mine. I just have never been ostracised from a group because of my class before, and it really ticked me off bad, I mean I can still solo low blues but wheres the fun in that? I just fear for my ability to get into groups, not all of those my level are as worldly wise as you guys and as far as there concerned a &quot;self healing tank&quot; is alot more valuable than a taunter. Guess thats the drawback to being anti-social through the first 20 lvl's of my career hehe. I need a ale, wheres Meddik when ya need him  =P<br>

<br>
Some of the low-mid levels can be rough on Clerics as well. <br>
<br>
At 19-23, We have Healing, but so do Druids/Shaman<br>
At 29-33, We have Greater Heal, but so do Druids/Shaman<br>
<br>
Not to mention that like you, we can't travel safely without help. (No SoW/Ports/Invis/Etc. for us, no FD/Sneak/Camo for you.)<br>
<br>
It takes a while to grind through it, but like Clerics, Warriors peak later in the game. at the mid-levels we don't have the advantages that some classes do, but at higher levels who is the basis for a good group? Cleric/Warrior. <br>
<br>
Druids/Shamen can fill in for a cleric, but you can notice a big difference. <br>
<br>
Pallies/SKs can fill in for warriors, but you notice a big difference.<br>
<br>
Although I don't have a ton of experience with them, I understand that Enchanters have the same problem as well. Noone cares about them until they hit 29 and get clarity. (With Breeze now, it may not be as bad for them, but they still don't show their true power until higher levels, when grouped with players who know how to work with an enchanter.) <p><CENTER><B>Meddik Sawbones</B><BR><A HREF="http://24.19.82.195/~orbis/">Orbis Honesti</A> Guild, Bristlebane Server</CENTER>

<br>
The answer is NO. But this is a good thing. I consider warriors specialists becuase we have the most hp and highest ac and the best taunt. Clerics and wizards are specialists in my opininon (ie. cleric heals the most, wizzie nukes the best). That makes us the best tank period. That is why the best post 40's and I imagine post 50's groups will always have a cleric and a warrior. Specialization has become the key in EQ high lvl groups. Druids are in my humble opinion are prolly the lamest group members at high lvl's being very poor healers and lousy nukers as well, but the evac is a lifesaver sometimes I will agree.<br>

There's a difference between bein' a balanced class...and askin' whether the class system in general is balanced (thus ensurin' a need/purpose fer our class).<br>
<br>
If yer askin' whether the Warrior has a place inna class system...is there a need fer us? Do we serve a purpose? The answer is a hearty AYE. In that respect, ye can consider us balanced...in regards ta how we interact and relate with and compliment the hunting party.<br>
<br>
But whut Uther says is true as well. Are we balanced by ourselves? Nay. Few classes are...if any. The gods created the world in a way that requires that we seek each other out ta conquer the challenges that Norrath has ta offer. But we didn't become Warriors ta be &quot;balanced&quot;...we became Warriors ta become the best o' the best at whut we do -- armed combat.<br>
<br>
We coulda given up a little bit o' Hp here...and a snipput o' AC there...and mebe tossed out sum skill with the blade...Then we coulda sat in sum library and read sum books on how ta practice withcraft...or how ta smell animal dung or how ta be sneaky...<br>
<br>
Bah. That ain't who we are. We ain't interested in bein' well-rounded. We're only interested in knowin' that when sumbody wants the BEST...they call the Warrior. <p><a href="http://www.feir-dal.net/tavern/bios/Jaikar.html"><IMG SRC="http://www.feir-dal.net/JaikarSig.JPG"></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=41.topic&start=21&stop=29>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=154.topic"> << Prev Topic </a> &nbsp;| <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=140.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.emailToFriend?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend">Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.threadControl?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub14.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><b>jump to:</b><br><select name=forumName><option value="thesteelwarriorthearena">The Arena<option value="thesteelwarriorthebattlefield">The BattleField<option value="thesteelwarriorthebunker">The Bunker<option value="thesteelwarriorthetavern">The Tavern<option value="thesteelwarriorfrm6">The Keep</select><br><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior>The Steel Warrior</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org">The Steel Warrior website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.free-irewards.com/cgi-bin/ezboard/games.html?id=ouuIcESe" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/banners/iRewards120x30-08.gif"></a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=7279965&siteid=33932331&bfpage=compstratgames" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
