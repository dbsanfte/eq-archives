Monk Defense.  Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; as far back as before the launch of Kunark.Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem.  Monk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)  It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.<br>

Yes, this should (if they don't screw it up) restore the balance between plate tanks and monks to where it should be, but it always sucks to get nerfed.  I wish it would have been done as an upgrade for plate types instead of a nerf for monks.<br>

Plate classes are where they should be, the problem is that monks are at the same level, and they shouldn't be.  Upgrading plate would only screw the game up more.  The nerf is the best way to handle it, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
And this patch does not &quot;Suck&quot; for manaburn wizzies.  It sucks for manaburn wizzies that formed posses and hit anything and everything they could.  Manaburn is still the tool it should be, without the exploitation.  Bravo on a fix.<br>
<br>
Modrod 2 was broke, and it was broke bad.  With modrod 2, you could keep a cleric CH chain going literally forever.  If you don't run out of mana, you don't run out of healing, you can not lose encounters.<br>
<br>
CH...I'm not sure why they bothered.  7500 hp isn't even a glimmer in a lot of people's eyes, so I dunno what the deal is.  It's not like CH is used to heal a warrior from 1hp to full anyway, so this will really impact the game little.<br>
<br>
And i'm not sorry to say it, but monks need to be knocked down a little.  There's a reason you can't walk 5 feet without seeing an Iksar Sensei monk..and it's not because they're so desired in groups.  Playing a monk with a fungi became playing this game on god mode essentially.  You kill crap so fast and take so little damage that you have no downtime at all.<br>
<br>
There's 2 kinds of people playing this game.  The kind that can't see the forest for the trees, and those people will get pissed off and hopefully a lot of them will leave.  The other kind know what's screwed up in this game and brought about these changes because they are needed to have some semblance of balance. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986">Veteran Haass Wolvesbane</a> <BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943">Venerable Cagna Soulshaker</a>

As for the other changes, seem ok. Although I am a little worried that a lot of luclin encounters will be extremely hard and/or require obscene amount of clerics present, now that mod rod II is basically the same as a necros twitch spell.<br>

I am guessing some current mobs will be unbeatable for a while, until the increased power gains from getting levels in PoP kicks in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usmushums.showPublicProfile?language=EN>smushums</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Steel Warrior Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 1403<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/9/02 5:16:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4103.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> the CH change was for PoP <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7023  target="web">smushums<a</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utogr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Togr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/9/02 8:08:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4103.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> &quot;Since there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of mana regeneration is mandatory for the encounter to be beaten by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be re-tuned to shorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit points on the NPC in question.&quot;<br>

I think this will mainly be focused on Luclin mobs but will really get rid of some raid encounters from being just a long ass grind (i mean exp grinding is bad enough, raiding is supposed to be fun after all!) <p><BR><BR><center><b><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=352044">

I think for monks though, it's a wait and see as to what actually happens.  They still have to pull mobs that quad for 700, and flurry.<br>

All plate classes and many chain wearers top the softcap against most mobs.  Monks obviously do too though how much difference this &quot;solution&quot; from verant will make remains to be seen.  Of course as verant admitted, the all/all gear has messed things up too.  Warriors use to get better AC gear than other classes, including the other plate wearers.  Of course that was when getting more AC actually mattered.  Now most of the newer stuff is wearable by all plate wearers or by everyone.  Make AC matter for higher end players and itemize so warriors consistently have the highest AC gear as it should be.  Verant seems to take a back a$s words way to addressing their problems when they address them at all.  I guess they're in a situation on the gear where they already screwed it up though and they're certainly not going to go back and adjust the stats on all the gear.  It's just boggling that they messed up itemization for so long.<br>
<br>
here's a question... we know that warriors with 1k AC and wizards with 1k AC do not mitigate the same.  That's according to verant's latest annoucement about the changes.  well, actually they said &quot;defends&quot; differently.  I don't know if that means just the higher defense skills on the warrior that lead to more avoidance or if it refers to mitigation.  anyway, what about a warrior and say, a paladin?  If their AC is the same, is their dmg mitigation the same?  From the many requests from warriors to be moved to our own mitigation table, I guess most people think that it IS in fact the same mitigation as other plate wearers and maybe as all other classes.  Is the description of the monk changes saying that wizards for instance already got less benefit from their AC, but monks got the same as warriors, so no they're changing it?<br>

I think this is one of the most promising patches I have ever seen im my 3+ years. Being an ex-Necro, I know what being beaten by the nerf stick feels like (ok we fell out of the nerf tree and hit every branch on the way down), but I also took those changes as a challenge. I knew that at the time I was overpowered, but I was going to use it to my advantage until they took it away, and take it away they did! But it never bothered me, I just found a different way to do what I did. <br>
<br>
The same will happen here. People will adjust to the new environment, and move on.  <p><A HREF ="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89208"> Valhalan Trueblade</A><BR>
