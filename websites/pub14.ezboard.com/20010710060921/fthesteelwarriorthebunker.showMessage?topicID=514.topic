In normal exp group situations this usually isn't a problem, if I'm pulling I can get ownership of a mob before it even reaches my group, but in 2+ group situations, in Kael arena, DN, Siren's, Velketor, I usually am assist guy, and a 60 pali or sk will be pulling (I'm only 55 currently.)  It's extremely difficult to maintain aggro in these situations, with high level mobs, and I'm forced to try and hold aggro off (typical situation):<br>
<br>
lvl 60 pali<br>
lvl 60 sk (w/epic)<br>
up to 3 lvl 54-60 monks (w/epic)<br>
60 shaman slowing<br>
54-58 enc tash<br>
<br>
In certain cases (Kael mainly) I can usually hold aggro by hugging the mob while all others stay just inside of melee range - but it's really not *me* taunting, it's a more the nature of the game mechanics, yet I still will have to chase the mob down off the enchanter and shaman in most cases after they've tash/malo/slowed, unless the sk or pali is holding aggro during that time.<br>
<br>
So anyway enough talk, basically looking for any suggestions on high taunt weapons - frostbringer is very nice, or would be if it wasn't cold-based, thus near worthless in most of SoV.  I plan on retaining that for offhand use simply due to its nice dmg/del ratio, but open to any other ideas.  Primarily after a good primary weapon - money is not much of an object,  nor is killing a mob that drops the weapon, just looking for advice and experience.<br>

<br>
 Chelaki tail is rare drop off, you guessed it, Chelakis. And Swarmer pincers are rare drops off the swarming beetles you trigger as traps.<br>
<br>
 Frosty is actually a pretty good taunter BTW, was using one in primary a lot before I got my epics. At 60 triple attack makes up for slightly slower weapons a little bit. And if 9/19 isn't handling the taunt to your liking then nothing short of a high-taunt proc is going to. So swap that Frosty into primary and try that out a bit, a resisted proc is still a good taunt generally. <p><B>Grimmlokk</B><Forlorn><BR>

Sure, the times you can actually do it are nice but it's not like you're a failure as a warrior if you don't all the time.  If the mob is staying on the enchanter/shaman then there might be a problem, but if it's a couple hits then you turn them it's ok.  This is nothing to seriously worry about right now but I will offer some suggestions all the same.<br>
<br>
1.  The main reason you can't hold aggro when you want to is because of your level, not your weapons.  If there are a bunch of 60s around you and you're 55 it's just going to be natural.  Also, if the mobs are over 50 it's twice as hard to taunt off someone higher level.  My warrior leveled slower than the rest of my normal group because I was leveling 2 characters at the same time.  I had a hard time keeping aggro when the SK and Paladin were 60 and I was like 57 or 58.  Once I got 60 and epics it became much much easier though.  Actually, I got epics at 59 and while they taunt nicely I did have much more success when I actually got 60.<br>
<br>
2.  Tell the enchanter and shaman not to debuff right at the start if you can afford it.  The longer they wait, the more time you have to build up aggro; even if it's 10-15 seconds.<br>
<br>
3.  You mentioned this but continue to use distance aggro management.  Kael would be the easiest place to use this since the giants have such a large melee range.  <br>
<br>
4.  If you have 2 or more groups at most of these places, having a main tank isn't all that important.  Even the general stuff in SG that hits for 300ish isn't too bad with more than one group.  I've never done rats in DN with more than like 9 people and they drop fast as it is.  Giants aren't all that difficult to slow and once they are they're pretty weak.  Now if you're talking about mobs that hit for 500+ like Dlammaz or something then you'd need to hold aggro but otherwise it's not that necessary with multiple groups. <p>~Tunare's Enforcer~<br>

<br>
I don't want to join the long discussion on Taunt, but to add my thoughts -- controlling aggro is the responsibility of the group. The group members should know the methods to control this or they are not doing their job. I've educated many a groupmate on various aspects of controlling aggro, and most of the advice in this thread seems sound in my experience.<br>

I know that level plays a big part in my ability to taunt at this point, just was kind of out looking for something to even the playing field a bit.  Maybe next time we hit DN we'll score a whip (seem pretty rare so far though, the times we've been, never had one drop.)<br>
<br>
One weapon I've been also looking at, is a wavecrasher.  Having no luck finding the guy who drops it, but it's been fun exploring SG, very cool zone, and under-used.   Anyone have info on the named that drops this weapon?   Heard he spawns in the castle where the named Mistress is at, not sure though. <p><img src="http://mtwebster.home.mindspring.com/eqpics/warlace.JPG"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usmushums.showPublicProfile?language=EN>smushums</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/01 11:09:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Taunting weapons</span><hr size=1> im becoming a walkin armory now<br>

i got a chelaki whip the other day and i use it in main hand, it does taunt VERY well<br>

got a frostbringer too, it taunts on things in seb good and stuff, good offhand.....but things like kael it dont.  resisted procs taunt good usually, but it seems like they dont if the mob is nearly immune to it<br>

yesterday i picked up a sarnak warhammer, and i like it.<br>
between chelaki tail and sarnak warhammer, the two weapons do good taunt...and ya dont have to worry about that cold resist.   not to mention diseasing and stunning mobs helps on its own<br>

Using Cracked Claw of Zlandicar atm, at 14/25, it's pretty slow for the primary hand, but the proc does own and taunts off of an epic warrior fairly often (proc is 24ac, 55agi, 55str debuff). Coupled with a Frostbringer in offhand, it makes for a fairly nice taunting combo - and the debuffs on the two combined is nice as well, they seem to stack (at least I get no xxx wears off when both proc on same mob). <p><big><center>

This is the best place I've seen for using proximity aggro management (as i heard it called), taunt really isn't that effective, but it doesn't need to be, the mob will attack the closest pc to it.<br>

I found the frostbringer relatively useless in kael btw, the only giants I can ever reliable land the proc on without a resist were on the 2 cleric giants that guard the named, near the entrance to the temple (the guys that drop defiance, and the heads for PoG quest), and resisted frostbringer proc has never been much of a taunt that I've seen. <p><img src="http://mtwebster.home.mindspring.com/eqpics/warlace.JPG"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/unoringrimsbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Norin Grimsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/01 12:57:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Taunting weapons</span><hr size=1> Git back in yer cave, Tem.
