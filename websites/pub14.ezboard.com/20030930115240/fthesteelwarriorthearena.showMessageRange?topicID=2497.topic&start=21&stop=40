We also had a rogue in the group. I stood shoulder to shoulder with him and stunned on engagement to allow the chanter to tash and slow. This got me aggro instead of the warrior...but also kept aggro off of the chanter. A few combat rounds later, the warrior usually had aggro. <br>
<br>
This warrior had much better tanking ability than I did, but he didn't have the aggro generating ability I did. After a while, he figured out that I didn't do anything to purposefully take aggro once he had it solidly, and that I wasn't trying to be MT. I just took aggro to keep it off the chanter. We worked very well together to get mobs on him and keep aggro off of the soft underside of our group. <br>
<br>
You can be grouped with high aggro classes that like to showboat. A paladin or shadowknight that likes to be MT regardless of the circumstances is something you really can't control other than through the disband button. When played well, they can also be very usefull to the group. The warrior needs to understand what the SK/PAL is trying to do though. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686">Graal MacBladefury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Actually,<br>
<br>
Tanking can stack to some degree, just never really in the same ballpark as damage dealing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
/shield discipline was supposed to be a method to &quot;stack&quot; tanking...  it still has many issues as most warriors have mentioned.<br>
<br>
Shadow Knights can pretty much tank when they want to...  with taunt spells that only a chanter/shammy can match and Death Peace, we can pretty much decide when we are going to tank.<br>
Add on top of this Lifetaps, GROUP lifetaps, and the Voice line, SKs are one of the best available methods to stack tanking...<br>
Warrior tanks until he's about to die... and backs off, SK darks and uber taunts...  done it before when the cleric had gone down.<br>
<br>
Paladins can also take a part in &quot;stacked&quot; tanking...  their group heals allow them to heal both themselves AND their warrior counterpart...  Paladins stun/root and back out leaving the warrior taunting furiously.<br>
<br>
<br>
That being said, I think the point of his post was the fact that warriors feel like a third wheel sometimes as their damage dealing is both underestimated AND less than ideal in practice.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warriors damage dealing role does need to be addressed.  I would love to see the following happen:<br>
<br>
-Fix the PoP &quot;2H additional attack&quot; AAXP to work with whatever is in your primary hand period.  Just about every melee class will be happy.<br>
<br>
-Warriors/SK/Paladins given the option of using a &quot;hand-and-a-half&quot; sword.  These blades are PRIMARY only and have much higher ratios than normal (look at Pal/SK only 1H weapons) as well as a damage bonus nearing that of a 2H weapon matched to their delay.  These weapons are heavy 1H weapons that the WAR/SK/PAL have perfected. These weapons are dual-wieldable ONLY by warriors (too heavy for everyone else) but cannot be readied in the SECONDARY hand at all. (Warriors may use a normal lighter weapon in the secondary)  Throw in a few of these designed for the warrior, and perhaps alter a few of the old knight-only ones to be war-useable.<br>
<br>
-Fix the stupid skill cap silliness...  warriors should cap at 250 piercing...  no rogue should be better SKILLWISE period. (We all know Warriors aren't going to touch rogue damage output by this change)  Adjust Knight Offense and weaponskills to 235-240 (+5offense and +10weaponskills) to match up offensive changes for the knights. (warriors using pal/sk ratio-1H and all dual wielders capable of extra attacks with primary hand should match up with a +15-25ish knight ATK boost to produce the correct effect.) <br>
<br>
-Have the shield do SOMETHING more than put someone that much furthur over the mitigation softcap please. (Perhaps allow a re-roll of Parry and Riposte - makes sense and the monks can't complain)<br>
<br>
-unnerf the mid-level monks already...  you hit the wrong guy with this nerf..  the uber monks are barely noticing and all the middle level/equipment ones can't be THAT far off their rocker.<br>
<br>
-Add a 1% /level over 50  innate mitigation bonus for warriors.  Add a 1%/level over 55 similar bonus for knights.  (or just put them both on different mititgation tables)<br>
<br>
-re-balance some of the disciplines.. /defensive needs to be less of night and day... reduce the mitigation (with innate mitigation it won't  change warriors effective mitigation though) and reduce the damage penalty as well.  Warriors should be better tanks overall WITHOUT defensive.  Knights should be better tanks than monks and rogues period.  <br>
<br>
Knight disciplines need a serious look as well... one should be offensive and the other defensive and should have some use.  Paladin Sanctification needs an overhaul, and SK leechcurse needs a tune to make it better at helping SK with damage spikes.<br>
<br>
<br>
The goal is to make warriors/knights close the damage-dealing gap between monks/rogues/rangers while getting rid of some of the dumb stuff.<br>
(and monks should be better at overall damage absorption than rogues please)<br>
Conversely, warriors shouls be the BEST at mitigation, but the rest of the field should be a spectrum, and not have warriors so dependant on /defensive.<br>
<br>
here's hopin.<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, there seem to be several powerlevelled twink alts that don't fully understand the class, or the usefullness of our spells to other players than just ourselves.<br>
<br>
I love giving the warrior any and all advantages they can get to build aggro.  I can control aggro on myself at any time during the fight... on the pull, in the middle, near the end to give the cleric time to CH the warrior, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
The only thing I give up in order to do so is spell slots, which means I may not be able to load some of my dd's or DoT's, group buff here or there, etc.<br>
<br>
Any SK that won't give you that spell is simply too close-minded becuase they are paying attention to how many dd's, dot's, etc. they can load up in their spell slots.  Dump them.<br>

<br>
You, sir, need to get off your high horse. A warrior keeping aggro is a GROUP effort. If it were so easy for me to hold taunt without help, believe me, I'd never bother the enchanter or shadowknight for an aggro buff! Perhaps YOU should play a warrior a little bit and see what we have to do to hold aggro.  <p><b><i><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75761>Kiyallmane Bloodcry</a></i></b><br>

I don't get how these examples help your argument that the classes are balanced and need to &quot;work together&quot;. Your working together examples each have the SK tanking and the warrior watching. In your second example the warrior has 3 levels on you AND voice, and STILL is less effective. That's not what I signed up for when I made a warrior. <p><A href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=140750><img border="0" src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bdiebold5/tugedit.jpg"></A></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tugurok>Tugurok</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bdiebold5/minitug.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/1/03 5:15:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brikbludgaard>Brik Bludgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/1/03 10:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2497.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmm</span><hr size=1> Turg,<br>

Apparently, you missed the part where the warrior who was 3 levels higher was tank for the party almost the whole time, and only that ONE mob/encounter was better for me to take over for...<br>
<br>
Knight taunt in that situation was of more use than warrior tanking advantage....<br>
<br>
He had more HP, and more levels....  and was a better tank for most of the time...  I simply bowed out until we met something where it exceeded his aggro abilities...<br>
That warrior backed me up and knew when to bow out.<br>
Its called teamwork.<br>

I haven't fought in Valor / Storms yet, but take the foreboding guardians in PoN for example...<br>
<br>
Level 64+ (red to me at 61 is all I know hehe), hit for just under 700 max, and use spells and HTs... Paladin drops 2 or 3 stuns on the pull, chanter / shaman can immediately slow the mob, saving probably an entire CH worth of healing in that fight. Couple taunts and/or aggro procs later, happily slowed mob is back on me and I can laugh at it without ever having touched Defensive.<br>

If I had some way to generate that kind of quick dirty aggro so slowers and debuffers could cast faster instead of waiting for me to build up enough hate, I'd be a seriously happy tank.<br>

How would your party have been any worse with you tanking the WHOLE time, and getting a real dps class to replace the warrior? How about a mage with a nice new pet? Better, right? <br>
<br>
After all, you're basically just letting the warrior tank the chaff, and then taking it over and doing better, despite his 3 extra levels and hate buff, when crunch time comes. You could have successfully tanked every single mob your party saw that day, including the named. So what exactly was the warrior doing, besides tanking mobs you simply let him tank, even though you could have tanked them yourself just fine.<br>
<br>
I still don't see it.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying things are horribly broken. But I do think they're a little broken, and the plate classes are not in real balance with each other. I think your own examples actually show that. <p><A href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=140750><img border="0" src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bdiebold5/tugedit.jpg"></A></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tugurok>Tugurok</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bdiebold5/minitug.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/1/03 11:42:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rykorbloodscream>Rykor Bloodscream</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/2/03 1:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2497.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Tugur, that's the point someone mentioned earlier.  Tanks don't stack as well as DPS classes.  My opinion ?  If you have a warrior and a SK/Pal in the same group, the group is &quot;less effective&quot; overall.  Only because 2 classes made for taking damage...and not dishing it out as well...are in one group. This means: one tank isn't doing what he's designed to do, thus making him a weak secondary damager.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, 2 tanks is sometimes nice in overpulls...or in &quot;non-mezable&quot; mob situations.  However, most times, SKs can pull singles in the planes..even when they have a chanter capable of mezing and are overly cautious *looks around innocently*....so, when i'm in the planes, an extra warrior or Paladin in my group IS effectively a less efficient spot taken.  <br>
<br>
We don't live in a perfect world, and no I don't turn down War/Pal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    However, this debate wouldn't happen if we were talking about a Monk and a Rogue...or Monk and a ranger....or a ranger and a wizard...or mage and a Rogue.  <br>
<br>
It's just when a class is made for takin' hits and not dishing them out as well, you are sorta losing out when someone else in the group tanks instead of ya.  Personally, I can't remember the last time I wasn't MT in a PoP group...this is something, by game design, that is wrong.  Can it be fixed ?  Not sure...but 2 tanks don't stack as well as 2 DPS.<br>
<br>
The good news is, when I go LFG in PoP (when I was 60+ that is) I always find a group fast...i'm in high demand.  Seems there are alot less of us tanks out there than there are DPS classes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
And, also...the group that chooses the Warrior has greater AC/HP on their side...less CHs used by the Clerics..less mana used....tho, now that SKs get Zeever's Bite....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    LOL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Anyway, the warrior is obviously more suited for tanking...tho SKs/Paladins add their own tanking abilities...and other Magicks to supplement...it's all in what ya want <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

<br>
The lack of spell slots sk's have to cast this spell and keep important spells up in spellslots.  What's so overpowered or gamebreaking about having a percent to aggro buff cast instantly especially since it lasts for 10 minutes anyways and can be recast instantly if its kept memmed? <br>
<br>
Either verant should put an item that casts voice or lower the recast to instant-30seconds. <br>
<br>
This would make both warrior's and shadowknights happy by keeping the warriors Voiced and the SKs spell slot free.<br>
