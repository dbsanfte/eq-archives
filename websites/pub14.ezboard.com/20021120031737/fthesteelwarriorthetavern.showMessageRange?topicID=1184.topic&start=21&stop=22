We also have people from other classes &quot;troll&quot; our boards (mostly clerics at the moment), but we also have reasonable people (e.g., Fulorion) come to our boards and make reasonable comments.<br>
<br>
I think the problem with the discussion, though, is based on no separation of raid vs. group advantages.<br>
<br>
In groups, paladins are so much better than warriors now that an idiot would be able to see it. Many groups do not have clerics, which makes our buffs, etc. very useful. Our healing is GOOD ENOUGH in experience groups. Our hitpoints, AC, etc. are all more than in enough in most cases. Throw in our utility spells, lay hands, etc. and, on top of that, very good aggro control, and it's easy to understand why someone would choose a paladin. The only thing we lack is DPS (I get about 40 dps with 25% haste spell, 24% haste item and an argent protector at 58th level), but we get on brought on to tank, same as a warrior.<br>
<br>
On a raid, though, most of our spells become pointless. (Remove Greater Curse is not a joke in terms of its usefulness, but it is a joke in that almost no paladin has it - clerics, shaman and druid can also cast it and it is a RARE spell.) If a raid has one paladin to BMB, that is plenty. Lay hands can be used to start the CH rotation. Healing Wave of Prexus is useful for AoE fights and that's about it. Multiple paladins are never wanted for a raid and no raid is ever called off because there is no paladin (many raids ARE called off because of no warrior or no cleric).<br>
<br>
If warriors maintained their &quot;essential&quot; status in raids, then I think there could be little argument about balance - but I understand that warriors ARE losing their essential status due to equipment. Those numbers given in the original post are WAY off form the uberest of paladin profiles I have ever seen, but despite being exaggerated there, paladins (and hell, monks) are closing in on warrior HP and we know that AC becomes a non-issue fairly quickly in the upper 50's. This does seem to leave warriors out in the cold - less preferred for groups, less effective at soloing and not essential for raids.<br>
<br>
Verant seems to be taking the path of having NO class be essential on raids - which I do believe is a good thing. However, it's clear that warriors need some boosts to make them more on par with other melee classes. It's a fine balance, and I'm not sure of the solution. I know it is not at all difficult to remember when paladins were the bottom of the barrel, couldn't get groups and were worthless on raids. From what I've seen in game, warriors aren't nearly there but if the mudflation continues, they will be.<br>
<br>
Paladins should be able to keep up with warrior tanking by use of spells (e.g., we should have fewer hitpoints but should be able to use mana to keep up - by using celestial cleansing, breath of tunare - if it were worth casting - etc.). Currently, though, it seems that &quot;we&quot; (at the very high end) can pretty much keep up without spells.<br>
<br>
Now, I have to say that at my level warriors are still superior. I do not have uber equipment (AC about 1150 self-buffed, Argent Protector, Sash of the Dragonborn) and most of the warriors I know do not either. They are still better at tanking (less mana used to keep them standing), but I'm better at holding aggro. In any encounter with challenging mobs, the warrior gets to tank it. From everything I've read and seen, however, that doesn't need to be the case when paladins start closing in on warriors due to equipment.<br>
<br>
The first step should be to fix mitigation in general. This would help to separate plate and non-plate classes. This would at least limit main tanking duties to warriors and knights. Then, if the plan is for NO essential classes, warriors need to be given something to make them as appealing as knights in experience groups (more ability to produce aggro? special attacks to disable an opponent?) so that the choice between a paladin and a warrior would not be an easy one in either direction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usoulflayerdwagonslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soulflayer Dwagonslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/02 3:08:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1184.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: definitely need some tweaking</span><hr size=1> Romidar<br>

Hope this link works. I am no Paladin, so I am sure they may be some pieces that have better upgrades. My main focus when I did this Magelo was to focus on hitpoints with a little utility in FT items, all Armor Class was just a bonus. Unfortanetly Magelo wont display the proper AC and the AC should be 2095 not 1095, not sure why Magelo does this. The best warrior I made has 6136 hp and AC of 1700ish, though AC was never a concern once again as HP was the focus. Before anyone says a Paladin will never see these item, remember this is the best vs the best, and in a DKP system it would be easy for a Paladin to this vs a Warrior as points are based on attendance.<br>
<br>
Its true many of the spells I listed under a Paladin become extinct in a raid but in a pinch they are there if needed. You will never hear &quot; All the Clerics are dead, buy the warrior time to camp so he can ress a Cleric &quot;. In very fast xp groups, you will generally go for a damage dealer over a Cleric but healing is still needed, Paladins do nicely here as they not only bring buffs but they bring a vast assortement of utility spells.<br>
<br>
As to DPS one handed, I agree, Paladins lack the DPS they should be doing from their holy blades BUT even with the weapon I used in the Magelo they can hold agro over a Warrior using EB weapon + Primal. Haven't tested vs dbl EB weapons and the reason they can hold agro is procs are luck while a spell cast is at will. As a warrior I would gladly give up DPS to hold agro with a spell or key that can generate agro at the push of a button, sadly the taunt key doesnt due this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As to what the answer is? Well items when made to all / all with 100 to 125 hp + stats + AC + saves it destroyed where the warrior sat in hitpoints and with AC capped at 1200ish then AC no longer matters. I personally dont care about hitpoints at this point unless they gave a skill to put warriors a few thousand above everyone else, but this isnt going to happen. The best bet, would be to remove the skill Defensive as a discipline and let it be a natural full time skill for the warrior and have it so it doesnt decrease their DPS as it does the mob. Sure this would be powerful but would secure their roll from all other classes as no other can mitigate as good as that. The other option is to make the discipline Defensive have no time limit, thus once entered you stay that way till dead or till you leave the defensive stance. AA skills I wont touch here but they need alot of retuning and new ones added for warriors ( not saying some other classes dont need work as well ).<br>

Sorry I don't have more time to respond, on break for lunch atm from work. <br>
