Nice of you to drop in, i'd pour you a drink if the glasses weren't all cracked.  Here, have a seat on one of these moldering chairs and we'll chat, they look like they still might bear the weight of all that armour.<br>
<br>
I like this bar, reminds me of my study.  The place could use a bit of work, a few carrion crawlers and a casket or 2 in the back would give it a very down to earth feel. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ujonarky.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jonarky</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.torchlake.com/cam/Aequus3d1.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>War Counselor</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#CD7F32>(8/6/01 2:33:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/faequusgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.torchlake.com/cam/Aequus3d.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone home?</span><hr size=1> umber is pos cleric! <p><img src=http://www.torchlake.com/cam/jonsig.jpg align=center>

<br>
&quot; As a little girl, the call of Mithaniel Marr came to her at all moments. She could hear it louder and louder till she joined the clergi and devoted her life to the God.<br>
<br>
Her piety was strong but life at the cathedral was getting to her and when the grand priest came and seek her help in the quest to destroy the Gnolls in the evil Blackborrow, she leap with joy.<br>
<br>
She gathered her things and started her journey, meeting many on her path. Her problems with the common inglish tongue made her seek and befriend others of the french common tongue, with who she created a Guild called le&quot;Cercle des Patriotes&quot;. These friends she made and home she created were of great confort and she loved all within them dearly, till one day they turned to her for help yet again. She had no more to give them, she had done what she could and left.<br>
<br>
45 seasons had passed since she had first left the temple and every time she returned on a pilgrimage yet on this one, she felt empty, the friends she believed in and the home she had help build had crumbled. yet on this same trip, she had met a person who would help her greatly.<br>
<br>
Jaandir was older and wiser than she, and he took her into his family were he introduced her to many others. These all became her friends and tho some like Jonarky had nothing but request from the grave to be resurected, many were eager to help and gave Umberlie a taste for life once again.<br>
<br>
New lands were discovered shortly after and as the seasons passed and many adventures brought rewards. Umberlie decided she had to move on. She wanted to see more, and with a tear on her cheek and a knot in her heart, she left Jaandir and the Aequus family.<br>
<br>
She has been far and near now, seen almost all in the world. From Queynos to Feriona Vie and from the Outpost to Kael. Yet she will always remember her times in Aequus and the friendships that were forged.<br>

But after this silly night in Plane of Air, i figure i'll write one before i pass out.<br>
<br>
First i'll start with &quot;man what a night&quot;.  I don't know who sent out the call to get me up to PoA, probably meemers.  Anyways, i dragged 11 friends up there to hook up with the group he had in progress.  We cleared most of isle 5.  I got the toughest part of the quest for cloak of spiroc feathers.  I am still missing the disk, so will have to do another raid some time.<br>
<br>
Hit isle 6 and just got maulled by birds.  We gave up due to lack of enchanter power.   Isle 6 is a very tough break.  Very tough.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, that aside.  Hrm, a character bio.. <br>
<br>
Chrysalid grew up in a very harsh city.  By the time he was 14 he had fought and killed probably half of his class mates due to petty squables for power.  The Erudites of Paineel are a very unforgiving bunch.  And rising in the circles of power the necromancers control often takes much sacrifice and focus of will.  At a very early age Erudites are taught that power is everything and nothing can stand in the way of accumulating that power.  Not even death.<br>
<br>
So at 14, with half his class dead and buried behind him, Chrysalid found himself out in the world doing minor quests for his masters.  Carrying letters, assasinating minor dignitaries, and menial jobs such as fetching basic reagents.  This pleased his elders and they rewarded him with spells that enabled him to travel farther.<br>
<br>
Seeing early on that the solo life can only take a person so far, Chrysalid founded Tarot.  By helping the people in this small circle he hoped to further his dark ambition of ruling the world.  And thus Tarot grew.   As time passed however, Chrysalid decided Tarot would not progress as fast or as far as he wanted.  So he made a pact with Aequus.  He would look the other way and not slay Jaandir for his pathetic love of nature, in exchange Jaandir would admit Chrysalid's allies of Tarot into Aequus.  And thus the dark pact was forged, and one night after trashing the fool god Innoruuk's back door, Tarot swore alliegance to Aequus.  Both guilds were strengthened by the merger and life continues.<br>
<br>
These days Chrysalid likes to romp through various cities killing guards and citizens for sport.  He's been known to slay dignitaries and kings for looking at him the wrong way.  Hobbies include dropping monks to their death and embaracing other warriors by solo'ing creatures that often take a group of 6 or more to bring down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CD7F32>- </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/baequus>Aequus</a><font color=#CD7F32> - </font><a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/faequusgeneral>The Fountain</a> <font color=#CD7F32> - </font><a href="http://www.prexus.com/Aequus">Aequus</a><font color=#CD7F32> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM DEFAULT AD SCRIPT -->
