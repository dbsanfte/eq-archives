My group usually tried to camp 4c for the earring upgrades (lizard tooth/bone and that priest one).  Our group consisted of:<br>
<br>
60 Warrior<br>
60 Rogue<br>
60 Necromancer<br>
60 Cleric<br>
60 Druid<br>
60 Enchanter <br>
<br>
<br>
We spent a few trips learning how to break it (and plenty of CR's lol) and it was really the most fun I ever had exping.<br>
<br>
After the exp changes/resist changes, things started to change.  No matter what our resists were, the AE's from the lizzys (slows and such) were hitting nearly all the time.  But that wasn't the real problem.  For some reason, breaking 4c was a lot more difficult with odd pathing and raptors running into walls.  It wasn't just lag either since everyone in the party saw it and I went up to one of them running into the wall and attacked it, so it was there but it wasn't aggroed beforehand either.  It got to the point where we'd aggro one of the roamers (after killing the 4 statics) and a whole corner would come  /boggle  .   At that point, the exp wasn't even worth it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, after all that mess, we decided to play in chardok near the overboss/kennel area and it was the BEST aaxp ever.  Even the drops were really good.<br>
<br>
Has anyone else had those problems with 4c?   We haven't gone back since that time when all the mobs were messed up.  Maybe a zone repop would fix it? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=223917 >Taarna Sunseeker</a><BR>

<br>
i disagree about the 'uber' group being efficient.  a mid 50's group can get insane xp and clear 3 named worth in grid (not even tov quest equipped).  other area's may be a bit more difficult, but the only thing that really matters in CT is level's IMO.  you can do more stuff if you have a full group of 60's with okay gear, than you can with a buncha 55's in really great gear.<br>

<br>
taunt is pitifully easy to handle in xp groups, even CT before taunt fix.  your group just needs to realize that it's their job to keep agro on you; not your job to keep agro from them.  agro control is a group/raid effort, not lone mystical abillities of weapon procs (though they tend to allow more room for error). <p>--------------<Br>

The hall can be pulled two at a time max if you take time to observe the pathing of the 2 or 3 roamers there.<br>
<br>
Also is sewers. This requires more DPS and better CC as the skeeters and pools can get nasty but still very manageable. Again a camp with 0 casters.<br>
<br>
Next I'd say is maze, very few casters if your puller knows the pathing and where to look but you will have to deal with the fast dmg raptors to do so. Good place to hunt with many rares.<br>
<br>
After Maze I'd say is LTR (Lower Throne Room) it's a good xp spot but mostly casters so have those clicky earrings/legs ready to cure disease to remove slow. If you can keep from being slowed too much and have good DPS this is a nice spot.<br>
<br>
After that your group is gonna have it rough. Maybe get another group and split 4c between the two, or go for the fish ponds if you don't mind fighting in the water. Fish ponds have rares as well but noone ever hunts them on my server.<br>
<br>
Also you can try for the mud bowl area but this gets rather hard with a single group. Lots of shammy mobs so expect to be slowed alot. Really at this point you need to be the uber high dps group or a mini-raid splitting the spawns.<br>
<br>
In my opinion CT is still one of the best zones in the game for both xp and fun. And depending on which area you are in it's a fun crawl dungeon too as some of the areas remain uncamped even on high population servers like mine. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=56851><img src=http://members.telocity.com/~tarana1/sig_daku_custom.jpg border=0></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usulvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sulvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/27/02 2:02:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1312.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cazic Thule - tell me again why I should bother?</span><hr size=1> TaranaRo is right on about the order of camps in CT.  I would suggest working your way up from the easiest camps to the hardest camps.  If it is your first time in CT definately start at the strip of land between the pools (old blue/green gator pools).  Once you have a good handle on this you can start doing the maze, planks, and the lower TR.  All of these camps are about the same difficulty.  Lower TR might be considered a little harder because of the AoE casters that spawn there.<br>
<br>
A couple of things that I have learned about CT are that it is good to bring along some sort of FD puller and a wizard.  The AoE casters are extreme bastards, but they have low hps compared to the rest of the mobs in CT.  My CT groups usually rely on our 60th wizard to burn down the AoE caster lizards fast.<br>
<br>
As for the 4C, I camped the 4C last night and got ~40% aa xp in 2 hour.  The adept also spawned and we got another lizard bone earring for our guild shaman.  While there I didn't notice anything new about the pathing, but then again 4C pathing has always been a little odd, even in the days of old CT. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=179608>Gartuff</a>

CT rules, i really hope a lot of pop zones are like it. <p>--------------<Br>
