Its very active in PvP.  People who get killed in PvP often translate PvP to &quot;ganking&quot;, &quot;griefing&quot;, etc., because they dont like losing (ever notice how someone who loses always has an excuse).  Just realize you ARE going to get killed by other players, probably on average of 1 time per play session, until you get into your 40's-50's.  The reason it takes that long is because it takes that long to figure out the good places to hunt for exp &amp; gear that arent PvP war zones where people on the other teams are constantly looking for PvP.  <br>
<br>
If you go to a PvP server (especially SZ), with the expectation of being able to PvE in peace, and with the expectation of &quot;fairness&quot; that you have come to expect on a non-PvP server, you definitely wont like it, so dont come if thats what you expect.   <br>
<br>
If you do come with those expectations, Im sure Ill see your posts later on, talking smack about how Zek servers are full of griefers and gankers, and how you almost had a mental breakdown because it was so unfair that they wouldnt let you get exp at the camp you were used to getting exp at on your blue server.  You probably will go on about how Zekkers have superior attitude complexes too, because they dare to get onto the message boards and defend their style of play, when they call you out for being the type of person who cant handle being killed by other players (Im sure that hurts your feelings).   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukantraetz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KantraeTZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/29/02 2:45:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1085.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Going PVP</span><hr size=1> I play on TZ and have played blue servers before seeing &quot;the light&quot;.  Basicly Pvp servers(atleast Tallon Zek), have their zones with lil pvp and lots of exp going on etc, but always always expect to have your plans upset.  The better at that you get the less yoru plans will be upset.  Spawnare fun as hell, never once have I had to adhere to a schedule or calender or anything.  If you want a spawn kill those that are trying to take it.  If you are the first to a spawn be ready to fight for it.  It really makes alot of fun in high end, where you not only do uber mobs to get better equipment to do uber mobs to get better equipment but you kill uber mobs to get better equipment so you can fight other players better and hopefully kick their asses.  It's a whole new element, at times you'll love it, sometimesyou'l hate it, having friends in the ight places helps alot. <p><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/tildetz/images/gagysig.jpg>

<br>
Sullon Zek: Don't even think about it. You've been blue too long already. This server is a No Customer Service PvP server. That means that when someone kills you and sits on your corpse and kills you over and over and over (you lose xp every time you die and do NOT gain xp for killing someone else) you won't be able to call a GM to help you. You either log or figure out a way to get your corpse yourself. And if they loot your corpse and it's naked, the corpse vanishes and so does the xp they just took from you. It's just a brutal server put into place for all the griefers and butt-munches to hang out. It is not a PvE environment AT ALL.<br>
<br>
Rallos Zek: Once the king of the PvP servers, now it's a pathetic version of itself. At high levels you get into heaps of trouble for pvping certain groups. It's a great server to hang at around level 35 with a necro or a Shaman or some other PvP heavy class and just beat on people all day, but you can't twink your characters unless you twink them with no-drop stuff. On rallos zek, when you die people can take 1 piece of your gear, except for your weapon. Die while wearing AoW legs? Kiss them goodbye.<br>
<br>
Rallos isn't a bad server and is decent at PvE, but it's not really a pvp server at high levels.<br>
<br>
Vallon Zek: Don't know a whole lot about this one, as I've never played there. A guild called &quot;The Prophets&quot; once ruled the server, but I heard they got disbanded by the GMs for some BS excuse. Not sure how things are over there now.<br>
<br>
Tallon Zek: King of the PvP servers. Best PvE by quite a margin and massive PvP if you go looking for it. You can XP in peace all day long though if you just know where to go. Coin loot only (as on Vallon) which allows you to twink out a newbie and go rape and pillage. Team based PvP, which means you can't kill anyone on the same team as you (shorts, elves, human types, evil types). HOWEVER if you want to see the end game on Tallon, you have only one choice. Pandemonium (one of the 4 team guilds on TZ) actively seeks out and destroys any raid going against any mob they want to kill and, so far, is uncontested in PvP.<br>
<br>
So it really just depends on what you want. If you want to be able to abuse people to a point that might make them cry IRL, go to Sullon. If you want to play in a relatively safe environment at high levels, go to Rallos. If you want to figure it out on your own, go to Vallon. If you want to try your luck getting into a PvP based uber guild, go to Tallon.<br>
<br>
And as a member of Pandemonium, let me just tell you how much fun it is to fight in these humongous scale battles (3-4 zones, 70-300 people in one giant brawl) come out on top and then kill some uber mob. People on Blue servers are really missing out on what I consider a fundamental aspect of an RPG game and just a hell of a lot of fun. <p>Shelrabbi Hassida<BR>

<br>
The attitudes you've shown, not just here, but all over, is akin to most attitudes live servers show Stormhammer. You think that we walk up to a mob, say Knock Knock, who's there, me, I'm going to loot you now, okay. You have looted a Bloodfrenzy. <br>
<br>
And that we all sit around with flowers in our hair, and when a mob spawns, we all say 'No YOU can have him!'. Not at all. We have vicious fights over spawns, and a total lack of calendars, on most servers. While we can't walk in and AE stun, or backstab clerics, or anything, we can train, destroy mod rods, or just lag opposittion to death. Theres a lot we can and will do, and don't forget that.<br>

We can have a 3 hour battle spanning half the globe and it's all legal.<br>
<br>
As far as Pandemonium being behind other PvP, we just couldn't kill the AoW. We got him to 5% about 3 months ago, then lost all our MTs to retirement (our uber players sell for 5-7K on playerauctions). We've done every other mob in the game though short of the Emp and any mob that requires the emp to die to be able to kill. I think we have it up on our page still that we're the only guild on any server to kill the Burrower Parasite before we killed AoW.<br>
<br>
In any case, I wasn't trying to put down the other pvp servers, just trying to give an accurate account of the servers I've played on. <br>
<br>
And fulorian, I was on Povar for about a year before I went to Tallon. I'm well aware of how blue servers work and I would sooner shoot myself in the head then sit and let some punk 14 year old talk trash to me and all my friends, steal my spawns, train my groups, and generally make me want to just log off. See, on MY server, when someone acts out of line you kill them. Then they come for their corpse and you kill them again. Then again. And if they keep talking, you kill them more. And if they STILL don't stop you follow them and kill them over and over and over til they log off and realize that their type of behavior will NOT be tolerated. <br>
<br>
Bet there were about a million times you wished you could just jack some little bastard. On a red server you can. <p>Shelrabbi Hassida<BR>
