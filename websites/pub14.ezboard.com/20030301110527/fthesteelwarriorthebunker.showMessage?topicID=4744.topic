<br>
Ok, put aside aggro for a moment (I partner, and never have problems keeping aggro). Let's just say I always have aggro. Let's also put aside skill, as I have my dual wield, 2hs, and 1hs maxed out (I am currently level 35, so they are maxed at 180).<br>
<br>
Now, I have a Jagged Blade (13/25, the ratio is .52) and a centi shortsword (12/25, ratio is .4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , which I dual wield. I am looking to upgrade my 1hs weapons. I have been told to upgrade to a lamentation (9/19, ratio is about .47), but this doesn't seem to make much sense to me - why would delay be more important than ratio? The ratio is almost exactly the same as on the centi, but is it actually better than the Jagged? Why??? And how can I calculate which sword will do the most damage while I'm shopping in the bazaar for a new weapon? I have been told that there is a damage bonus which I don't get until level 51, and that until then the Wurmslayer (25/40, ratio is .625) will actually outdamage it. But how is that possible?!?! How can a weapon with such a low ratio outdamage one with such a high ratio??? Please explain!!! And more importantly, please explain how I can tell from now on what weapon will be best!<br>
<br>
Now, to complicate things even further, you have 2HS!! So how do I compare my two 1hs weapons while being dual wielded to, say, my silver swiftblade (16/24, ratio is .66)? Or to my Throneblade of the Ykesha (33/51, doesn't proc until 46 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , ratio is .64)?<br>
<br>
Now, let's REALLY complicate things....<br>
<br>
What about weapons with procs???? Last night I killed some wandering giant with a pretty sword, and I picked up a Drakkel Icereaver (24/40, ratio is .6) that has a 30 damage proc on it! So how do I tell which one will do more damage taking the proc into account?? Still, completely forget aggro, because I never have a problem with aggro and know what weapons to use in order to keep it.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taminy>Taminy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/27/02 10:28:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4744.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_sword.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Very confused on 2hs vs. Dual wield, and what weapon to </span><hr size=1> The damage bonus you speak of kicks in much earlier than level 51 - around level 30 I believe (high 20s/low 30s). However, it increases as you level. The damage bonus on one handed weapons is all the same (you can find what your damage bonus is by right clicking on a 1h weapon), and it applied *only* when used in the main hand.<br>
<br>
How does the damage bonus work? Ok, well this is simple... when you swing your main hand weapon, if you hit, the damage bonus is added to whatever damage you did (minimum damage = 1). So if you have a damage bonus of 2, you will never ever hit for less than 3 damage with your main hand. If your damage bonus is 13, you will never hit for less than 14. Sound simple enough?<br>
<br>
To see how the damage bonus really helps, it's best to look at two weapons of the same ratio but different delays. For example, take a 10/20 weapon and a 20/40 weapon. They look the same, but the damage bonus makes the 10/20 weapon superior - because the 10/20 weapon will get two applications of the damage bonus for every one that the 20/40 weapon gets. <br>
<br>
This is why people say it's good to put a fast weapon in your main hand and a good ratio weapon in your offhand. Ratio is the only thing that matters in the offhand (since there's no damage bonus), but in your main hand a faster but worse ratio weapon might outdamage a slower but better ratio weapon.<br>
<br>
Also, 2h weapons have damage bonuses as well, and they are even more confusing. They change with the delay of the weapon (faster 2h weapons have smaller damage bonuses).<br>
<br>
Now, to your questions about 1h vs 2h, ratios, and procs, well it's just as you said - complicated. The only way to figure out which weapons are the best is to /log a lot of your combat (in several zones preferably, and get a large sample size) and then parse the logs with a program to see which weapons come out ahead DPS (damage per second) wise. <br>
<br>
What makes things even more complicated for you is that since you are leveling, your damage bonuses are changing every few levels too. The bigger the damage bonuses get, the more faster weapons (for 1handers) are going to come out ahead. So a Wurmslayer might outdamage a lammy for now, but that could (well actually will) change later on. <br>
