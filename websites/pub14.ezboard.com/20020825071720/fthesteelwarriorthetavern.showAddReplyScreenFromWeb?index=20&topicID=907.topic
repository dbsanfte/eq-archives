these boards for a while, and I think I'll put in my two cents... I read a lot of class boards... And this is by far the quietest.  Read the Safehouse or any other class boards and you'll come by lots of class rants demanding some change or another [small or outright ridiculous].  But here... I just see tons of posts regarding what weapon choices you should use... Mageolo gear checks... Questions about how you should spend your 10k on your new warrior twink... It makes me think this... Are the majority of warriors on this board twinks of bored classes out to spend their cash so they can dress up a warrior like some barbie doll?  After reading the majority of these posts, I'd only call a very few people here &quot;serious&quot; warriors.<br>
<br>
After getting over the glory of seeing just how much HP I can get unbuffed and taking screenshots of myself dressed in a variety of multi-colored plate pieces, I find the warrior class to be the class with the least utility out of any class in the game.  Well, I previously played a rogue and druid to 60, so maybe I'm a little spoiled.  But I'm going to use a little common sense here...  All these so-called &quot;utility&quot; classes that sacrifice melee for &quot;utility&quot; are getting upgraded in the melee department tremendously... And they are getting some nice extra utility as well... But warriors aren't pushing for any extra utility in any regard... Why is that?  Is it taboo to ask for some utility?  But it's absolutely alright to have utility but ask for extra melee?  I mean... Where's my AA summoned horse?  Does it make sense for utility classes like SKs and Pallies get some nice utility AAs like that horse but also embellish themselves in Physical Enhancement and Combat Fury?  I'd like to step into their little utility territories as well... Where's my AA 72 hour refresh super nerfed version of LoH?  Or perhaps an AA 72 hour refresh super nerfed invis. I don't get it... Hybrid AAs strengthen their weakness and embellish their strengths... But warrior AAs do jack and squat, nor does it help with utility at all [other than bind wound - which is kinda funny].<br>
<br>
Which takes me to epics... There is no reason to not request changes to Severilous...  The logic for a triggered Trakanon for bard epic was that Trakanon was being killed &quot;regardless&quot; of whether or not a bard needed to complete his epic.  He was being killed specifically for his loot, which had no regard for epic pieces.  Some guilds had him on raid targets simply because they could kill him and wanted to fill their guild banks.  A bard might have been waiting a week for Trak to spawn to complete his epic, but a guild who regularly kills him and want to send yet another mana robe to their guild bank may just come and kill him regardless.  Thus, Verant put in a triggered Trakanon [their exact reason].  In the same regard, a warrior may camp EJ for days, even weeks, but a guild who wants to fill their guild banks with CoF or just have Sev as a &quot;raid insta-kill target&quot; will just come in and kill him regardless of epic pieces that are sought out.  Mana burning wizzies who want some loot to sell find Sev as easy pickings, regardless of epic necessities.  More and more green dragonscales are finding their way to auctions for outrageous prices and Sev is killed almost as soon as he spawns.<br>
<br>
Finally, I'd like to address the insane high end game.  I've seen some insane magelo profiles... Monks with 4000 hps, 1500+ AC, and some insane ATK/damage output.  Hybrids can now match warriors in AC/Hps, with warriors pulling out ahead by as little as 500-800 hps, and at times... even less.  I was in Cazic Thule the other day and saw a monk and cleric camping sewers.  I was totally blown away.  The monk was tanking very well.  It may surprise some, but high dodge caps and block coupled with 4000 unbuffed hps and 1500+ unbuffed AC makes monks better tanks there by far.  I don't think I could have done nearly as well with the same cleric... Not to mention trying to split pools of slime [which takes me back to the area of &quot;utility&quot;].  Nor could I keep up with a decent damage output to keep up with such a camp before respawn, even with my gear [which is pretty nice].  I mean, even asking for some better dodge modifier items to help with our extremely low dodge cap would help us out.  Hybrids get huge offensive modifiers on high end weapons to help with their caps [not to mention their utility].  <br>
<br>
And is it just me or is the desirability of warriors in guilds going down tremendously?  Guilds establish their main tanks and their little suicide damage sponges with no purpose but to soak up rampages.  What incentive is there to get more warriors?  Certainly not damage.  And certainly not utility [LOL].  Many guilds have closed their doors to warriors for good.  Even hybrids are sought out more by established guilds for simple little utilities.  Is there a reason to have a surplus of warriors?  There certainly is not.  Not all warriors have a &quot;solid&quot; role in raids.  Only one or a few.  The rest just do damage.  A surplus of monks or rogues never hurts.  But a surplus of warriors is just looked down on.  <br>
<br>

Okay, that part wasn't really taken straight from my head, Ill admit. But the following parts of his post were good. Warriors don't generally whine because previously we had no reason to...we were one of the most desired classes in the game. But, as has been said, the scale has tipped from one extrteme to another. Remember a year ago, a Ranger or Paladin was only wanted to take death touches or occasionally pull (rangers to harmony pull Hate) in a guild, and Warriors were wanted for every single encounter in every single zone. Somewhere, things swapped. I mean, what respectable ranger would take a DT now? They can outdamage a friggin rogue for christ sakes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But in all seriousness, the reason I say that these end game warriors dont know the struggles today's average Joe mid 50s warriors have to go through is, quite frankly, you couldn't understand. While most of todays never went to PoH in Bronze, or ran &quot;10 zones&quot; (complete BS, but I see the general point) to recover their corpse, I just say that every generation has it's hardships. Your parents undoubtably told you how bad they had it &quot;back in the day&quot;, while you privately thought &quot;yes, but you don't understand how it is now&quot;. If you yourself are a parent you've told your kids how they don't understand how good they have it, and they too have undoubtably been thinking &quot;fool, you CAN'T understand&quot;. Things change, problems will always remain. <p>_________________<br>

really hybrids are almost as good a tank as a warrior now in the hp/ac/damage area but with their spell utility and superior aggro it often makes them the tank of choice in more and more situations.<br>

Think about how long it would take you to get 500 hps in gear upgrades.  ND3 is considered one of our best AA abilities and it adds what, 200 hps, maybe 250 on a top end tank...I guess that's beyond trival huh?  If you've got 2 tanks and one of them has 500 more hps, all other things being equal, then the one with more hps should be tanking.  If your guild can't keep aggro on a MT warrior then you straight up suck and you should try another game.  Sure hybrids taunt better, but warriors taunt well enough.<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with suggesting some new features that you think should be given to the warrior class.  I think it would be great if we got some Defensive-oriented AA skills as well.

<br>
&quot; actually, paladins and shadow knights do pretty good damage, probly more than most warriors&quot;<br>
<br>
No? Didn't think so. Well I have data that disproves it, tons of it in fact. Here's some data from Tunare:<br>

<br>
Be specific.  Get stats and logs and show them side by side to prove whatever point you are making.<br>
<br>
Do not compare yourself to other classes.  Show where there is a significant lack of something reasonable (key word here) and be brief in outlining both the problem and a reasonable solution.<br>
<br>
VI (like every other company out there) is more likely to listen a well-presented, logistically rich, rational suggestion that includes workable and balanced solutions rather than a whining rant.<br>

<br>
it doesn't seem to be that crash hot when the average hit is 500+ these days<br>
<br>
&quot;Think about how long it would take you to get 500 hps in gear upgrades&quot;<br>
<br>
fooking ages<br>
<br>
&quot;ND3 is considered one of our best AA abilities and it adds what, 200 hps, maybe 250 on a top end tank...I guess that's beyond trival huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
almost everyone gets ND3<br>
<br>
&quot;If you've got 2 tanks and one of them has 500 more hps, all other things being equal, then the one with more hps should be tanking&quot;<br>
<br>
not necessarily. as 2A i have 500hp less than our guilds MA (he gets gear preference) but i still tank to gain experience or for defensive transition or if the MA can't log on.<br>
<br>
&quot;If your guild can't keep aggro on a MT warrior then you straight up suck and you should try another game&quot;<br>
<br>
sorry man i'll just go back to quake. lose the attitude man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure hybrids taunt better, but warriors taunt well enough&quot;<br>
<br>
i remember being SoL trying to tank my way thru HoT at levels 54 - 59. maybe spare a thought for our non-60 brothers and sisters who are doing the hard slog to 60 but are still relied on by their guild to do their job which is to keep aggro away from the dress wearers against mobs that are often of a higher con<br>
<br>
&quot;There's nothing wrong with suggesting some new features that you think should be given to the warrior class. I think it would be great if we got some Defensive-oriented AA skills as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
i'm glad we agree<br>
<br>
&quot;What I don't like to see is oh boo hoo paladins are better than me in every way and /flame VI because they won't make me uber&quot;<br>
<br>
eqnecro is over that way<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry if you can't handle not being a god class and clearly superior to hybrids in every way and in every situation&quot;<br>
<br>
i don't recall any calls for godliness in this thread. maybe some further utility or improvement to further refine our role in response to the upgraded knight class usurping our role in day to day situations, but hardly any requests to be overpowered. i am sorry but i do not accept warriors being irrelevant in day to day gameplay despite their necessity for the big mobs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Suck it up and go play your class...if you can't do that, then go roll a paladin and you too can be the uber god class that Paladins have obviously become&quot;<br>

<br>
This would be for the lvl 60's with AA but hey give us all something to shoot for.<br>
<br>
1.) Why should paladins and sk's get horses only?  Wouldn't it make sense for a warrior to have a horse as an AA skill also?<br>
<br>
2.) The whole Assasinate Skill rogues get, warriors should have something akin to that, as in the decapitation idea, or use whatever semantics you want but that would be only fair too.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts.  We shouldnt get spells, or uber skills, but clerics are far ahead of other healers, warriors should be ahead of others tanks in both ac and hp's.<br>
<br>
Maybe give warriors a higher hp bonus for stamina.<br>
<br>
Much of the posts here are not class envy, but simply some common sense additions that are being left out.<br>
<br>
One question to end....how many today would still start from square one and roll up a warrior as a melee, or presently would you choose something else?<br>

I remember I got invited on a HoT raid when I was 59 with a guild that wanted me to join.  I had hands down better AC/HP than anyone in their guild, and better weapons than the other warriors, so they picked me to main tank.  Boy, big forken mistake that was.  All the HP/AC in the world doesn't do jack @#%$ for you if your stupid taunt button doesn't work.  God that was frustrating.  They ended up having their pally's and SK's tank, and if pally's and SK's are just gonna tank from 51-59 then what is the point of being a damned warrior from 51-59?<br>
<br>
Granted, i'm 60 now, with 20 aa.  This is my last set of characters, i'll never roll up more, so the 51-59 game isn't important to me anymore.  Still, the fact remains that warriors are really broken on raids from 51-59.  We give up spells and damage output in order to have superior mitigation skills, but it doesn't mean anything when you can't keep the mob on you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/usinark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sinark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 168<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 12:01:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=63>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.steelwarrior.org/forum/p_ale.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The State of Warriors in EQ</span><hr size=1> Did it ever occur to you that ToV is a level 60 zone and is designed as such? I'm sure you taunt just fine in sub level 60 zones and areas. <br>
<br>
No level 40 warrior waltzes into Sebilis and complains that he can't keep aggro on the red con mobs, but when the same warrior reaches his 50s and tries his hand at ToV, suddenly it's a big design flaw and warriors are broken? Level up on appropriate content and come back when you're 60. Get appropriate taunting weapons, and have the guild give you a 5 second head start. It works wonders.<br>
<br>
There would be little challenge to the game if all you had to was press the taunt button and you get instant aggro on any mob. There's a reason AE taunt is on a 15 minute timer. Aggro control is a big part of game balance and is not something that comes for free. Stop thinking you're entitled to have it easy and put a little work into your tanking. <p><html>
