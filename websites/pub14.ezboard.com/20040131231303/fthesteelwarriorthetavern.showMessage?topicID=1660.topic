Besides this, you should all know that there are martians planning to invade the planet earth.  I have to start preparing for this onslaught, so I don't really have time to play EQ anymore. If you'd like to stay safe yourself, I suggest that you cover your head in tin foil so that they can't get you with their brain interception rays.<br>

I can't ever forget how much i hate that @#%$ Lovecure. Just yesterday, he tried to pick a fight with me. He called my mother a slut, and then I called him a fag. (I'm very clever, aren't I?)

To top it off, my mom grounded me this week because my grades are dropping, and she took my computer away, so I can't play EQ. I'm posting this from the school library though, but please don't tell on me, my mom will be really angry! Stonesweeper has my password though, so if you see me online, it isn't me.<br>
<br>
Also, in my opinion, EverQuest is getting way too easy. All the @##$ing newbies can do anything in the game now, and zerg guilds always win. This game is being dumbed down for retards like Dreambuilder, and it makes me so angry! I don't think VI cares about anything but profit. &amp;^*#ing a$$holes.<br>

Aside from this, don't have the energy to play EQ anymore because I'm dying of a rare form of hand cancer, and between horribly painful treatments and terrifying blackouts, I spend most of my time sleeping.

Ever since my grandmother died, I can't help but think about my own life, and how I've wasted it playing everquest.<br>
<br>
Actually I've come to realize over the past few weeks wasted way too much of my life on this game. When I look back at all the time I've spent playing this game, months and years that I can't get back, that I could have spent in the REAL world, with my REAL friends, it almost brings me to tears. I hate this game so much now.<br>
<br>
You should all know that I recently got a new job, and I don't have time to play EQ anymore. When I'm not working, I'm usually too busy plotting how to kill my bitch ex-wife... err... nevermind, I didn't say that.<br>
<br>
Anyway that plays EQ is a loser. I can't believe that all of you retards still play it. I guess you're all just jealous of my 22 inch rockstar @#%$ and 12 supermodel girlfriends that I @#%$ every day (all at the same time), both of which I gained immediately after quitting everquest. You're all a bunch of @#%$ sad losers. Especially Hatecrow. You really need to get a life, buddy.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that everyone in my guild is so greedy. Just yesterday, Dreamcrusher got a Super Death Sword of Invincible Doom, when she had just gotten a Mask of Discontent Housewives a week earlier. Not to mention that Earthsnake ninja'd a Bracer of Infinite Goatse later that day.<br>
<br>
I can't ever forget how much i hate that @#%$ Wyndflare. Just yesterday, he tried to pick a fight with me. He called my mother a slut, and then I called him a fag. (I'm very clever, aren't I?) But then his friends Wyndslayer and Moonsnake joined in and started making fun of me. I thought they were my friends, it really hurt my feelings.<br>
<br>
Besides that, ever since my corpse rotted, the game hasn't been the same for me. I can't stand to live without my items, and I just can't take it anymore. Thanks a whole not Bonewolf and his group for leaving me in the Hole and refusing to help me get my corpse out, you @#%$ assholes. I hope you burn in hell where your skin will be shaved off daily by horrible demons.<br>
<br>
Besides this, you should all know that there are martians planning to invade the planet earth.  I have to start preparing for this onslaught, so I don't really have time to play EQ anymore. If you'd like to stay safe yourself, I suggest that you cover your head in tin foil so that they can't get you with their brain interception rays.<br>
<br>
Actually I've come to realize over the past few weeks wasted way too much of my life on this game. When I look back at all the time I've spent playing this game, months and years that I can't get back, that I could have spent in the REAL world, with my REAL friends, it almost brings me to tears. I hate this game so much now.<br>
<br>
Anyway, everyone who plays EQ is a big @#%$ loser. You should all be ashamed of yourselves, you pale-skinned freaks of nature. Why don't you go outside and get some sunlight, you freaks of nature? I'm done posting here now, forever. Bye losers!<br>
<br>
Love and kisses,<br>

It's so depressing. Every time I play EverQuest, all I can think about is slitting my wrists. My doctor said that's bad, so I can't anymore.<br>
<br>
Besides that, ever since my corpse rotted, the game hasn't been the same for me. I can't stand to live without my items, and I just can't take it anymore. Thanks a whole not Sandseer and his group for leaving me in the Hole and refusing to help me get my corpse out, you @#%$ assholes. I hope you burn in hell where your skin will be shaved off daily by horrible demons.<br>
<br>
You should all know that I recently got a new job, and I don't have time to play EQ anymore. When I'm not working, I'm usually too busy plotting how to kill my bitch ex-wife... err... nevermind, I didn't say that.<br>
<br>
Anyway that plays EQ is a loser. I can't believe that all of you retards still play it. I guess you're all just jealous of my 22 inch rockstar @#%$ and 12 supermodel girlfriends that I @#%$ every day (all at the same time), both of which I gained immediately after quitting everquest. You're all a bunch of @#%$ sad losers. Especially Dreamflare. You really need to get a life, buddy.<br>

To top it off, my mom grounded me this week because my grades are dropping, and she took my computer away, so I can't play EQ. I'm posting this from the school library though, but please don't tell on me, my mom will be really angry! Sacredflare has my password though, so if you see me online, it isn't me.<br>

Not to mention that everyone in my guild is so greedy. Just yesterday, Moonseer got a Super Death Sword of Invincible Doom, when she had just gotten a Mask of Discontent Housewives a week earlier. Not to mention that Lightreaper ninja'd a Bracer of Infinite Goatse later that day.<br>
<br>
I hate this game. It's so unfair. I'm never, ever coming back, so @#%$ you all. Especially Sporksmoke. @#%$ you.<br>

But that's hardly anything in comparison to all those long hours I spent cybering with Bluesweeper, and I even gave her lots of money and items!

Also, in my opinion, EverQuest is getting way too easy. All the @#%$ newbies can do anything in the game now, and zerg guilds always win. This game is being dumbed down for retards like Snowcure, and it makes me so angry! I don't think VI cares about anything but profit. @#%$ assholes.<br>
