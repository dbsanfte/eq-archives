<br>
Please note:  This ONLY refers to raiding scenarios when there's fairly large numbers of people engaging a LOT of high aggro behaviour from a distance.  It does NOT refer to experience groups, more melee oriented raids, or anything else whuch doesn't involve high distance aggro.<br>
<br>
1. It is absolutely proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that one can be highest on a mob's aggro list and not be getting beaten upon because of distance.   Don't believe me?   Go get yourself on top of a mob's hate list with 10 mother melees around and try to move the mob.  You CANT DO IT by yourself unless it's immediately post-summon.<br>
<br>
2. IF you are the main tank and are NOT highest on the mob's hate list, but are the highest among those within &quot;aggro proximity&quot;, then a successful taunt ABSOLUTELY adds numeric hate to you, it places you above those higher than you yet far enough away to avoid engagement.<br>
<br>
3. Every time you press the taunt button, it does NOT guarantee a successful taunt.<br>
<br>
4. The more times you press it, the more likely it is to be successful once.<br>
<br>
5. If someone exceeds the range/aggro quotient, the mob WILL move, particularly post summonning placing everyone nearby in danger of either AE's or Melee damage.<br>
<br>
6. It is MUCH harder to re-establish lost aggro than it is to maintain a position on top of the aggro list.<br>
<br>
7. It is also MUCH less likely that a mob will be in taunt range for your convenience if he runs halfway across a zone to pound on a mage or wizard, leading to the possibility of wasting your chance to taunt because of range issues.<br>
<br>
8. If you think that you're on top of the mob's aggro list simply because he's beating on you, explain that to the wizards who get summonned while you're getting beaten upon.   <br>
<br>
9. If you had the opportunity to place yourself higher on a mob's aggro list and avoided that opportunity, out of stubbornness then you're a jackass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhick>Rhick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/19/03 5:42:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Show me the money</span><hr size=1> Frodlin,<br>

You are using lots of ancedotal evidence to support your theory that taunting matches you hate to someone who has higher hate but is simply to far away to have aggro.<br>
<br>
I don't buy it myself. Show me some evidence that this is true.<br>
<br>
In my experience Taunt adds no hate unless someone else has taken aggro from you. This means mashing your taunt button does no good whatsoever, unless you are losing aggro every 6 seconds. I have lots of evidence to support this. I have seen no evidence to support the proximity aggro theory.<br>

(Telk in WToV is an awesome one since there;s little else to worry about in terms of other mobs, but both you and the ranger would need bottommed out CoV faction) Have a ranger generate LOTS of aggro from a distance, while the mob cannot get to him.   Walk up to the mob, he won't do a damn thing to you.    He'll stand there and look at the ranger.     Press your &quot;taunt&quot; button.   If successful, the mob will turn and start beating on you.  Thios is proof #1, that you take aggro from the top person on aggro list, regardless of range.    <br>
<br>
Then, switch places... you back away and have the ranger walk up to the mob, without doing anything to add to the aggro list.   The ranger WILL die.  This is Proof #2, that there is a range where proximity overrides the &quot;top&quot; of the aggro list.<br>
<br>
Finally, you claim to have offerred some sort of &quot;non anecdotal proof&quot;.   I'd like to challenge you on that.  What &quot;proof&quot; have you offerred other than making fairly logical hypotheses?   How can you &quot;prove&quot; without code, numbers, or  anything other than &quot;mob behaviour&quot;? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frodlin7th>Frodlin7th</A> at: 1/19/03 12:02:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhick>Rhick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/19/03 4:24:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Show me the money</span><hr size=1> That is a good example. We use that same strategy to pretreat mob aggro for many rooted boss type mobs.  <br>
<br>
That situation is unique because the boss can't chase, and no damage has been done yet to summon. <br>
<br>
Actually, after thinking about that particular situation when you have nukers doing just enough damage to get more hate than you, but not enough to get summoned or cause a mob to hate you.... In that situation you probably do get more hate by taunting all the time.  <br>
<br>
I'm still not sure how high that margin is though. I suppose it kind of depends on the mob. Some mobs (like Vindicator) are extremely sensitive to proximity, and others seem to summon even if the nuker is on the other side of the room. Something to think about. Mabye we are all right. <br>

Rogues have long been aware of the benefits of staying at max melee range (well, usually a little under max to compensate for mob push).<br>
<br>
I have on a number of occasions stolen agro (like most skills, evade has a success ratio of around 2/3).  At these times I can usually turn off attack, take a couple of steps back and the mob turns back to the tank.  Wait a second and step back in, and the mob turns and smacks me - despite me not having hit it since.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the optimal use of taunt (ie in order to produce the most hate generated by the skill without having the mob actually turn) is when somebody is just about to generate enough agro to turn the mob.  Seeing as nobody really <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>knows</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> when that's going to be, the two basic strategies (mashing and finessing) have developed.<br>
<br>
If you're in a situation where everybody else is generating vast amounts of agro over you (ie when it's likely that somebody is nearing that turning point every time Taunt refreshes), mashing would appear to be the optimal strategy.  The downside is that should the mob get away from you, it's going to have plenty of time to beat on the poor victim while you wait for refresh.<br>
<br>
If you can stay at or near the top of the list however (because everybody is keeping their own hate down through evade, jolt, archery, concussion, natural agro decay etc), then situational use is clearly superior, as it minimizes the time that the mob gets to beat on anybody.  The disadvantage is that you might fail Taunt, giving it a full refresh cycle to beat on its victim. <p><center> <table border="0" cellspacing="0" style="background-color: black;"> <tr><td colspan="3"><img src="http://ojaste.dhs.org/~shariin/Shariin.gif" alt="Shariin"></td></tr> <tr style="color: white; background: rgb(40,35,40); text-align: left; font: italic bold 10pt sans-serif;"> <td>Shariin Shadowblade</td> <td style="text-align: center; color: rgb(128,128,128);">Soldiers of Light</td> <td style="text-align: right;">Assassin</td> </tr> </table> </center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viken>Viken</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/20/03 5:13:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Show me the money</span><hr size=1> I would agree with the hypothesis that there is a modified (based on range, sit/stand, low hp) hate list.

When you are in a raid situation, the amount of variables involved becomes impossible to guestimate, unless you have verants actual agro algorythm sitting infront of you. Unless your raid force is disciplined, the warrior has to mash taunt simply because he can lose agro faster than taunt refreshes. So in that sense, sometimes we will have to mash without question at times.<br>
<br>
Most of us have posted our thoughts on what method is used to calculate agro, a tangent on the purpose of this thread, but while we are taking stabs in the dark I will as well. Being a programmer myself, I believe the most efficient and easy way to calculate agro is to only maintain one list. Creating and modifying multiple lists is not only calculation intensive, but also requires multiple redundant algorythm's just to match the lists. Here is how i see it:<br>
<br>
a.)I see one 'list' per mob<br>
<br>
b.)I see the agro engine updating that list in very fast increments. Much smaller than a tick, lets call it a tock. Every tock, the list runs another cycle and recalculates agro. Since some damage will happen at any given time (AoE,Dot), a tock really needs to be the smallest amount of time measurement that eq uses.<br>
<br>
c.)I see every spell and skill tagged in the database with the amount of agro 'points' that it adds to the list. Resists could even have a different amount, but i don't see that as the case. damage points could translate directly into agro points for arguments sake.<br>
<br>
d.)Player actions trigger 'events' that add agro to the list as soon as they fire off: <br>
1.) For example, when a player sits down, an event fires off that adds x amount of agro to the list. The amount it adds could even be multiplied based on how much damage they have done, or maybe based on where they are currently on the agro list. Either way, when a player sits, if they have done enough damage, they move to the top of the list, and the mob rushes/casts on/summons them.<br>
<br>
I think the above approach works for all situations, and is very, very simple to maintain and explain. Lets try to:<br>
<br>
Taunting: Assuming taunt works, you move to the top of the list by 1 point. You get agro as soon as it hits, but you dont keep agro. why did you lose agro right away?<br>
<br>
1.) cause a few tocks later, the ranger/rogue/monk was still out-damaging you, and was therefore back on top of the list.<br>
<br>
2.) The wizard that just manaburned at 80% life just sat down. When he sat down the event fires and adds a ton of agro points to his profile on the list, moving him to the top of the list. The moster summons him. If summon hasnt refreshed, the un-rooted mob rushes him. The wizard sees the charging mob and stands up. The mob turns back to you. Why? Because the next tock after the wizard stands the agro list once again goes through an algorythm and puts the wizard back to where he was in the list before he sat down (approx.).<br>
<br>
<br>
A caster gets slammed and is now at 1 bubble of health. What happens here?<br>
<br>
1.) Every tock, all agro lists in the game are updated. we've established that. Lets say the caster is on 3 agro lists (3 mobs). The next tock after the caster has only one bubble of health, the caster is kept at the top of the agro list every tock until hes dead or healed. Since hes now at the top of all agro lists, all 3 mobs summon/cast/rush him. No amount of taunting or damage will help, because the system keeps him at the top of each mobs agro list because of his health. When he dies, the next person on the list becomes #1 and gets agro.<br>
<br>
The mob is rooted. Lets try to explain this situation:<br>
<br>
1.) All agro rules apply except that it cant move. If he can summon, he summons the top person on his agro list every time it refreshes. If he can't summon, he hits the highest person on his list that he can reach. If the closest thing he can reach is the gimp ranger that hit him for 10 points, hes going to hit him. If the closest toon to him is somebody that hasnt hit/casted on him, but is kos to him, hes gonna hit that toon.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on with examples, but since half of you have probably given up and continued on to the next post before getting this far, ill end it here. I think this is pretty straightforward, and can account for all aspects of agro.<br>

In reality you won't mash perfectly and the average time you wait will be lower then 2.5 sec.  Let's say 2 sec.   That's not a big deal whoever you put it imo.<br>
<br>
Another thing about the existence of 2 lists for aggro.  I did not bring that up but someone did I think at the start of that thread somewhere and said it like it was a fact or something. What we know for sure is that some action simple adds more aggro to the list and some others modify the already existing aggro.  Many mobs and some players spell like voice of terris simply affect your aggro by adding a % like +20% to your actual aggro.  Basically these effects work as a &quot;mask&quot; over your actual total.  When you lose these effects, you lose the benefice/penality but your actual aggro  do not change.  Range would fall in that category, creating some kind of mask over your actual hate by how close/far you are from the mob.  Certains mob behavior are of course gonna be different but that's in general.<br>
<br>
The idea of having 2 lists from a programming standpoint is not that bad for some reasons.  It's also supported by additionnal evidence I'll cover in a sec.<br>
<br>
So you have the first list.  Everyone that aggroed a mob is on that list with their actual hate.  If we assume we have 2 lists that first list does not need to be sorted since aggro is determine in the second one.  Gratz on finding the list used for rampage.  Each time you do something your number is taken from the first list then modified by whatever aggro spell you have, by your range and other conditions like sitting, etc then it goes in the other list and calculate your new number.  Swapping you with another if totals change.  Then when it's time to determine mob behavior, that mob go into that sorted list and see who it should be attacking.<br>
<br>
The 2nd list can be much smaller then the first one and it would be very simple to simply not do any sorting/update if you know that the person on that list is not gonna be in the top 10 or something.  Remember that your modified hate total is calculated each time you do something worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Now, again from a programming standpoint, this look like a lot of manipulation to do in real time to make certain that everything work right.  This could also explain why out of all the mmorpg I know EQ is really the only game with a hate list worth @#%$. You also have to add to that that the AI can cheat on things that will be transparent to us anyway or use randoms numbers on stuff to simplify things and cut on calculations.   This would also explain why sometime the AI do things differently then we thought it would (wtf, I just nuked for 200 dmg when the mob was at 200 feet, I got summoned and killed).<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's rambling, but just saying it's possible.<br>

Seriously speaking have you ever taunted a mez'd mob that answers when your taunt is succesful and then when you break mez it still runs at the enchanter? <br>
<br>
Anyway do whatever you do to keep aggro and I will continue to mash my taunt button.<br>

I used to be a masher.  A few weeks ago, I read this thread, and decided to try to avoid the &quot;turge&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, I'm sold!  Mashing is bad, down with mashing!<br>
<br>
Seriously, by only hitting Taunt when a mob turns away from me, I have dramatically improved my agro management in groups.  Having Taunt un-greyed and ready to go the second the mob spins has saved more caster's lives than I can count over the last few weeks.  Resisting the urge to taunt if the mob is already agroed on me has had a noticable effect on how well I can maintain agro.<br>
<br>
Of course, everyone in the group still has to do their part, agro management is a team effort, and there is still the &quot;taunt failed&quot; factor, but by and large, people who group with me regularly have noticed, and commented on, my improved agro control. <p>-Bumamgar, 65th Warrior</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumbleroot>Bumbleroot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/27/03 3:50:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Brussel sprouts taste worse.</span><hr size=1> I mash, have little problems keeping aggro during a fight. Or MTing a boss mob. <br>
If I hit taunt, keep attacking mob then I lose taunt, I need to regain aggro. When I hit taunt, keep attacking and don't lose taunt, I will up myself on the aggro list again the next time taunt comes available. If I lose taunt for 1 second after I gain aggro, I'm going to need to get aggro again in 5 seconds or whatever timer on taunt is anyways. If I don't lose aggro, then hitting taunt again helps me keep my aggro. Once mob is on me, it doesn't stray from me too much. I don't have that problem of the mob turning away often. Thats because I constantly am hitting the taunt button. It appears everyone who says you need to taunt the mob as it turns away have the mob turning away from them. This doesn't happen too often from me, and because I mash, when it doesn happen, I get the aggro back quickly.<br>

My only problem is  casters and hybrids who do not know how to manage agro.. they steal it from you and then they scream tuant... &quot; if you would  tuant i would not be dead&quot; well then... &quot; if you would manage your agro i would not have to tuant so damned much&quot;. I have been know to let an over eager caster deal with  his own mob when an agro control is called for on a raid or on a group. If they steal it from me when the mob is clearly still dangerouse...  well lets just say this... &quot; good luck caster&quot;.. This is only for those people who truely dont manage  thier agro. I belive all warriors would be the #2 buttons as much as possible if people ( rangers, pallys, sk's rogues, monks wizards and mages) truely  knew what a pain in the ass it sometimes is to regain control of agro after a mob has been dotted or nuked for 5000 points in the first 30 seconds of the fight. Yes we need to use the button correctly... but we also need to point out that we cannot create hate nearly as good as all the other classes can.
