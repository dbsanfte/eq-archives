It took a while but I think Gorlab and some others made a convicing argument and after a lot of debate and some hard data to look at a consensus emerged.  I remember seeing some parses at the time showing a softcap, at around 1250 AC.  AC up to that point helped a lot, even against uber mobs like AoW,  and beyond that point it helped some but not nearly as much.  If it was mob specific and some mobs atk was too high then ac up to the softcap wouldn't have the major impact it does.  How do you explain that Daxos?  This just feels like Deja Vu.  As far as a soft cap it was soft -- AC had some benefit but much smaller impact than below the softcap -- something like 100 AC above the softcap had the impact of 10 AC below it.

<br>
You're exactly right.  While Gorlab and Co. by no means proved the AC soft cap beyond a shadow of a doubt.  They made a convincing enough argument that a lot of people, myself included, started looking for hit points over AC.  Some people did some parsing, a lot of other people pointed out flaws in their testing, a few more people did some parsing, we came up with what we thought would be a really good test of the softcap, which nobody ever performed.  A couple people claimed to have &quot;inside information&quot; from VI that the soft cap existed.  People speculated that there may be some level of AC that would help above that level, and that it might be related to the mobs or their ATK rating, but no testing whatsoever was ever done with this, or even could be done since we couldn't reach those levels of AC and didn't know anything about mob's ATK level.  <br>
<br>
We have pretty much stuck with these theories for the last few months.  We can speculate that it may be different with PoP, but we don't really know until somebody parses it.  <br>
<br>
My point is, as one of the people who participated heavily in the original AC soft cap discussions on this and other boards, the soft cap and our understanding of the effects of AC is a basic theory based on a very small amout of relatively unscientific testing and a lot of speculation.  We follow it because it's the best thing that we have, but to call even the existence of the AC soft cap a proven fact, let alone some of the inferences made about mob ATK level etc. is really pushing it.<br>
<br>
Saying &quot;soft cap&quot; or point of diminishing returns, or whatever you want to call it is just arguing semantics.

Romidar was the first that I know of - the first person to say that AC was more important that stats, which was heresy in those days. <br>
<br>
The findings then were that average damage taken was roughly analagous to a negative error function curve. <br>

<br>
Assume that y is multiplied by -1, which would make the peak on the left and not the right. The y axis is average damage per hit and the x axis would be varying AC levels. This curve would shift along the x axis depending on the mob being fought. <br>
<br>
Back before kunark came out, parses were done against all sorts of mobs with varying values for AC and the result was very similar to the curve shown above for all of the mobs with low enough atk (level, whatever the determining factor is) that were tested. The inability to get super high AC to test this against 50+ mobs doesn't mean that the combat model for EQ suddenly changes at higher levels. <br>
<br>
Those questions I asked before were for a reason. If you have 600 AC and adding 200 AC doesn't make a noticeable difference in the average damage taken from an orc in EC, it doesn't mean that anything over 600 AC is worthless. It means that anything over 600 AC is worthless <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>when tanking an orc in EC</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. If going from 600 AC to 750 AC doesn't help lower average damage from a flurry drake, it doesn't mean that raising it from 1200 to 1350 won't help, even though that is a smaller percentage improvement. <br>

<br>
I've been following/participating in this discussion on and off since back in the days when the best BP in the game for AC was the BEBP from LGuk or rubi from CT (i.e. before PoF and thorny vine was even put in), and the primo (only) warrior board was on eqstratics.  Rather than add, I'd just chip in that what Graal says above is fully consistent with everything I've seen and parsed so far.<br>
<br>
I would like to see/do some analysis on the effects of the new AAs.  In particular, I'm thinking that you could SERIOUSLY reduce the DPS taken if you picked the right set of skills...<br>
-mitigation/avoidance (CS/CA, innate defense, lightning reflexes), obviously<br>
-tactial mastery (significantly fewer ripostes, makes a big differernce vs. mobs that hit for 1k+).<br>
-stalwart endurance (less damage taken while stunned, which seems to interfere with avoidance skills).<br>
-max out Agi + planar power, up to new cap of 305ish<br>
-max out resistances, to avoid elemental damage if/when verant decides to give them to mobs (I'm guessing it's in the elemental planes right now, only a guess tho- should hear for sure soon since people are keeeeling stuff there now).<br>
<br>
Toss in the high end skill modifier items (+% dodge, parry, riposte, and maybe someday block) and I think you'd see a BIG, tho streaky (due to RNG) reduction in average DPS taken.  It seems like the same RNG seed, which might be zone-wide and is apparently changed each tick or so, is used for many differnent calculations during combat.  Simple probability sez that multiple small percentage changes can add up quite nonlinearly if they are applied serially, especially if they are entangled and not discrete...<br>
<br>
I think. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

If you put on 100 AC and suddenly mobs hit min 50% more often then everyone would've noticed this by now.  However this doesn't mean the effect isn't significant.  Just because you can't easily tell what 10% more mitigiation means doesn't mean it isn't there.  If you're expecting to put on AC and start seeing a whole ton of mins, or the reverse, lose 100 AC and expect to see a whole ton of maxs, you're looking at this wrong.  People at the high end worrying about caps are at a point where any improvements are marginal and not observeable by eyeballing.  If you just got Bloodfrenzy, you've improved your tanking ability because your riposte skill is 15% better, but of course you'll be seeing plenty of times where you didn't riposte.  But this doesn't mean the riposte mod is useless.  It's just not enough so you can see it.  Whatever effects AC has, if any, can only be tell by parsing, not by you looking at some numbers flashing at your screen.<br>
<br>
As for the 'AC depends on mob', that's also false.  Yes, if a mob has infinite attack or zero attack then your AC wouldn't matter, but there is no mob with infinite or zero attack.  Even if you've a mob landing max for 80% of the time against 2000 AC, this doesn't say anything about how useful AC is, because maybe he would've landed for max 100% of the time against 1300 AC, or maybe it's only 82%.  A lot of people got this 'AC doesn't matter on certain mobs' because back in Velious days, AoW would pretty much kill anyone if he gets a good two rounds in on you.  But this fails to account for how easily AoW can kill you in two rounds.  How often can AoW kill you in two rounds if you've 7K HP and 2000 AC?  What about 8K HP and 1300 AC?  If he's less likely to kill you with 7K and 2000 AC, then it's better to have that combination of stats, even though inevitably you'll see a round where you tell yourself, 'Another 1K HP and I'd have survived.', but what you don't know is that with 8K/1300AC on a lot of 2 rounds you'll be taking 1K more damage than the other combination.  You can't say AC doesn't matter until you've hard data from what happens without AC.<br>

<br>
The orc pawn in freeport has a very small range, say somewhere in the 0-100 range. Once you hit that 100 ac, adding more doesn't make much of a difference (since you've pretty much beaten his atk rating completely - the rest is just random numbers).<br>
<br>
Kobolds in Sol B.... I'm just making up numbers here as an example. Let's say that if you have 600 AC or less, you get maxed quite a lot, and adding AC up to that 600 point has hardly any effect. That's because the Kobold's range of &quot;effective&quot; mitigation (or the start of the steep section of the damage curve listed earlier) is right around 600. You can keep adding AC between 600 and 900 and notice some very nice effects from your AC, all the way up to the top of the curve, where adding more AC doesn't do much (since the kobold is min hitting much of the time, and it's just down to randoms).<br>
<br>
For the AoW? Who knows what his range is, no one is able to reach an AC high enough to plot out the curve. Maybe the effective range - the range where adding AC gives you the best results - against him is 1500-2200? There's just no way for us to know right now.<br>
<br>
I know these statements to be true, at least on the basic level. The way the code is implemented may be different, but just think about how your tanking ability has changed against the mobs you fight as you upgrade gear and level (or the second time through, with a high AC twink). Each mob is different, each has a certain stat (or set of stats) that determine where its &quot;opposing AC&quot; should be, for lack of a better term. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=443380" target="_blank">Daxos Valdorn</a><br>

You may have another high lvl character I dont know.  But many of these warriors here have had experience tanking things that from your lvl i would have to surmise you probably havent even seen.  Some of them have tested theories against these mobs.  <br>
<br>
I am by no means uber.  But i have done some very uncontrolled tests of my own and have my own theories that are also very similar to those of the majority of the board here.  <br>

Brut is right tho.

Of course, HP has the most noticeable effect.  100 more HP is 100 more HP, but you can't really tell what another 15 AC does for you by eyeballing, so I can understand why HP is chosen over AC, but you need to parse things to have any proof whether HP is better than AC or vice versa. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90049">Phantron</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=graalthedorf>Graal the Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>is a Formidable Opponent</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/9/02 7:11:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2591.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: is there a new AC cap?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Of course, HP has the most noticeable effect. 100 more HP is 100 more HP, but you can't really tell what another 15 AC does for you by eyeballing, so I can understand why HP is chosen over AC, but you need to parse things to have any proof whether HP is better than AC or vice versa.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
You can't compare mobs from different expansions, it won't work. Each expansion's ubers and higher levels are tuned to characters of the corresponding level. So AoW versus the Frenzied Ghoul from LGuk is a worthless comparison.<br>
<br>
You can't compare mobs of different levels. The Orc in EC is green while the AoW is deep deep red at 55. So tell me, do you actually know that at level 3 you only need 600 or 700 or whatever incredibly low number to reach the orcs soft cap? No, you do not.<br>
<br>
The devs stated publicly that a soft cap DOES exist. This was at a fan faire Q&amp;A. I wish I could remember which, but I can't and I'm not going digging. The dev stated that AC is made up of 3 components. One of those components has a hard cap, one has a point of dimishing returns, and the last is a free range number. He said this translated to a baseline softcap, not a per mob softcap.<br>
<br>
You can not claim that the soft cap exists only per mob when even your anectodal evidence is un-provable. The contention has been made that the reason you can't cap against the AoW is because no one can get the gear to get high enough. But tell me, how do you know that you aren't already at the cap and that even with 2200 points of AC you won't get any noticable returns? The simple answer is that you don't. The AoW whoops your ass primarily because he's red. <br>
<br>
At 65 he's a joke, at 60 he's brutal, at 55 he's an impossibility, regardless of your AC. <p>Shelrabbi Hassida<BR>

<br>
4 components, not 3. And of those components, 3 of them are capped...because those components are defense skill, AGI, and level. The AGI portion of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>avoidance</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> AC (note we are talking about mitigation AC here btw) is softcapped. AGI above 200 doesn't provide as much <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>avoidance</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> AC per point of AGI as it does below 200.<br>
<br>
What is the component that I didn't mention? Raw AC from items. The whole point of the &quot;soft cap&quot; discussion all along has been to answer a simple question...does adding more raw AC via gear increase tanking ability.  <br>
<br>
BTW, what the dev actually said is &quot;there is no softcap&quot;. I'm not going to spend the time looking, but if you want to go to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/archives.asp">eq.crgaming.com/archives.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> feel free to look for it.<br>

It's actually even incredibly lower than 600 or 700. You mean you don't have twinks? Get a level 3 twink and give him 100 raw AC in items and see what percentage of hits from an orc pawn in EC are min hits. <br>

You are right. You can't compare mobs from different expansions. I have a question for you. What changes when you fight mobs from different expansions? Is it the basic mechanics of the game? Or is it some characteristic of the mob? <br>
