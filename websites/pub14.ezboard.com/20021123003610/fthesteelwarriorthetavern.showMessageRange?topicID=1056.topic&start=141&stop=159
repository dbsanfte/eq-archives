<br>
Avoidance AC is checked against a random roll and a portion of the attacker's atk to see whether you get hit or missed. Avoidance AC is made up from defense skill and AGI, with monks getting an extra ~230? avoidance AC just for being a monk and not going over the weight limit. Gear has no effect on avoidance beyond increasing AGI. The avoidance portion of AC cannot be raised except by increasing defense skill (which is capped) and adding AGI (which is capped).<br>
<br>
Mitigation AC is what is checked after the combat engine has determined that you have been hit. Your mitigation is compared to a random roll and a portion of the attacker's atk rating to determine how much damage you will take. You cannot take less than a certain amount of damage regardless of how much mitigation AC you have. Mitigation AC is made up mainly of the raw AC from gear, along with a lesser contribution from the defense skill.<br>
<br>
Pre ROK, monks had much higher defense and better secondary avoidance skills like block. They also had much, much lower raw AC from items. Monks got hit less often than warriors did, but took more damage when they did get hit. Warriors at the time had about 50% more hp than monks did, which in the long run made them the better tanks for anything that was moderately difficult.<br>
<br>
Now, the situation is different. It isn't terribly difficult for a monk to get the same <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> effective</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mitigation AC as a warrior (due to the effects of mitigation AC being tiny after a certain point) and still have much better avoidance. A monk with 1300 AC will have less mitigation AC than a warrior with 1300 AC, but more avoidance. A monk with 1400+ AC will have essentially the same mitigation AC, but much better avoidance. Mitigation AC is broken, that is the problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
At the same time, the hp difference between warriors and monks has shrunk drastically due to all/all gear to the point where it isn't out of the ordinary for high end warriors to only have about a 20% hp advantage over monks, when it used to be 50%. Now do you see the problem? <br>
<br>
Monks effectively tank much better relative to warriors than they ever did before, have nifty utility abilities like FD, sneak, mend, and ID, and do considerably more damage than warriors do. This is all supposed to be balanced by the weight penalty. With the amount of 0.0 weight, ALL/ALL items with high AC and high hp, that penalty is gone.  <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

Monks are by far the most superior in more areas than any other melee class, bar none.  Excellent soloing.  Extremely good tanking.  Superb melee damage.  An ability to heal themselves.  200+ more base AC than other melee just for being a Monk.  And to top it all off they have been given access to armor of equal mitigation in most slots to a Warrior's and additional HP enough to close the gap on Warrior's by 20%.<br>
<br>
So while I don't happen to want to see Monks nerfed, if any melee class in the game had it coming, Monks would be it.

Thats not true, prerok was hard for alot of monks to get groups cause no one knew their true advantages. in prerok everyone wanted cleric/war/rog/enchanter the rest were just fill ins. <br>

&quot; Their FD ability makes them a must have for 80-90 percent of the raids.&quot;<br>

<br>
well consider a lot of tanking is gaining and keeping argo then never have monks been better at tanking then knights or warriors, But if you dont count argo then monks always been better then knights and wars till rok. Thats why monks make good rampage tanks (we gain argo VERY slowly).<br>

&quot;Add to that mend&quot;<br>
why is it that wars want to throw out def disc cause of the reuse time but they are so quick to throw in mend(mend also has a long reuse time)?<br>

If there was no soft cap warriors would still have a higher mitigation ac easy.<br>
<br>
&quot;additional HP enough to close the gap on Warrior's by 20%.&quot;<br>
Dam would you stop useing % in compairing hps. Since the first hp item the hp% gab has closed thats a fact. Like I said before you want more hps? have them remove the 255 cap on stam.<br>

Fair enough.  So, how about your melee damage?  What does that equate to?  Sorry, defensive got used to equate to mend.  How about feign death, what does that equate to?  Sorry, defensive is taken.  Almost exactly the same mitigation with the exception of a few slots?  Sorry, no defensive doesn't also equal that.  Better avoidence?  Oops, looks like defensive is taken.<br>
<br>
Thats right, every time anyone wants to try and deflate an VALID arguement, they point to defensive.  And defensive is ONLY as useful as mend.  Its on a timer.  It only works part of the time.  It doesn't justify EVERY other catagory being crap.<br>
<br>
Monk vs Warrior comparison:<br>
<br>
Better avoidence = Better HP (which has DECREASED compared to Monks since Velious)<br>
Mend =  Defensive<br>
Better damage output = Nothing<br>
Feign Death = Nothing<br>
Similar Mitigation = Similar Mitigation (and since over 1300 is wasted even in those FEW slots where a Warrior actually has an advantage its pointless)<br>
<br>
So as you can see, in a comparison of USEFUL traits, the Monks come out ahead.  Lets just accept that, shall we?<br>
<br>
The Velious quested Monk armor was the armor DESIGNED to be the equal to Warrior quested armor.  But no one wears that crap, the Monks go for the all/all stuff that drops off the named.  I don't blame them for that, I would as well if I was a Monk.  But it does throw the mitigation out of wack, and nothing can change that.  <br>
<br>
Now, are the Monks at fault or to blame for any of this?  Hell no, its Verant's designer's issue.  But don't argue that the problem doesn't exist, because anyone with a bit of common sense can see that it does.  <br>

Monks were given our intended armor via the kael thurg ss quests and they WERE balanced with were a monk should be tank wise, capable, but not near first choice. What really bugs me is all this bs about how monks need to be nerfed. We dont need to be nerfed because there is nothing overpowered about our CLASS. Whats overpowering is all that damn GEAR that drops in the high end. All that wonderful 45 ac headbands that are all/all and similar gear with obscene ac hp and other stats that any class can wear. Stop looking to those monks in guilds that farm vt and are wearing maybe one other peice of monk only gear besides their epic and claiming that all monks need to be nerfed. (BTW, I am not inferring that YOU personally have been calling for monk nerfs, just in general a lot of people) I mean really, its kind of sad that so many are calling for nerfs to a class that only becomes overpowered after you have finished gearing all your warriors in ntov or better gear.<br>
Thats right, I said overpowered. I admit it, no denying that in NO WAY were monks supposed to equal the mitigation or near the hp of a warrior. We were always meant to be tanks, just not as good as a warrior. Once again, it is the GEAR that is the problem, not the class, so stop calling for nerfs to a class that doesnt deserve one. <br>

(and i really really hate that softcap crap for ac, as i asume all other classes do also,) hell, i see 57 pallys/sk's soloing in velks (3 mobs in a row before haveing to stop). i cant do that, but that is my choice as a warrior, to be dependent on other classes. haveing the use of spells and also melee ability should not make you equal to a warrior, and should not make you equal to a cleric. that is the whole point of being a hybred, you have use of both skills, but are not as profecient as either of the other two classes you are part of. so, if you want to be one or the other, make that toon, otherwise let us try to be the soul purpose of our class, and that is to be able to take damage while others kill the mob. dont get me wrong, i like sk and pallys, but you are not pure melee.<br>
<br>
p.s. btw, i thought this board was for us warriors to discuss things, not for other classes to come in and give us there opinions wether they are right or wrong.../shrug<br>
<br>
ok, feel free to flame me, i dont care, because i know what i am talking about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
edit: ok, just wanted to add also that, the 2hs versus 1hs idea, use 2 one hand slash, i have tested and found that you definately do more damage with them instead of a 2hs. this was tested with useing my epic (no, did not count procs into consideration and had someone with me lower level while in fg that was useing /con to get the same level of the shroom) <p>> > <h6 align="center"><img src="http://blissett.net/eq/sigs/sig_kedin.jpg"

<br>
In a Seb xp grind group heading for the discoes, you have everything except a tank and you suddenly see /ooc Warlord lfg and /ooc 56 Pally lfg, hmmm, who to take???  I'd take the Pally.  Sure, 4 levels lower, but guess what, no problems with aggro.  The Warlord will do what every Warrior has ever done, mash the Taunt button, wait 6 seconds, mash the Taunt button, pray your weapon procs while waiting the next 6 seconds to mash the Taunt button and peel the mob off the Rogue.  The 56 Pally casts Flash of Light (level 9 spell) and instantly has aggro.  If the Pally loses aggro, well that's nothing a stun or another Flash of Light can't fix within a couple seconds.  Plus the 56 Pally can backup heal, buff, root, stun.  The Warlord on the hand can...ummmmm...<br>
<br>
As for damage mitigation in this case, there is no difference, the Pally likely has enough AC where it won't matter and chances are you're not using Defensive on Frogloks.  So the Cleric has to CH a bit more, but then again the cleric never has to heal the Rogue because the stupid Taunt button isn't doing anything.<br>
<br>
There is absolutely no purpose to having a Warrior in an xp grind group if there is a Knight available, there just isn't.  We can't acquire or hold aggro with anywhere close to a Knight's consistency.  Our dps is FAR lower than Monks, Rogues, or Rangers with a clear bow shot and is only slightly better than a 2H equipped Knight.  We can't snare, buff, or add anything usable to the group.<br>
<br>
I am absolutely opposed to mobs getting damage bonuses when attacking other classes, that's just plain stupid.  Most high end mobs already hit hard enough, there is no reason for the chanters to die even faster.<br>
<br>
I also think that the Knights should be as good as Warriors in terms of tanking ability, that all 3 classes should have an equal value in a group.  Since succesful tanking requires the ability to acquire and maintain aggro and the Knights have spells uniquely suited to that purpose, there needs to be some balancing done in other areas.  AC is a wash, forget about changing that, it won't happen, plus any changes would further widen the gap between the uber-guild/uber-twink Haves and the Have-Nots who don't have those advantages.<br>
<br>
Some sort of skill or innate ability that reduces damage taken would go a long way towards helping repair the gross imbalance that currently exists.  VI can scrap the Defensive disc if that's the price we have to pay for innate Warrior-only damage reduction.  How about a Block skill tied directly to our Dual Wield ability so we have a chance to Block with an offhand weapon?<br>
<br>
The Taunt skill needs to be improved or changed, period.  The more I think about it and the lame &quot;but if we improve Taunt then the game will be trivialized&quot; arguement, the more I realize just how much BS it is.  The only thing trivialized is Warriors.  Knights can grab and hold aggro without even touching the Taunt button.  Instant, nearly permanent aggro.  If that doesn't trivialize most encounters, I don't know what will.  Warriors on the other hand get to mash the Taunt button every 6 seconds and pray that our weapons proc.<br>
<br>
Other needed improvements for Warriors besides some kind of innate damage reduction and a workable Taunt skill...<br>
<br>
Lesser versions of Enraging Blow weapons since 99% of all Warriors will NEVER see these weapons except in someone else's hands.  Something to bridge the gap between the Willsappers/Wavecrashers/Frostys and the EB weapons that drop off mobs that only uber guilds ever see.<br>
<br>
Make Severilious spawnable only and on less than a one week timer.  Or do something like the Druid version of Fay where only the quest spawned version drops the Green Scale.  The Epic is hard enough without having to pay 75k to the manaburn team that shredded the poor lizard 15 minutes after the patch was done.<br>
<br>
Increase Piercing so that it caps at the same level as every other weapon skill.  It's a very minor point, but really, is a spear THAT much harder to use than mace or sword?<br>
<br>
Give Warriors and Warriors alone an increased damage bonus to boost our dps some.  The sacred 1.0:1.2:1.4 ratio is bs, it's closer to 1.0:1.5:2.0.  Instead of the (level-25)/3 formula, maybe something like (level-24)/2 for the mainhand weapon and (level-24)/6 for the offhand weapon.  At 60, that would be 18/6 rather than the current 11/0, not a huge increase but something to make us more effective at combat...that is what we are supposed to be good at, right? <p>Hyardgune Varangian <BR> 57 Ogre Myrmidon of Gathered Might</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uhyardgune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hyardgune</A> at: 9/2/02 10:01:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ukedintheoneeyed.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kedin the one eyed </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/2/02 10:58:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1056.topic&index=159>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Uh...</span><hr size=1> hehe all i can say is my eyes were bugging after all that reading, plus i had been up for nearly 24 hours (12 hour shifts and start of my weekend lol) <p>> > <h6 align="center"><img src="http://blissett.net/eq/sigs/sig_kedin.jpg"
