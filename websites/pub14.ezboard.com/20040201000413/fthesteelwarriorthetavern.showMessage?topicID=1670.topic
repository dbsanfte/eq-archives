Ok, I'm somewhat new to the game, been playing since maybe august or so.<br>
<br>
Played around with a bunch of different characters, but dont have a ton of time to play.  I generally play with my girlfriend.<br>
<br>
So, the deal is, I have tried most classes, and have characters in the 10-17 range in warrior, enchanter, magician, bard, and ranger classes.  Other classes are lower levels so far.  But I am enjoying playing my warrior grouped with her shaman quite a bit.  I also enjoy my enchanter, but that will be a post on a different class board <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I just have a lot of questions about basic stuff that isnt really out there easy to find.  <br>
<br>
I am an ogre warrior, level 11 so far.  I want to be able to get some levels quickly, to get to see more of the game.  Assuming that I have a shaman working with me, with decent gear herself, what sort of things should I look at as far as questing, good places to get exp, good equipment to use?<br>
<br>
First, I want to figure out how I should be working with my gear.  I manage to make reasonable money, and have around 1000 pp to play with, and could get more within a reasonable timeframe.  I currently have a centi shortsword and blackened alloy bastard sword that I bought, and have been using those two weapons skills exclusivly.  My armor varies from complete crap (ie, tattered leather) to decent (my bp is AC 17).  I dont know what to look for on a decent budget.  My plan before coming here was to keep saving for a FBSS, since haste seems so powerfull.  The other thing I was thinking of working towards is the Iksar breastplate for the regen.  Should I aim for these goals, or just worry about getting the AC up as high as I can?<br>
<br>
Second is hunting.  So far I really dont know where to hunt.  As an Ogre my options are limited.  I'm only dubious in Halas, and the PoK lets me do selling and banking ok.   But so far hunting in halas has been mediocre, blackburrow is starting to find dark blues at this point, never mind yellows.  Outdoor hunting in Halas is starting to feel the same.  I tried going to EC and taking an orc camp (partly to help faction), and the exp sucked.  I was thinking of the Dervish camps in WC, but I only went there once with a friend, I dont know if they are the right level range.  So, whats a good place to get exp in the 12-20 range?  <br>
<br>
Finally I am curious how guilds work.  My GF was asked if she wanted to join a guild, so we did, but they seem somewhat inactive, and what players there are are much higher level.  I dont see a whole lot of use in being in this guild at this point, but the more I read about applications etc, I dont want to just bail and hope I get into a guild later.  What sort of guild options are there where I could reasonably expect to round up a group to hunt with at my level range, or is that asking too much for a guild?  Should I be guildless until I get to the level where people start needing bigger groups?  Or should I stick out with this guild and hope more people come on around my level range?<br>
<br>
I know its a lot of questions, but I really do absorb things quite well, and I think I can do ok even without help, I just really want to maximize my time online.  with only 3-4 hours a night, 3-4 nights a week, I want to try and see the higher end of the game before next winter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have lots of time to browse websites and dig thru alakazams website during the day, but I try not to play and get too far ahead of my gf during this time.<br>

I'd look into crustacean shell (commonly referred to as crusty) or crafted, perhaps a mix and match of the two, depending on what's available and cheap in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
For weapons, you'll be dual wielding soon so look at getting some cheap yet reasonably decent 1hand weapons .  At your level, ratio is more important than procs.  Go for something in the 10 damage 20 delay range, you probably won't get something quite that but it gives you something to shoot for.<br>
<br>
Don't worry about it too awfully much, not for many levels yet.  Its not until the 30s or 40s that things really start becoming important gear wise.<br>
<br>
As far as experience goes, Northern Ro and Oasis are good at that level, at least they were in the day.  Once you get into the mid to late teens though, many people recommend pauldron caverns.<br>
<br>
Having a Shaman partner will make outside adventuring much easier, since sow is a life saver.<br>

While still important id reccomend going for 6ac/65hp rings and other hp/ac items. The last time I checked the iksar regen bp was steady at 6kpp but it might have dropped recently. An fbss should be pretty cheap at around 2k or maybe less in the bazaar I havent used one in over a year so no clue what the going rate is currently.  FYI, for your girlfriends shammy, work on raising HER hp too. For a shaman hp=mana. Unless its really abysmal, forget wis, get +hp then +mana gear. As for leveling fast, there is a reason why people talk about the ec, nro, oasis, loio, fm cycle. It really IS one of the easiest and fastest ways to level. I dont reccomend you take it as there are a number of great low level dungeons you could hunt in but the choice is yours. Upper guk, befallen, unrest, sol a, najena, all these are great dungeons to level up in and gain experience in important skills you will need later.<br>
Of course, as Dennis Miller would say, &quot;But thats just my opinion, I could be wrong.&quot;<br>

<br>
2 things that will make your world alot easier in the  low levels are haste and hp gear.  For now, the haste is prolly too much money.  So, try to focus on items that give alot of hps.  The velium fire wedding rings sell for ~800pp/pair, and they are 6ac 65 hps each.  Many lvl 60 chars still wear these staples.  Also, spider fur belt is a good, cheap waist slot item with decent ac and 40 hps.  <br>
<br>
That's 170 hps extra right there, or ~3-4 levels worth for you.   Not bad for ~1k. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=464869">Nyssah</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khazadum>Khazadum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/02 8:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   no</span><hr size=1> no real faction, but PAladual Caversn from 15ish to 25ish in one day, its like gettin PL'd without really gettin PL'd <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Stay in highpass till about 35..then head to Sol B if they still have pick-up groups there on your server, if not, then Exp grind in Echo Caverns until 40. 40-45 Dreadlands , Great Divide, Ice-Clad. 45-50 Karnors, Kael, Great Divide. 50 + ...Planes.<br>

Thanks for all the advice.  I managed to get a Magelo profile set up, but I cant seem to get the autoupdate thing to work.

<br>
But I'm less than one blue from 12 (Like one more kill, but it disconnected me, so I figure I'll get it tonight).   From the advice I've seen here, I'm going to try Paludal cavern at 15, it seems to be the common choice.  I'd like faction, but exp is far more important with PoK being so accessable.  As for now till 15, I figure the orcs will do ok for another level or two anyhow, so I'll stay where I am for now, maybe go to highpass at 13-14 if it starts drying up, but probably stay thru 15 otherwise.<br>
<br>
As for equipment, I'll wait till you see what I have before I make any buying descisions.  Btw, someone said haste wasnt that important with a shaman around, doesnt item haste stack with thier spells to make me even faster yet?  <br>

However, haste items are expensive.  Figure to pay somewhere around 2-3k for an entry level haste item and 30-100k for a decent haste item.  Haste early is good, however you can go for a lot of levels without haste. <p>The Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us. <br>

<br>
Crusty helm I am wearing now at 50 still.<br>
<br>
I'd still stay with the 6/65 rings, and spider fur belt.  Just don't overpay for them.  800pp for the rings, no more than 200pp for the belt.<br>
<br>
Tattered mantle would be a good cheap upgrade.  Antlered mask or tribal war mask, both should be hella cheap.  It's refreshing to see someone starting off from scratch again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=464869">Nyssah</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=keaneabrams>Keane Abrams</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are superior</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/02 6:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Guilds</span><hr size=1> I am gonna tackle the guild question here.<br>
<br>
On your server there are likely several different types of guilds. Guilds that do nothing but raid, guilds that require you to be lvl 60, guilds that are just about grouping, fun, and exp etc etc...<br>
<br>
Before you make a decision on what guild (if any) to join. Ask yourself and your GF what you want in a guild. Are you looking for some toons in your lvl range to group with? Do you want hand me downs from the higher lvl players? <br>
<br>
You may want to just start making a friends list instead. Most players are in several guild during their players life. You change, guilds change, friends change. Don't feel that the guild you pick now has to last to 65, but at the same time take your guild seriously. Don't change guilds every month for a minor reason.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, group with members of any guild you join before you join it. Make friends, and do some research.  <p>Keane Abrams<br>
