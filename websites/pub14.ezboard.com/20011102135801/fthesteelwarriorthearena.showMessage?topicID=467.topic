<br>
I was just sitting here bored at college (as you do) so thought to make this post.<br>
<br>
Now i got my shaman to 60 so thought to start an alt, i thought to myself what class is most needed on major RAIDS, a class we cant have enough of. it didnt take me long to see that warriors was one of the best classes that is needed to take down that uber mob.<br>
<br>
looking at all the posts here on races that make a good warrior i chosent an iksar warrior.<br>
<br>
Why did i choose an iksar? its really simple really. being in an uber guild i had the chance to talk to MANY lvl 60 warriors of alot of different races. i asked them one simple question to start off. what is more important to a warrior? AC or HPs. of all the warriors i asked they all said AC. i did not hesitate the fact that iksar are the best race for AC. they also get regen, high base agi, forage (always useful) infravison and imo they look cool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Now point distribution. i basically put points into agi and str to make base 100 agi and base 100 str. i do feel to a degree that it should have been stam and agi and not str and agi.<br>
<br>
Now here is my warriors stuff. His name is Chakkorsis and im quite pleased with him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
ARMOR:<br>
Kylong helm.<br>
2x couger claw earrings<br>
2x velium fire wedding rings<br>
cloak of the maelstrom (kael quest)<br>
Dragon tooth choker (skyshrine quest)<br>
worked dragonhide mask (westwasists) AC10 mask.<br>
Royal frosted velium arms, 1 bracer and gloves.<br>
Heavy dragonhorn boots.<br>
RBG<br>
Tree weave (imo not a bad tunic that is tradeable)<br>
Rygor leggings<br>
<br>
WEAPONS:<br>
Lammy (prim)<br>
Jagged longsword (secondary)<br>
Club of the ice ocean (cant use till 51)<br>
wurmslayer<br>
heavy velium brawl stick (32/39 2hb)<br>
kunzar... thingy, procs dark. (used when no snarer)<br>
<br>
his name is Chakkorsis and is lvl 44 atm.<br>
<br>
i think that iksar make perhaps the best warriors because of the AC they get. Ogers have been said by some to make the worst warriors /shrug because they require too much healing. with low AC and agi but uber hps, they just get hit for more dmg and loose that 5k+ hps fast when someone of high AC and like 4K hps would get hit less and require less healing saving the cleric mana.<br>
<br>
IS the HP diff between an iksar and oger THAT different at 60? with the same buffs iv noticed that an oger warrior only has like 300-500 hps more TOPS. with a mob hitting for 1000k+ a pop dose that extra hps make any diff? NO! but the extra AC dose!!.<br>
<br>
well there you go, this is my warrior and my opinions. feed back is welcome flames i will just /rude. thnx info <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/27/01 3:45:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: First post here and a lil view on warriors</span><hr size=1> Well also being from Povar I can attest that you have one of the deepest pools of post-50 knowledge to pull from being in Triton. <br>
<br>
Curious tho... you made a HP comparison between an Ogre and an Iksar - what was the AC difference? And how does that compare to the other 60 warriors specifically the ones with a high starting Agi like Giantt(halfling) and Krellyk(think he is a wood elf right)? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/utheaarondome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>theAaronDome</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>knows that Warriors are Superior</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/27/01 4:31:17 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/theaarondome/blue.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: First post here and a lil view on warriors</span><hr size=1> well not that it matters, but i dont think it is a question. Ogres are the best warriors. Granted Iksars have around a 40ac bonus at, what 60? <br>
<br>
well 40ac aint going to matter in a uber encounter, in fact going in naked dont really matter, ac wise. when a mob is beyond your lvl, it's going to eat your ass up no matter what. ya know lvl is god and ac is king. so in fact ac is out the door and you stock up on resist/hp gear. <br>
<br>
now granted day to day in seb, ac is what matters. but still id take immunity to frontal slam(may fave racial ability), slam, and a few more HP, to a few more ac. further if it is true that Ogres are immune to rampage, you can chalk up another pro for them. <br>
<br>
one more thing...wtf is this? &quot;Ogers have been said by some to make the worst warriors /shrug because they require too much healing&quot;. --do you really think the agility difference makes that much difference? <br>
<br>
Either way it's kool, Goodluck on that Iky. <p><font size=2 color=red face= ariel>

Looking at racial advantages (other than sight):<br>
<br>
Iksar: Regen, ac boost (40ac at lvl 60)<br>
Troll: Regen, high sta<br>
Ogre: No frontal stuns, high sta<br>
<br>
Of these no frontal stun is by far the most beneficial.  When you're tanking a tankable raid level mob and get stunned that's bad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The hp between two different race warriors will be the same at the same level (ignoring hps from gear) with the same sta.  Sta is the hardest of the stats to max.  Sta is important enough to max that warriors even go so far as to wear junk like barbed dragonscale shoulders/boots for the big sta boost at the cost of some ac.  The Ogre advantage is maxing sta in normal gear, this means that given comprable gear an Ogre will have higher ac and higher or same hps as any other warrior.  Maxing str, agi and dex is trivial by level 60 for raid situations...sta is the only one that presents a challenge.   <p>Gorlab 59 Warrior<BR>

<br>
I talked to someone about this not getting hit by RAMPAGE thing. From what i understood it is a roumer at best but ill have to look into it further and when my iky is high enough, test it out myself.<br>
<br>
someone said that for a uber encounter that extra 40 AC makes no diff right? well nor dose 400 odd extra hps a oger gets when something like the AoW hits for 1100. I dont know if this is true or not, but isnt AC and agi a factor to wether the uber mob MISSES you or not?. not trying to state that as fact just asking a question.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, its going to be hard to compare warrior races unless we did do that test i sujested.<br>
<br>
i think i will try that some time. ill make full patchwork and get a oger warrior and iksar warrior who are lvl 60 (prolly Titch and Blass) get them to unequip all other stuff (including weps) and tell me their HPs and AC totaly unbuffed in nothing more than patchwork. Or would just asking them what their stats are when they naked just work as well? hehe less fugging about that way.<br>
<br>
Im not saying that the unstunable and high stam isnt good cos it is, its very good infact. but not having that isnt the end of the world and dose NOT make a warrior any less of a tank for groups or on a raid.<br>

<br>
&gt;someone said that for a uber encounter that extra 40 AC <br>
&gt;makes no diff right? well nor dose 400 odd extra hps a <br>
No you misunderstood.  Iksar stamina is so low that you will end up wearing lower ac/hp gear to boost stamina.  The end result is wearing gear that maxes your stamina under normal lvl 60 raid buffs the Ogre will not have to put on the extra +sta gear and ends up with higher ac in the long run.<br>
<br>
&gt;isnt AC and agi a factor to wether the uber mob MISSES you <br>
&gt;or not?. not trying to state that as fact just asking a <br>
Agi gives you ac and that's it (in a roughly 5-6agi per 1ac ratio).  Yes ac is the factor in whether the mob misses you or not. <br>
<br>
&gt;At the end of the day, its going to be hard to compare <br>
&gt;warrior races unless we did do that test i sujested.<br>
I, and others have. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Don't bother with patchwork just have them check naked.  Play around with agi to even out their agility and you can compare ac to see the iksar boost.<br>
<br>
&gt;get them to unequip all other stuff (including weps) and <br>
&gt;tell me their HPs and AC totaly unbuffed in nothing more <br>
Well that's a meaningless comparison.  My ability to wear better ac/hp gear instead of +sta gear is part of what helps boost me over other race warriors in hp/ac.  One example many/most warriors wear barbed dragonscale shoulders, ac9 10sta while I can wear ac15 65hp shoulders and we both max our sta...who comes out ahead there?  Recall that str, dex and agi all max very easily at 60 in full raid buffs.  (Now side note with some of the very uber items my guildies are closing the gap with the silly amounts of +sta warlords gives us, and sta has always been a problem.)<br>
<br>
&gt;Im not saying that the unstunable and high stam isnt good <br>
&gt;cos it is, its very good infact. but not having that isnt <br>
&gt;the end of the world and dose NOT make a warrior any less <br>

Absolutely, race is the least important thing about a warrior. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
