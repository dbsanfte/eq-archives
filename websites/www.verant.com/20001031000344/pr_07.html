  WIRE) </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">&#150;</font> <font size="-1">Oct. 18, 
  1999 <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">&#150;</font></font>
<p>989 Studios<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">&#153;</font>, a Sony Computer Entertainment 
  Group Company, announced today that its top-selling online PC title EverQuest<sup>&reg;</sup> 
  has broken all subscription-based online gaming sales records. 
<p>In only six months, EverQuest has sold more games than any other online role-playing game ever released, with 225,000 units 
  sold and an active subscriber base of more than 150,000 players. 
<p>''EverQuest has changed the traditional lifecycle and sales curve of entertainment software,'' said Kelly Flock, president, 
  989 Studios. ''What is most impressive is the fact that EverQuest's sales and subscriptions numbers are continuing to grow 
  by the thousands week after week. Frankly, EverQuest is performing more like a blockbuster movie than the usual online computer 
  game.'' 
<p>The allure of EverQuest, which released in February 1999 &#150; and was developed by 989 Studios' PC division, the predecessor 
  of Verant Interactive &#150; involves the game's multitude of expansive adventures and detailed quests that provide a unique 
  interactive storyline that evolves according to a player's decision. Players can choose to begin the game in any of three 
  continents, with more than 70 adventure zones and 12 cities. Each of these continents has diverse species, economic systems, 
  alliances and politics. 
<p>''EverQuest is way ahead of its time, both technologically and conceptually,'' added Flock. ''Its continual popularity 
  can be attributed to its uniqueness and addictive gameplay, which differs from any other form of personal entertainment, 
  be it books, movies or even videogames. Simply, by transporting the gameplayer into another world, with tens of thousands 
  of people playing online simultaneously, EverQuest offers gamers an unparalleled immersive social experience.''
<p>During peak periods, EverQuest adventurers and dragon slayers can form alliances with up to 37,000 other players simultaneously. 
  The active global EverQuest subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries throughout the ''real'' world, 
  including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France and New Zealand.
