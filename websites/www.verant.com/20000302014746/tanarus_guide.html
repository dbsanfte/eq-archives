<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="5">Tanarus Beginner's Guide</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are new to Tanarus, take a few minutes to read this short introduction 
  to the best action game on the Internet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Options</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the Tanarus title screen you are offered several choices. Click on Options. 
  Configure your system and graphics card. Tanarus can run without a 3-D graphics card, but if you have one, make sure you 
  select it in the Graphics Option area. Tanarus looks much better when using a 3-D card, plus it offers strategic advantages 
  (the ability to see an opponents shields, etc.).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Basics</b></font></p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you first enter the game, you'll be in a chat room known as the Command 
      Center. Just type to chat. At the top of the screen there are various buttons. Click the Arenas button. Select an arena 
      type, then click OK to enter the arena. There are many types of arenas, but the basic three are Open style, Force Wars, 
      and Phoenix Wars. </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Open style allows full selection of tank types and equipment configurations 
        and this version is Tanarus at its best. Choose and play in Beginner to learn the ropes. </font></p></li>
      <li><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Force Wars is a variant in which everyone plays the same tank and carry 
        only force missiles. Force missiles do not damage opponents but instead give them a good shove. Force opponents into 
        ramps or off catwalks to kill them. </font></p></li>
      <li><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phoenix Wars is another variant in which all players use the same tank, 
        but can carry both phoenix missiles and rockets. It's a fast action game, but you'll drive more than fight at first.</font></p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you've chosen an arena, you will see a list of the available cities. 
      Find one that has an opening on one or more of the 4 teams and click on that team's button.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You are now at the Tank Selection screen. Near the screen's top center, choose 
      a tank by clicking on the arrows on either side of the tank. Use the default weapons for now by pressing the Load Config 
      button. Enter the city by clicking on Enter Arena button.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You are in your team's base. All tanks that are your color are on your team. 
      Don't shoot them. Stay with them and shoot the other guys. In the upper right corner is your radar. You are in the center.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The F2 key toggles an arena map display. You are the blinking spot. Your 
      teammates show up as colored dots. The white dots are recons used to repair and recharge your tank. To use these recons, 
      drive over the square and hit Enter. You have a special "base recon" where you can reconfigure your tank. You can only 
      use recons that are white or the same color as your team. Enemy recons will drain your power.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To talk in the arenas hit / for arena chat and ' for team chat.</font></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is much more to the game but this will get you started. A manual is included 
  in your Tanarus folder and strategies are available at <a href="http://www.tanarus.com">www.tanarus.com</a>. Print out this 
  <a href="media/keyboard_shortcuts.gif">Tanarus keyboard shortcuts</a> card for reference while playing.</font></p>
