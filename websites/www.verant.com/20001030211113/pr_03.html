  8, 1999 &#150;</font> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="http://www.989studios.com" target="_blank">989 
  Studios</a> announced today that its highly anticipated PC title EverQuest<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#153;</font> 
  has broken industry record numbers for pre-sell orders and has become the number 
  one PC pre-sold game on <a href="http://www.ebworld.com" target="_blank">EBWorld.com</a>. 
  Heralded by game reviewers as an extraordinary evolution in online role-playing 
  games, EverQuest features a multitude of adventures and quests that break the 
  mold in the online role-playing game genre. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;We have already received phenomenal feedback on the pre-launch of EverQuest 
  from all of our retailers and are obviously very pleased by the high volume 
  of pre-sell orders,&quot; said Jeffrey Fox, vice president, marketing, 989 Studios. 
  &quot;EverQuest is literally the most detailed and visually stunning role-playing 
  game ever developed and since we are limiting the initial build of this game 
  to ensure no server issues, consumers should take advantage of the pre-sell 
  opportunities to make sure they can secure a copy of EverQuest before the retail 
  launch on March 16.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The retail pre-sell promotions that began February 1 allows consumers to either 
  pre-purchase or put a deposit on their copy of EverQuest at select retail outlets 
  across the nation. To date, more than 8,000 consumers have reserved a copy of 
  the game. With one week remaining before EverQuest&#146;s retail launch, 989 
  Studios is estimating that the pre-sell list will exceed 10,000 units. After 
  consumers have purchased EverQuest at retail, there will be a fee of $9.89 per 
  month for access to the ever-changing world of EverQuest. <br>
  <br>
  EverQuest allows thousands of gamers from all over the world to adventure solo, 
  at great peril, or join forces with online allies to fight off enemies together. 
  The <a href="http://www.station.sony.com" target="_blank">Station@sony.com</a> 
  will be the official provider of EverQuest software updates and news about the 
  game, message boards and other community features, as well as an easy-to-use 
  billing system for EverQuest&#146;s monthly subscription fee.<br>
