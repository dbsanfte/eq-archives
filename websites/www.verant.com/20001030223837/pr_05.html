<p>Sony Online Entertainment Inc. together with Verant Interactive, Inc. a premier developer of online games, announce the 
  development of Sovereign, the first ever massively multiplayer real time strategy game scheduled to launch exclusively on 
  <a href="http://www.station.sony.com" target="_blank">The Station@sony.com</a> in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of 2000. Components 
  of the game will debut to the public at the GenCon Game Fair, in the Midwest Express Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin from August 
  5<sup>th</sup> through the 9th. Further information can be obtained at The Station at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/sovereign" target="_blank">http://www.station.sony.com/sovereign</a>. 
  Sovereign will join 989 Studios’ EverQuest<sup>&reg;</sup> as the second Verant game created by the Verant Interactive development 
  team on The Station@sony.com’s game roster.</p>
<p>Sovereign is a real time strategy game played on a grand scale, allowing up to 500 people to gather online simultaneously 
  in a single game. Built to take advantage of cutting edge Internet technology, Sovereign, a game of empire conquest, is 
  similar in structure to classics such as <i>Diplomacy, Command &amp; Conquer, </i>and<i> Civilization </i>and features diplomacy 
  and persistence as characteristics crucial to success. In a stunningly rendered game environment, players can roam an entire 
  planet constructing cities, airbases and seaports, building and deploying massive armies, launching air and land attacks 
  with nuclear or chemical weapons and spying on enemy empires via orbital satellites.</p>
<p>&quot;We pushed the envelope of massively multiplayer gaming with 989 Studios’ EverQuest and created an entirely new set 
  of expectations for the fantasy role player. Building on what we’ve learned and applying it to a strategy game will result 
  in an incredible new product. Sovereign is this product, &quot; stated John Smedley, President and CEO of Verant Interactive. 
</p>
<p>The persistent nature of the Sovereign world allows strategy gamers to spend every waking moment online playing out their 
  dreams of conquest. But for those who must occasionally sleep, Sovereign offers options for allowing empires to remain operational 
  while the player is logged off, to be run by allies, the computer, or simply be shielded from attack.</p>
<p>The game also delivers on a unique roleplaying element to offer the ability to develop and roleplay custom characters (or 
  personas). Each persona, ranging from soldier to spy, from scientist to theologian, continues from one game to the next, 
  thereby allowing players to advance in rank over an extended period of time by gradually building technology and experience 
  points. </p>
<p>Like EverQuest, Sovereign will be sold at retail and played exclusively online at The Station@sony.com (www.station.sony.com). 
  The first month will be free, and thereafter, unlimited play is available for a flat monthly subscription fee. Subscriptions 
  can be purchased by the month, or for multiple months at a discounted rate.</p>
<p> &quot;Sony Online Entertainment is thrilled to present this groundbreaking title as part of The Station’s commitment to 
  the serious online gamer,&quot; said Robert Gehorsam, SOE’s Senior Vice President, Programming and Platform Development. 
  &quot;It’s our goal to revolutionize the strategy gamer space as successfully as we’ve done with our mainstream titles such 
  as JEOPARDY! Online and Wheel of Fortune Online.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With Sovereign, Verant continues in the tradition of creating outstanding games that support massive online communities,&quot; 
  stated Brad McQuaid, Vice President of Verant Interactive. &quot;The development of Sovereign promises to further define 
  Verant as one of the leading developers of online games and propel a new and revolutionary era in strategy gaming. The incredible 
  success of 989 Studio’s EverQuest on The Station has excited us to partner with Sony Online Entertainment again to offer 
  the serious gamer the best online game experience possible.&quot;</p>
