<p>Makers of Best-Selling EverQuest&reg; Bring Expertise to a New Genre</p>
<p><b>SAN DIEGO, Calif., November 8, 2000</b> - Sony Online Entertainment Inc. is pleased to announce the development of &quot;PlanetSide&#153;,&quot; the first massively multiplayer first-person action game in PC gaming history.</p>
<p>&quot;We're leveraging our experience with EverQuest into an entirely new genre. Imagine a soldier-to-soldier combat and vehicular warfare game set within a massive persistent environment,&quot; said John Smedley, President and CEO of Sony Online Entertainment Inc. &quot;'PlanetSide' is a logical extension of Verant's online capabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>In the game, players assume the roles of mercenaries and reside in a distant galaxy where little semblance of law exists. In PlanetSide, these mercenaries rise within the ranks of one of four specialized corporations that offer both character development and professional growth.</p>
<p>&quot;'PlanetSide' expands the first-person action genre into an entirely new universe,&quot; said Kevin McCann, producer of the game. &quot;Both team-minded players as well as independent rogues are going to find a place within this game, which represents the culmination of years of Verant's work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We've created a persistent world where you work to capture bases and increase your worth over time - a place where you can return again and again, where your accomplishments are recorded and translated into statistics, merits, and other rewards.&quot;</p>
<p>More About &quot;PlanetSide&quot;<br>The &quot;PlanetSide&quot; continents measure approximately 64 square kilometers, varying from arctic wastelands to scorching deserts. Players work to capture various technological bases - using both soldier-to-soldier as well as vehicle-based combat - to eventually influence the control of the continent toward their chosen corporation.</p>
<p>There are four primary corporations that offer professional growth opportunities and steady income: the mining industry, the technological industry, the science and research industry and the military industry. These corporations &quot;sponsor&quot; players - offer a starting apartment and a Personal Computer Terminal where they can access job assignments, news, and e-mail.</p>
<p>&quot;PlanetSide,&quot; published by Sony Online Entertainment, is due to ship the third quarter of 2001 for the PC platform.</p>
<p>The game is currently featured on the cover of the December issue of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; magazine. Six screenshots from PlanetSide are available for FTP download at <a href="http://www.filekey.com/linnpr/PS-Screens.zip">www.filekey.com/linnpr/PS-Screens.zip</a>.</p>

<p><font size="-1">CULVER CITY, CA, May 31, 2000--</font></p>
<p><b>Verant Becomes Part of SOE as Sony Pictures Entertainment<br>Takes Steps to Strengthen Its Interactive Gaming Leadership Position</b></p>
<p>Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) announced today it has acquired the online games company Verant Interactive, Inc. and named prominent digital gaming executive Kelly Flock as president and CEO of Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) to bolster SOE's position as the dominant cyber-destination for interactive game enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Verant, a San Diego-based development studio that creates and markets cutting-edge online games, will be merged into SOE as part of SOE's effort to concentrate on becoming the premier attraction for interactive gaming enthusiasts from its new San Diego headquarters. With a staff of more than 150 software developers, Verant has been responsible for operating the popular online games EverQuest<font color="#CCCCCC">&reg;</font>, Tanarus<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">&#153;</font></font> and Sovereign<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">&#153;</font></font>. Verant President John Smedley will remain with SOE as executive vice president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Flock will supervise the development of engaging new interactive games by SOE and Verant, and will oversee SOE's award-winning Web site, the Station@sony.com, which features EverQuest, the top-selling online PC game title, and such popular attractions for non-paying, casual users as Wheel of Fortune, JEOPARDY! and Trivial Pursuit Online.</p>
<p>Yair Landau, president of SPE's recently created Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment (SPDE) unit, which includes SOE, said the acquisition of privately-held Verant and Mr. Flock's appointment reinforces SPE's determination to fortify its online businesses and enable SOE to deliver the most exciting, cutting-edge, network gaming to interactive consumers.</p>
<p>In Mr. Flock's previous role as president of the interactive game company 989 Studios, he oversaw the rapid growth of EverQuest into an interactive gaming powerhouse. Under his supervision, EverQuest broke all subscription-based online gaming sales records, reaching more than 250,000 paid subscribers and 350,000 units sold. During peak periods online, more than 60,000 people can play EverQuest simultaneously, acting as adventurers and dragon slayers in cyberspace. Average playing time per player is about 20 hours a week.</p>
<p>&#9;&quot;As the pre-eminent executive in the interactive gaming community, Kelly Flock is perfectly suited to build on Sony Online Entertainment's leadership position and lift it to new levels of excellence,&quot; said Howard Stringer, chairman and CEO of Sony Corporation of America (SCA). &quot;With all of his wonderful skills, talent and creativity, we're delighted that Kelly will continue to work his digital magic in the extended Sony family.&quot;</p>
<p>&#9;&quot;We're delighted to welcome Verant and Kelly into the fold at a time when interactive gaming is an increasingly important part of our business portfolio,&quot; said Mel Harris, co-president and chief operating officer for Sony Pictures Entertainment. &quot;Considering that consumers worldwide spent nearly $7 billion on computer games last year, we look to Kelly and his team at SOE to broaden our base and make us a pre-eminent force in this fast-growing business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The acquisition of Verant is a very natural fit for us, considering the way our companies have worked together on games like EverQuest. And, we've been very interested in having Kelly join us for some time,&quot; Mr. Landau said. &quot;Kelly is a world-class executive who commands enormous respect in the interactive gaming universe. As we focus more and more on SOE becoming a pure gaming company, we're pleased to bring aboard both a high-profile industry leader like Kelly and to acquire an innovative gaming leader in Verant to oversee both our 'casual' gaming, led by such tent-pole properties as Wheel of Fortune and JEOPARDY!, and our pay programming led by the hot-selling EverQuest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I continue to believe that online gaming is the fastest-growing, most exciting area of interactive entertainment,&quot; Mr. Flock said. &quot;It is a great honor to be able to rejoin the pioneers at SOE and the EverQuest development teams, under John Smedley's direction at Verant, in furthering our goal of facilitating the next evolution in games. Sony Online Entertainment has the edge in technology and content, and I am excited by the opportunity to create and lead the next mass-market category of gaming.&quot;</p>
<p>The appointment of Mr. Flock, a longtime Sony executive, as president of SOE coincides with a shift in emphasis and location for the interactive gaming concern. The company has sharpened its focus on SOE as a creator and distributor of all kinds of networked gaming, and has moved its headquarters from New York to San Diego, where Mr. Flock will be based.</p>
<p>Mr. Flock was appointed president of Sony Imagesoft in March 1995. Imagesoft evolved into Sony Computer Entertainment America's (SCEA's) sole North American development studio before launching as 989 Studios <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">&#153;</font></font>;, an SCEA wholly-owned independent PlayStation publisher, in April 1998. In that position, he was responsible for day-to-day operations of the cross-platform, multimedia entertainment software company and reported directly to Ken Kutaragi, the chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc., who was recently named to the Board of Directors of Tokyo-based Sony Corporation.</p>
<p>Before joining Sony, Mr. Flock held various senior executive positions at LucasArts Entertainment Company and other interactive entertainment companies, including Electronic Arts and Activision. During his tenure with LucasArts Entertainment Company, the company emerged as one of the leading CD-ROM publishers in the industry. He obtained his B.A. in English literature from San Francisco State University.</p>

<br>
<b>The future of gaming to be showcased as Sony Online Entertainment joins hands<br>with powerhouse Verant at Y2K E3</b><br>
<br>
The highly anticipated expansion to the world-renowned online role-playing game EverQuest<font color="#CCCCCC">&reg;</font>, EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">&#153;</font></font><font size="3">, along with the revolutionary and highly anticipated massively multiplayer real-time strategy game Sovereign</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">&#153;</font></font><font size="3">, are set to be showcased in booth #1346 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in the Los Angeles Convention Center by SOE and Verant,<br>May 11-13.</font></p>
<p>The Ruins of Kunark expands the EverQuest world by over 30% and gives EverQuest fans the chance to take on the new continent of &quot;Kunark&quot;. In addition to providing new lands for EverQuest fans, The Ruins of Kunark also introduces an entire new character race of lizard men, known as the Iksar.<br>
Players will now be able to conquer more than 20 new adventure zones, ranging from lush, densely forested areas, to deep and dark dungeons where danger lurks around every turn. The strongly-dedicated fan base of EverQuest will have a chance to view this newly-released expansion title that<br>is the next chapter in the unsurpassed, massively multi-player universe.</p>
<p>On Saturday, May 13, artist Keith Parkinson, who depicted the mythical world of &quot;Norrath&quot; in the artwork for EverQuest and the Ruins of Kunark expansion, will be on-site to meet people and autograph his works.</p>
<p>Also showcasing at E3 will be Sovereign, which is the first title to define a massively multiplayer real-time strategy game within a persistent universe. As in the world of EverQuest that has an active subscription base of more than 225,000, Sovereign combines the social phenomenon of an on-line community within a game of empire conquest, political intrigue, espionage, and diplomacy. The persistent nature of the Sovereign worlds allows strategy gamers to spend every waking moment online playing out their dreams of conquest. For those who must sleep, Sovereign offers options for allowing empires to remain operational while the player is logged off, to be run by allies, the computer, or simply shielded from attack.</p>

<p>In only six months, EverQuest has sold more games than any other online role-playing game ever released, with 225,000 units 
sold and an active subscriber base of more than 150,000 players. 
<p>''EverQuest has changed the traditional lifecycle and sales curve of entertainment software,'' said Kelly Flock, president, 
989 Studios. ''What is most impressive is the fact that EverQuest's sales and subscriptions numbers are continuing to grow 
by the thousands week after week. Frankly, EverQuest is performing more like a blockbuster movie than the usual online computer 
game.'' 
<p>The allure of EverQuest, which released in February 1999 &#150; and was developed by 989 Studios' PC division, the predecessor 
of Verant Interactive &#150; involves the game's multitude of expansive adventures and detailed quests that provide a unique

alliances and politics. 
<p>''EverQuest is way ahead of its time, both technologically and conceptually,'' 
added Flock. ''Its continual popularity can be attributed to its uniqueness 
and addictive gameplay, which differs from any other form of personal 
entertainment, be it books, movies or even video games Simply, by transporting 
the gameplayer into another world, with tens of thousands of people playing 
online simultaneously, EverQuest offers gamers an unparalleled immersive 
social experience.'' 
<p>During peak periods, EverQuest adventurers and dragon slayers can form alliances with up to 37,000 other players simultaneously.

<p>Sony Online Entertainment Inc. together with Verant Interactive, Inc. a premier developer of online games, announce the 
development of Sovereign, the first ever massively multiplayer real time strategy game scheduled to launch exclusively on 
<a href="http://www.station.sony.com" target="_blank">The Station@sony.com</a> in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of 2000. Components 
of the game will debut to the public at the GenCon Game Fair, in the Midwest Express Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin from August 
5<sup>th</sup> through the 9th. Further information can be obtained at The Station at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/sovereign" target="_blank">http://www.station.sony.com/sovereign</a>. 
Sovereign will join 989 Studios' EverQuest<sup>&reg;</sup> as the second Verant game created by the Verant Interactive development 
team on The Station@sony.com's game roster.</p>
<p>Sovereign is a real time strategy game played on a grand scale, allowing up to 500 people to gather online simultaneously 
in a single game. Built to take advantage of cutting edge Internet technology, Sovereign, a game of empire conquest, is 
similar in structure to classics such as <i>Diplomacy, Command &amp; Conquer, </i>and<i> Civilization </i>and features diplomacy 
and persistence as characteristics crucial to success. In a stunningly rendered game environment, players can roam an entire 
planet constructing cities, airbases and seaports, building and deploying massive armies, launching air and land attacks 
with nuclear or chemical weapons and spying on enemy empires via orbital satellites.</p>
<p>&quot;We pushed the envelope of massively multiplayer gaming with 989 Studios' EverQuest and created an entirely new set 
of expectations for the fantasy role player. Building on what we've learned and applying it to a strategy game will result 
in an incredible new product. Sovereign is this product, &quot; stated John Smedley, President and CEO of Verant Interactive. 
</p>
<p>The persistent nature of the Sovereign world allows strategy gamers to spend every waking moment online playing out their 
dreams of conquest. But for those who must occasionally sleep, Sovereign offers options for allowing empires to remain operational 
while the player is logged off, to be run by allies, the computer, or simply be shielded from attack.</p>
<p>The game also delivers on a unique roleplaying element to offer the ability to develop and roleplay custom characters (or 
personas). Each persona, ranging from soldier to spy, from scientist to theologian, continues from one game to the next, 
thereby allowing players to advance in rank over an extended period of time by gradually building technology and experience 
points. </p>
<p>Like EverQuest, Sovereign will be sold at retail and played exclusively online at The Station@sony.com (www.station.sony.com). 
The first month will be free, and thereafter, unlimited play is available for a flat monthly subscription fee. Subscriptions 
can be purchased by the month, or for multiple months at a discounted rate.</p>
<p> &quot;Sony Online Entertainment is thrilled to present this groundbreaking title as part of The Station's commitment to 
the serious online gamer,&quot; said Robert Gehorsam, SOE's Senior Vice President, Programming and Platform Development. 
&quot;It's our goal to revolutionize the strategy gamer space as successfully as we've done with our mainstream titles such 
as JEOPARDY! Online and Wheel of Fortune Online.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With Sovereign, Verant continues in the tradition of creating outstanding games that support massive online communities,&quot; 
stated Brad McQuaid, Vice President of Verant Interactive. &quot;The development of Sovereign promises to further define 
Verant as one of the leading developers of online games and propel a new and revolutionary era in strategy gaming. The incredible 
success of 989 Studio's EverQuest on The Station has excited us to partner with Sony Online Entertainment again to offer 
the serious gamer the best online game experience possible.&quot;</p>
