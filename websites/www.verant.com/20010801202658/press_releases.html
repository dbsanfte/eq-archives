<p><i>- Online Gaming Set to Explode Worldwide With All-New Payment Options Available -</i></p>
<p><b>SAN DIEGO, CA - May 24, 2001</b> - In an effort to expand online gaming globally, Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) announced today that two alternative payment methods will be available for SOE's massively multiplayer games.  Game Cards will be sold in retail stores this fall throughout Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia as well as North America.  Additionally, JCB (Japanese Credit Bureau) credit cards are now accepted, making EverQuest&reg; and SOE's other massively multiplayer games more accessible to an international audience.</p>
<p>Currently, SOE requires an American credit card number to subscribe to the online game and ultimately this has limited EverQuest's growth abroad.  Game Cards will allow cash holders to experience the best-selling online game of all time in 90-day increments and will be available on retail shelves worldwide.</p>
<p>The JCB Card offers a great opportunity for SOE to reach gamers in Japan and many other Asian countries.  With over 40 million cardmembers worldwide, JCB's sophisticated global payment system network has made it the number one card in Japan and number four internationally among all of the major credit cards.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a universal increase in demand for access to our best-selling game, and now we have found a way to reach this broader market by changing our billing methodology,&quot; said Scott McDaniel, Vice President of Marketing, Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;We're looking forward to inviting a whole new group of players into the world of EverQuest.&quot;</p>
<p>The EverQuest online game currently boasts more than 385,000 active subscribers, and recently released a popular expansion pack to the game, EverQuest&reg;: The Scars of Velious&#153;, last Fall.  During peak periods, more than 90,000 adventurers and dragon slayers have explored the EverQuest world simultaneously.  The active global EverQuest subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries throughout the &quot;real&quot; world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, Germany and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Station (<a href="http://www.station.sony.com" target="_blank">www.station.com</a>) is the official provider of EverQuest, with software updates and news about the game, message boards and other community features, as well as an easy-to-use billing system for the EverQuest monthly subscription fee of $9.89.</p>

<p><i>- SOE Set to Expand Lines of Communication Internationally For Best-Selling Massively Multiplayer Online Games -</i></p>
<p><b>SAN DIEGO, May 21, 2001</b> - Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) announced today that they have begun localization for several games at The Station, (<a href="http://www.station.sony.com" target="_blank">www.station.com</a>) allowing them to support a global community.  The initial phase of localization involves both human and automated translating agents, beginning with French, German, Japanese and Korean.  The localization will allow players to fully interact textually within the game in their own language. SOE is committed to making its incredible array of online games just as accessible to gamers around the world as they currently are to English speaking players.</p>
<p>&quot;The vision of a global gaming community has always been the core of our business model,&quot; said Kelly Flock, President, Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;The localization allows us to surpass language barriers and give gamers worldwide the best online gaming experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Leading off the localized products is EverQuest&reg;: The Shadows of Luclin&#153;, the third expansion pack to EverQuest, the most successful online role-playing game of all time boasting more than 375,000 active subscribers comprise of players from all over the world. Other games planned for localization include: PlanetSide&#153;, the world's first massively multiplayer first-person action game set in a persistent world and Star Wars&reg; Galaxies&#153;, an online game set within the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>SOE has already begun the multi-language duplication process for several games. The identical version preserves the look and feel of the game while making it accessible to a foreign language audience.  SOE's plans include the use of real-time machine translation of in-game player chat.  This will allow players to chat even if they do not share a common language.  The combination of localization and advanced translation software will facilitate SOE's position as a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online games.</p>
<p>Sony's localization coincides with current increases in global interest in the Internet. According to the International Development Conference, more than 50% of current web users reside outside of the United States; this percentage is expected to increase to 60% by 2003. By 2003, nearly half of worldwide e-commerce will take place outside the United States.</p>

<p>&quot;EverQuest is a highly detailed game, with a massive and truly loyal following,&quot; said Scott McDaniel, Vice President of Marketing, Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;There is a wealth of information just waiting to be transposed into trivia and it only seemed natural to blend our strongest brands together.&quot;</p>

<p>Rob Hill, Producer, Sony Online Entertainment, &quot;We feel we've taken this genre of action gaming to a new level.

<p>Deep in space, the races of the Terrans, Skithzar, and Grazi existed along side each other relatively peacefully until a mysterious entity entered the galaxy. Known as the Null, these aliens were relentless in their attacks on the existing races. In the aftermath of war, resentment for losing various battles turned the battle groups against each other.  Now, the once peaceful coalition of races find themselves in a constant state of turmoil and unrest.</p>
