  to our already strong programming team is going to help us make the best games 
  out there."</P>
<P>"I'm very excited to have Brian on board," said Brad McQuaid, Verant Vice President

  opportunity to work on Verant's future titles is just too good to pass up," 
  said Brian Hook. "I strongly believe in Verant's commitment to making the best 
  Massively Multiplayer games out there, and I'm excited to be able to contribute 
  to a product line that will be the benchmark against which all other Massive 
  Multiplayer games are judged. People are going to be blown away when they see 
  what Verant is working on."</P>
<P>Hook will be involved with programming and technology in both current and future 
  Verant projects.</P>
