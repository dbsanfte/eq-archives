<p>Well, the server has been up an running for a few hours now - It was hung
hard and required a power off.<br>
Hopefully it will chug along until I get a chance to relocate it back home, or
setup a new one.<br>
<br>
It will probably be Wednesday until my primary ISP gets my new static IP's
assigned, so the server will not<br>
be moving before then.<br>

<p>Oh Joy..<br>
It looks like either the server hardware has crashed, or some little 4UcK 5cR1pT k1dDi3<br>
took advantage of my quick repair and crashed it because I overlooked something in my<br>
haste to repair it.<br>
Unfortunatly, it is no longer "on site" for me to reboot, so it will have to wait until<br>
I get in in the morning (PST time).<br>

Sorry 'bout all this.&nbsp;
<p>ps. On the good side, my primary ISP is sort of back up - but they were taken over by<br>
another company last year, and now I am forced to switch into the new billing and support<br>
system.  There will probably be some more grief over the next few days :(&nbsp;
<p>

If your an officer reading this, perhaps post a guildmotd about it.
I will update it when I get it running again.

<p>Ok, well my backup ISP has collapsed under their overwhelming incompetence,
so&nbsp;<br>
I have physically moved the server to another location and as long as the ISP
there isn't<br>
as useless as the ones at the previous location we should be up and running for
awhile.</p>
<p>Let's hope this brings us back to some stability.</p>

<p>Previous message:<br>
<br>
Due to Microsoft's crappy products, 
and the ability for people with no skills or IQ to setup a Webserver,<br>
My Primary ISP has collapsed, and my Secondary ISP (Non Comercial Service) has<br>
decided that they need to block port 80 traffic for everyone instead of 
terminating the service of infected machines.</p>
<p>SO, until my primary ISP is back up (Monday) the Oboo websites will be 
spotty.<br>
I am trying my best to resolve the situation as quickly as I can
but I am at work right<br>
now.

In the Interm, you should be able to connect to the Oboo Forums at<br>
