By the 15th lap, SaaM and Scrobius were neck and neck for first, Liza was in third, and Sir John was in fifth. By lap 28, SaaM had sneezed twice and fell back to 4th. Sir John and Liza wer fighting for 1st, and Scrobius was waiting his chance to sneak up. On lap 29, Sir John tried to force Liza to the outside on a turn, and Scrobius and SaaM sneaked by to steal their spots.

GRAND GLADITORIAL MELEE!!!<br />
<br />
A dazzling fight, with five Fanaticans, and many peoples from other nations. During the first couple events, SaaM was knocked unconcsious, and was taken to the nearest Hospitality Center. Liza was struck in the arm with Brutus' hammer, and Liza left with a broken left arm :(. Sir John was defeated in a 1 on 1 fight against Brutus. Brutus made it to the final event, where he fought an insane Egyptian fighter. The Egyptian charged Brutus with a furious look in his eye. Brutus was on the brink of exhaustion, and took one swing of his hammer. The Egyptian soared 7 meters away, dead as a rag doll. But Brutus, unfourtunately, died of Heat Stroke. A Grand Burial Ceremony is in place for our fallen hero, the Victor of the Nar Shaddaan Games. He will have a 21 bow salute, and his trophies buried with him. His Victor's Crown will be placed on his head before he is buried, and his hammer placed in his hands. From now on, this will be the way we should honor deceased Tournement Victors.<br />
