<br />
It crashed on average of once an hour.  I even did a format and reinstall 3 times in 2 weeks hoping it would help but nope.  <br />
<br />
Never seen such junk released as a final product in my life.  I'm sure if my brand new car broke down every hour I wouldn't be saying &quot;It's just a ford, chevy, whatever&quot;  That's what we say about microsoft though.  &quot;It's just microsoft.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, from time to time SMAC doesn't run. But then I play CTP, and when I switch back to SMAC usually I can play.<br />
<br />
Of course, I find Win2K much more stable, but SMAC for example can't be played with that OS. By the way, I have XP installation disks, but I've not installed it yet, because I'm not sure Civ series (and some other games too) are supported.:confused: <br />
<br />
I'll have to look into the CFC forums to find out...;)</div></div><hr />

DOS is an upgrade compared to 98 or ME.  I installed WIN98 for my son last night and it crashed 2 min after booting for the first time.  <br />
<br />
I upgraded too.<br />
<br />
To Mandrake Linux 8.2.  See how M$ likes that!</div></div><hr />

My son crashes it with some of his 3D graphic intensive games.  It is a RAM hog, but must of that is resident programs you can check off in the start up menu of msconfig.</div></div><hr />

It has been fairly nice to me lately.</div></div><hr />

This must be a trick question! I was under the impression that you don't run ME, it runs you. :) That's why I put it on the kids computer.</div></div><hr />

You go to a computer store and look for almighty Linux.  It deletes the virus and crashproofs your computer, it also runs faster is more flexible and fun.  So when the health of your computer is at stake get the ultimate solution, LINUX!  Thats L-I-N and U and X</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Sep 08, 2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LINUX? Crash proof? Gee we just had to reinstall LINUX on our firewall due to a power failure. [The power failure thing is another problem more related to security than actual power problem.] The file system was corrupted  and would not boot after regaining power. Not the first time I've seen this with Linux, but when Linux goes bad it goes very bad. Sure you just have to reinstall and restore settings but I thought that was a Windows type action. :)<br />
<br />
But seriously, yes, Linux does have a purpose but I'm not running out and converting programs for it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Four Four Seven</div><div class="date">Sep 08, 2002, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it irritate anyone else that Microsoft essentially advertised XP as &quot;Buy this version - it actually works and doesn't crash often!&quot;<br />
<br />
They are implicitly admitting that:<br />
1) Their old version sucked<br />
2) You need to pay $$$ again because they made a non-working product before.<br />
<br />
XP is a good product, yes.  But needing to pay for it when I got a machine with Me just months before XP came out - that is irritating.<br />
<br />
Of course, Windows is not alone in this.  Apple is equally guilty.  I bought an iMac for a second machine 3 months ago, partially on the promise of easy networking with Windows.  Uh, it wasn't easy until their OS version &quot;Jaguar&quot; came out.  And I needed to pay FULL PRICE on Jaguar to upgrade.  Grr...    That being said, the iMac is now a fantastic second home machine and truly does network flawlessly with my XP machine.</div></div><hr />
