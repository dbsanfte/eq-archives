<br />
Anyway, I'm far off in the game now, knowing all the other Civs. The first two huts I encountered gave barbarians. :mad: The third nothing.<br />
<br />
From that point every hut gave either barbarians or nothing. :( I have been very unlucky.<br />
<br />
Apart from that I'm doing very well. The Great Library was very helpful! But after that I went to republic and I can keep in technology quite well. ;) I'm only a bit small (really just a bit), but I blame that to the barbarians in the beginning.<br />
<br />
Our neighbours, the Japanese, have a much bigger island than we have. :(<br />
<br />
Oh, one last thing: I'm above the Germans and the Aztec in the histograph. :D The Germans are having trouble with the Americans and the Aztec had a very mean start if you look at the starting positions if the Aztecs and their neighbours. :p</div></div><hr />

I've got good island cover, but the other civs have got much better islands; At one point I hav over double the culture of any other civs, but cos of my small expansion area I'm back downthe ladder to a point where even the lousy japanese are gona overtake me; I wish I'd attacked them before they built the War academy, now Iv'e got to build a million Cavalry units, and even then, I've got no chance of taking their main island, I'm gonna have to just put up with the satisfaction of destroying the japanese infestation on my small islands.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the AI can see the Resources right from the begining, Two small islands with heavy jungle cover, the japanse planting just two cities on each island, and they covered all three Coal resources.<br />
How did they know where the coal would be?<br />
Now Iv'e got to either make an unfavourable bargain for the coal (lets hope 20 turns is enouh to modernize my main island) or I build up my cavalry force, ship loads of riflemen out to the smaller islands and crush those lousy japanese scumbags :D <br />
<br />
Any one have any luck with getting a golden age out of the war charriots? I tried to land them next to the weak Aztecs but every time i did, a huge army of horsemen came running out of their cities and eliminated them :(</div></div><hr />

Their war ended and all of a sudden the Americans attacked me!! Immediately after that I made a mutual protection pact with every other Civ on the map. :D :D They shall pay for this. :D :D<br />

I'm afraid I'm gonna loose my only source of coal though. :( Gladly I've made railroad on almost every tiles I possess. ;)</div></div><hr />

I had no problem in the beginning.  I read the game paramaters and after scouting my island, I made nothing but settelers and workers and spearmen for defense.  I covered my island.  For my tech I went straight for mapmaking so I could expand.  I grabbed the tiny island to the east of me, then the jungle island to the east of the tiny island.  Had a small war with Japan at the beginning of the game when they attacked me for no reason.  Then another war with the Japanese when they attacked me again.  Only good thing is I captured 5 cities on their island where I got a leader and built the FP.  I figured this would be a good stepping off point to wipe the Japanese off the map.  Only problem is I have no saltpeter :(  I have rifleman and knights but the Japanese have infantry and cavalry.  My only hope is to make a gazillion knights and riflemen and launch an attack and try to sue for peace afterwards.  I thought I was doing good but I'm in 5th place on the historygraph and I'm behind in tech.  I gotta find some way to catch up or I will lose this game.  Looking back, I don't think I would have changed anything because if I had went for rush with galleys and swordsman then the other civs would have landed on my island and I think I would be even further behind.  Well, we will see how it goes.</div></div><hr />

The Persians were early leaders, and with their scientific advantages they had to be curtailed. They threatened me and,since they couldn't actually attack me, I bravely told them to go boil their silly headgear.<br />
I got everyone to join in on them, which kept them in Monarchy most of the game.<br />
While we slung insults from across the oceans,<br />
the poor Aztecs were mercilessly crushed.<br />
Things looked bleak when I realised I had no coal,<br />
and no-one seemed to have any spare.<br />
Scouring the globe for the stuff,<br />
my peaceful strategy looked doomed,<br />
but then Eureka! a big lump of the stuff appeared next to Thebes!<br />
<br />
By the time of the UN the Japanese had surprisingly gone into the lead in every sphere. They had colonised far more than anyone else. Thankfully without picking on me.<br />
I feared that it might be a three-way vote with Persia.<br />
With the Americans being eradicated by the Germans a few years earlier, I had almost given up on the UN<br />
and had prepared for a space race.<br />
The island just south with coal, aluminium and uranium all in a little triangle was gonna be essential. But in the vote it was only me and Tokugawa. The Germans voted for me, because I'd been especially sweet to them just before we put the final brick into the UN building, and to my extreme surprise, so did Darius or Xerces or whatever his name is. I hadn't ever been that nice to him. Dunno why, except maybe he'd fought the Japanese a bit longer. A really enjoyable map, a different challenge for me,<br />
and, yes, when''s the next one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was this close &lt;--&gt; to giving up on this game in the early stages, the huts that gave me barbs, came in and killed my warriors, took all my cash, and raped my people! (or so I heard) and then after some more expanding more barbs killed a warrior fort. on a moutain, dammit! more money lost... but when I noticed I had an island to myself, i went mad settlers b/c I knew the AI was gonna be all over my island unless I settled first. <br />
<br />
Now that my galleys are everywhere I can see the Japs are kickin ass, they have cities all over the place, and they went to war with me, now Ive got to decide if Im gonna destroy them (or get destroyed) or try to make for a peacful game...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plejr Van</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2002, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Six civs on a large archipelago map? Looking at the starting position I'm thinking I gotta be stuck on a tiny island and all alone -  etter get that map making ASAP. It turns out It's the worst starting position of all civs, except for the Aztecs. If this was JAG (just another game) i would have restarted at 4000BC until I get what the Japanese got. On the plus side It looks like I have a gems&amp;furs monopoly. And I'm the only one who got iron within his borders. Later I claimed all dyes and one more iron.<br />
Egyptians are my favs, the only ones I manage to beat deity with, but in this game I can't play them the way I'm used to.<br />
In no game have I expanded so much. The Japanese didn't seem to appreciate cultural variety in their home(is)land and attacked me. Twice! And they had such good deals with me, fools. It looks like no war would be easy or benefical on this map, but they added themselves on my to-do list. The only good thing about the war was a GA that followed (I've managed to rush only one regular war chariot on an faraway island, but it did kill an enemy warrior). I gave one city away in peace negotiations, two were razed, one abandoned, I captured two and got one in the second negotians. <br />
Now I'm eight turn from astronomy and we are all level on techs except for Germany (lags behind) and sharing second place with America in histograph (1k1), Japan leads with 1k5. <br />
Tech progress is terrible - Persia is in war with the Aztecs, Germany with America and the strongest units others have are still horsemen. Eight turns my gems-furs-dyes-iron monoply will hopefully boost my economy.<br />
I'm a bit worried where the Salteper will pop up, there are not much good sites in my territory.<br />
Anyways... I'm planning to destroy the japs, get a leader and make a palace jump to the center of their land. Backup plan is to go expand further and go commie. <br />
Then build the UN, never vote and buid the spaceship. But who knows what the future brings? :cool:</div></div><hr />

I send my galleys in different directions for exploring the word and found new cities. I met Japan, Persia and Aztecs. Japan leads. No horse on my island!:(  It delays my expantion on the Japan's land. I will try to capture more free islands peacefully.</div></div><hr />

And now i am still in fear a city will be going back to the japanese because of culture :(<br />
<br />
Expanding really is the key to victory here. I am all over the islands i can reach: My main island, little island, the 2 jungle islands (both the big and small ones, totally filled up with cities :king: ), and the island north of the big jungle where i found another iron source. :)  I got 3 leaders while conquering the japanese. This was probably my best planned island invasion ever in the early ages. I started the first war by stealing their only horses source by planting a city on it. :p Then i triggered the GA, then i produced 5 war chariots per turn and totally swarmed their island with them. I needed like 10 galleys to transport every newly made chariot to Japan. And like 6 to colonize the new islands.<br />
<br />
I will rest it for a while now, after i have figured out that has caused the Japanese to still live.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squirrel</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2002, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first GOTM and my first game on monarch level. I'm having a really hard time!<br />
<br />
I did a couple of essential mistakes in the beginning, but I thought I was doing okay. That illusion was shattered when I first encountered the Japanese. They demanded huge sums for their world map and when I finally got it I realized I was leading a very small country...<br />
I was far behind in tech. I was in the ancient times when my rivals were far into the middle ages. I also had lost all wonder races. Some of them by only one turn. I only have two cities that are not on my main island. This does not seem to be my game.<br />
<br />
Now I had two choices. Quit and start over again, or rise to the challenge. I am no chicken, so I went for the last option. A good challenge is what makes Civ fun!<br />
<br />
I decided to put my research spending to zero, keep friends with everybody and trade for techs. I have also had to trade for resources, since iron is the only strategic resource on my lousy island. This has been a good strategy. While the others have been waging wars, I have stayed at peace and bought techs. Being at war, they needed the cash to finance their warfare, so the techs have been cheap.<br />
<br />
Now, we are deep into the industrial age and I am waiting for someone to research motorized transport and sell it to me. I am far to small to stand a chance in the long run, so I need to expand, and there is only one option: WAR.<br />
As soon as I get tanks I will hit the Germans. And I will hit them hard. The Germans are a little bit behind in tech and I figure I will manage to build up a nice invasion force of tanks to decimate them before they get their panzer.<br />
While waiting for motorized transportation, I am building a strong navy to support my campaign.<br />
This is gonna be fun. I can't wait!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abla</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2002, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First GOTM I have tried seriously - last one barbarians thumped me so bad I gave up!<br />
Goodie huts on my island gave me diddly but once I figured I was alone I've went for a 'close city build' strategy.<br />
I always used to go for a perfect spaced -let every city build to max - approach but for my last few games I've gone for a slighlty closer spaced build (not packed) with some city overlap and it seems to work ok. Maybe because it takes me so long to get to hospitals anyway the game is usually decided by then!<br />
Anyway - got 15 cities on my home island. I could see the Japs to the east and a little empty island between. The turn before my settler lands, the Germans from the west built a city! (always the ******* way!, every time!, are they doing this deliberately?)<br />
Anyways, I wasn't having this so I put my cash to max, signed up for tech trade for gold per turn then declared war. Weeha, 5 free techs and a dead German city! Close run thing though I only ended up with a beat up spearman left. I stuck as much defensive stuff on my new city as poss and put a couple of swordsman and galleys to ward off the Germans from the west but after a dozen or so turn they went peacefull happily enough.<br />
I landed on the bigger island to the north of the wee one to find a goodie hut that gave me a settler which I plopped down a city with straight away. I though this was part of the main Jap island but turns out to be seperate so the Japs have 4 cities and I have 2 but I have a good swordsman force.<br />
My spare galley kept going and found an hourglass shaped island to the north west which I have circumnavigated. When I saw a goodie hut I dropped off the warrior and hey presto a settler.<br />
I have founded a city in the narrow part of the hourglass and have rushed a spearman to protect it from barbarians.<br />
It's about 500ish AD and I'm quite chuffed so far.<br />
The only anoying thing is the Aztecs have demanded my territory map and 10 gold or else - I gave them this as I am sick of never ending wars against opponents you can't reach. I had never seen the Aztecs, never met an Aztec - nowhere near the ******s yet they still demand stuff and get pissed about it if you refuse. The AI seems over aggressive in this respect.<br />
And as a footnote nothing to do with the above - would map creators please stop designing huge maps, I am sure they are all very pretty but they are also unplayable due to turn delay - what's wrong with standard size....please, more standard size maps, thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShredZ</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First GOTM I have tried seriously - last one barbarians thumped me so bad I gave up!<br />
Same here, I considered giving up in this one too but thought otherwise. :)<br />
<br />
since iron is the only strategic resource on my lousy island.<br />
AT LEAST YOU GOT THAT! I didnt get any, repeat, ANY strategic resourses, no horses, no swordsmen, no musketmen, no coal, no rubber, no nothing! I was hooped right from the start, this Monarch game turned into an Emperor one almost right away. <br />
The only one good thing that happened just before I gave up was the Aztec got destroyed and the Japs luv to raze cities, so I built 2 more cities capturing iron AND coal. omg omg omg I can make railroad, how nice :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
PS: only the americans had extra coal and iron, but they were at war with me so no options there.<br />
<br />
The AI is about 4 techs ahead, should be able to (i hope) catch up before the end of the game...<br />
<br />
Wuts with the AI charging 650gp for their world map? hell no!<br />
<br />
Quit and start over again, or rise to the challenge. <br />
Are you allowed to restart in a GOTM? I dont think so.<br />
<br />
I wiped out the Japanese in 550 AD, <br />
I was planning an early game conquest too, but after I found I would only be attacking with archers until the industrial age I decided against it !#^$@#$^  :\</div></div><hr />

<br />
just after i got my first galley i immediately built cities on the northeastern part of the Jap island. Built three of them before something lucky happened - i got a Golden Age by building the Hanging Gardens. I then started on a swordsman-training spree and half a century later (600 AD now) my armies are now just outside Kyoto. Damn spearmen are like ants in his cities - too numerous. But I now have half of the Japanese cities on their main island. Maybe I shouldn't conquer Kyoto and the Japs. I could make them my milking cow to keep me abreast with technology on the international scene.:D<br />
<br />
Damn lucky!:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mathias</div><div class="date">Jul 04, 2002, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first GOTM that I will complete, and my first Emperor game. I started this game with a completely different strategy than I have used for all of my previous games, and I like it so well that I will probably use it more often, to an extent.<br />
<br />
Knowing this was a large map with only 6 civs, I set out to grab as much land as possible. I studied bronze working for spearmen then wheel for war chariot. No horses!! So I study iron working for swordsmen, delaying my bee-line to map making. By the time I got it, around 500 BC, I had 15 cities on mainland and several settlers ready to jump ship.<br />
<br />
It is now 750 AD. I have colonized the two islands to the northeast without letting Japan get a city in. I also have about a dozen cities on the larger island further north, filling the western half, and securing dyes and iron in the east.<br />
<br />
All of my land grabbing has rewarded me with second place in score to date. Japan leads by about 240, but I'll fix that. They have no iron, so masses of swordsmen will break them. I have already taken two cities on their west coast, then sued for peace and a city of mine that had flipped.<br />
<br />
While building the Great Library, I studied through to Monarchy. Hanging Gardens was pre-built and completed 2 turns later. No GA. The Library was completed soon after, which put me into the middle ages with Monotheism. I have just been granted Theology, and the Sistine Chapel will be built in Thebes. Sun Tzu's isn't so certain, as Persia got a head start building it in a size 8 city with mined hills and irrigated grassland. Only time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShredZ</div><div class="date">Jul 04, 2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Ive only got 15 mins to write up a little something to see wut some of you Civ3 Gurus think of this game. On 1 hand Im really proud of wut I accomplished with how little I had, only the other, Im really dissappionted with how it all came together.<br />
<br />
First off, I think there needs to be a new Diplo. option so I could politely tell these Japs to get off my (no longer theirs) island. I took it over in the VERY early game, and they sat there for the ENTIRE game, the reason they never left is b/c I had a MPP with the for the ENTIRE game, it was cheap and I would never risk an empire of their size not being on my side, they wouldve squished me like a bug (they were always looking for a fight).<br />
http://shredz2001.homestead.com/files/SS/civ2.jpg<br />
<br />
How I pulled this off is beyond me, you cant imagine how militarily enept I was during this game, the only strategic resource I ever got was Uranium, ALL the others never popped up on my land, I took more than half the game to finally get my own coal and iron (northern island), then, 5 turns before the end of the game, I placed a city (southern island) that captured (another) uranium, oil, rubber &amp; aluminum... INSANE, b/c that aluminum was wut made me able to build the last couple SS components, whew! I traded with the Americans for aluminum once for 1200g and 50g/t. I didnt have that kinda money laying around b/c I was making -250/t while trying to win the tech race.<br />
<br />
I never built a single Wonder, never built a single Tank, never any Fighters, Cavalry - wuts that? I never got my GA thru the whole game, but some how I was the first one to get Nuclear Power (using it for more MPP with Japan), and raced for Laser so I could finish it... what a chore!<br />

<br />
Who ever said the underdog cant win eh?<br />
http://shredz2001.homestead.com/files/SS/civ4.jpg<br />
<br />
PS: This was my first time playing Emporer difficulty, and with wut I had Id say it was more like Deity.<br />
<br />
I realize Ill never win the GOTM b/c my score is gonna suck, but to make a comeback like this after wanting to quit twice really goes to show you anything is possible! :D<br />

Thx fer listening. :king:</div></div><hr />

Started pretty bad. First researched The Wheel hoping to get an early horsemen rush. But no horse :sad:. Fortunately got Bronze Working popped from hut, so I went for Iron Working. Thanks Matrix there's an iron icon.:D  That's good. After I had enough settlers to fill the island, I started to build warriors. Got 15 when I have Map Making and see Japan as my neighbor. I upgraded these warriors to swordmen and charge!<br />

What a charge, I am so inept in war. Although I got Tokyo and Edo quite quickly, I made the wrong decision of strike straight Kyoto, being thirst for wines. Outcome: Seven swordmen died in front of two spearmen in Kyoto, a size 7 city. :suicide: <br />
<br />
My forces went weak and Japan kept poping horsemen and archers, later longbows, so I just took another city and asked for peace. That city later flipped back to them.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile I got the Great Lighthouse and sailed my galleys to the open sea. Found Germans through a bit luck, then traded for American's contact with contact with Japanese( even if you're in war with them you can still sell them;)  ). Got a few techs from the deal also.<br />
<br />
Since I knew where Germans and Americans are, the other civs have no place to hide. Another galley found them. With a big trade deal I got World Map, latest techs and bunch of coins by selling Japan again, that's funny, I was still fighting hard with them.<br />
<br />
Peaceful building period..........<br />
<br />
But it didn't went long. I have already discovered a horse icon on the northern island. So I trained War Chariot in my cities and researched Chivalry. Upgraded 20 Chariots to Knights quickly, and started the second war on Japan.<br />
<br />
This time I have a good foothold on the center of the Japanese island, so I took Kyoto quickly. But the size of Japan was causing some problems so I didn't clear them off until about 1100 AD. Now they have only Echizen and a bunch of faraway size 1 cities. I pulled all these cities on the peace treaty, and they agreed. By the end of war I built two War Chariots to set up a GA. <br />
<br />
Another peaceful building period..........<br />
<br />
Other civs have been quite reserved till now, there was only a war between Germany and America, but no one won it, it did help to slow down their development though.<br />
<br />
By 1550 I got tanks and is researching Computer. I planned to get the Germans first, cus they are the nearest and got good wonders( read Sistine, Pyramids and Copernicus), but the Aztecs threw a spear on my back. Ok, feel the wrath!<br />
<br />
It took me a long time to sail my transports to Aztec, and only after I secured two cities from them, Persia amassed their 100 infantries beside me. Although I've got an airport in former Aztec territory, 100 infantries is still a big number. Transferred 10 modern armors to Aztec I hoped to induce Persia to attack my city. They did, and they succeeded. Casualty? About 60 troops, including many infantries and some ancient longbows and riflemen.<br />
<br />
I mobilized and started to pomp Modern Armors. Of course Persia can't contain these, especially when their major force was still sieging Aztec cities. When they got defeated, they still have 35 infantries( intelligence report:scan: ), but didn't get any chance to use them against me.:lol:<br />
<br />
My next target is America, they haven't got rubber so should be an easy foe. I took several cities already. Germany would be the last opponent, but their scientists haven't discovered Mass Production yet, so can they endure 80 Modern Armors' attack? Don't believe so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simplybag</div><div class="date">Jul 06, 2002, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I said in my previous post a while ago, I planned an invastion into Japan but then I realised that they already were in industrial times and my swordsmen could have a hard time to compete against riflemen :) I dropped the idea again and completely concentrated on diplomacy and trading. The iron did help me soooooooooo much. The americans paid me 128 gold per turn when I was only making 20+ gold per turn! I have some &quot;colonies&quot; on the small islands, luckily those 3 towns have one saltpeter and one oil in its radius. On the bad side, I also controlled a coal ressource (without knowing it in the middle ages yet) but that city flipped over to Japan :( That happened quite often with my colonies, I lost 4-5 of my smaller cities, even though some had temple/cathedral. <br />
Well, I was desperately behind technologically, I thought this game can only be lost. But, no! Almost the whole world went at war! Japan declared war on Persia (the two biggest), the Germans declared war on the Americans (the next 2 biggest). Germany and Persia signed a MPP as did Japan and America. The aztechs were somehow destroyed, I can't remember by whom, but they were unimportant anyway :) So, those 4 superpowers were all fighting each other and were really in need for money to upkeep their military. With my banks in all towns later on I bought EVERY tech (after entering middle ages I had tech rate at 0% all the time) and basically only concetrated on clever diplomacy and good trading. And heya, it worked. With my small island and a few colonies I bought fission off Persia and built the UN. I then was elected by 3, 2 votes for Xerxes. I'm only second in the ranking after Japan, but who cares, it's my first victory at emperor and I'm very proud as well as happy about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 06, 2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game is going very slowly becasue the early tech pace was a snail's pace due to the archipeligo isolation.<br />
<br />
The new key tip to remember is related to getting settlers from goody huts: When you pop a hut, make sure you have no cities set to build a settler and have no active settlers. When you have either of these two conditions met, then this will suppress the chance of getting a settler from a hut.<br />
<br />
Early hut yield was pretty crappy except for one lucky settler on the main island plus a cash and settler bonanza on the out islands. I got no techs from any huts after the first even though I needed everything and had research set to zero through most of the BCs. (added note about tech's from huts on 7/12)<br />
<br />
Strategy was settler/worker rush all the way but had to build some warriors in between to provide growth space. This start position is relatively terrible because its landmass shape is too narrow and restricts the density of the core area to only about 50% of what it could be.<br />
<br />
Lackof rivers again suppresses the opportunity for early $$ bonuses that could help the pace of the game. Forces me to micromanage every worker and citizen laborer to squeeze that 1 extra pound of flesh out of every turn, (so very tedious)<br />
<br />
Set research to breakeven and made a beeline for Mapmaking and then added on Literature. Wanted to get the Great Light if possible and definitely the Great Library. Since the AIs generally do not research Literature early the high risk target was the Light.<br />
Used the Pyramids to prebuild and switch because the Pyramids would be worthless on this starting continent. Turned research to zero after the lighthouse was built, but took many turns before the Library benefit fully kicked in because I had to finish discovering the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
Found Japan easy and then slid northeast through and along the inland sea. I hate jungles: thank heavens for the industrious worker. Since I was spewing out settlers, warriors, galleys I was able to drop in a few cities on the north tip of Japan's beautiful continent and also rim the coasts of the islands on the inland sea.<br />
<br />
Harbors ought to be discounted on archipeligo maps in order to equalize game play a bit. Either that, or there ought to be a cheaper improvement called a &quot;fishing village&quot; that gains the coastal food benefit at a lower cost with harbors still coming later.<br />
<br />
Japan ran out of space and attacked my 4 city beach head with an archer. The Great Library had brought me up to tech par with Japan so I could upgrade to swordsmen and now could build chariots and horsemen. I built a few horsemen because the chariots restricted mobility can handicap an advance if they are all you have. Horsemen and Chariots ar power equal, but the pay me now or pay me later upgrade costs apply when looking ahead to upgrading to knight or Cav. The first chariot victory set off the GA right around the 10AD.<br />
<br />
Tedious, Tedious, Tedious -- war versus Japanese spearmen and horsemen with my advancing chariots and swords across river laced country. Sent two galley loads of  attackers plus 1 spearman along the northeast edge of Japan to get near Kyoto quickly and found a severed a horse near Satsuma. I think it took until about 400 AD to smack the Tokugawa off the Land. I used the exploit bug in V1.21 extensively where the Culture of captured cities stays pumped out after they are captured, to speed the advance as much as possible. When you rush the temple, the culture will shrink back so you have to make sure the attacking force and accompanying defenders are thrown as far forward as possible before the temple gets rush built. This exploit buys you at least one or two turns per wave of city attacks.<br />
<br />
Great Leaders and Promotions were very stingy and far between. I got Ramses in the attack approach to Kyoto but didn't get Cheops until killing the last two jap cities on the little east island that I didn't even know was there until the Jap capital jumped.<br />
<br />
Tokugawa survived as boat people with what appeared to be a loan galley moving up the northeast coast. Not sure where he thought he was going but the the worst part of the game was losing 6 galleys (almost 7) to try and destroy this last galley. There ought to be something in the game that recognizes that a fleet of 3 galleys with the ability to move in seas cannot possibly be defeated by a lone regular galley restricted to coasts. I know this would be tough to code but I can definitely see where some people would be frustrated. Perhaps Galleys with Sea movement should be able to retreat to the sea. In the second wave of attacks, using 2 galleys from a port city, both galleys were defeated while attacking out of the city at the Jap Galley right near by. Again this is really unrealistic because the galleys would definitely retreat back into port before just dying. Yes, I know its the RNG at work here, but both these cases indicate examples where the Jap galley should not have survived.<br />
<br />
Just reviewing the details of the map to prepare the next wave of strategy and realized that Japan had no Iron. Persia and Aztecs have no Iron or Horses. Just researched Chivalry since no AI's went that way. The Great Library just obsoleted itself with education from Persia and America (I think). The next phase will be very bloody, but the question is Who first. There are still unsettled Isles far to the north but &quot;man-o-man&quot; all this ferrying of units in galleys is TEDIOUS, luckily caravels are near.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've finally got enogh of the map visible to read the spoilers.  It seems that the map-type is really slowing everyone down, and my game was no exception.<br />
<br />
Started settler / warrior and later settler / spearmen combos from most of my cities as it became quickly apparent that I was all alone on the island.  I made a bee-line for mapmaking, carefully choosing to research pottery first, so that granaries would speed my expanion / growth.<br />
<br />
About the time that I got mapmaking, I started the Great Lighthouse and saw the japanese cultural boundary to the east.  Hurried a galley and managed a beachhead on his land (two cities) fo a later invasion.  One city flipped to him, then flipped back to me.  The second flipped to him.  I was amazed that the other one flipped back - Japan has 3 times the culture I do!<br />
<br />
I maximised production to get the great lighthouse as quickly as possible.  The turn after I built it, the Americans built the great wall, so I barely pipped them!  At this point, I didn't know whether to build for an invasion of Japan, or continue expansion.  I saw that Japan were well ahead of me on the histograph (and in tech), and couldn't see enough of their land to know what resources they had.  Given that there were a few nearby islands, I decided on expansion.<br />
<br />
I settled the little one off my cost to the north east, and a few cities on the jungle one to the north-west of that.  The japanese also dteed two cities on that island; both very &quot;random&quot; looking locations in the middle of jungle, so I assume its the old AI resource-knowledge trick.  I settled the island to the north of that, securing the dyes (although the harbour is taking an age!).  The Japanese have a few cities on that island too.<br />
<br />
I sent galleys exploring, and made contact with all the other civs.  I noticed that I was behind in techs by quite a way (haven't traded any, as the price is too high).  The most bizarre thing is that by 500 AD, no-one had built the great library.  I research literature, and found (remakably) that none of the AI had research literature!  This must be greatly hindering their research / tech progression!  So I built the GL, and the techs flooded in.  Cancelled very quickly by education, but I caught-up.<br />
<br />
I have stead-fastly refused to trade either my world map (given the unsettled islands I've found), nor contact with the Japanese.  I was hoping to get a substantial prize for trading contacts, but got all the techs from the GL, and have the widest world map anyway.  Still, when Navigation is researched, I better trade it....<br />
<br />
The only other trades I've done are furs / gems with the japanese - primarily to prevent them invading me!  They are polite.  At war with the americans, because I won't give them contact with the japanese.<br />
<br />
My plan now is to withhold literature, and keep everyone dumbed-down in the tech race.  I figure that with a few &quot;negotiated&quot; wars, and me being the only one with libraries / universities, I can beat everyone to military tradition and start my conquering of the world.  Still - things are really lagging - around 900 AD, and the most modern tech is about invention!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Researched as far as map-reading then switched off research. Since then I've just paid up the going rate for any advances.<br />
<br />
When my triremes made it to the southern island, the might of Japan was apparent. MUCH stronger than me. I continued to churn out settlers and filled the next island East apart from the northern tip which Japan grabbed. More land grabbing onthe next island across ended about 50/50 between japan and I. <br />
<br />
As per usual, Japan settled a hopeless piece of desert which much to my surprise turned out to have both saltpeter AND oil later .....<br />
<br />
Traded my iron and anything else for advances and money..<br />
<br />
My attempt at culture crowding Japan resulted in MY cities flipping. Grr.<br />
<br />
I'm rolling along in 4th place on Demographics now, slightly over 2k in score. <br />
<br />
I guess I'm trying to ferment a world war, hoping all the other civs will go into Communism and self destruct. I'm staying in Democracy and trying to have load of settlers ready to fill in the gaps when all the other cities get razed.....<br />
<br />
I'm on good terms with everyone - even Japan is only annoyed with me now after a ROP. IF I can get UN I should be able to pull off a diplo victory. Problem is that my production is not great and I dont know how many GLs are lying around. I'll prebuild and hope.<br />
<br />
Failing that a spaceship might sneak through IF the others stop researching and start fighting.<br />
<br />
Most likely scenario is that I'm gonna lose this one to a spaceship OR get my *** kicked by Japan if they decide to go after me....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JackRules</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoyed my 1st GOTM, although I was soundly thrashed by the Japanese.  I usually play at Warlord, so this was a huge step up for me.  I managed to survive until Japan won (space ship I think) in 1953.  <br />
<br />
Having an isolated island to start helped me I think, as I was able to build up my little empire without early war.  I managed to keep Japan happy the whole game, which enabled me to survive.  Persia attacked me a couple times, but never with anything much, and they allowed me a GA by sending a lone longbowman to my island against my charriots.<br />
<br />
Of course, I was way behind in tech the whole game and never got close to catching up.  I did manage to get things going a little after getting democracy and Wall Street (my only wonder great or small). but didn't even get through the industrial age. Japan and Persia were huge and dominate, with Germany holding down 3rd spot.  Aztecs out early and America on the verge of destrucion by game's end.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was pretty happy just to survive Emperor, and I'm looking forward to trying again next month.</div></div><hr />

No one else is able to traverse the oceans. I have found several major islands - some of them quite close to other civs, but they have not been able to get beyond their coastlines.<br />
I have completely refused to trade maps so that no one will know where the other islands are. We are on the verge of gaining astronomy so my corner on inter-continental travel will be gone soon.<br />
Then I will see how well I am doing!<br />
I am also the proud owner of Lennie's Workshop. I have also noticed that since War-Chariots are my special unit. I can still build them. Once they are built, I can upgrade them to Knights for 30 gold - and later Calvary...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A big character of this game is that pope strategy is much less useful. You have to double or triple the money you used to pay for a tech. Fortunately I used Great Lighthouse to get all the catch-up.<br />
<br />
But tech rate is extremely low (again) in my game. By the time I got Modern Armors( about 1610 ), no AI has even researched The Corporation!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bill_in_PDX</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best GOTM I've been in so far.<br />
<br />
Tough position from a resource standpoint.  I beelined for map making and was fortunate enough to settle the third eastern island, so coal and rubber were available later.<br />
<br />
But, both of my iron's dried up, so I attempted to stay out of war the entire game.  However, the Germans didn't like that, and they launched a few feeble invasions during the Galleon age.  I was well behind the Persians who had vasselized the Aztec early, and then amazingly (in my experience) stayed out of all wars until late.<br />
<br />
The Japanese kept fighting the Americans or Germans, which allowed me to catch up in democracy.  They didn't come after me ever, apparently because I gifted them furs through most of the game.<br />
<br />
In the Modern Age I hoped to beat everyone to the UN and win, but I lost that race to Persia, who I saw building space ship parts quickly.<br />
<br />
I went after my only possible path to victory and started timing my parts builds and keeping cities either in wealth or research labs.  Moved my Palace (traditional build) to the eastern tip of the home island to boost production on the two others.<br />
<br />
Launched and won about two turns ahead of the Persians, who decided to nuke it out with Japan late.  <br />
<br />
It was nip and tuck, and the anticipation at the end was amazing.  First game in a long time I felt that close to winning or losing late.  And, like many, I almost gave up on the map when I didn't have oil or uranium.</div></div><hr />

The situation didn't look great. Japan and Persia out in front. Me, Germany and US about 1000 points back. Not much production capacity and no resources.<br />
<br />
Sent a couple of settlers to iron and saltpetre island. Rushed workers and harbour. At last some resources!<br />
<br />
I traded everything I had as often as I could and kept Persia, Germany and US  polite and Japan only annoyed.<br />
<br />
Signed ROP with everyone (which I think is the best way of preventing war - they dont rape you!) <br />
<br />
When war finally broke out, everyone else got dragged in. Two dropped to Monarchy, two dropped to Communism. Goodie - the Ai usually whips itself to death. Actually it didnt here but its research slowed dramatically. <br />
<br />
I stayed in Democracy.<br />
<br />
 I switched research back on and managed to get a couple of advances first which I promptly used to bankrupt everyone else and catch up my missing techs<br />
<br />
The US was at war from now until the end of the game with someone - usually Japan. Persia had signed a MPP with Japan so was in and out for the next hundred years.<br />
<br />
For the first time, I thought I could get into a winning position. My infrastructure wasnt strong enough to win a SS race - no factories or coal plants at this stage so it had to be a beeline for Fission. <br />
<br />
Got to Fission first but still had 10 turns to go on my prebuild for UN. Japan started to look threatening once I had Fission so I made a crucial decision to trade it to everyone for lots more cash and luxuries. Didnt do my reputation any harm either. Played honourably the whole game!<br />
<br />
Anxious countdown to see if anyone had a GL handy to beat me to Un. There was no other way I'd feature in vote. Managed to build it while everyone else was ferrying vast numbers around. A few bribes had evryone polite again.<br />
<br />
Hold election, hold breath. Win 3-2. Persia voted for Japan. The two tiddlers for me!<br />

Looks like he had same luck building wonders as I did. I missed the Lighthouse though and I can now see how much it cost me. It was a long time before I was allowed contact with everyone. Cant tell you how many suicide galleys sunk....<br />
<br />
I did get Adam Smith's though and went for all out money production. Kept me in the game being able to pay my way.<br />
<br />
Built my FP in about the same place too.<br />
<br />
In my game, US and Germany fought to a standstill. The Aztecs were wiped before I met them. Persia and Japan had a free run.<br />
<br />
I did manage to build a couple of cities on Japan's island but they were easily taken - didnt have horsies so no chariots at this stage to at least give me a GA in compensation - and I lost three cities to japan in culture flips on other islands. All had luxuries (sob)<br />

Why do other people try to attack Japan? In my game, they are so strong that I have to watch out and keep them from attacking me!

Well I liked your reasoning on the first move. I moved my worker on the hill to scout and decide to move the first settler to the west so it had access to the coast and immediate access cattle. :)<br />
<br />
We did things different from there, I wanted rapid expansion and to be able to eliminate Japan.<br />
<br />
I have ROP with all civ's and since I did not raze any of the Japanese cities they are all still on polite terms. I get about about two world maps and 10 gold each turn for my territorry map. I rank 1st on 9 out of 13 catagories in the demographics screen.<br />

<br />
Your approach sounds almost identical to mine. I have been milking the game for all its worth from about 2000 BC on. I beelined for the Great Light and Lib combo and then switched to zero science. With the industrious workers and lots of slaves I could strip the jungle and setup for 100% forestry as soon as engineering came on line.<br />
<br />
I had a four or five city beach head on Japan's northern tip when they attacked me so I then counterattacked straight toward Kyoto which was the only city I could see at the time other than border cities because the shogun wanted something unholy for a map.<br />
<br />
Unlike you, I raised many Japanese cities because I was behind in culture and needed to conserve limited numbers of WarChariots to continue the attack.<br />
<br />
Killing Japan early and building the FP in their zone may be key to converting our losing start position into a winner.<br />
<br />
I would emphasize again than I have raised tedium to a new art in this game since I am micro managing worker tasks and civilian worker assignments in every turn. In 1300AD, it is taking me an average about 1 hour per turn just to manage all the workers since the governors and autmation functions do not work to maximum effect.<br />
<br />
Here's my mini-map from 750AD to compare to your position:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/750AD_mini_map.jpg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cycle</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow !<br />
<br />
This is my first game at emperor and my first gotm. So far, I'm doing ok. I'm second to last in overall score but my civilization is doing well. Current date is around 1400 AD. I'm in the first third of the middle age in techs.<br />
<br />
Here it goes :<br />
<br />
In the beginning, I concentrated on warriors to scout the area and settlers to control territory as fast as I could. When I realized I was alone on my island, I built settlers like crazy. Later on, I finally got map making and started exploring. I met Japan. From the beginning, they were very agressive and we had a war early on. Thanks to my swordsmans, their invasion didn't go too well and they didn't do any damage. I was able to colonize the tiny island north-east of our starting position, and then the slightly bigger one north of it. At some point, I shared it with the Japanese. Another war erupted and I quickly conquered the island, thanks to my steady flow of reinforcements. During this conflict, I met the Aztec who joined the effort with the Japanese. Argh ! Bribery from the Japanese part for sure. Couple of turns later, I bribed the Aztec for peace and they accepted. North of this island, there is a much bigger island. The Aztec had a few city there, on the east side of it. I started to send settler to colonize the west side of it, as well as the central &quot;choke point&quot;. Such be usefull strategically later on. Interestingly enough, there is now 4 civs on this island.<br />
<br />
When I finally traded for contact with other civs, I quickly realized that I was very late in tech and wouldn't be able to catch on for a while. At best, I would get one tech every 7 or 8 turns, if it was widely known by other civs. I decided to try something new : set research to 0%. I now generate 150 gold per turn. Nice. So far, I buy 1 tech from the Aztec (the smallest of my rivals) every 3 or 4 turns. I am slowly catching up in tech. We will see how it goes.<br />
<br />
My current priority is to finish grabing some land in the northern island. I just got gunpowder and there is saltpepper there, which I don't have on my main island. I need to grab it fast. The Japanese will be a major problem in this game with their huge island east of ours. Invading them won't be easy and cannot be achieved before infantry and artillery, I think. I will play defensively until then, which shouldn't be any different than how I've been playing so far ;)<br />
<br />
I love this game so far. First time on a large map, I usually play on standard size. First time also on this kind of land/water settings. Should create some nice naval battle in the modern age.<br />
<br />
This is also the first time that strategic ressource do make a difference in how I play. I only have iron on my main island. I have 1 horse on the second northern island, and now I'm going for saltpepper on the bigger northern island. Luxury are also pretty rare, and usually I have to give them or 'suffer the consequence' :(<br />
<br />
I hope I can finish this game before the deadline at the end of the month. Each turn take some time, and only 20 days left.<br />
<br />
I will be surprised if I survive this game, considering how late it is (1400 AD) and how small my civ is, in number of cities and territory, compared to the other ones.<br />
<br />
Until next time, happy civ-ing !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not expecting to be managing workers that late in the game. ;) At 770AD, I'm clearing jungle on the larger Island over by the Persians and 'all' my other currently owned territory is completely groomed (no railroads yet.) The ICS type build that I have going on, on the outer fringes has slowed my control of lands but I'm just getting set to beach head on the Persian Island and a spot over between the Germans and Americans. I've got 60 workers (not including captured workers) and 12 settlers on route to new pastures. I am pretty deep into building up my infrastructure and have completed some universities and have a lot of marketplaces starting to come on line. Once I embroil the rest of the world into war I will turn on the research and leave them in the dust. :)<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see if I can catch up to your lead from this point. There should be some high scores posted for this map, it will make the current HOF entries (about 12000 points right now,emperor) pale by comparison. <br />

Beard Rinker, well there are many many turns left and when milking you can take better building sites later in the game and eliminate poor sites that served their purpose earlier in the game. By grabbing coastal sites early I can get points for that terrain.<br />

<br />
I think that is an important point! When you know you control your island and you have no threat you can push your expansion toward the areas that are more likely to be in contention. Once I got map making I wanted to explore to see what was in the immediate vicinity and grab lands in those other areas. You can back fill areas later when the pressure to expand starts to dwindle as expansion opportunities start to dry up.<br />

<br />
Here's my power graph from 810AD for comparison to yours.<br />
<br />
We were operating on very similar major strategies with differences in implementation. You seemed to be more ICS with settler flood while I was going expansionist with settler flood.<br />
<br />
Note the difference in timing of the conflict with Japan. Mine was earlier because of the 4 city beachhead on the north tip of Japan. This led to conflict with Japan attacking me much earlier than in your game.<br />
<br />
Note also the slope of the power demise for Japan. Your approach gave you more power to terminate them quickly while my approach seemed to drag on for ever and ever.<br />
<br />
Japan was really a tactically wierd situation because they seemed to deliberately be building too few culture improvements and way too few horsemen. In retrospect, I was their only contact and I refused to trade techs with them because my strategy to get the Library.<br />
<br />
This is the first game I have played where I can see the great library/great lighthouse combo as being an absolute killer combo on archipeligo maps. Since I get all their techs for free, there is no need to give in to the ridiculous, one-sided trade demands of the AIs and there is no need to make peace with them in order to harvest their advanced technologies.<br />

Am I correct in assuming that both your wars against the Japanese involved Horses/Swordsman against Archer/Spearman?<br />
<br />
This would have been based on the learning that they did not have iron/horses early on.<br />
<br />
I missed that to start with hence I am racing to get a Knight army together before rifleman appear.<br />

I don't think I attacked as early as cracker. I started the war with chariots/swordsmen but used knights the last half of the war. Japan seems to always pour on the culture and I wanted to get by them before the samurai.</div></div><hr />

I should probably be on the record as feeling that you should not be here reading the spoiler's thread because you are way too early in the Game. Just my opinion based on your questioning type posts about still not having built knights and still dealing with Japan.<br />
<br />
Not a flame, just a thought out loud.<br />
<br />
On the Japan question, my thoughts were driven by knowing Japan gets he evil samuri instead of knights. Also with our realtively limited value start position, that meant I felt that I needed to restrict the development of my nearest neighbor or I was going to die.<br />
<br />
Egypts War Chariots are open terrain horsemen at only 2/3 the cost of horsemen. Compared to Japan if building horsemen at 24 shields per horse I would have an advantage with my 20 shield War Chariot. I don't think I ever built even one archer or real longbowman in the whole game<br />
<br />
When I met Japan, I had only the tech prereqs for MapMaking and Temples so I did not have a clue what their military looked like. I didn't even get them to trade me their map because the Shogun refused to trade me his territory map for anything less than two or three techs. So all I knew was the coastal towns and the location of Kyoto due to my embassy. I could look at the garrison of Kyoto and the production queue and see that Kyoto was building the Pyramids with about a 1000 years to go when I first met them (Jerkses beat them to it).<br />
<br />
You can also use the &quot;investigate city&quot; menu list from your embassy to get some good data even without investigating a city. I have an excel macro spreadsheet the helps to use the population number for the city plus the investigate city dollar cost to figure a rough guess at what the city contains even without spending a dime.<br />
<br />
In my case, I had squeezed 4 cities onto the northern peninsula of Japan and had reached down to grab irrigation from a river when Tokugawa decided to attack me with archers.<br />
<br />
I had landed my first units on the north tip of the Japan continent somewhere around 450 BC because the forest were a welcome sight compared the Jungles and riverless plains of the other first two options.<br />
<br />
One thing I forget to consider (and it really slowed me down was the river crossing movement penalty that exists until engineering gets discovered much later. Even with my worker hordes throwing down roads it seemed to take forever to get across Japan.<br />
<br />
The only brilliant piece of luck (maybe it didn't really matter much) was the choice to send two galleys containing chariots along the north edge of the continent. Originally I was just guessing Kyoto was a coastal city, but this turned out to luck onto one of their horsies in route to the Kyoto Gambit.</div></div><hr />

I founded my first city on that island, 450 BC also.:lol:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I did a great deal in this game was to use the &quot;Short Rushing&quot; technique to speed up production of units from the moment that I made it into Monarchy.<br />
<br />
The technique for &quot;Short Rushing&quot; uses cash to add to an existing shield balance to complete a unit that is just short of the desired completion total and then switch production to the  desired unit so that it will complete using the cities expected shield production.<br />
<br />
Combined with lots of mid game forestry, you can save lots of shields and lots of gold but this is a very labor and math intensive process in almost every turn.<br />
<br />
An example of this technigue that works really well is when a city is producing 10 to 14 shields and you want to build a swordsman.<br />
<br />
If you build the swordsman straight in a 14 shield city it will take three turns and cost 42 shields.<br />
<br />
If you short rush the swordsman, it can be built in two turns for a cost of 28 shields plus 24 gold.<br />
<br />
The trick is to make sure the production bin already has shields in it so the rush cost is 4x the open balance and then set the queue to build a spearman. When the bin has 14 shields in it you pay cash to rush 6 more shields up to the 20 total for the spearman and then switch over to a swordsman with an open balance of 10 shields that will complete in the next turn.<br />
<br />
Short rushing works best when you have a production output that is near to a multiple 10.<br />
<br />
In some cases, you can disband an obsolete unit to fill part of the production gap. I often use captured catapults for this rush fill technique.<br />
<br />
I also applied the same technique in a few cases where I pop rushed to use some unhappy people and convert them to something more useful.</div></div><hr />

Fair question. I am currently at 610AD with world maps from everyone after trading for them, so here I am....... As for being relatively equal with the AI's on tech entering the middle ages I thank my lucky archipelagos.<br />
<br />
As for questions I hope they don't appear too naive ;) <br />
<br />
I am just trying to invoke discussion on how other minds work. For example the key difference between your early expansion and mine was that you collonised the Japanese main island while my settler filled boats saw them and continued on northwards.<br />
<br />
I like your thinking about taking on an equally sized  horse bases CIV with a cheaper chariot based one. Your toe-hold, cheaper chariots and clever strategies paid off against a CIV without iron.<br />
<br />
Nice one.</div></div><hr />

I guessed that a toehold there would prove useful later and ferried across abour ten swordsman to my three cities there with the intention of cutting south. Japan's int must have been pretty good because before I made a move they cut me down with a combined force of about 25 horsies and spearmen. <br />
<br />
I also lost four cities including all the spices to culture flips to Japan. Once they got iron and hordes of samurai appeared, there was no chance to make a dent in them before modern warfare. <br />
<br />
I went for an 'economic' win. All money and a nice neighbour approach let me get a diplo win. Terrible score - but a more satisfying game than many.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, not flaming, but it does raise the question as to when its acceptable to read this - is it when you know where all other civs are on the map, or when you know where all the landmasses are?<br />
<br />
There is another island not shown on your minimap, and two not shown on CBs.  If these had resources / luxuries on them, then it would certainly be a &quot;spoiler&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not that it will affect the games of either of you IMHO (although it is extra land-mass).  One of these islands was settled by the Japanese in my game, so it could be the elusive missing Japanese city that someone was commenting about.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 12, 2002, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ainwood,<br />
<br />
Your point about the other island landmasses is semi-valid. I'm not sure the mini-maps do more than just reveal land mass locations as opposed to any resources or luxuries.<br />
<br />
I personally stop scouring the map for any final pieces of land once I can add up enough tiles to fit closely with the mapstat totals. I usually kick mapstat on about the time I meet just about everyone on the map. I also find it just infuriating when I sail around the world like Magellan combined with Captain Cook and the AI grins and offers to trade me his World Map that I already know for 100 gold and My World map that is 2 times as grand.<br />
<br />
I stopped hunting for land because I was busy enough with the targets I could see. You can just follow right behind and AI boat if you think you smell a blood trail to another potential landmass. Since the AI knows where all the dirt is there is almost no value in scouring the earth for Gilligan's isle.<br />
<br />
By using the F11 demographics screen really actively in the early game I could get lots of hints about who was where and how their cities were doing. In one mid game waste of time, I followed an AI galley that was being escorted by a frigate because I assumed they were headed to someplace of value and it turned out just to be a magical mystery tour of sorts.<br />
<br />
You can also use the list of cities in the diplomacy screen to compare to the areas of the map you can see and then make a guess as to other land masses. If the AI has 11 cities listed (plus the capital) and you can only see a capital plus 9 more citioes then you can bet your booty they have an island colony or two. A quick foray into the investigate city screen with your embassy will give almost a total picture of an island colony.<br />
<br />
One of the problems with Archipeligo maps is that it is almost impossible to kill a civ directly in a single landmass war. The WT Sherman strategy of marching to the sea ends up with the victim escaping to a final refuge on some far off coastline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to ask you if you used the whip much in the early game?<br />
<br />
I came to the forums in March but really did not pay much attention until April and really never depot rushed until after the V1.21 patch altered some of the early strengths of that approach.<br />
<br />
I have been doing a lot of testing on cases where hurrying along an unit or improvement is still of value during despotism. In this game I rushed a number of units improvements using home grown pop points. I had several really big whip sessions that surged out some key units in many cities all in the space of one or two turns.<br />
<br />
I'll probably post a separate discussion on this topic as it relates to religious civs, but would like to here if you felt you could take advantage of the whip prior to about 300BC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Jul 12, 2002, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi cracker,<br />
<br />
I don't use the whip too much at all (maybe granaries and temples) and not for settlers. <br />
<br />
I prefer to let my cities get a bit bigger with granaries to produce settlers. Whipping to produce a granary can rebalance the early loss by faster growth thereafter. Early in the game I use settler production to keep cities from being too unhappy.<br />
<br />
Whipping to produce temples can be beneficial when you lack luxuries on higher levels like this but the start position here being a horseshoe type mass did not lend well to leveraging a methodical expansion approach.<br />
<br />
When playing for points, whipping needs to be handled carefully, try to use only unhappy population for whipping.<br />
<br />
So, to answer your final question, I only used the whip early in the game to finish off the first two granaries I built. I don't recal whipping to complete any temples in this game, I would normally only do that if I was going for an early culture win. I did whip up a galley or two early on. :)<br />
<br />
I'll be interested to hear what you have learned about this form of rush building, I never really tried rush building like that which was used by some in the early versions. Hey, this GOTM was the first time I ever used the boat hopping feature. And your notes on cash rushes reminded me of some things I used to do in Civ2 and should pay attention to in Civ3.<br />

<br />
No, the minimap does only reveal land-mass locations, but small islands may have resources / luxuries.<br />
<br />
I think that this issue is much more applicable to an Archipeligo than to continents.<br />
<br />
Maybe people should just refrain from posting the minimaps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd be interested in seeing a power graph for your game circa 800-850AD (at about the same time as the one from CB and from my game. This way we can compare the power impacts of the different strategies. You seemed to be way out in front on the land grab and it would be nice to see how that effected power factors.<br />
<br />
I find comparing the nuances and slight differences of these approaches very interesting. Far more interesting than any arguments about fifth or sixth echelon players who might gain access to a remote island via a minimap exploit. Don't take this as a slam, but I had no clue where those last three islands were until late in the game when war refugees revealed their locations to me. <br />
<br />
The final outcome of the game is domianted by how quickly you get to the 10th or 12th city on the map because of how the coeffecients in the differential equation are determined over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2002, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cracker,<br />
<br />
Your power graph starts to really increase when you started your war with Japan. If you look at mine I get a jump at that time also even though I had a more steady increase earlier in the game. Since I build more cities my power goes up quicker but I spend too much production building cities. This usually slows my overall development and military production. This style works best for me when I know I'm going to play all 540 turns. When I do speed runs, I don't build ICS because the expansion goal overrides long term production goals.<br />

<br />
I just traded for Industrializaton and switched to building factories in my core cities.  <br />
<br />
I am 2 techs behind at this point.  Persia beat me to Electricity by 2 turns or I would have caught up on tech.  I have science at 9 now and have 4 turns to research medicine.<br />
<br />
I am at war for the first time currently with America after signing a MPP with Japan when it was offered so they would attack someone besides me.  I made the mistake of signing one with the Aztecs too so I am stuck in the war with America still for a few more turns.  Japan signed a peace treaty after Abe took one Japanese city.  I have taken one American city and Abe has taken one of mine.<br />
<br />
Its been a game of near misses with wonders.  I missed The Great Lighthouse by a few turns but got the Great Library.  I missed out on Leonardo's Workshop, JS Bach's Cathedral, Smith's Trading Company and Sistine Chapel but got Magellan's Voyage and Newton's University.<br />
<br />
My GA was triggered when a war chariot successfully defended against a rifleman attack before I lost the city.  Hopefully the GA will allow me to get Universal Suffrage and Theory of Evolution to catch Persia in tech.<br />

I only completed the FP about 5 turns ago on the northern island which I control.<br />
<br />
Japan beat me to a temple by a few turns so I lost the saltpeter on the 3rd island that we share.  I have a city with saltpeter on the island I share with america but its 72 turns from building a harbor.  I am going to have to rush that or I will have to wait for infantry to start offensive actions.<br />

I am still in monarchy.  I forgot to switch to republic when I got it and then didn't want to because I was building Smith's Trading Company.  I will switch to republic as soon as the war with America ends.  No one has researched Democracy yet.<br />

I send my score graph for 850AD (Score 2307). The quick growth of it is the begin of Japan's war (end of war ~630AD). I sent the galleys with settlers out as soon as was possible. 12th and 13th cities were founded out of the home island (550BC and 530BC). This fact didn't allow me to get the wide graph in begining  because the border wasn't optimal. I met all civs without assistance.<br />

Then find the link for your file in the upload system. I usually click on the 'last modified' column (hitting this twice will give you the most recent additions first) to sort the files by date, and I know one of the most recently added files is mine. Right click and select properties will tell you the link.  Copy the link from the properties.<br />

Whooosh. 14 tech rush from Great Library way past Education pulls me back into the game.  Germans give me maps and communications with everyone else. <br />
<br />
I can see that the small island to the north hasnt been settled on yet as hasnt the two islands in the south east.  Send settlers and get both islands.  Still way behind in score etc.  Try to play peacefully while I come up with an idea how to get back into this.<br />
<br />
At 1800 decide that science research is doing nothing for me and put everything into commerce and buy techs to catch up.<br />
<br />
Japan and Persia (2 superpowers) have been warring for about 1000 years with no sign of let up.<br />
<br />
Buy my way back into contention in the tech race, now only Persia in front.  America destroys Germany then the Aztecs.  Persia declares war on me for no reason.  He is probably to busy with the Americans and the Japs to send anything at me.  <br />
<br />
I notice that some Jap cities have been nuked by Persia (First time I have seen the AI using nuclear weapons before I did)<br />
<br />
War weariness is starting to take effect but Persia wont let me get out of this war.  5 nuclear strikes on their 5 biggest cities may help them decide that this war aint a good thing.<br />
<br />
Still wont talk to me :(<br />
<br />
Japan and Persia sign a peace treaty after about 1400 years of war with no side gaining ground on each others islands.<br />
<br />
1 more nuclear strike on Persia.<br />
<br />
Japan declares war on me.<br />
<br />
Bastards!<br />
<br />
Somebody nukes me.  That great little island in the south east with the aluminium, rubber and uranium.  This has set my space program right back and I was on course to pull this back and turn it into a victory as well.<br />
<br />
America attacks Japan straight away and Persia eventually signs a treaty with me.  Change from Democracy to Monarchy.<br />
<br />
So as it stands Persia is at war with America. Japan is at war with me and America. I only need the Laser too to put the final touches to the Space Race but that nuclear missle has set me right back as has changing government.  Its about 2006.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I should still be able to win by space race due to the 6 nuclear strikes against Persia as they were the tech leader at the time although I have to get out of this war with Japan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In 690BC,  I was researching MapMaking,  pre-building the Lighthouse and building the GrLib.<br />
<br />
Lighthouse in 310BC and GrLib in 10BC.   Japan was the first contact of course followed by Aztecs / Persia and soon after America / Germany.<br />
In 500AD,  I was surprise to see so many deserted Islands.   I started colonizing the closest ones,  in particular the big Dumbell Island.   I also decided it was time for a Golden Age :   I declared war to Japan on the very small Island North of their Empire.<br />
<br />
America declared war in 650AD after refusing to give them Chivalry.<br />
<br />
Peace with Japan in 680AD for Astronomy / Gunpowder.  I spotted Saltpeter on Dumbell Island (need a road to the Harbour).<br />
<br />
Germany declared war in 730AD after refusing to give them Gold.  I switched to Democracy and made an alliance with Aztec / Persia / Japan against  America / Germany.<br />
I noticed that Seattle was built on Ivory,  so I captured Seattle and Washington in 880AD and made peace the same year.<br />
In 1130AD,  with 9 Cavalry I took Bonn for Silk and Cologne the next turn.<br />
GL Ramss in 1170AD for Palace relocation at the Choke Point of Dumbell Island.<br />
Peace with Germany in 1190AD.<br />
<br />
In 1440AD,  Japan declared war and I signed a MPP with Persia / Germany.<br />
GL Cheops in 1505AD for Hoover Dam on Dumbell Island (only River available).<br />
<br />
Until 1768AD,  it was Wars against every other Civs to protect my territory.<br />
In 1770AD, Germany declared war when asked to leave.  The process was simple :  razing  German Cities and rebuilding.  Peace with Germany in 1834AD.  I left them on small Islands North and South.<br />
<br />
In  1866AD,  Japan declared war when asked to leave.  I used the same process :  razing / rebuilding.<br />
In 1900AD, America declared war (alliance with Japan).  Peace with Japan in 1908AD.  I left them on small Islands.<br />
Next was America.  They were defeated in 1926AD and GL #18.  One GL was used for UN, and the others were converted to 4-Elite Modern Armor Armies.<br />
In 1944AD,  Germany declared war to Japan and Persia declared war to Germany.  I was almost ready for the final assault against Persia.  (Less than 200 tiles for Domination and Japan barely over 50% of my 154 000 Culture)<br />
<br />
In 1946AD,  I switched to Monarchy and invaded Persia with 13 MA Armies,  32 Vet MA and 18 Mech Inf.  9 turns later and no extra GL,  I made peace with Persia and left them on smaller Islands.<br />
<br />
The same year (1957AD),  I switched to Democracy and began milking.<br />
<br />
Space Race Victory in 2050AD with 9697 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'm ready to tell my story.<br />
<br />
It all started out way back in the 4000's BC ya know with one settler one great industrias worker, and all the promises the gods have given our great society.  I founded my city on the start spot, and started my spread.  I got a settler out my second hut so in my capitol after building one settler I immiedietly started making it into a wonder builder (2 units, temple)  then started building the pyrimids.  I found myself all alone so started researching litaracy then mapmaking.  Straight path to both, and then learned iron working.  These were the last techs I would learn for a long time.  After the pyrimids were built, around the same time as I learned iron working, I got my GA and started building the great library in the same town.  got it in 24 turns.  The pyrimids allowed me to put out tons of settlers to put into boats to take all nearby islands I new of.  In the mean time I saw japan and knew they must go and soon!<br />
<br />
I had traded japan communications with the persains for it's world map since I saw they had a galley close by.  I noticed they had no iron and only one horsey.  My plan was to take out that horse before the war started.  So I put 2 swordsmen In galley and made way to there horses, he would sit there till the invasion force was complete.  My invasion force consisted of 30 swordsmen &amp; 6 galleys to transport back and forth. I attacked somewhere around 10-100ad not sure.  I first unloaded on there horses and pillaged there road.  This made for an even playing field.  With my units only moving 1 space and there units only moving 1 space.  The first 1 - 2 hundred years was attrition war.  I sat around and beat there staning army to the ground.  Then after that was taken care of I slowly made my way across there continent.  I got a great leader on there 6 town I sacked, and built my FP with it slap dab in the middle of the continent.  By 500ad I had thrown the japs compleatly off there land and then around 600ad had finished them off.  I spent the next 700 years just sitting back and building my infastructure, preparing for the great war.  When the AI discovered education I moved my slider from all gold to 80% tech and beelined it to military tradition.  I learned that and magnatism before they could then slowed the learning pace to snail.  I upgraded all hoseman and war chariots I had built in the past five hundred years (roughly 40) to cavalry.  This was rather cheap since I also built leonardos workshop in my capitol.  I then took the largest gambit, yet most succesful, I have ever taken in GOM.  I went all 70%monet 20%luxery 10%tech for the next 600 hundred years.  This is the begging of the Great War.<br />
<br />
The Great war was for the conquest of the world.  I started out by doing something I have never done before, purposefully starting a 2 front war.  I used my mainland to attack it's north-eastern nieghbors, and I used my second heary to attack it's north-western neighbots.  Germany and Persia.  My initial strike force for both lands was roghly 40 units per land.  I hit at there heart first splitting both in half.  I had taken both of there capitols by the third turn of the war.  I got Sun Tzus out of persepolis, and the obsolete Great wall out of Berlin.  I then slowly kept building units and attacking all there cities.  Moving to take out a city every turn.  This part of the war took roughly 400 hundred years, then they were both knocked off too become small island peoples.  Next I turned my eyes towards america.  I waited five turns though to regroup and begin moving my strike force from persia across the sea to the amercian homeland.  I had roughly 90 cavalry near them when the war started,  thogh they had also been fightin with germany and had roughly 40 rifleman,  ahh.  My first strike took two cities then none more for several turns.  I had to clean up there units before moving onward.  I HATE AMERICAN CONSCRIPT RIFLEMAN  firaxis should have put the proggramming somewher a conscript rifleman in a level 2 city SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO KILL MY ARMY OF CAVALRY fully healed, then fully dead to a damned conscript.  Ohh well I had plenty more where they came from.  The funny thing is by 1500ad when I had nothing left but mopping up to do the AI still haddn't learned replaceable parts.  This allowed my cavalry to take over the world.  Acording to mapstat I could have achieved domination in 1465ad, but I held back and decided to milk.  I attacked the azteks next a we little civ of ten cities not task for my 145 cavalry.  I managed to beat the world down and have the AI with one city surrounded by 96 cavalry, by the early 1600's  My current score is around 9k and I figure I should be able to get 15000+ pts out of this milk, appollo says culture vic in 2047ad, I will adjust this in time, now on to the future!</div></div><hr />

Susa and Samaria are within easy reach when this bug is part of the game whereas they would not have been reachable prior to V1.21.<br />
<br />
This is a major exploit in V1.21 becasue it literally serves up subsequent conquest cities on a silver platter. If this had been a pangea map I could have conquered the entire world in one turn using Cavalry and Railroads.<br />
<br />
Because this seems like such a weird bug I have not fully been able to exploit it.  Also the V1.29 patch may fix it becasue it is so severely unbalancing.<br />

Curious though, I thought that the rules were saved with the game.  Also, I'm getting a new message that I've not seen before and I'm wonding if perhaps I'm not using the correct rules.  On turn begin, I'm getting a message, &quot;Your citizens are rioting... Give them Entertainment&quot;.  Is this correct?  Does it mean default rules as they come in the saved game or default rules from Civ Install? Because I've been playing since this game was released and I've yet to see this message box.<br />

<br />
Eventually got out of war with Japan, but it took an ICBM to do it.<br />
<br />
Which then started another war with Persia who then nuked the great little island in the South East :(<br />
<br />
My switch to monarchy meant little money was coming in but a least there was a great reduction in war weariness.  <br />
<br />
Nearly laughed when Persia started dropping off longbowmen in galleons right after nuking me but thats all they would send at me.<br />
<br />
Got a great leader from killing a bowman and used it to hurry the second last spaceship part. (Could have done something more useful if I could have airlifted him off that tiny island)<br />
<br />
Eventually researched the laser and started on the planetary party lounge in Byblos where it would only take one turn.<br />
<br />
Launched a nuke on Persia just to say goodbye.<br />

Won 2026  Space Ship Victory 4th in Histograph with a score of 2600 or so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2002, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I made it up to 1330AD now.<br />
<br />
I had some problems when I started the war with the Persians and Germany at the same time. First of all I was in democracy so I had war weariness in about 5 turns (have not researched up to industrialism even yet, that's what I get for holding back on research). So I switched back to Republic and about 5 turns or so after that war weariness was getting bad again. Then to top it all off everyone got nationalism so rather than fight a war of attrition I negotiated peace and rethought my plan. I changed production and rushed a bunch of cannons. I had a few already cause catapults and cannons are great for attacking sea going vessels as they cruise by. ;) I was no longer concerned with reputation and started the war again the next turn. I got a couple of great leaders and had no wonders to produce so I built armies of cavalry. The cannons and the armies gave me the extra punch to break through the defenses.<br />
<br />
So at 1330AD the Persians are down to 2 puny cities and the Germans have about 6 or 7 cities left. As a bring my forces over from the Persian island, the Germans should be reduced to ruble. I plan on keeping the Persian through to the end since they have the least culture. ;) All my forces will start to gather to start the war with the Americans who are at war with the Germans right now (that military alliance with the Americans got them into the war, the got a bit pissed when I signed peace with the germans but they stayed at war with the Germans since these wars started). I should have about 100 cavalry, 100 cannons and 100 riflemen when I start the war with the Americans.<br />
<br />
I will post my 1400 AD power chart when I get there, should have made a pretty good dent into the Americans by then.<br />

AIs were at constant war with each other (and with me, do I have to mention that) and because of that tech progress was very slow and strange - printing press and democracy were researched only after radio was, and that happend somewhere in the late 19th century. Has this happend to anyone else :confused: ?<br />
Funny thing - all three militaristic civs were wiped out, and three industrious remained. Persia was the strongest civ most of the time and I had almost twice as much culture as they did, but could never trigger cultural victory.<br />
They were the first ones to have nukes. Never seen AI attacking me with them before I nuked him. And here comes AI's stupidity in play: Persians dropped a nuke on some forgotten tundra city - 5 times in the period of 100 years :eek: if they bombed key cities, well, thing would be different, I guess... <br />
Later I nuke whole persian continent and put them out of the space race (and they were the only ones in it :) ) and win with histographic wictory. Ended with ~7ooo pointz...  not that I care that much about that, but there you go...</div></div><hr />

The tech race in my game is so slow.  We have just gotten into the middle ages with only one or two techs disovered.  I have yet to go to war, all I have been doing is expanding, I have had no time for war.  I have my island settle completely, and the small one to the NE.  I then found three more islands to settle and am trying to fill them all quickly.  Japan put one settler on the big jungle island to the NE, and that is probably all they will be able to get in.  My settlers are arriving as fast as my boats can get them there.  I have never used caravels so much.<br />
<br />
I just found a new island to the North west of the large jungle island, and it seems a safe bet that it will be all mine as well.<br />

I have over 400 units so my turns are very long at least for a while, I estimate this turn will take 2 hours to complete because of the wholesale changes to be made. Suffrage will be completed next turn so war weariness should not be a factor that will hold me back, however, I will most likely stay in Republic until the war with the Americans is over.<br />
<br />
I've been at war with the Americans for two turns. I had been expecting that they would have some major forces but I've only seen 1 cavalry and two of the three cities I took had musketmen and pikemen for defense. They must have burned themselves out in the war with the Germans who are now history. My handful of ironclads have started to whittle their frigates down. Since the Americans have a fairly high culture and I am now  selectively choosing build sites I will raze every American city, they have no wonders, and I don't need to battle culture flips. Persia has two cities left and I will set them up later in a corral.<br />
<br />
I have about 250 cities and I will now go and sell all existing temples in cities where the culture is 10 or more.. Change production in second tier cities (commerce above 18 or so) to universities to I can get to ecology as quick as possible. Manage population growth so that as many cities as possible are at full size without a hospital ASAP. Change all production in corrupt cities from military to point enhancing production like aqueducts and then marketplaces.<br />
<br />
I will build new cities in prime locations and start eliminating cities that are on poor sites (tundra and mountain locals). I will rush build settlers in these cities to be disbanded to reduce and move population quickly. This process will take up some of the time between now and ecology, I don't want too much global warming but I do want to get some hospitals on line before ecology.<br />
<br />
My score for the first half of the game (1400 AD) will be over 6000 but I'm unsure how fast things will develop to really predict final score but I'm hoping to get above 25000.<br />

How do you calculate the score this early?  I have seen Sir Plebs calculator and that helps, but I am too far from the domination limit to use that reliably.  Is there another way?:</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is how I arrive at an estimated final score at this point of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
(estimated end game score) = ((first half score) + (second half score)) /2<br />
<br />
(first half score) = score at 1400 AD<br />
<br />
(second half score) = ((current estimated score) + (maps potential score))/2<br />
*** The estimated average of your scores per turn in the second half of the game <br />
<br />
maps potential score = domination limit * 4 * difficulty<br />
*** this is a very simple estimate and the real potential is based on actual squares in your control and how well you use them<br />
<br />
Anyway, a cheap way to provide a 'carrot' to play it out. :)</div></div><hr />

Don't give up so easily. If you are using Windows, double click on the &quot;Recycle Bin&quot; icon on your desktop.  You may find your game files there.<br />
<br />
In the future, when not playing a GOTM, you might find it helpful to rename the leader of your tribe. You can do this when starting a game by clicking on the picture of the leader. The game files are saved with the leader name, so this allows you to easily distinguish your games.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

I'm not playing conquest either so I'm sure that the early conquest win will before 1400 AD because that is about when I will have finished off all my wars. The early spaceship victory will probably be in the 1500's cause they will benefit from AI research much longer than those that are fighting big wars.<br />

Unfortunately I play for domination because havn't enough time to milk the game. I will not have the big score but will get satisfaction from force win not from surviving. May be early war is better then early spread on the world and I could be get the domination earlier. My science stopped many years ago and I can't get the cavalry for boost the war. Other civs don't follow in that direction. I got out Aztecs and prepare to conquer the Persian. I'm in 1000AD and have 48% of the map.</div></div><hr />

I know the time involved with milking. :(<br />
<br />
Since there was so much unclaimed land on the map, early expansion like you did would be better than heavy war. You had much better positioning than I did for a domination.<br />
<br />
Because milking involves domination, conquest and sort of a space race combined; that approach may have actually benefited both my domination and conquest aspects in this game. Cavalry was my war ticket after the Japanese.<br />

I was keen for capture the new unclaimed territory and collected money for upgrade the war chariots to knights but forgot for science. Now I'm easier to use many knights then be trying to learn the Military Tradition (at least 24 turns for 3 discoveries). This fact is my main strategy mistake. But I'll win in any case though it will not so fast. The main thing is the pleasure from the game. Although to get the earliest finish should be great.<br />

I am now up to 860AD and am taking a break from the war with Japan.  I need to regroup and try to switch to Republic.  I am just not sure if I can afford it?  I have to really sit down and analyze my troops.  Because of my rapid expansion I have over 70 warriors at the moment and about 70 workers to look at.  It would cost too much to switch without getting rid of some of them.<br />
<br />
The Japanese are slowly dying, but their culture is killing me.  I managed to get a leader out of the war so far and moved my palace over to their Island.  This helped corruption (My FP was right next to my Palce before).  I can't seem to take over the cities and reduce the resistance fast enough, so I decided to stop and regroup to get more troops over to help.  The japanes will be gone within the next 20 to 30 turns.  I will have Calvry by about then to assist if need be.<br />

I have to agree with Sergs comment above about CB.  It does seem like you will be 1st again this month, but some of us are trying to catch up.  Here is an image of my mini map at 860AD.  I made a few mistakes along the way or I would be further along than I am.</div></div><hr />

Left click on one of those unhappy people to see what the problem is. This may give you the clue you need to understand what happened.<br />
<br />
My unscientific observation:<br />
I have noticed that under Monarchy, that if another civ starts a war with you then you end it fairly quickly with diplomacy that can lead to some unrest. I don't know the circumstances of your war but short wars without a real positive outcome seems to lead to some unsupportive citizens. Starting the war up again can make those malcontents happy again. Then give you a chance to end the war in a more positive position.<br />

Although I though the Americans were going to be the hardest battles they seemed to have been the easiest to finish off. The Americans had a good rating on the power graph but they were wimps.

It will take to the early 1600's to get to ecology and by then I should have rearranged my cities to better locations. The game should go alot faster now that the number of units I have to manage is reducing.<br />

You have good density of cities. Especially on the big jungle island and old Aztecs map. You are balancing on the domination edge. Your cities havn't have any cultural the buildings. How percent of luxuries are you using?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I did have culture up in the old Aztec lands. As the Persians defeated the Aztecs I built cities and then temples to press the Persians with my culture. After that the small cities supported the war effort, even if they only produce 1 shield, 50 of those corrupt cities produce 50 cannons in 40 turns. ;)<br />
<br />
As for luxuries, I use 10% as my normal setting but that varies depending on war conditions. Now that I have gone to democracy I have dropped my luxuries to 0% so that I can research and purchase improvements. Lots of small cities really only require the 8 luxuries to be fairly happy. I guess if I was really pressing for points I would raise them but for now I'm looking at development issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought I was going to get squashed like a bug - my first game on Emperor - but by being VERY conservative I seem to have survived. (so far!)<br />
<br />
It's now 1770AD and I'm a solid third - the Aztecs got wiped out by the Persians, and the Germans/Americans/Persians have been squabbling for about 50 years now. The Japanese are most powerful, but I have a MPP with them which has kept them off my back I think (it's cost me 1 or 2 gpt).<br />
<br />
I've been adopting a vulture tactic. When the Aztecs died there were gaps between the 0 culture captured cities. So I rushed some settlers over to their island and grabbed some spices. When the Germans had some cities destroyed I swept in and claimed some ivory. And I've been chasing Japanese resources around. I rush-built a pile of culture improvements in a border city in order to try to flip their coal (I have none :() and it worked - 2 turns after the damn coal ran out. :( Then I noticed the Japanese only had one iron - right on my border, but a couple of tiles from their nearest city. They don't have any iron now, I flipped it from them. Now I'm selling them their own iron at a very reasonable 100+gpt. :lol: <br />
<br />
Everyone seems to like me - even though I'm gouging them with my monopolies of furs, gems and dyes. :) The question is, do I go for the UN and hope I'm popular enough for diplomatic victory, or cut off the strategic supplies to Japan (Iron) and Persia (rubber ) - the two leading civs - and build up for a war? Just entering Modern Age right now. Decisions decisions. UN is probably safer - but I'd hate to lose my first Emperor game at the UN!<br />
<br />
And what are the Americans doing with all their silk - they never have any to trade! Grr. It's the only lux I don't have by ownership or trade. Mind you, they'll want an arm and a leg for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My early expansion was somewhat hampered by the fact that due to poor exploring i missed the cow to the southeast of Thebes until my fourth city and i got barbs from almost all the goody huts.<br />
However my opponents seemed to be pretty slow in developing as i managed to get the Great Lighthouse in 650 BC, the Great Library in 90 BC and the Hanging Gardens in 90 AD.<br />
I had already contacted the Japanese on their island by that time and was trying to delay their expansion with my exploring warrior as long as i could. They were pretty poorly developed so i managed to colonize most of the small islands before they got a few settlers over.<br />
<br />
I contacted the Aztecs and Persians around 200 AD and got a load of techs from them through the Great Library. By now the Japanese finally had enough of my warrior and declared war. Since i don't have much experience with archipelago type maps (and thus with island invasions) i decided not to try and wipe them of their island  but to go for republic instead.<br />
<br />
It appeared the Japanese had more bark than bite because they only managed to land a single warrior near one of my island cities during the entire war, wich i killed using a rushed war chariot.<br />
The resulting golden age really helped as i managed to get a huge tech lead over the others and all medieval wonders except sun tsu's and leo's.:yeah:<br />
<br />
Around 1100 AD the Japanese again declared war on me and razed a poorly defended city on the jungle island. Too bad for them i just finished completing factories in my core cities AND they didn't have iron nor saltpeter so my cavalries made quick work of their main island, using the great leaders i got in the process to rush the universal suffrage and a palace on their island.<br />
<br />
Everything looked set for a space ship victory (i almost always win via space ship as i find the extremely long turns during modern age warfare not very enjoyable) but out of nothing the Persians attacked me. As i had a huge tech lead over them this wouldn't had to be a problem but a weird thing happened: although i had acquired 7 out of the 8 luxuries and had universal suffrage and police stations in most cities i could not keep my cities happy. :confused:<br />
<br />
As i had already seen that i controlled all the world's rubber sources i changed to monarchy and decided to go for domination instead. As they only had riflemen to oppose my tanks it was an easy though time-consuming war wich led to victory in 1715 AD. :)<br />
<br />
Not a very high score (4000+) in comparison with some other players (see above) but a very nice game nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

Even if they have built it five times?  This is the first milking game where I made it a point of keeping the AI with only one city for around 600 years.  I used about 60-90 cavalry surounding their border to keep them from building other cities, unitl thier culture spread three tiles then i had to go to war to stop them from building cities.  I noticed that every time I killed them down to only one unit and one settler the next turn they built a city wherever the settler was placed and then got all their bonus units again.  Is this a bug or intentinal.  Either way I don't like just plain annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurricane</div><div class="date">Jul 23, 2002, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started on the GOTM early this week, and only after the patch came out I decided to try to finish my game quickly. :) <br />
<br />
The early game was pretty conventional. I spread out to the small islands northeast of my main island and founded a city on the Japanese mainland. Since my main island was pretty small, I decided to go for a purely domination game. I built no improvements and instead crancked out settlers, swordsmen and later war chariots and horsemen. I tried to get the Great Lighthouse but missed it. I managed to get the Great Library, though. The Pyramids were built on the other side of the world in Washington, which was a big setback.<br />
<br />
Before I was ready the Japs declared war and got one or two cities. A few turns later I got knights, made massive upgradings (about 50 chariots/horsemen) and invaded Japan. He had only spearmen so it wasnt too hard, but with my noexistent culture the culture flipping was insane. :mad: At least a dozen cities flipped, with Satsuma even flipping 3 times. I got a leader which I used to rush the FP in the middle of Japan (an earlier leader had rushed Leonardos). I only wiped out the Japs a few turns before I got Cavalry.<br />
<br />
I quickly continued against Germany, but only managed to get 3 cities before everybody had Riflemen. I decided it was time for Democracy and preparations for Tanks, so I switched and started building marketplaces, libraries, aqueducts and later factories. <br />
<br />
It is now 1600 AD, I am the tech leader with 3 techs ahead of the Persians. The other civs are stuck in wars against each other and are far behind. I am gaining 427 gold/turn from trades with the Persians, which means they are broke and I can get techs every 4 turns and still keep a nice positive income. The Persians have no oil but chance to 1, so I think I will kick them out first when I get tanks. After that probably the Americans (have 3 oil) and then the weak Germans&amp;Atztechs. They are both out of Rubber, too.<br />
<br />
The map shows the situation in 1415 AD, just after I signed peace with the Germans:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Txurce</div><div class="date">Jul 24, 2002, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first GOTM on this site, and my first game not playing with eight civs on all-standard settings.  As a result, I took a different approach from most of you, which led to pretty obvious problems, and some solutions I'd never tried before.  The result is a still-ongoing game that has been very challenging, and consistently fun.<br />
<br />
OUTER SPACE OR BUST<br />
<br />
As soon as I realized that I was alone on an island, I made the decision not to go for a domination win, and focused instead on the space race.  The idea of building the FP in a totally corrupt city without a Great Leader also didn't appeal to me, and I had no horses, so I made a second, more fateful decision to limit most of my expansion to my home island, and build a small, low-corruption civ.  As you probably guessed, this led to a game where my strategy was dictated by an almost-total lack of homegrown strategic resources.<br />
<br />
I spaced my cities for maximum expansion, filled in the island, and built infrastructure.  Aced out of the Colossus and the Lighthouse, I settled for the Great Library.  I encountered the Japanese around 400 BC, and established contact with all of the civs by the time I entered the Middle Ages.  At this point - 100 or 200 AD - I was already second from the bottom in points, a republic with about 15 cities, but was even in tech and second to Japan in culture.<br />
<br />
MIDDLE AGE SAG<br />
<br />
The Middle Ages led to very limited off-shore expansion: one city to bring in horses, another to snag the dye cluster, and a few other random ones.  I managed to build Bach's and Newton's, but started to fall behind in tech.  In the meantime, Japan was pulling out in front of everyone, Persia steadily ground down the Aztecs, and the Germans and America began what would be a long, inconclusive war.  Egypt avoided all war except one with America where not a shot was fired, occasionally paying tribute.<br />
<br />
The downside to not being expansionist on a large map with a low number of civs became painfully obvious as I entered the Industrial Age around 1040.  Egypt lacked both saltpeter and coal.  I considered invading the far-off Aztecs for saltpeter, but found some unclaimed on the dye island.  More problematic was no coal.  At this point, only the Germans had it, so trading for it was impossible.  But a small civ like mine virtually required it both to generate a competitive number of shields, and to employ a small but mobile defense force.  Unfortunately, my army consisted of  about 20 spearmen led by two archers, and it would be a long time before I gained the ability to send back the saltpeter to the homeland for cavalry.<br />
<br />
IF I CAN'T TRADE FOR COAL...<br />
<br />
It was time for Egypt to make a bold move.  I loaded one settler and seven freshly-built vet riflemen onto two galleons, sailed over to the German coal tile - conveniently on the coast - and plopped all eight units atop it in 1140.  I allied myself with the Americans, built a city on the coal tile one turn later, and hunkered down.  To my surprise, that the Germans ignored me, moving past to defend the cities to the north against the invading Americans.  I quickly built a harbor, temple, and barracks, then waited for an opportunity to make peace with the Germans, so that I could ship the coal back home.<br />
<br />
Peace with Germany came a century later.  I spent that time trading luxuries for tech, falling no further behind, and researching straight for Scientific Method.  I reached that first, and sold it at a fairly safe point for lots of everything.  On the military front, I decided that there was no point to building cavalry, as infantry would soon be a more useful all-around unit.  So I built enough riflemen to guard all of my cities (and two cavalry, by mistake).<br />
<br />
THE GLORIOUS CENTURY<br />
<br />
By 1300, everything started to come together.  I switched to democracy, killed a rare German longbowman with my lone War Chariot to launch a Golden Age, and - most importantly - built the Theory of Evolution in 1320.  This gave me enough of a lead in one tech branch to catch up where I was behind, and take the overall tech lead for good.  It also gave me a huge supply of gold which, combined with the three luxuries I controlled, allowed me to trade the Americans for oil, and the Japanese for rubber.  (Yes, I lacked those resources as well.)<br />
<br />
While I couldn't build Hoover's - no rivers - my revved-up workers cranked out one railroaded grassland tile per turn each, while my cities built factories and coal plants.  These focused mainly on airports and tanks.  In 1375, Egypt entered the Modern Age ahead of all the other civs, and its four tanks were the only ones on the globe.  By 1400, when the Golden Age ended, Egypt was still second-worst in points and fourth in size and population... but it was first in productivity and mfg. goods, second in income, and third in gnp.  My war chest had 3500 gold, and rising.  And every single tile was mined and railroaded.<br />
<br />
WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?  ALUMINUM AND URANIUM, I HOPE<br />
<br />
Things look good, even though I've never played a game like this one.  As a rule, my forces consist almost solely of fastmovers, but in this game I built almost none entering the modern age, and used only one offensively: the War Chariot that launched my GA.  My war totals are one city built on foreign territory, and one chariot killed, to about four of the enemy.  In the end, this is a very contained builder game that turned around on two key successes: the taking of the German coal, and the building of the TOE.<br />
<br />
The plan for the end game is to build a force of about 20 tanks, and enough airports to have instant global deployment in case of attack.  One settler is en route to claim some available oil on a tiny northern island that the dying  Aztecs haven't quite filled in.  This leaves only rubber as something for which to trade, so whatever gold is left over can be fully applied to maxing the science rate.<br />
<br />
What lies between Egypt and the stars?  Well, call it a hunch, but I expect to find no aluminum or uranium on any of my tiles.  And the AI will close on me in tech, even tough I expect to build SETI.  That said, I doubt the AI will beat me to space.  I'll let you know how it turns out.</div></div><hr />

I noticed this game seemed to take a lot longer than normal. First, being archipelago, techs were slow. Later, I played a very complex attack strategy against Japan hinging on pikemen that took quite a while to prepare and execute. Then I paused an entire day to decide if I should attempt an attack on the Persian mainland. Finally, I didn't get an early standard culture win, so I went for a city culture victory playing until 2000AD, much later than I usually do. <br />
<br />
There's still a few days left. Maybe you can still finish. :)<br />

Persia reached the Modern Age after me, but pulled ahead with its free tech.  I then tried to research my own branches, and trade the tech with Persia and sometimes Japan.  This kept me almost even, partly due to the wars that Persia and America fought against Japan and Germany.  While the only loser in the war was Germany, who lost all its offshore holdings to Persia, I was the true beneficiary, in that Persia researched not only Recycling, but Advanced Flight and Stealth as well.  This slowed them down just enough that I was able to launch in 1690, two turns after trading them for Superconductor.<br />

<br />
I've been living a peacable existence since about 1100AD, happily building and colonising whenever the AIs are at war, razing their cities for me!<br />
<br />
Now in mid 19th century, with Japan #1, Persia #2, me third, Americans 4th. The Germans just got wiped out by Persia and America, but I managed to grab the German silks and coal :)<br />
<br />
Then Xerxes pops up and demands uranium as a tribute. Does he think I'm some kind of moron? No way.<br />
<br />
Now we're at war. The Persians had already attacked the Americans, and I had an MPP with Japan. So now it's everyone vs. Persia. :)<br />
<br />
The Persians ambushed a huge amount of my ships and subs in their initial attack. In future I'll keep them all in port I think. I'd love to know how his ironclad hunted down my sub.<br />
<br />
I was forced in communism in 2 turns of being attacked by the way - I went from an empire of WLTQD in virtually every city to riots due the war virtually immediatelly. And I have NO units in enemy territory yet. As has been complained about before, this is rather a pain. If Egypt wasn't religious it'd be a crippler.:mad: <br />
<br />
Fpr disrupting my democratic peace the Persians are going to die. That tac nuke looks awful tempting right now! :) (If they don't have uranium, then they don't have nukes hehehe)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Persians living in my territory - about 2 (I had captured one city, which they had taken from the US previously)<br />
<br />
Units not in home territory - quite a few - ships at sea, units in US (ROP in effect) or neutral tiles.<br />
<br />
I really don't see why my citizens were so worked up. They have abused their right to democratic expression now, though, and will not be trusted again!:)<br />
<br />
And the war had gone maybe 2 or 3 turns. I had lost two cities (and gained one). One of the two had a luxury, which I then lost. Perhaps that was it. But some of the cities went from all happy to more than half unhappy.</div></div><hr />

I know that at this level war weariness can be frustrating but that just seems ridiculous. Wish I could offer some better insight. I know I fought alot of these types of problems also but at least with a religious civ you can go down to republic and that helps quite alot. If your close to being able to negotiate peace again, bumping up luxuries temporarily can save you the trip to republic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a lot of Japanese nationals in my cities, I guess that's the problem.<br />
<br />
Fortunately the war was only a clean-up job and it ended in 2 turns with Japan's destruction.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scientia</div><div class="date">Jul 27, 2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I can admit defeat on this month's GOTM, but I have a couple of concerns about the circumstances leading to my loss.<br />
<br />
Persia was at war continuously, mostly versus everyone else, since the 1500's.  They have been in communism for all of that time.  In 1898 they land some troops on two of my continents.  I have an ROP with them and am at peace with everyone with Democracy for my government.  I am in the middle of researching space race (about 3 turns left), and from the diplomacy screen, it appears that I am about 3 techs behind (Fission, ecology, Space Race)<br />
<br />
Anticipating a sneak attack, I sign an MPP with Japan, who is currently at War with America and Germany.  My suspicions are confirmed the next turn at Persia attacks, violating the ROP that still had 10 turns left.  I'm not too concerned about the stack of tanks and mech inf they have on two of my continents as I quickly whittle both stacks to nothing using my own defensive forces.<br />
<br />
There's one advantage to this War at least - I've been saving some Chariots hoping to start a GA.  Saving one Persian tank with 1 HP left, I sacrifice 3 chariots in a counter-attack, but am rewarded with the GA I'm hoping for.  The year is now 1900.<br />
<br />
Production and comerce in my cities increases dramatically.  Rather than launch counter-offensives, I take advantage of the GA in the hopes of closing the tech gap, and spring-boarding me towards a space race victory.  I'm researching techs in 5 to 6 turns, and keeping an eye on my war weariness so that I can bump up luxeries if need be.  I let Japan run defense for me.<br />
<br />
By the end of my GA (and the WAR) I had space race, satellites, super conductor, and Fission, and am thinking that I can only be (at most) 1 or 2 techs behind.  The whole world is at WAR, and eveyone is in communism but me.  By the end of my war with Persia, I had luxeries set at 30 percent and science at 40 percent.<br />
<br />
When I finally get peace with Persia (Japan sued for peace 1 turn before the end of our MPP), I see in the diplomacy screen that they now have miniaturization, synthetic fibers, recycling, and nuclear power.  A quick glance at the space race screen shows they have 5 modules built and 3 more on the way.<br />
<br />
I am thinking to myself that they must be researching lasers, but surely this will take them awhile under communism, but I'm also wondering how they managed to out-tech me during the war when they were fighting against everyone else.<br />
<br />
I also notice that they don't have rubber, and as far back as I can remember, they have lacked this resource.  I breathe a little easier thinking that I can still crank out the tech in enough time to give them a good run for the space race.<br />
<br />
From here on out, I check the diplomacy screen every turn, checking to see if they have secured rubber to build the outer casing, which is one of the most expensive pieces to build.  <br />
<br />
For the remainder of the game they NEVER have rubber (it always shows up as a resource they wich to trade for).<br />
<br />
In 1946 they have 6 (3) on the space race screen.  Still no rubber.  A few turns later, the screen shows 7 (3).  <br />
<br />
I'm stumped.  How could the Persians possibly have started the exterior casing without a supply of rubber?  I must have missed something, perhaps they captured a city with a rubber resource for 1 turn, and then immediately lost it, but had it long enough to start the module.  I consider this unlikely, though because they were at WAR with everyone for pretty much the remainder of the game, and unless they had a trade route back to the mainland I don't see how they could have accomplished this.  Perhaps they captured a city with rubber, got a GL and rushed the exterior casing, I don't know.<br />
<br />
Again, I wonder how Persia out paces me in tech research when I am in Democracy and a Golden Age and they are in Communism and at war with everyone, and how they manage to build the one space module that requries rubber when they have been without for the entire modern age? :confused:</div></div><hr />

So I don't know what I did wrong, except in very generic/useless terms. And I really don't see that WW sets in even in democracies THAT quickly. In fact, it seems to me that governments seem to have given up long before their people did in many cases. But I digress....<br />
<br />
back OT, the persian menace appears to be being contained :) After they invaded that nice little island SW of Egypt, SE of Persia, a vicious tussle has been raging for one of my cities, which has Aluminium (my only supply) and Rubber and Uranium (neither of which Persia has access to). They took almost all the island (razing three of my cities :mad: ) but our retaliation force landed the next turn and 4 vet MA, 4 vet MI made mincemeat of the assorted tanks, infantry and longbowmen(!) :) . They tried to land and retake the city but we wiped out their beachhead.<br />
<br />
Our Navy has now regrouped after the initial dastardly Persian attack and the CVBG is now hunting Persian BBs. They have Magellan's Voyage, so they can outrun us - even when we have bombed them into a barely-floating hulk :crazyeye:. They can run, but they can't hide. I haven't seen a Persia CV yet, only BBs. I guess they haven't worked out naval airpower yet :) Perhaps the current demonstration will open their eyes :lol:</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will be a conquest,domination,cultural, spaceship victory in the year 2050. I should have the entire tech tree complete by the end of the game. I will declare war on the Persians in 2047 (I have to go over hills to get to them.) so that I can take out their last city in 2049. Also in 2049 I will launch my space ship and build a new city or two to go over the domination threshold. My culture is already timed to trigger a victory in 2050. I'm not sure which victory the system will give me credit for but I suspect that it will be for the conquest.<br />
<br />
Earlier in this thread I had estimated my final score to be 25,000 however I see from those notes that I had used 2550 domination squares at in the calculation. There are not that many squares required for a domination and I ended up with a few more mountains in my control than I originally planned so my final score will be a little more than 10% less than that estimate.</div></div><hr />

After running a test on monarch I got  crushed in 2 deity games and finally managed to win the third. Then I discovered GOTM and thought this would be fun.<br />
<br />
I do present some of my ideas on this game as well as a short summary for discussion and entertainment of all.<br />
<br />
Egypts being industrious and religious with war chariots as UU can't avoid an early GA. I do consider this good contrary to a couple of other opinions I found floating around. You just have to be prepared for it. The advantage of an early GA is, you can catch up with the AI early in the game. Usually you should have serious problem after you are on par with the AI. So I prepared my GA and intendet triggering it with the pyramids, which is both an industious and religious wonder. I would use use the production and commercial bonus to get the lighthouse and the great libary and then send hordes of troops to other islands.<br />
<br />
I moved my worker onto the hill in the north and founded at the starting position, with has access to fresh water and a cattle after cultural expansion. I planed to build the pyramids and the great libary  here. So I started with 3 warriers, a settler, a worker to improve production, a temple and then the pyramids.<br />
<br />
I founded Memphis in 3000 BC on the hill beside the second cattle. having access to both cattle and wheat it produced most of my settlers.<br />
<br />
Heliopolis was founded in 2230 BC 4 tiles northeast of memphis and should be prepared for the lighthouse by prebuilding a palast after some initial builds. <br />
<br />
I build the pyramids in 1075 BC and triggered my GA as intended. Discovered I did a math error in judging the corruption after the GA. Fortunately one of the huts gave me bronce working and Heliopolis build the Kolossos in 850 BC instead of the lighthouse. The GA still allowed me to build the lighthouse in 290 BC and the libary in 110 BC.<br />
<br />
I stopped researching after the discovery of the essential techs. The libary gave me the wheel and iron working almost immediately and there where no horses, but there was iron. So I got no horsemen/war chariots but lots of swordsmen I intended to use against Japan by upgrading warriors. <br />
<br />
Japan declared war on me around 100 AD and my 10 galleys where ready only a few turns later. I then invaded Japan with more than 60 swordsmen. Taking out 5 cities on the first turn. Due to the lack of speed of the swordsmen my war progressed slowly and Japan got finally eliminated around 1000 AD. Around this time I looked into the spoiler threat and discovered I was way behind other players in the contest for domination or conquest. So I concentrated on culture where I had already a solid base. <br />
<br />
The rest of my game was not entertaining. Concentrating on culture and sience I was well ahead of the AI from the industial age on. I managed to build all wonders except the great wall, the oracle and Sun Tzu. <br />
<br />
At several times one of the AIs demanded tribute and got a blody nose. Nevertheless I held back not to trigger a domination victory. Finally in 1832 I passed the 100000 culture border and had way more than twice the culture of everybody else.<br />

<br />
Normally I would agree with you. I too had an early Golden Age, initiated with the Great Pyramids in 1000BC. <br />
http://www.zachriel.com/gotm9/bc1000-Pyramids.htm<br />
<br />
The Golden Age did speed my research into mapmaking, allowing me to contact other civs, start a trading consortium, etc. However, I didn't have any techs for any buildings in Thebes. I was actually using my extra production to build -- warriors!<br />
<br />
Well, that situation had its own consequences. First every town and hamlet had two veteran warriors for garrison. Second, I upgraded all those warriors to sword when the time neared for war against Japan. It actually worked out quite well, but it was rather ironic (painful) to have Thebes producing warriors right after completing the Great Pyramids. :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MPF</div><div class="date">Jul 31, 2002, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the first time I played the GOTM. First game on emperor level for that matter as well. I've read the threads and wow do some get a big score. I managed to rack up just over 6000 (my best score up to now). The threads do give some clues about their gameplay but still leaves some questions. I'll start off with some tips (well bugs in the game actually)<br />
<br />
1. When early in the game (before battlefield medicine) when your units strength is down load them in a ship sail into youre own territory and behold next turn they are completely healed. Works faster even then bringing them to youre own city to heal. Worked wonders while invading Japan in GOTM IX.<br />
2. There is a way to battle culture flip with the more inland cities (those not in the front line that is). Just remove all units out of the city and park them just right next to them. Build improvements and when the city generates enough culture put them back. I did this playing some civ III games before GOTM and somehow the AI refuses to flip the city when nobody is home :p <br />
<br />
And now for the questions:<br />
I always thought you should give your cities room to grow In general I give them a 5x5 square. I now see maps which have a city density twice and some times 3 times what I am used to. Is this always a better tactic? How does this effect the creation of specialists? I had cities 30-35 big with a lot of specialists but what if the city density is bigger how does that work out?<br />
<br />
Mostly I do battle with the government form I happen to have when the war breakes out (republic or democratie). Is it wiser to switch to other forms like communisme? (I just hate the turns of anarchie in between).<br />
<br />
I noticed that police stations do battle corruption but not tile loss due to corruption. Is there anything else that helps (beside the obvious like building courthouse). I sometimes relocate my palace (strange that the palace can be relocated but the second palace can't) but its a lot of waste of prodcution and shields.<br />

<br />
With scoring, getting to the domination point quickly is the first key. It's the fastest way to increase how many points per turn you are earning. After that, by having a dense build of cities, those cities can grow quicker and use more of the available land earlier in the game. For instance, it's better to have 4 cities working 5 tiles each than have 1 city working 10 tiles. Later in the game, you can thin those cities out, cause it's best at the end to have fewer cities so you get the advantage of irrigation and railroad on as many tiles as possible, rather than wasting the potential by having a city center on the tile.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps answer some of your questions.<br />

&quot;With scoring, getting to the domination point quickly is the first key. It's the fastest way to increase how many points per turn you are earning.&quot;<br />

Two thirds of the total land and coast tiles.<br />
<br />
You don't want to trigger the domination but you want to get close to it ,to maximize the points you receive for controlling those land and coast tiles.<br />

<br />
Looks like this has been a fun GOTM! Nice settings to result in a different set of challenges. Slow research considering the difficulty level, and it played out a few different ways. Sorry I couldn't take a run at it. I hope I'll be able to get back into things with GOTM10, don't know yet...</div></div><hr />

Lawrence thx, read through the posted links. Not sure I will use all the tactics. It might give a big score but it seems a bit less fun. I prefer a more natural style of play. Thx anyway.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even come close. Work and other commitments took to much time. Ended in 1500 AD with my my own island, the 3 islands to the NE and the japanese island expect the south strip. I guess I was about 5 turns from exterminating Japan. I just managed to get to first position on the histograph with about 2050 points. <br />
<br />
I was very satisfied with my progress. Normally I never play archipelago cause I hate the ferrying. I built heaps of galleys and settlers this time and managed to grab a lot of land and resources. Especially the resources turned out to be great moneymakers, other civs payed almost 400gp a turn for them. Definitely gonna use this in my future games.  I missed out on building the pyramids, great lighthouse and great library. Every time i was only a few turns away from finishing it. So I ended up with some very expensive marketplaces and libraries :(<br />
<br />
Don't feel like finishing the game so I'm gonna dl the 1.29 patch and try the gotm X. Regent lvl and 31 full days! Sounds like a possible finish.</div></div><hr />

In my haste to re-arrange cities for better utilization of land I accidently triggered the domination limit.  I forgot to remove one of the mountainous cities:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Oh well.  My final score was 10002 by domination in 1926AD.  I think I could have ended up with a score over 14000 if not for this.  My cities were just starting to explode with growth (Longevity wonder)  and would have been at maximum in another 20 to 40 turns.</div></div><hr />

I agree that an early GA is an excellent way to catch up to the AI at a point when it often has the greatest advantage.  But you didn't have to trigger it early if you didn't want to.  Couldn't you have built the Lighthouse and Library - triggering nothing - and continued with your original domination strategy?<br />
<br />
MPF,<br />
<br />
To comment on your question about city size from a perspective other than maximizing score:<br />
<br />
Limiting the size of your cities helps early, because they secure your borders faster, and are easier to defend, needing fewer connecting roads.  They also generate more culture with a temple, and often more productivity.  If your goal is a culture or domination win, then there's not much upside to maximizing each city's acreage.  On the other hand, if you're playing the space race, and therefore need to get through most of the tech tree, larger cities produce thelarge number of late-game beakers you'll need.<br />
<br />
Fighting in republic is pretty easy if you don't get bogged down in a stalemate (if you do, that's your mistake, not being in republic).  Democracy is tougher for war, but not that hard if you have enough luxuries and plan your wars efficiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nbarclay</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I watched Japan grow in size and culture, with probably the best starting position in the game, I decided I had two choices.  Either I could play second fiddle for most of the game, or I could swallow up Japan and make its large, well-shaped empire a part of my own.  Guess which I chose, especially with Japan not having any iron to build pikemen?<br />
<br />
I hadn't built any cities on the Japanese continent at the time the war started, but I had found a small niche in the northeastern corner where Japanese culture had not yet taken hold.  Unit after unit built up in that cultural no man's land, including warrior-upgraded swordsmen, a few spearmen, and the war chariots and horsemen that had started to become so popular once Horse Island started sending back its magnificent animals.  Then I struck.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, even with fast units, wars can easily bog down fighting a major power on a large map.  I had to switch over from Republic to Monarchy long before the war was over, which limited my research potential.  (Not that I wasn't the world's technological leader, but as a Republic in a golden age, my lead would have been more than just marginal.)  During the war, I used two leaders to build Leonardo's and an army, but then I got a real scare when I couldn't seem to get a third leader to build my forbidden palace.  Finally, after conquering the Japanese mainland, I loaded up practically every elite unit I had and landed on the island to the southeast.  At long last, my third leader emerged and I could make peace.<br />
<br />
The only problem was that the peace didn't last.  One of my cities culture flipped back to Japan, and that pushed me into finishing the Japanese off.  No problem, right?  Except that much to my surprise, my magnificent republic exhibited massive war weariness even in my core cities from the beginning of the new war.  That strange phenomenon occurred in spite of having been a Monarchy through most of the original war and of having had somewhere around ten turns of peace before the fighting resumed.  To avoid switching governments, I had to boost my luxury rate so high that research ground to a screeching halt.  Definitely not good, especially since Japan built a new city just after I finished what had been their last one and then had another settler after that.  (Their remaining cities were all on Dye Island, if I'm remembering its identity correctly, to the east.)<br />
<br />
At that point, I still harbored some dreams of attacking someone with cavalry before Nationalism became a factor.  But such was not to be.  The tech race was too close moving toward the industrial era.  In the meantime, Persia and Germany had declared war on me, and I found myself having a really interesting time on occasion trying to defend some of my lesser cities.  One totally corrupt town fell to Germany temporarily.  On another occasion, I had to bring in reinforcements from Japan to thwart a German attack on Horse Island (fortunately, I had a galley perfectly positioned for the job), and on still another, I decided to sacrifice a war chariot to delay an invading Rifleman until I could upgrade some units to cavalry and bring them in for the kill.  (But my general had other plans and decided to win the battle instead. :) )  During that war, I brought in America and the Aztecs as allies, most likely hastening the Aztecs' doom.<br />
<br />
After I made peace and started full-scale trading for luxuries again, I interrupted that game to play the first &quot;Apolyton University&quot; game.  Then when I got back to the GOTM, there was little enough time left that I decided to go for a space race victory.  (It had been something of a toss-up; part of me liked the idea of a peaceful finish, but another part wanted to really punish Persia and Germany.)  With both my own continent and Japan's, plus two islands to the east, my research ran in high gear through the industrial and modern eras.<br />
<br />
Once I got Computers and Fission, I brought the three remaining powers (Germany, America, and Persia) into the modern age and even stopped squeezing them for new gold payments.  Quick deals got me Ecology and Rocketry (thanks to Germany's and Persia's scientific natures), but in spite of my efforts, the AIs never provided any additional help.  I determined that uranium and aluminum were both serious danger areas since I had only one supply of each, so I pillaged my own supplies and finished off the initial modern tech trading by arranging imports in exchange for my technology.<br />
<br />
Not long after those trades, Persia and then Germany went to war with America, one of the reasons for the negligible AI research in the modern age.  Fortunately, no one wanted to add me to their list of enemies, so the only real damage was the loss of my American silk supply when the Germans razed the border city it came from.  Part of me really wanted to punish Germany, but I settled for giving America free rubber and later, as the game was winding down, selling them Synthetic Fibers for a song.  Since Germany had neither oil nor rubber, they could have found themselves quite unhappy had the game lasted longer, especially since Persia had already made peace.<br />
<br />
My launch date for Alpha Centauri was 1640, almost a century later than SirPleb's magnificent showing last month.  I'll be interested to see how my performance compares, especially given the difficulty of maintaining a high late-game research rate without conquest on this particular map.  My score wasn't too much below 7000, and blew away my best previous score.  (Then again, this is probably the first high-level game I've ever actually finished on a large map.)<br />

Of course I could do so. But Pyramids are extremly useful, saving 60 shields and 1gpt in every early city and giving a quick start for any new settlements. I was prepared for the GA. All worked tiles had at least 2 shields and 2 commerce and the hill tiles where all mined giving 3 shields under despotism.</div></div><hr />

Playing my usual peaceful expansion style with stakes on 6 islands gained without war. I was surprised I kept up with AI expansion at emperor! Nice. Have learnt much.<br />
Played till 1415AD but then got dragged into war, ran out of time and commited ritual Kurt Cobain suicide again.<br />
Aiming for highest conquest defeat again ;)<br />
<br />
Gory Details:<br />
<br />
100% science until 1250BC when maintenance costs exceed income from barb camps.<br />
Squeezed in an early temple in 2400BC, which gave me a cultural lead into the ADs. <br />
330BC I see Japanese borders but seeing unclaimed islands, sacrifice early contact for faster expansion into those islands.<br />
150AD Japanese attack (by ramming the body of a single warrior into my spear) since my expansion will soon overtake theirs. <br />
The logical thing to do. I out-expand Japanese on barbell island, with 6 cities to his 2.<br />
260AD FP completed due to early construction. The location is non-optimal (in Elephantine) but it was the best location for a city not totally corrupt. I plan a palace shift later seeing new lands to NE. This was never accomplished. I realised Palace takes 1000 shields to build! Is this a bug?! Civilopedia puts it as 100.<br />
270AD Great Lighthouse completed in Memphis just as Japanese galley gives chase 1 square behind mine.<br />
280AD Trigger golden age just before I sign peace with Japanese. I take this opportunity to build courthouses since corruption will go thro the roof later.<br />
290AD Exploration skyrockets with Great Lighthouse and I achieve first contact with Persians. They are much more advanced but smaller and have less culture. Obtain first contact with small Aztecs. They are behind in everything. I have 15 settlers at this point. This is about 1/3 my total pop. And I am not even playing ICS.<br />
330AD Contact with Germans and Americans. Aztecs catch up 7 techs in 1 turn upon meeting them, with 0 gold to spare! WTF? I am now about 2 techs behind again. I have the most cities but am only 4th in land area since I used a relatively dense build in the jungle island to NE. Only behind Japan in culture. 9 barb horses attack a city which I purposely left undefended. Lost 2 shields only <br />
420AD Discover Feudalism and catch up in tech in a massive trade. Switch government to Republic. The well-timed GA has tided me over to republic. Discover that Germany and America are at war.<br />
570AD I realise selling Feudalism was a mistake since America completed Sun Tzu's, beating me by 3 turns. I thought the AI wouldn't be able to build it in 20-40 turns without pre-building. I am forced to buy Invention from Persians for 900 gold to complete Leo's. I recoup 200 from Aztecs.<br />
650AD I have finished expanding into the NE islands on which the Japanese only managed to sneak in 5 cities. I begin expanding into the NW gaps to grab ivory.<br />
740AD Wonder race for Sistine begins. I investigate all 3 rivals and find myself in the lead but only 1 turn (~30 to completion) ahead of Richmond. Workers are sent to mine irrigated squares.<br />
940AD Time flies and income takes off as I switch to 0 science to catch up tech. Complete Copernicus by an old palace pre-build. Want to move palace to barbell island in NE.<br />
1000AD Minor city deposes to America. Spy on Persepolis building Bach and see that I am JUST behind, so give it to him.<br />
1020AD Ocean trade is finally possible and I catch up with tech again by trading luxuries. New islands to the N are discovered and I consider another crazy expansion phase even as some cities reach maturity and others constipate at pop 6. Enormous inflow of cash at 0 science, but still not enough to buy techs, rush buildings and rush expansion! Since it's the 29th of the month, I decide against expanding since it will only add to my territorial score and deprive the AI of some lands - they are too far away to be of much use, since at this point, I will be going for diplo or spaceship. Not much real-time left to play with.<br />
1090AD Could have led race for Smith, but lose it since I built a bank instead of pre-building. <br />
1100AD Another city deposes! Lose 5 workers to Japanese! I make sure everyone (except Aztecs) is dependent on my luxuries to deter invasion. My base island has been weakly or undefended since the start. (No sh*t)<br />
1230AD a few cities depose to Japanese/Persians/Americans. Acceptable losses. Could have been prevented by rushing culture in the right cities.<br />
1285AD My Newton's University, complete in 13 turns, got beaten by Persians by 5 turns! No spice on WM??<br />
1325AD Persia declares war because I forget to renew their luxuries! Bastards! <br />
1360AD Aztecs (!) declare too!!<br />
1370AD Germans (!) delcare too!! I get peace with Persia :rolleyes: Make sure they are sedated with luxuries <br />
1395AD Germans threaten my ivory seriously! I waste lots of gold rushing. My rifle attacks a pike and dies without even causing a single point of damage. My cavalry failed to take out a pike(!) and I was forced to MPP with Americans! This is all sounding very improbable. I definitely blame it on the random number generator :p Industrialization slowed due to war <br />
1405AD Germans keep coming and Americans declare on Germans. <br />
1410AD Dragged back to war with Aztecs due to Americans.<br />
1415AD War weariness skyrockets due to Aztec error (should have maintained war with them). Communism costs a bomb.<br />
I give up!!! It's midnight 2/8.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to include a map, but keep getting the message that I have included too many images in previous posts or my signature. What should I do?<br />
<br />
A retarded thing I noticed during the replay...The Aztecs built their 3rd city and then it disappeared and reappeared again 2 or 3 times!<br />
No message on capturing, so it must have starved to death! That probably explains their, um, somewhat undesired expansion rate.<br />
<br />
Entertaining game and learned a few things too:<br />
1. Peace is harder to maintain than war.<br />
2. AI are bastards (I already knew this, but this needs emphasizing again).<br />
3. See above.<br />
<br />
Achieving 2600 points at 1400AD ain't bad. My cows are dry ;)<br />

<br />
I've started most of the GOTMs; this is the first one I've completed!  It's mostly finding enough time to finish the game.  I usually do pretty well, but can't finish.  But not this month!  (Okay, I was done one hour late in my timezone; I hope Matrix will include my results, since I do find it so hard to even come close to finishing a game.)<br />
<br />
Quick synopsis: early barbarians delayed me a bit.  No early wonders.  Slightly behind the Japanese in colonizing the adjacent islands, but made up for it by sheer numbers of cities generated.<br />
<br />
3 wars with Japan.  First one, 400 to 800 AD, ended up with me owning all 3 of the adjacent islands (small, medium and large Jungle), 2 Japanese cities, my GA and my first Leader.  Second one from 1000 AD to mid 1200's; had to stop when other civs gave him Nationalism and my Cavalry were being stopped.  I now owned 5 Japanese cities, and founded two more in the spaces between.  3rd one started in 1700's, with large force of Tanks, Infantry and Artillery on my side.  Finally finished him off in 1806, :slay: one turn before I finished the UN.  (I didn't think I'd get his vote!)<br />
<br />
Built UN, called for Vote.  Germany: big trade partner with Egypt, never at war with Egypt, I got his vote.  Aztecs: nearly wiped out by Persia, I allowed 1 city on my large Jungle island, and gave him lots of stuff, I got his vote.  America: big trade partner with Egypt, however, he signed a MPP with Japan 3 turns before I finished Japan off, so we were at war.  He abstained.<br />
<br />
So, 3 votes for Egypt, 1 vote for Persia, 1 abstention.  Egypt Wins!:egypt: <br />
<br />
I guess if I previewed my post every few minutes, that might prevent the timeout.  Okay</div></div><hr />
