<br />
also, the lifespanian territory defines the major part of helenatica. due to this, most of the helenatican army and force as well as fame was defined by the lifespanian family.<br />
<br />
as an example, the curret heads of the lifespanian family are always also the rulers of helenatica (rulership of helenatica is defined by the tilecount a person owns inside helenatica). and most of the army is baught and maintained by them also.<br />
