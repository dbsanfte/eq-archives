well, again there are the french right beside you...soon you will discover the russians, another aggressive opponent, they already have 4 or 5 towns after a few turns...to make things even worse, the starting position is a joke ;-), if u cant manage to build a city in the west of the french, you can already quit this game :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 01, 2002, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having such a difficult starting area, along with new rules really makes the Ancient Era very interesting on this map.  It took me until about 500BC before I really figured out what I was doing without pop rushing!  Even then I kept getting into wars that I hadn't built up enough for, just out of habit ;)  That the game is on Monarch saved me though, if I had played this way on an Emperor game I might not have done too well.<br />
<br />
I started out building ICS style, there really wasn't room for anything else.  I kept tech at close to 100% for a change, but always seemed to be a turn or two behind.  I sent a couple Archers and a Spearman up to look around the French holdings, the French had popped some barbs on my 2 Scouts earlier.  I saw 2 French Workers unprotected, and so started the war.  One of the Workers became a colony on the Iron, and I had a Settler found a city on the nearest Horses.  Being Industrious was a godsend on this map, as building roads over the hills and mountains didn't take long.  I kept sending lone Swordsmen on the attack, really screwed up by not waiting to mass my troops.  Still I was able to carve out some territory for my Settlers who were following.  I couldn't take Paris at the time, so I just build several cities nearby and made peace.  The French and I were evenly matched, so no compensation was recieved for signing the treaty.  <br />
<br />
The Russians decided I should pay tribute to them about this time, the fools.  I sent several Swordsmen to take out their Iron supply, but other than capturing 1 city and razing another, nothing else happened the whole war.  I did get all the techs I had missed out on for signing peace with the Russians though, and a couple worthless cities which I just ended up gifting to the Japanese.  <br />
<br />
Then I turned my gaze back on the rich (relatively speaking) lands of the French.  My few remaining Russian expedition forces doubled back and combined with the newly produced Horsemen from the south, made short work of the remaining French cities.  I allowed the French to keep 1 isolated tundra city at least until Knights showed up.  Once I had finished, I switched to a Republic and disbanded all my Swordsmen.  Only 3 Horsemen had survived the fighting (I hadn't produced many), and I kept them around to upgrade later.  I found it was faster and cheaper to not do any researching, just buying up techs everyone else had already.<br />
<br />
Once I had Chivalry, I returned to the warpath.  I held back until I had 5 Knights, and then started taking Russian cities.  I cut off their Iron very quickly, and only had to fight 1 Knight of theirs because of it.  During the fighting, Washington made his appearance, and when Dallas was founded near where Moscow had been, the Forbidden Palace was rushed.  I also disbanded Washington (my capitol, not my leader!) about this time, and the Palace jumped to the city I wanted it to (my only one over size 3 at the time).  This city was right next to Paris, and finally my empire was productive.<br />
<br />
I had mapped out most of the World by now, and was the first to make contact with any of the others.  The Egyptians were well behind, but I sold their contact around for a few techs and world maps.  The next turn they had caught up (at least 5 techs) even though they had no visable income, at least that they would offer to me for the same tech.  I renegotiated some peace treaties, hoping I had enough of a power lead to demand some cities.  I did get a couple, but they were pop rushed into oblivion previously by the AI, and so I gave most of them right back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 01, 2002, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After banishing the Russians to a few scattered tundra cities, I started looking for a new target.  The Aztecs were being obnoxious, demanding tribute (27 gold... haha), but they had Saltpeter hooked up, and I didn't want to fight against Musketmen with my Knights very much.  After trading maps, I noticed that the Egyptians hadn't hooked up any Saltpeter yet, and only had 1 source of Iron.  I built a few Caravels and started ferrying my troops across.  The Egyptians had settled 2 of the larger Islands, and one of them had Saltpeter, the city near it was my first target.  The Egyptians ferried their entire offensive force over to try and retake the city, and after slaughtering their War Chariot and Archer landing force, I decided to try and take their main isle.<br />
<br />
The Egyptian Culture was a little more than my own, and I figured there would be a lot of flipping going on.  Cities never seem to flip the turn after they have been captured, so I just moved all of my units out after each city was taken, and waited for the flip to happen again.  A couple cities I was able to supress, and started rushing settlers to fill in the gaps.  I took 3 of the Egyptians Wonder cities, including their capitol.  Overall I had to retake a city because of culture flipping about 10 times, but after I had taken out their Iron source, they only got Spearmen, and they were easily retaken.  I made peace, and recieved one of the cities I had passed up.  After quickly quelling all the resistors, I plan on rushing settlers until each of the former Egyptian cities is down to size 1.   <br />
<br />
And thats where I stand right now..  I own about 1/2 of the worlds non tundra landmass at about 1200AD.  I am a couple of techs behind the Greeks, but they don't have any Saltpeter... it's only a matter of time :lol:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that might've been the key. There's a semi-chokepoint, but you still have the Russians to contend with. I did manage to build 3 cities. Washington, New York (on the desert spot to the north, right by the iron resource. The Russians and French must've known about it! And Russia turned the city against me! :)), and Boston on the southern most point. Washington put up a very good 500+ year defensive battle, including a great leader to build a colossus (I was hoping for a WLKD).<br />
BTW, here's the scores:<br />
<br />
Russia: 6292 (The cheaters!!! :crazyeyes )<br />
Japan: 440<br />
Eygpt: 416<br />
France: 284<br />
Greece: 220<br />
America: 148</div></div><hr />

This is my first venture into Monarchy mode. What was everyone's strategy? It seems when I built New York on that one desert square to the north-west, everyone was after it!<br />
<br />
BTW, how do you successfully pop rush? And, how much time do you spend per turn? Or, atleast up to 10AD? I played about an hour up to 70 AD, when my defenses were finally breeched.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what I did wrong though. I had a good (I think) infrastructure, but by the time I researched Iron, the Russians had captured New York, and thus taking my only strategic resource, iron!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 02, 2002, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ICS stands for Infinite City Sprawl (or some other choice S words).  Basically it is placing cities very close together.<br />
<br />
The Russians were quite agressive on this map, I was able to get several Swordsmen and a few Horsemen produced before they demanded tribute though.  I just fought a defensive war for the most part, keeping to the high ground, and cutting off their own Iron supply was key.<br />
<br />
I only pop rushed 2 times in this game, both were temples in corrupt cities.  With the 1.17f rules, pop rushing anything else isn't worthwhile, unless an extra unit or two is needed desperately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 02, 2002, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Greeks were able to get Nationalism the turn I landed about 25 Cavalry on their Island.  I decided to withdraw the troops and instead target the Japanese.  The Japanese had a handful of Musketmen, but I quickly took out their Saltpeter source and then blitzed through the rest of their holdings.  I was able to hold most of their cities, as their capitol ended up being on the other side of the map after I took their original one.<br />
<br />
I was tempted to try and take out the Greeks afterwards, but I was worried about triggering domination, and didn't have any troops on my main islands.  A counterattack could have been devastating.  I wanted to switch to a Democracy, to speed up my workers who were laying down rails at the time.  I waited in Republic until I could buid the Theory of Evolution though, I didn't have enough of a lead on the Greeks to try a revolution before then.  Everyone Hates me, even the Greeks who have been my allies in several wars.  I guess news of my lack of integrity has spread ;)  I definitely need to get the UN, but with the tech lead I have now that should be no problem.<br />
<br />
My coastal cities keep expanding their borders, and it was making me worry about domination a lot.  So I gave 6 cities I had on one island to the Japanese, who were down to 1 city at the time.  It shouldn't help them much, as their capitol is about halfway across the map on another island.<br />
<br />
It's 1766 now, I think I'll shoot for a Cultural victory, should be able to get it before 2050 comes around.  I've been rushing temples and libraries like mad for about 20 turns.  I'll most likely have to raze at least a few Greek cities to do it though, their culture is still about even with mine.</div></div><hr />

i have now been battling the russians in the desert for over an hour we both keep sending in swordman turn after turn. The rest of the world are far more advanced and expansive.

Man that was a nice move, but I don't think it's allowed in the GOTM.<br />
My Washington was in the worst place geographically I can<br />
think of.  I quickly defeated the French and got a leader which used for the great library.  The russians declared war and<br />
stalemated me (I took Minsk once with an army but they<br />
attacked and destroyed it!).  The land sucked so much I <br />
fell more and more behind, last time I looked my score was at<br />
560 and Eqypt is over 1000.  I think you definitely need to beat<br />
the russians and get the FP in their land.</div></div><hr />

Green is allowed.<br />
Red is disallowed.<br />
Black is in discussion.<br />
<br />
Any bugs or exploits not in this list should be mentioned. Also, feel free to discuss the current list. The list should be final when the GOTM V commences.<br />
<br />
Please note that these rules are applicible for version 1.17f!<br />
<br />
Free palace jump<br />
When disbanding your capitol your palace will appear in the biggest other city. Your former capitol can be rebuilt by the settler it created. This way you've moved you capitol free.<br />
<br />
It is allowed, and especially on this map can make a huge difference.  I hadn't built any Wonders in Washington because I planned to do this from the moment I saw the French lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 02, 2002, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd think the AI would learn (figure of speach, I know they never will).  About 1850 the Greeks got uppity and demanded a few gold from me.  What they hoped to gain will be forever beyond me, maybe they just were sick of &quot;milking&quot; their score and wanted out!  I payed the gold, but plotted my revenge.<br />
<br />
I signed a ROP with the Greeks, and moved about 3-10 Modern Armor next to each of 15 of their cities.  I demanded that they give me all their gold, luxuries, and cities, but they decided to fight for it instead.  I thought it was a pretty fair offer, seeing as they didn't have any Tanks yet.  2 turns later it was all over, and the Greeks were no more.<br />
<br />
Then it was just 50 turns of fixing things up, and another 100 waiting for Culture to hit.  I timed it for 2050.  I couldn't have gotten 100,000 culture before about 2020, and the last 30 turns only took about 5 minutes anyways.  Nothing of note happened for the last 100 years.  The Japanese kept demanding tribute even though I was gifting them 7 luxuries.   And a barbarian Horseman actually took a hitpoint out of one of my Modern Armors that was fortified on a hill.  Other than that it was 'J', Shift-c*4, Space. <br />
<br />
That was one good thing about these settings, almost no pollution problems due to population.  Really speeded up the end game.  I'll hold off on submitting until Matrix gets GOTM4 submissions all sorted out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillChin</div><div class="date">Mar 02, 2002, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is 510 A.D. and I got the world map, and the first war is over. <br />
<br />
I build the capital on top of one of the incense icons to get a gold boost at the cost of some food.  I start with a warrior and then a granary.  The granary may have been a mistake.  I vascillate on attacking the French.  I decide to wait until their cities get culture so they will not burn when I conquer them.  Around 10 B.C. my forces are massed two squares from Paris, a big stack of about 15 units.<br />
<br />
Two turns before I want to go, the Russians attack,  f***!  There goes my invasion plan.  Instead I ally and get Right of Passage with the French.  The Russians sacked a French city very early in the game and Joan remembers.  She is eager to go, despite only having about four cities.<br />
<br />
The war goes well, though the Russian cities are worthless.  I hope for a leader, but do not get one.  The war last about 50 turns, I get everything the Russians have in the peace treaty.  I give one of my worthless junk cities to Joan.  Joan is poised to go ahead and take out the last Russian city to complete her revenge.  The Greeks declare war on France, but are so far away they can not accomplish much.  Without a Forbidden Palace all the captured Russian cities are one shield cities.  200 turns to try and build a Forbidden Palace?  I think not.<br />
<br />
I may stay in Despotism and turn my troops on Japan next.  Changing governments will probably make things worse.  The Japanese extorted some stuff from me while my army was in Russia.  Japan's proximity to my capital may make their cities more useful.  I may try to jump Japan before they can build many Samarai.  It is tough because my production economy is dismal despite having a large nation.<br />
<br />
I am tempted to disband the capital and somehow make it jump to the Moscow area, but it seems too risky for something that I have never done.  What if I miscalculate and it only jumps a few squares?<br />
<br />
I am second in the rankings.  Egypt is first.  My borders are relatively secure, if I can keep France on good terms.  I could turn my troops on France, but I am the loyal and vengeful sort.  After Russia attacked me, there was no way they could be allowed to survive, plans or no plans.  France was a decent ally in the first war.</div></div><hr />

In my game chilvary wasn´t discovered by anybody! Never seen this before...<br />
<br />
Got a golden age around 200AD because I had built the Pyramids (using my only GL) and the Colossus.<br />
<br />
Destroyed the Frensh early (&quot;everyone who destroyed the frensh early cheated&quot; :D )and went westwards to the Russians. Managed to conquer Moscow an some satelite cities. But then my conquest stoped - gunpowder was invented stopping my swordsmen quickly. I made peace and built some border defences with musketmen.. In the meantime I started to explore the map and got a settler down to the three spice. At that point I controlled gems, incense and spices.<br />
<br />
<br />
Got rich by selling all the iron, coal, gems, incense and spices. Got a lot of friends too.<br />
<br />
After a while the russians declared war (stupid fools :crazyeyes ) and were taken from the gameboard using some cavalry. Who were easy to produce. No one discovered chivalry so the only &quot;horse-unit&quot; were horsemen. I pumped out many, discovered military tradition and upgraded them.<br />
Seems to be a cheap way to get cavalry in the late game if you decide to use swordsmen for the early conquest.<br />
<br />
<br />
1770s: Last turn the Egyptians declared war against me. I was able to get everybody involved so we´ll give them a hard time. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
... and get pummeled.<br />
<br />
At least reading through it seems that I made a lot of the right choices.  I built New York pretty quickly next to the iron resource.  I tried to attack Paris, but some bad rolls meant I couldn't finish it off, and the French started to expand.  I had to make peace once our twice while I regrouped to keep them off me.  By the time I was ready to launch another offensive, the Russians my scout discovered started demanding tribute, they were far ahead, and declared war when I refused.  Their armies eventually took New York and marched to the capital.<br />
<br />
My biggest mistake?  Underestimating the devastation of a pop rush.  I used them one too many teams and ended up at one point with a Washington that was permanently unhappy and not growing.  Didn't even know that could happen until this game!  So between some bad rolls and handcuffing myself, it's no wonder I lost.<br />
<br />
Also, I had not played at this age before, and was totally not experienced in dealing with massivem ountains and hills.  I expected a greater growth curve.  Ah well, it was fun, and seeing that other people were also around my 172 score makes me not feel QUITE so bad...<br />

Is the map always that hard?? <br />
<br />
No, it is not always this hard.  This is my third GOTM (Jan, Feb, Mar), and this map is harder than the first two.  The only successful stories are from a few veteran players that often dominate the top score list.  Everyone else seems to be having a very hard time.  <br />
<br />
I think this map illustrates how starting position often means as much as difficulty level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't think it would work but I tried it anyway; I walked my first settler and worker all the way to just south of Paris.  Joan then had no choice but to build her second city on the tundra to the north.  Meanwhile, I'm building nothing but archers.  I get four of them (in retrospect three would have worked) and I seize Paris.  I then use the remaining archers to fend of the 4-5 warrior counterattack.  Joan decides she's had enough and sues for peace.  All thats left of France is one of those perennial (until Harbors at least) size two cities, so I can pretty much dispatch France at will; I don't, I decided to keep them around for a couple techs.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Russia is demanding gold and being a pain.  I found a city on a hill for the upcoming war; This pays off as the Russians are unable to take my hilltop, swordsmen defended city.  I sue for peace and get it for the low price of 60 gold, and start building horsemen, lots and lots of horsemen.  Said horsemen eventually rampage throughout the Russian Empire.  France inexplicably declares war and promptly ceases to exist.  Russia sues for peace and gets it for the high price of all of their techs, gold and all but three of their (worthless tundra) cities.  <br />
<br />
At this point I start building infrastructure, Moscow gets an FP and the whole former Russian territories are now the most productive area of the empire.  I manage to swipe a few wonders, since Moscow has so many wonderful hills and the floodplains neccessary to support a large population.  I race to cavalry, with the intention of taking out the Egyptians, but they hit Riflemen like two turns before the troops land, so I use this force to steal Spice island from the Greeks.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much where I stand right now.  I'm still lusting after the luxuries of Egypt, but the tech race is pretty tight so I may just shoot for Space Race win; after all how can I lose: I'm pretty much the Russians and the Americans :cool: :cool: :cool:</div></div><hr />

so the egyptian is left with 3 cities in a lousy south east of the island i just took over. the greeks control half of the island which they started with the japanese and the spice islands. and one other island west of spice island. <br />
<br />
do i rebuild all those resisting egyptian cities and play out till 2050 before flying a space ship, or do i sent all those modern armour and take out greek's main cities and try to win by domination or conquest if possible? which would get me more points? all those corruption and quick build is making my treasury low, i wont be able to build those egyptian cities should i decide to attack the greeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as I saw the French north of me, I knew they had to be destroyed quickly. Found the iron resource just north of me, then geared up my whole strategy to utilise it, 'cos the Frenchies didn't have one. Russia started demanding things damn early - I appeased them at first.<br />
<br />
Then just as I built my city next to the iron resource - pow - it disappears! Bummer! Another one appears in the far North East of the continent - trouble is, the Frenchies have blocked the route with a new city.<br />
<br />
Sod it, with one last throw of the dice, I build a few archers (not enough I thought), and started a war against the French anyway. Lo and behold, a couple of quick cities captured, and the tide has turned.<br />
<br />
I've now defeated the French, gearing up to take on the Russkies, and I'm probably level on techs with everybody.<br />
<br />
The key seems to be taking out the French early, then getting to that choke point west of the French starting position to stop the Russkies.</div></div><hr />

Play it out.<br />
<br />
Someone (SirPleb?) has calculated that you must have an early vic (~1500AD) to get more bonus than the score for playing it out.<br />
<br />
You didn´t enter the modern age that early, did you?<br />
<br />
About the Spaceship: If you are looking for a bonus-medal don´t go for the spaceship. Most people will go for it or the UN at this map. Being the best of a bunch of people will be hard, so try to get a cultural vic (if possible) or a late domination or conquest.</div></div><hr />

With a lot more time on my hands I plan to finish and submit again.<br />
<br />
Crappy starting position and I make a mistake of starting reserarch with bronze working and forgetting to change to the wheel. Last month the swordsmen proved to be useless pretty soon so I want to build the horsemen again. Switch to wheel and discover horsies west of france. BUild my first city SW of Paris skipping the the desert/hills spot many used because I dont know thats where the iron is. This turns out to be lucky. Build city SE of Paris on the horses and start roading to Washington. When my horsemen invasion army is ready and marching towards Paris the Russians demand trib, I refuse, they declare war. Joan was already warring them so we join forces and after a short war Russia makes peace for a few techs. Time to take out france. France is pretty easy to take out because my early cities have blocked her expansion possibilities. <br />
<br />
Next is mighty Russia. They have a tech lead (I'm going all cash) and iron, but no horses. I take and build a few cities in the neck of the continent and make peace for a few techs again. Still no leader -&gt; no FP -&gt; no production. I declare war on Russia without invading and start picking of Cathies troops form my cities, until BINGO leader. BUild FP in a city just SE of Moscow and production soares. Meanwhile Knights make their appearance and I quickly finish of Russia getting techs and contact with all other civs in the process. <br />
<br />
After finishing Russia I switch to republic and plan to develop my continent first so I can get back in the tech race. I should have known better :) After a few years other civs start demanding iron although I'm more powerfull. I refuse and end up with major war with Egypt. So I sent over my cavalry and raze a city but when I want to raze a few more it turns out Cleo has already built infantry :( Too strong for my lousy cavalry. Cleo won't talk and civil unrest is rising. I decide I'm not going down into anarchy alone and start alliances with Japan and Greece for iron. This turns out to be a major turning point for my good. <br />
<br />
Cleo can't handle a 3 front war and makes peace with me. Japan and Greece are furious but I'm back on the happy development path. After a few turns the others make peace too and Greece and Japan sign a MPP.  I'm startled but happy when Japan starts a new war with Egypt immediately after signing the Mpp :) :) :) A few years later  Japan is a monarchy again, Greece and EGypt are communist. I start exporting luxuries for crazy amounts, buy all the techs I'm behind and get filthy rich. <br />
<br />
It's in the 1800 now. I have a substantial tech lead (4-6 techs) and I have just landed my tanks on  Japans continent. I have high hopes for this piece of land since its furtile and close to washington.  I want to avoid domination so I plan on taking the patr of Greece thats on the same island as japan and razing the rest of greece and egypt.  <br />
<br />
Great game so far but I don't think my score will be any close to the top. My guess is the winner will be someone who's taken Japan early in the game getting much better production and less AI tech trading. As far as the map is concerned, my compliments to Matrix. The starting location made it a challenge and the proximity of all the islands minimized the troop ferrying. Great work!<br />

i tried last months GOTM but got soundly thrashed, i was a huge fan of civ and civ2 but civ3 the higher difficulty are just too hard for me<br />
this months GOTM i fared better<br />
i quite like the diffuculty, enuff to keep me on my toes all map<br />
anyway i built the first city on start point and immediately buil a road on the incense for happyiness<br />
i build warriors and go exploring<br />
i find a settler on a goody hut north east of paris, heheh in about 3650BC, this should give me the edge<br />
i dont build since the terrain is tundra<br />
i walk and build a city southwest of paris next to the sea and a cow resource<br />
paris are quite peaceful and we trade a few techs until i get iron working and iron appears on the road btween my cities<br />
frnace moves in to build a city there<br />
war is inevitable<br />
ill report back soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chinese_rider</div><div class="date">Mar 04, 2002, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first GOTM, and darn, the map is BAD.<br />
I bulit my capital right at the starting point, and my scout travel north. Found Paris and the furtile land SW from it. Surprisingly, French built their second city NE of Paris, so my first settler travel all the way up to build NewYork. I saved my money, and bought Iron Working from French. When my settler form Washington was going to claim the IRON, my scout found that French settler was moving to the same direction. My scout and warrior slowed them down a bit, and woola, Boston is settled next to the IRON source, which prove to be the most important event in the early game. Also to my surprise, that French settler did not claim the horse, in stead settled north of it. While she is waiting for the culture to expand the boarder, my settler build my forth city right on the horse.<br />
After all that, French is still polit to me, and Russia, right from the beginning, is annoying to me. While I am building my Swordman trying to take over French, Russia demanded tribute and declared war. My war effort now is on Russia. My swordman is moving toward Moscow to deny their IRON source. When I arrived there, to my surprise, it is not connected. Giving AI the credit, it has 2 Archer on the hilltop. My swordman easily claim the Iron hill, and from there on, the game is over. Although Russia sends hords and hords Archers(all her city is pop_rushed to one or two), but they are no match to my swordman. I razed all the city I captured from Ruusia, and bringing my own settlers. After razing Moscow and got a great leader, I realize that French is ferrying her settlers to the newly unoccupied land. I signed the peace treaty with Russia, got all the teach, money and one city. I then used my force to block the French settlers, and repopulated the furtile land with my leader rushing FP in the city where former Moscow was.<br />
I found Japan, Greece and Egypt, and sold all the techs to them with good money(especially Egypt, who is backwards in tech, but high on culture). What surprise me again is except Japan knows Greece, no one talked to each other. That helped a lot to slow down the tech progressing, and also my tech brokering. There is one French city bordering with one Japanese city, and still, they do not know each other.<br />
After 20 turns, my swordman struck again and Russia is history. I gathered my all victorious troup towards French, moment after expiration of my two luxury export to French, I struck. French is in disorder due to lack of luxury and in republic. I captured Paris with Pyramid in the first turn, and swept through France. I signed a peace treaty with them because I still need her tech. I got everything and France now has one city on tundra.<br />
Another surprise is that all the other three Civs are now annoying or cautious to me, even though I did not break any treaty during the war, and they  do not even know Russia and France anyway.<br />
But no matter, they will be destroyed soon.<br />
My next target is japan....<br />
<br />
Footnote: some AI stupudity makes this game easier. Claiming the IRON and horse, building the second city on grassland, Russia not connecting IRON, and no communication between AIs are doing me a huge favor. This makes the tough map not too tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AndyS</div><div class="date">Mar 04, 2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first GOTM and I thought it was kind of funny that my previous game I had a similar situation.  The city starting position was much better and the game settings were more favorable, but I was essentially in a starting position where the closest civ's capital was close to cutting my civ into two pieces.  In that game, I tried to expand past the civ and got cut off, only to die slowly (no growth, lots of corruption, isolated capital + 1 other city, etc).  Strange that the civ that cut me in two didn't do the killing.  I got invaded by two civs almost simultaneously, one on each 'half'.<br />
<br />
Anyway, once I started this game I saw that expansion to the west was the only possibility since north was tundra.  I found Paris quickly and built up some warriors with the intention of just fortifying on key production tiles next to the city so it couldn't grow and cut me off.  After the French sent a unit to attack and failed, I tried to test the waters and attack Paris itself.  I failed on the first attempt, but damaged the defender on the second and killed him on the third.  I was surprised after the fact that the French attacked me with one of the two defenders of the city, because I only had to defeat one to conquer it (seems kinda silly).<br />
<br />
Once I got Paris, I expanded west a little and then north into the tundra.  The French got a settler away on a ship and currently has two cities on the same continent, but in Russian territory.  I got a bunch of techs from them but I'm still behind.  I'm having trouble tech brokering, as I can't seem to find a tech that one has that the others don't.  I haven't yet gotten trade routes to the other civs so I can't sell them my resources yet.  Russia just declared war and I'm heading over to try to cut off their iron.  Luckily, when I got peace from the French, I demanded a world map and they already had on from the Russians.<br />
<br />
We'll see how it goes from here.  Like I said before, this is my first GOTM (although I played last months just for fun and didn't finish or submit since I started too late).  Thanks to Matrix for organizing it and I'm looking forward to future challenges.<br />

<br />
The key point in my loss was the AI attacking and killing 3 swordsmen plus an army of swordsman, all fortified in a city on a hill.  The army had 7 of 11 hps left.  I don't think the AI would have done this in  the 1.16 patch.</div></div><hr />

No room to expand, settlers keep getting killed by barbarians, etc.  I restarted just for fun, trying to rush to Map Making and sending a bunch of settlers to the other continent, but I saw that the AI got way ahead in tech before I got Map Making.  Then I gave up again.<br />
<br />
This is my 2nd consecutive GOTM of giving up.  I have only actually won 1 of them, #3 I think (the Chinese one).<br />

Oh well, back to my other slightly easier game.  I'll wait for the next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Mar 04, 2002, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like this map, just because it made me laugh when I finally began to see it all. All the other civs given idyllic starting conditions with plenty of room to expand while the player is crammed onto a tiny worthless peninsula surrounded by other civs with nowhere to go. Someone was having fun at our expense (Matrix...)<br />
<br />
My game has been pretty bad so far. I very much doubt that I'll be able to win this one. Scout finds the Frenchies very early - close enough that one of us is going to have to go very soon. I send the first two warriors up to Paris to deal with Joan immediately and finally. I stole their worker and got their warrior in the field to kill himself by attacking my warrior fortified on a hill. Then 2 turns later it was my two warriors against Joan's only remaining unit, a fortified warrior in Paris. The odds of winning this are about 70%, but I got unlucky and lost. The next two units I built were killed in a &quot;massive barbarian uprising&quot; just outside my territory (I mean RIGHT outside it). Not to mention them pillaging all my tile improvements. It got bad - I had to whip a spearman in my capital to avoid losing it to the French. :mad: :mad: <br />
<br />
Fast forward a while, to the point where I finally was about to kill the French. It was murder recovering from the bad luck I had earlier. I managed to find the other civs first and trade up to tech parity, and felt like I was finally going to stand a chance. Then the Russians declare war. No, I never had a chance to get to their iron because I was in the process of finishing off the French. That was bad, but I killed &quot;the stack&quot; of swordsmen in my chokepoint city and held off all their attempts to take it. I could deal with the Russians, even though they're 5 times my size. But they got the Japanese to declare war on me, and now this last turn the Greeks declared war too. I was actually laughing at the game tonight: no one will talk to me, trade with me, or ally with me and here the rest of the world is ganging up to take me out. Did this happen in other people's games? If I could have taken Paris in 3000BC like I set myself up to do I would have been able to deal with the Russians and everyone else wouldn't have jumped all over me. Yeah, a better player could probably have avoided my situation. But I do feel like I was dealt a bad hand from Lady Luck in my combat results this time.<br />
<br />
Edit: Some other players here are reporting much different results from the AI. They never contacted each other in some games? Didn't go for the iron in some games? All of the civs traded like crazy in my game, allied against me, and refused to talk to me. Me versus the world - isn't that what 1.17 is like now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">senecasax</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2002, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this is an interesting map, to say the least. Its 600 A.D. and the entire world hates me. Here's the gist:<br />
<br />
Built capital first turn, sent scout north. Expanded south first (different than most) got new york asap. Met the french (wow they have all those techs already!?) sold em pottery. Continued to expand, met the russians, traded techs a bit. No war on the horizon - yet. Managed to get a french and russian worker out of trades early on - this was a godsend. Started colossus in N.Y. - got it done 1050 b.c. ish - really helped my science. Built Boston on desert patch by the iron - got that cattle. Built atlanta next to horsie. Around this time the french are all pissy and decide that they want to fight me. Also i end up meeting the japs, and etc etc end up with world map and a few techs. French are easily beat up w/ swordsmen, but still haven't found that GL (i NEVER get them, just bad luck i guess). Took lyons, build philadelpha in its place (west of iron). France gives me everything for peace (all gold +2 g/turn, all techs). Russia wants some tribute now, i say no way, they say war. So my 6 swordsmen i used against the french are now defending philly and startin south. Manage a war of words with the russians for awhile, uneasy peace. I sit on my arse for awhile, buildin up - workin on a settler for that nice gems spot. By now its 300 ad or so, changing to monarchy soon - this mighta been a mistake. Cities start pumpin out swordsmen while egypt allys with russia against me.  By the way, Greece and France both decide to join em (and i lose my fur route with france - boo hiss). So now everyone but japan hates me and I CANT even sign a military alliance with japan?! is there somethin that allows the ai to ally even though I can't? it doesn't appear as an option! So egypt and greece send in galleys with warriors on em - ooh scary - warriors die fast, but STILL NO GL. Wonders are bein built all over the place by the AI - and THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE WAR AMONG EM! Paris builds Great Library - i figure this is the only way i'll be able to catch up in tech - so I go after em full force - capture paris, destroy orleans. Russians runnin up my arse now with lotsa swordsmen - they capture philadelpha (w/ 3 spearmen defending!!), thankfully i have pikemen now for def. Chivlary on the way but - 36 TURNS! my science is pitiful now at a measly 20% and i'm still losin gold. tryin to get some more cities started northward but kinda hard when the world hates you. Oh by the way Japan decides that I'm a nice target to attack, and declares war on me as well. So heres how it stands:<br />
<br />
Me<br />
<br />
vs.<br />
<br />
Remants of France (1 city, almost dead)<br />
The Russian Bear (they got lotsa cities!)<br />
Egypt (no biggy a.t.m. as their warriors die when they land.)<br />
Greece (see egypt)<br />
Japan - (not sure what they got to attack me yet haven't seen any forces)<br />
<br />
Does the AI ever fight with itself! Man i could do with a war between Russia and Egypt or something right now! Why do they all hate me!! Its 600 AD and I hope to God that I survive this russian onslaught. <br />
<br />
Couple mistakes I made that made a lot of difference:<br />
Switchin to monarchy - still not sure if this was a good idea - i get an additional military police, but still...<br />
<br />
Not Killing France when I had the chance - but then again i now got the great library, prolly never woulda had it if i didn't<br />
<br />
Building New York south instead of north. Still not sure but prolly shoudla.<br />
<br />
Wondering if i'll survive to 1000 AD....<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Sulla - I sympathize w/ ya. This time around the AI hates me just as much as they hate you. Isn't it great to feel loved?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2002, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The AI has a tendancy to try and gang up on who they feel is the weakest Civ.  With the starting position how it was, that's going to be the player in many cases.  I never had Alliances formed against me in this game, because I was quickly near the head of the pack in number of cities and units.  Signing alliances is possible, but the AI looks at the relative strengths of the civs to determine the cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I built New York south, along with 1 other city at the start.  This gave me 3 productive cities quickly with at least some growth potential (all 3 ended up size 9-14).  All of the city sites to the north were either poor food areas, or far enough away that corruption was a big issue until a Forbidden Palace (or in my case, a Palace jump) could be built.</div></div><hr />

You need the Writing tech for that option to appear. My guess is you don't have it yet and the AI has.<br />

My game is going pretty ok. killed the japs yesterday and declared<br />
myself ruler of the northern hemisphere :)<br />
<br />
Healed my tanks and decided to wait untill synth fibers (bout 10 turns) to upgrade them to modern armor. So I get synt fibers, upgrade my tanks and try to get a ROP with greece. They refuse, so I tell em to remove their sorry infantry from my territory and they declare war 8) :) :) I just dont get that stupid AI, I'm at his front door with about 70 modern armor, he only has 40 infantry and 15 cavalry! So  I grab old greece and ship my troops to the Alexendars colonies on spice island. I'm almost done razing them. <br />
<br />
Cleo will definitely be next. She's asking tribute but her army is more pitifull than greece's. <br />

BTW I didn't find any goody huts on this map and read only post of someone who did find one. Was my scout slow or was this map low on em?<br />

<br />
1) Peace with Russia at ruinous prices - treasury and 10g/turn :mad: <br />
<br />
2) Destruction of France (finally!) in 420AD :cool: <br />
<br />
3) I had one city on the Greek mainland which I had founded to get the silks near the coast. The Greeks had been attacking it with archers, but every turn my elite spearmen would heal up in the barracks I put there. Well after about 10 turns of this, I get a GREAT LEADER! [party] :D :goodjob: :bday: [party]<br />
<br />
Thank you Washington! Only problem was I had no way to get him back to the mainland - and the Japanese and the Greeks are massing for an attack with way too many guys. So - whip a galley in the closest city (my defending city is size 1 and can't be whipped). Sign another ruinous peace with the Japanese to prevent capture of city - but Greeks won't talk! Can I hold out for 2 more turns? Ggggggggggggggghhhhh!<br />
<br />
I get Washington out, and the city falls on the next turn :eek: Now I have a Forbidden Palace at Paris, a decent amout of land, and finally peace with all other civs. Trading luxuries is a godsend - it's the only way I've stayed caught up on tech. The AI civs are actually up to &quot;annoyed&quot; with me thanks to the luxuries I'm sending them. I can't believe it, but I managed to survive.<br />
<br />
The lesson must be to keep going and not give up no matter how bad things seem. I was about to quit this game several times but kept going on, and now might actually be able to get a win. :king:</div></div><hr />

I got a settler from a goody hut far east of Paris.  I may have gotten two other huts, but got nothing memorable.  The Russians also have a scout so they probably took all the huts on their side pretty early.  The free settler helps a lot, as always.<br />
<br />
My game is to about 1100 A.D.  Production of units is painfully slow without a Forbidden Palace and the capital still on the peninsula.  I was planning a palace jump but then I read the thread about a jump going to some other city than the one with the highest population.  I will win my game, but my advantage is not what I want it to be after fighting three wars (Russia, Japan, France).  Japan and France still have a few cities, and Paris flipped back to the French.  I am waiting for 20 turns of peace to expire before retaking Paris.</div></div><hr />

Greece and Japan still have not met Egypt YET! From the world map of Greece using my luxury trade ( I do not want them to know my world map), both Greece and Japan started to settle on the land between them and Egypt. Also Egypt has the lighthouse, but I have not seen ONE boat from her. That is a surprise for me, but works for me.<br />
The barbarian from the northern tundra of former Russia land is poping up like crazy. This redirected some of my swordsman into that area before I can populate over there. Since I have a big treasury, I really do not want my city raided, especially most of the new cities with only one spearman on duty. <br />
Now everyone except Egypt reached middle age, and I think Japan will soon get pikeman. Since Egypt does not have IRON and horse, I may direct my force to them when I get the knight. And they have a very high culture, so get rid of them earlier may save a lot of flipping later.<br />

It is 1360 AD and I have been fighting the Russians for longer than I can remember to get some salt and pepper.  I had one of them but as soon as I got gunpowder, it was exhausted the same turn.  Anyway, I have been fighting them and about 4 times I ran low on reserves so I made peace and got some techs.  Then I broke the agreement within a few turns and started war again.  I don't usually do this since it ruins my reputation, but I had no choice.  I had to get salt and pepper or I was going to get clobbered by someone.<br />
<br />
I finally broke through the choke point near Moscow and captured the city (which has salt and pepper right next to it).  I have been paying off everyone to keep away from me so I could throw everything I had at Moscow turn after turn.  Wouldn't you know it, but the turn right after I captured the city, I discovered a new salt and pepper source next to one of my larger cities in the middle of my territory.  :mad: :mad: :mad: :mad: :mad:</div></div><hr />

In my game chilvary wasn´t discovered by anybody! Never seen this before... <br />
<br />
This has occured in my game too. The civs have been researching far, far ahead on the tech tree (up to Banking last, I think) but no one has researched chivalry. I will get it in 10 turns (even though I've been going min science for the last 40 turns) at which point in time my horsemen will become knights and crush the Russians. They don't have any saltpeter for muskets, so you can imagine what's going to happen... :goodjob: <br />
<br />
Maybe then I can get out of last place on the histograph! I won't have a good score when I win (eventually), but I'll be proud just to say I won this one.</div></div><hr />

Finally, my economy is producing.  Before I did the jump, I build the Forbidden Palace just west of old Washington to help my conquered Japanese cities.  I switch to Republic--eight turns of Anarchy :p  The French have four cities.  I let them live.  I may roll over them when I get Calvary.<br />
<br />
That's the good news.  The bad news is both Egypt and Greece are big and powerful.  Both have Nationalism and Steam Power, and I am still researching Military Tradition.  They both skipped Chivalry and Military Tradition.  Egypt and Greece have a Mutual Protection Pact.  I may try for some kind of peaceful victory.  Sigh.  <br />
<br />
If I can get a stack of 30+ Calvary I may go for it, but I have to get them in place before Infantry shows up.  Even 30 Calvary will be whittle down to nothing after taking five or six cities defended by Riflemen, and both Egypt and Greece each have about 15 cities and the MPP.  Sounds like peace is a better option.<br />
<br />
I am glad we did not get this map on Emperor level, or I could be a lot of trouble at this point in the game.</div></div><hr />

French managed to build by the iron and horses too damn quickly (I am surprised other players got to the iron first without knowing where it was).<br />

Nevertheless killed the French, but the time and effort was too great and the Russians attacked me to death over the next 3000 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexti</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2002, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After the first scout move I realized that starting spot is just too small (might be acceptable on tiny map, but not on small). So I've headed north. Mountains and hills, hills and mountains, time is ticking away and I still have no cities. Finally, I discover french, furs and cattle on the same turn. I build the capital and soon see Paris two squares away. After building couple of warriors I have to go for temple to &quot;culturally&quot; steal some land from french.<br />
Few moves to the west and I meet Russians, who promptly declare war on me and send an invasion army of one warrior. I easily defeat it and asks for peace (I have french to fight), but russians want 80 golds. I build second city just to the west and another settler travels south to build a city on original starting spot. Still nobody sends armies, russian still want 80 golds and I still don't want to give them. After building dozen archers I capture Paris and another [useless] french city, but lose too much units and war stalls. I have to make peace with french and finally pay to russians. With 3 useful cities I build some more archers, make quick raid on russian razing one city and quickly build 2 more cities of my own. Now I am established, but my initial move to the north means that I don't have iron. French and russians have it and they have swordsmen too. I build dozen more archers and take iron away from french. Soon I capture their remaining 2 cities as well (neither of them is of much use) though french somehow appear on the very south west tip of the continent. Now I can build swordsmen and attack Russians. I have good relationship with other nations, but Russian managed to secure some alliances and soon I am fighting vs Russians, Egyptians, Greeks and French at the same time. However, I destory small egyptian force that landed on my continent, Greeks never bothered to send army, French are weak and far, so I quicky invade major Russian cities, but despite all these wars I still can't get GL which is definitely needed to make any use of Russian cities. War lasts well beyond the point I would like to, but I really need that leader. Finally I get him, quickly make peace with everybody, egyptian and greeks are again polite toward me (I gave them some luxuries and techs for free). FP is rushed in Moscow and empire is growing.<br />
Now it's around 700AD and I own most of the continent. I suppose the game is already decided, now I need to decide whether to go for quick domination or develop empire for the high score or just stop playing.<br />

One good thing about the GOTM though: since you know everyone else has the same bad luck, you can press on.  Not like trying for HoF games at all.<br />
<br />
I killed the french as soon as possible (300BC or so) by doing nothing but building archers and more archers.  Then expanded for a bit, until I began to have border clashes with the russians.  So we had a war that ended in me razing three of their cities and taking Minsk, essentially bottling them up.<br />
<br />
At this point, I had an army and many swordsmen, so I shipped them all over to attack the japanese.  Took 4 Japanese cities, plus their capital.  Long time at peace followed.<br />
<br />
After I got cavalry, attacked the russians, razing two three more cities, including their capital.  Of course, the Greeks and Egyptians haven't had to go to war at all so far, and so are whipping my butt in score.  So I decide to switch to Democracy and go 100% money.  Raking in 300 to 600 gold per turn allows me to rapidly build my empire and buy all the tech I need.<br />
<br />
Soon egypt attacks russia.  Instead of joining them, I send in settlers behind their attacking force and take over as they raze russian cities.  Soon the greeks attack the japanese.  Since I was in a MPP, that means that I am at war again.  I stall until I get tanks, then take out the entire japanese civ (~8 cities) in several turns. Now, I build many tanks and waltz through what the egyptians have left of the russians.  <br />
<br />
It's 1926 now, and there are only three of us left.  I am third in score, but very rapidly catching up; first in tech; and I have the largest empire.  I am MPP'd with the greeks, which allows for some stability:  I'm not going to attack soon, the egyptians won't dare attack the two of us, and the greeks have nothing to gain by starting a fight with egypt.  I would start a war with my massive number of tanks, but I don't have any navy at all, except for some transports, and the egyptians have four carriers and twelve battleships, plus smaller stuff.  I'll be able to win this game, but I don't think that I can get a high enough score to win anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spork</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I saw the starting position, I knew my settler is going to have to go on a stoll before settling down. I initially went north behind my scout, and when I saw the cow south-west of Paris, I just knew I had to put Washington there.  I managed to settle before the Paris borders expanded, but I was so close that Paris still went right up to the city square. Luckily my scout met the Russians and they sold me ceremonial burial for cheap, so the very first thing I did in Washington is build a temple. Not long after that it was MY cultural borders that went right to the front door of Paris. For some reason, they only used a single warrior to defend it. I couldn't help myself; I just took it. Soon I had peace, and interestingly enough, the French couldn't even stay furious at me. Once Paris was mine, all they had was terrible terrain. Though I left them two cities, they were effectively dead before 3000BC.<br />
<br />
Getting naval quickly is a big advantage in this game.  I was shocked that Egypt stayed totally isolated until AD times--even though a simple galley could sail all the way there!<br />
<br />
Oh, and what's up with those sweet pastures south of Greece which they refuse to occupy? BTW, those guys are wusses!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillChin</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My game takes a nice turn.  It is now 1595 A.D.  I finish off the French with Calvary.  I bribe the Greeks into a MPP.  I send a single Longbowman against Egypt.  Greeks declares war on Egypt, despite having a MPP with Egypt as well.  I lack the forces to invade Egypt, and their navy is bombarding my improvements, but just starting the war is mission accomplished.  It looks like clear sailing from here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squiggy</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, it seems like everybody else is having trouble with the Russians, but I guess I got lucky.<br />
<br />
Having found the French right away (as there was only one way to explore), I quickly sent two warriors and captured Paris before they could found Orleans. They respawned in the eastern part of the continent and promptly started a war with the Russians. By the time I made contact with Catherine, she was down to only 4 or 5 cities. I watch the Russian cities fall one by one until they are down to three. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I expand northeast and then then southeast, forming a large nation, second only to Egypt on the histograph. I build up an army of about 10 swordsmen and grab Kiev and Minsk from the Russians, then sue for peace as I am getting technologically behind, leaving Russia with only the capital of St. Petersburg. (Moscow is under French control.) It's currently about 1000 AD and everybody's about halfway through the Middle Ages - It looks like a technologically fast game.<br />
<br />
I plan to get the rest of the world to turn against Russia, then I'll be revered as a hero when I take their last city. Conquest of France may lie in the future, but I will hold off on that until I can better evaluate their military strength.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spotski</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first post and first time playing this game above Chieftain level.  It's 1600AD and I'm still in the game, but about 2 techs behind Russia/Japan/Egpyt/Greece - the latter two having entered the modern era.  Even the Japanese who are slightly behind me on points (and friendly) are ahead on wonders and tech.  The AI is just a prick with respect to trading.<br />
<br />
The French got pasted from the Russians early on, and I grabbed a couple of cities, but after fighting a brief war have been appeasing them for centuries it seems.<br />
<br />
I've got a couple of cities on Spice Island with the Greeks, and rushed a harbour to bring in Iron and Saltpetre. <br />
<br />
I know I'm going to get crushed soon, and can't find a way to move up the tech ladder.<br />
<br />
Anybody got any clues?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm finished too! I had a good game this month, the approach I took turned out very well.<br />
<br />
In summary, with the advantage of hindsight, the key elements of the game as I played it were:<br />
1) Careful management of the start position to squeeze every possible crumb from it.<br />
2) A long initial build up to produce as many Horsemen as possible with the available resources.<br />
3) Built a number of temples early to get a cultural lead. This was important because I wanted to capture towns later, not raze them. Razing requires settlers, and resources seemed too limited to produce them. High culture would allow capturing instead of razing.<br />
4) Built up a big cash reserve. No research after some initial techs. Early exploration and carefully managed trade between the other tribes supplemented the income produced while not-researching. Buying slightly old techs was cheap (often just traded maps.)<br />
5) As soon as other tribes had learned the prerequisites for Chivalry I bought those and researched Chivalry at top speed. Then I used the big cash reserve I'd built to upgrade the previous Horsemen production into Knights. I.e. I used the money to leverage the 30-shield Horsemen into 70-shield Knights, effectively doubling military production up to that date.<br />
6) Sent the Knights on a Crusade before anyone could prepare for them. American culture far overshadowed everyone but Egypt. The Knights swept through one tribe after another, capturing towns. They greatly exceeded my expectations! After each victory, enough remained (with meager additions from the homeland) to continue the crusade to another tribe's land.<br />
<br />
At the start of the game I produced some Swordsmen and Horsemen, and waged a war which nearly eliminated France. Losses during that war were high, especially when compared with early America's production. I didn't want to attack Russia the same way, losses would be even higher. That's when I started working on the approach which eventually developed as described above.<br />
<br />
In the Crusade, I drove each tribe out of its homeland, giving them peace only when their government had fled to an island. First Russia, then Greece, then Japan, capturing all of their towns. Finally the crusade continued even to Egypt, razing the towns there because of their high culture. When the crusade finally ended after Egypt, I decided to play the game out for a cultural win. The date at that time was already well past a time when an early win bonus could outweigh playing it out.<br />
<br />
Although the start position was very resource poor, the good thing about this map in the long run was that no tribe had a good start. France, Russia, and Egypt had slightly better starts than America but far from good ones. Japan had nice land but it needed irrigation and they had no water. Greece had a very nice bit of land but they developed it slowly. I suspect that their land was initially all jungle and that this delayed their start. If Greece were allowed time to build I think they could become a very strong rival on this map.<br />
<br />
The rest of this note is a more detailed diary in case anyone is interested:<br />
<br />
I settled Washington on the incense NW of the start position.<br />
<br />
After the first bit of scouting I concluded that the start was very resource poor. Shield production would never be high. The best initial build seemed to me to be 3 towns south and east of Washington and 5 hill towns. (I actually ended up building 6, adding a forest town NE of the hills.) The towns near Washington would be on the 3 points of land. The one south of Washington would require a temple before it could utilize the whales. The hill towns would each reach a maximum size of two, working two hill tiles.<br />
<br />
Building this many towns would be difficult because of our limited food supply. So the first thing I built in Washington was a granary. Micro-management of the 10 tiles which could produce 2 food each, between the four southern towns, was important for a long time.<br />
<br />
I rushed improvements at critical times. When a town's happiness and current task permitted, and all food tiles were fully utilized (the town was not growing) I rushed something. Temples. (I decided fairly early that eventually capturing rival towns would be important. There was little capacity for building settlers for a raze and replace approach. So I built some early temples to get a culture lead.) Barracks in the hill towns. (A barracks costs 40 shields. A rush gets 39. The 2nd tile worked by a hill town got 20 shields in 20 turns. A size 1 hill town regrows to size 2 in 20 turns. So rushing a barracks at the right instant saves 19 shields.)<br />
<br />
The scout got a settler from a goody hut east of France. The land there was barren so I sent the settler home to help the buildup there.<br />
<br />
My research began with Alphabet. (I started on the sea-faring research path before realizing we were not alone on our land.) After Alphabet I switched to Bronze Working because the French were nearby, defense might be important. After that Ceremonial Burial because I wanted temples. Then I traded for Warrior Code and researched Iron Working - the terrain suggested that iron would be easier to find than horses. After learning Iron Working I saw iron in the hills. France did not yet know Iron Working so I didn't trade it of course - it was possible to secure the iron first with one of my early settlers. I started research on The Wheel. After discovering The Wheel (1750BC) I saw the nearby horses in one of the intended hill town tiles. Of course that became a priority for an early settler. After The Wheel I researched Writing and then Map Making. After that I traded a bit, getting Horseback Riding in one of the deals. That was it for research. After that I did little research for quite a while. (None at all that I remember until Chivalry.)<br />
<br />
After learning Map Making I built a galley and it quickly discovered Japan. I bought her maps to find out where Greece was. (Didn't trade my maps nor buy contact with Greece.) The galley sailed on to Greece and established contact there. Since I had seen no other galleys exploring yet, I held back the contact between France/Russia and Japan/Greece for some time. During this time I controlled the trading of maps, profiting a bit from each exchange. My galleys contined to explore, discovering more of the world and then selling this knowledge for gold and tech. I eventually sold the tribes contact with each other. Hadn't seen another galley, but did not want to lose the opportunity to profit by the exchange. My galleys discovered Egypt. It was fortunate they'd been isolated - they were the strongest tribe, but technically backward due to their isolation. For some time I eeked out technology to Egypt for the highest prices they could pay. And continued to profit from my advanced maps with all tribes. Eventually I also sold contact between Egypt and the other tribes.<br />
<br />
During the time of exploration, about 250BC, my first army of 8 Swordsmen and 8 Horsemen (all veterans) attacked France. The war was brief and decisive, we took all French towns except a young one north of Russia. But it was an expensive war, costing a number of our units.<br />
<br />
After this war I made the most important decision of the game: I did not attack Russia. Losses in battle were too high compared with our ability to produce new units. I redoubled the efforts to produce Horsemen and stockpiled them. I waited for other tribes to discover the prerequisite advances for Chivalry. During this time I built up the treasury as described above. (Zero research, exploring, trading.) When the required techs finally became available I had a reserve of about 2000 gold! I traded for the latest techs and set research on Chivalry at 100%. When we learned Chivalry I had about 30 Horsemen, and enough money to upgrade 21 of them to Knights.<br />
<br />
Then began the Great Crusade!<br />
<br />
The 21 Knights (followed by more as additional Horsemen could be upgraded, and the occasional new one as towns very slowly produced them) sliced through Russia. Only 5 Knights were lost in this invasion. We captured the Great Library, which quickly revealed three techs and made itself obsolete.<br />
<br />
I granted Russia peace after driving her off the continent, leaving her with just some island towns. As before with France, I captured all towns instead of razing. I began the occupation of each town by starving the population to one, using some of them to build a temple when there were enough. I brought a settler with the Knights to create a new town for our Forbidden Palace. But the war created no Great Leader. (Paris continued on its very slow build of a Forbidden Palace as the backup plan, just in case. Fortunately that was never needed, that project was eventually abandoned.)<br />
<br />
Our Knights remain strong and want to continue their crusade. Greece has the finest land in the world. If we do not attack soon I expect she will grow to become the strongest tribe. Now is the time to strike. Our culture overshadows Greece, we should be able to capture towns and keep them again. The Knights return to Washington and are ferried to Egypt. (7 Galleys were ready at this point.)<br />
<br />
The first wave of 14 Knights slices through the Greek defenses. Regular Hoplites crumble before elite Knights. More Knights follow the vanguard. A few Knights remain to guard the home continent. These guards amuse themselves by capturing the remaining French towns - France is no more.<br />
<br />
When Greece has been driven entirely off its homeland I give it peace for some island towns and tech. Losses during this crusade were very light, just a few Knights.<br />
<br />
Near the end of the crusade against Greece a Great Leader emerged. (At last! It took nearly 40 wins by elite units before this, our first leader, appeared.) I settle Las Vegas in the center of the prime Greek lands and build Forbidden Palace there. (The gods suggested this town be named Buffalo. I could not bring myself to agree with that choice for the new cultural center of our world. :))<br />
<br />
At this point I decided to play out the game. The date was already too advanced for me to prefer an early win bonus.<br />
<br />
Japan had recently learned Chivalry. I decided to attack before she could produce many Samurai. The Knights regrouped and began this crusade. They encountered only two Samurai, but these were costly encounters - four Knights died subduing those two fierce fighters. Other losses were light (two Knights I think) and Japan was driven out of her homeland. I gave peace when the Japanese government fled to an island town. Our elites won 16 more battles but no new leader emerged.<br />
<br />
I switched to Monarchy at this point. After rushing temples in some captured Japanese towns it was time to put the whip away, to allow Las Vegas to truly blossom.<br />
 <br />
I did not expect the Knights to carry their crusade even this far, but a strong core of elite units remains! Egypt's culture is as high as ours and she is growing rapidly in strength. I have slowed her research a bit over time by selling luxuries to her at high prices. Egypt does not have Saltpeter nor Horses. 13 Knights, almost all elite, continue the crusade to Egypt. This crusade has two objectives: 1) Weaken Egypt sufficiently to remove them as a long term threat. 2) Secure access to wines and ivory for our people. Two settlers travel with the Knights. A few more Knights will follow in a second wave.<br />
<br />
The first wave of Knights destroys Sun Tzu's in Egypt and then destroys their three strongest cities. A great leader emerged from the first fight. The settlers establish two towns and the Knights retreat there to heal. We lost only two Knights in this assault! After healing, the Knights continue the crusade. They seem unstoppable, razing town after town with few losses. Soon the Egyptians, like the Russians, Greeks, and Japanese before them, are driven completely out of their homeland and take refuge on an island. The crusading Knights again exceeded my expectations. I quickly produced some settlers to claim the now empty land.<br />
<br />
The first great leader from the crusade in Egypt returned to Las Vegas and built Copernicus's Observatory. Because we had already acquired (:)) the Pyramids from Japan, this caused a Golden Age to begin. Soon after building Copernicus's a third great leader emerged in Egypt. He, our last leader, went home to build Adam Smith's Trading.<br />
<br />
After driving Egypt out of its land I did some careful counting - did not want to trigger a Domination victory again! I decided to reorganize our holdings a bit, abandoning some bits of tundra in favor of the more fertile Egyptian lands. I decided to leave the remaining remnants of other tribes alone and to go for a cultural victory. The other tribes would be allowed to claim what they could in the remaining barren parts of the world.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the game was uneventful. After the Golden Age we became a Democracy. A long period of peace, prosperity, and growth followed. Las Vegas became the cultural, intellectual, and economic center of the world. Russia and Egypt had taken refuge on the same island and this eventually caused them to have a brief but inconclusive war. They grew a bit, settling small outposts elsewhere. Japan never recovered, she remained a single size two town on an island. Greece recovered best from our Knight's tender ministrations, eventually growing to take most of the two large SE islands. Amusingly, in 2048 Greece demanded that we supply her rubber. When I refused (not that it mattered in 2048 but I would not give in on principle) she declared war. She even convinced Japan to join her. Greece attacked one of our towns with about 5 Cavalry, who died in their senseless assault on our Mechanized Infantry. In my final 2049 save, America is at war with Japan and Greece. Although America's military is small, it is powerful, advanced, and has an airport network for high mobility. Suppressing the feeble Greek attempt at war would be trivial if the game were continued.<br />
<br />
In 2050 America won a cultural victory.</div></div><hr />

That is no mean feat - the starting position is horrendously bad and some advanced &quot;tricks&quot; of micromanaging were needed to overcome the starting position. No offense, but there is probably little you can do by now to win the game - it's just too late. If nothing else, try to get the UN and maybe, just maybe, if you haven't irritated the other civs much, you can win a diplomatic victory. It's worth a shot.</div></div><hr />

Totally peaceful! Apart from maybe a ten turn war with Russia which I was forced into by an ill judged MPP with France just after I'd got some cavalry.<br />
<br />
It's 1800 I'm about to get computers, Egypt have just started MP and UN, Russia just completed HD. What a map, there are only two rivers as far as I can see, both deep in Ruskie territory, Moscow and Kiev, no chance Golden age for me then! Resources, what resources?<br />
<br />
I've got about 10 cavalry, 20 Infantry, 2 artillery, 3 workers! (everything is developed!) 1 destroyer and three transports. In about 20 cities only three of which are over size 12. Oh yeh, one bomber.<br />
<br />
Got a foothold on the Japanese island where three cities have defected to me, one right next door to the Japanese capital.<br />
<br />
I've no oil, alumininum, or rubber! I got some footholds on Spice island (one Greek city defected within 2 or 3 turns of being built near a city with only a temple about as far from Washington as you can get!)<br />
<br />
I've survived by trade and dipolmacy, at least everyone is polite or gracious, but I think Egypt will get the UN first.<br />
<br />
I'd fight someone but who? The French were kicked out by Russia, they live on buying my Iron and Saltpeter every so often. The Japanese lands don't look worth the effort, no resources and one luxury I already have.<br />
<br />
The Russians, well they've been marching about 100 cossacks, infantry and workers through my lands to their northen (ex French, I re-settled Paris). I'm not about to take them on now am I?<br />
<br />
Greece, Egypt too far away (although neighbors on Spice Island, they have so little to take).<br />
<br />
Aztecs died before I'd even met them.<br />
<br />
And, normally I'm the one with troops coming out of my ears!<br />
<br />
Two mistakes really. One, not building the FP on my own continent, I was saving it for a better position. I normally play larger maps than this. Two, staying republic for about 100 turns too long. I only learnt today that the length of anarchy is partially dependant on empire size, the corruption/worker benefit of Democracy would have really helps some time ago. I'd held off, reasoning that there would be a war to fight sooner or later.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and the three stacks of 24 barbarian horsemen really made my day on Spice Island just as I settled it. Went for me as well, not the AI cities that were just colonizing, which then killed the camps for the money. Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
I'll finish this game, don't know I'll get a victory but I might be there or thereabouts.<br />
<br />
One more point. The French irrigated a desert square just west of those cows. Anyone know where the fresh water came from? And this was 1000 BC! Tell me Soren that this AI don't cheat!<br />
<br />
Worst moments? Paying the Egyptians a fortune for Oil I'd built the road to allow them to export through my harbour (rushed at high cost) only for it to dissapear with 5 turns and end up with the Russians. Who've got everything already! Paying the Egyptians an absolute fortune for Rocketry to find the Aluminium so's I could build my UU (how's that gonna win a victory for a Golden Age?) to discover there is none anywhere near me and no-ones selling. Surprise surprise.<br />
<br />
Best Moment. Reading this thread and seeing that y'all been having a fine old time of this one too! That Matrix is a sadist!</div></div><hr />

BTW, how do you successfully pop rush? And, how much time do you spend per turn? Or, atleast up to 10AD? I played about an hour up to 70 AD, when my defenses were finally breeched.<br />
I pop rushed very carefully in this game :) Some general rules I use for rushing (like all general rules there are excexptions, but these are pretty good):<br />
* I try to plan things so that the rush will be for as close to 39 shields as possible, while staying under that amount. Try never to rush 40 or more, build whatever is being worked on until &lt; 40 are required, then rush. One exception to this is when I want to quickly reduce population in a captured town.<br />
* Don't rush more than once per 40 turns. If you don't want to keep notes with dates as you go, you can check whether a town is ready again by comparing its happiness to what it ought to be, considering the luxuries and troops. Or if it has any unhappy citizens, click on them to see if they are still annoyed about your oppression. (Sometimes I move the military police out a step on a road, then check an unhappy citizen in the town to see its reasons, then move the police back in the same turn.) There are exceptions to this rule too but if you rush more often than once per 40 turns be very careful. :)<br />
<br />
About time per turn: do you mean you spent an hour total up to 70AD? Sad to confess, I'm sure I'd spent a lot longer than that before I got past 3600BC :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just concentrated on not pissing off anyone, working on trade and giving tribute where tribute is due.  The lack of wonders is an obvious issue, as other civs are &quot;disdainful&quot; of my culture, although I have built a few libraries/cathedrals.<br />
<br />
My cities are all too small to make building a wonder worthwhile.  I'm also frustrated with the lack of leaders, even after winning loads of battles.<br />

Might give the UN thing a go then.</div></div><hr />

I was about to crush the Russians with my army of knights when all of a sudden I notice Musketmen in their cities. &quot;But Russia doesn't have any saltpeter...&quot; oh wait, some just jumped into their territory for no reason. There goes the last 20 turns of strategic planning in a random blip. The fact that a few turns later horses appeared in Russia too, letting them build Cossacks later, did not make things better. In fact, Russia has been getting all manner of resources during this game; they went from having practically nothing to 2 or 3 of everything. Kind of frustrating - and they're still alive 500 years later (terrible city infrastructure but a ton of those Russian Cossacks. When I get tanks... :soldier: :soldier: ). <br />
<br />
I don't know how some of these games stayed peaceful. In mine the AI was aggressive both against me and against each other. They all declared war on Japan around 1300 and the feeding frenzy was on. Of course I jumped in and got almost all the land  :D  It's now about 1650, and I was prepping for war against Russia when out of the blue Egypt attacks me. And this when they were already fighting Greece! Looks like Cleo was going through the &quot;Crazy Catherine&quot; syndrome of random attacks. Her loss - now the whole world is against Egypt, which has been frankly crushing everyone else in culture. I was seriously worried they would win a cultural victory before 1900. Well, looks like they won't be around that long now :cool:  Thanks to Theory of Evolution, Wall Street, and finally a decent amount of territory, I am starting to pull away from the AI in tech. The fact that they keep wasting their money on pointless warmongering doesn't hurt either. I've got discoveries down to 5-6 turns at a profit, something unimaginable earlier. The key in this game, as in most Civ3 games, seems to be surviving until railroads; even with smallest territory I had the highest overall production of any civ. That and on this map you have to take out France early (this sounds like GOTM4...) If I had done that better (I lost a lot of battles I should have won against them), I might have gotten into the lead before the mid-industrial period.</div></div><hr />

I now have some hope of victory, although I haven't conquered a single Rusian city yet. I hope to deal a severe blow to my neighbours before they start pumping out cossacks..

<br />
No leaders for me.  Though, I am winning handily, it is 1725 A. D. now.  I took out the Russians first in a long and costly war.  The Russians attacked me despite my giving in to their outrageous demands.  For that they could not be allowed to live.<br />
<br />
I am in an end game with a long bitter war with Egypt, with Greece as my ally.  Everyone else is dead.  War Weariness is beginning to become a problem.  I am behind on tech as Egypt just built Theory of Evolution, but Egypt has to fight two enemies.  Victory is in sight, but my score is going to be average (like usual).</div></div><hr />

I did, and maan, it was UGLY! I built lots of settlers and was the first to make towns on the uninhabited islands, but I couldn't protect them from those stacks of 17 barbarian horsemen. All together, FIVE stacks attacked various outlying cities at a time when I had 2000 gold saved up from doing no science. I was at most two techs behind the lead, which I &quot;safely&quot; stole (hey, no reason to hand over my money to rivals), and the rest of the money just got taken by barbarians.

Ooh, that must really hurt :sad: Nice move using the money to steal some tech though :)<br />
<br />
FWIW I think there are number of ways to deal with barbarian camps and uprisings, a couple of which are quite effective.<br />
<br />
First a few things about how they behave:<br />
A) They only &quot;spawn&quot; in wild areas which are outside (I think with at least one additional tile between) any tribe's sphere of influence.<br />
B) In those wild areas they never spawn within &quot;sight&quot; of a military unit. <br />
C) I think that uprisings only start happening after a particular camp has been around for a while. I'm not sure of this but I haven't had an exception to it. It may even be that the longer the camp has been around, the higher the chance of uprisings from that camp.<br />
<br />
So, ways I can think of to deal with them are as follows. (The only really good ones I think are 4 and 5, the others are short term measures when necessary.)<br />
1) Just let it happen. This is not too painful when your treasury is low. In that case their damage appears to be limited to the town they hit. If your treasury is high letting them hit will really hurt, the little buggers know how much you have and take a percentage. Maybe there's a way to use it to advantage before they hit. (Like stealing tech, nice!)<br />
2) Try to defend the town. Generally not practical in Ancient Times. I'd try this only if they were going to hit a hill town, and I could rush walls in it, and I could get a few Spearmen there within a couple of moves.<br />
3) Get rid of the town. Give it to a rival. First drain it, e.g. rush a military unit or settler, sell improvements, and move any defender out of it, away from the barbarian uprising if you know where that is coming from.<br />
4) Stop barbarian camps from appearing. Place guards in the wild areas so that all territory is visible. Use hills and mountains to advantage for this of course. This is great when milking an end game.<br />
5) This last one is the best I think. Have a guard (or guards if it is large) patrol the wild area. In my experience, if the guard visits every part of the wilds every few turns, uprisings won't happen. Camps will appear but now they are revenue opportunities, 25 gold every time! Single barbarians may sneak past the guard so it is good to have a Spearman defender in the nearby town. If the wilds are near a core area, Horsemen make good patrol units. On a remote island I would prefer a Swordsman. Horsemen run a risk of being killed by a lucky barbarian. Replacing one at a remote outpost might take too long, better to use a stronger Swordsman unit there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once upon a time I had a tiny little empire overshadowed by the large and rich romans.  While travelling in the wild with a horseman, I ran across a huge stack of barbarians.  So I led them using my horseman as bait away from my town, and towards one the romans had just built.  It was most satisfying to see their bank account deflate rapidly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chiefpaco</div><div class="date">Mar 08, 2002, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just finished my first ever GOTM.  Just eeked out a victory over those Egyptians &amp; Russians.  A few games on Emporer 1.17f style sure prepared me for this tough affair.  Here are some of the &quot;highlights&quot;:<br />
<br />
I was lucky to have just beat out France for the early Horses &amp; Iron (if not, it would've been a quick defeat).  France was then resource-less &amp; a pushover for my mighty swordsmen &amp; horses.  <br />
<br />
In the meantime, Russia had pretty much soaked up the better half of our island &amp; right after the French war, declared war on me.  I was able to fend them off &amp; grab a city but my forces were not strong enough to fend off their longbows.  I did get 2 leaders from that war but had to beg for mercy.  Staying in despotism all along, I didn't see much of a need to switch because the land was so poor.  I grabbed some techs off the French for peace &amp; the rest came so cheaply.<br />
<br />
Leader #1: FP in Paris for a nice &amp; close production centre.  Leader #2 was used to rush Copernicus back in Washington.  Looking back, not sure how smart this was, but I already had the Hanging Gardens &amp; wanted to trigger a GA.  I switched from Despotism to Monarchy just before GAing.<br />
<br />
Where next?  I was tied for third with Japan behind Russia, Egypt, &amp; Greece.  I didn't want to mess with Russia &amp; their Cossack/potential GA.  So, staying in Monarchy while everyone else was Republic/Democracy, I sent a couple herds of cavalry off that surprisingly wiped up Japan before they could set up their riflemen.  I then decided to press my luck &amp; was able to take most of Greece's homeland with some help from a short War-Time economy.  <br />
<br />
So now that I was rapidly climbing to the top, I got a little too comfortable &amp; switched to Republic.  That was definitely a poor move.  Without a very great Palace/FP location, my research never really took off.  Russia &amp; Egypt were racing off to a spaceship victory.  I declared war on Russia &amp; got Egypt to join in to try to wreck them.  I razed Moscow which destroyed their spaceship &amp; Egypt switched to Communism for a while.  But that wouldn't hold them off for long so I rushed my spaceship along and finally won in 1912.<br />
<br />
My lessons &amp; observations from this game:<br />
- I made a big mistake early:  I first declared war when France asked me to leave their territory (I had no ROP).  That move hampered my relations with everyone else the rest of the game :(  Not recommended.  Perhaps you can safely start wars by declaring while none of your troops are in?<br />
<br />
- I had no Coal or Rubber of my own until taking it from the Japanese &amp; Greeks.  Even then, they were my only 1 source.  I was able to trade for some as Russia was kind enough and I had extra luxuries.  However, it was all fair - France had no resources in their short history &amp; Greece lived without iron for the longest time (good thing they had the Hoplite!).  Also, Egypt didn't have any saltpeter until the modern age!  Resources were definitely the key in this game.<br />
<br />
- I was able to keep some civs broke by getting gpt for extra luxuries &amp; resources.  I kept a 0% science &amp; luxury until the late Republic switch.  Using the Military Police, most of my cities were in WLKD &amp; were ok productive-wise.<br />
<br />
- I got pretty lucky wrt generating Leaders.  Though I never got to use my last one (generated in the Moscow razing) I did get those 2 early ones when I needed it.  Funny how they were only generated against Russia (something about America vs. Russia...).  But I was always wondering what my empire would look like if I moved my palace to Kyoto.<br />
<br />
- Absolutely 0 wars outside of my own meddling above.  Not sure why.  Pretty boring game, really.<br />
<br />
- A moderate effort on building culture meant that I kept most of the cities I captured.  Really handy as the Japanese &amp; Greek towns came fully stocked (esp the Japanese towns which were close enough to be rather productive)!<br />
<br />
- I think I would've been happier staying in Monarchy &amp; being a pest the rest of the game.  Then I could've launched a big enough assault against Russia &amp; Egypt to dominate better.  In the 1.17 games I've played, the AI has been harder to beat scientifically than militarily.<br />
<br />
- Not sure how you guys beat up on the Russians.  They had so much open land, all the resources, &amp; were a little out-of-reach for me.<br />
<br />
Edit: just thought of one more thing I did this game:<br />
<br />
- I built tons of coal plants for the first time since I didn't have any rivers for the Hoover or even Hydro plants.  Not bad at all.  Great production bonus &amp; a lot earlier than other plants.  Not much extra pollution as it went from about 2 to 4 per city &amp; had tons of workers (industrious, no less) with nothing else to do by this time.  I'd fully recommend them if you don't get Hoover.  Even if you are getting it, getting a few of these before would likely still save you some work.  Even if you want solar or nuclear down the road, get the coal - it'll save you work on building these, which come so late!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my game the Russians attacked me around 10 B.C., just as I was ready to war with the French.  I allied with the French and their 10+ archers helped a great deal in the war.  My war was long and bloody, lasting about 50 turns, but the progress was steady.  Two civs against one, almost always wins in the early game.<br />
<br />
SirPleb had the best plan, taking France early with swordsmen.  Saving his gold and building horsmen, and trading his way up to Chivalry then rush researching it.  Use the money to upgrade the Horsemen.  If you read his story, it is 21 Knights in the first wave and Russia never had a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radegast</div><div class="date">Mar 09, 2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finished, Space Race victory 1955 1653 points :(  (actually, Russia got a score in the 1800's so I didn't 'win' but I won. Can I count the Russian score instead?) <br />
<br />
Following on from previous post, inbetween I'd discoved that the Manhattan project was an Industrius wonder (Thanks Civfanatics!). So I got computers as quick as possible, begged stole and borrowed Fission and built Manhattan in the Capital. Now a late game Golden Age is a wonder to behold, even in my very weak global position. Got SETI, Apollo, Battlefield Medicine and half the spaceship finished before it was over. Also managed to build something of an army and some nuclear deterrent, not a lot but sufficient.<br />
<br />
With the extra money I'd negotiated Rubber, Oil and Aluminum but thanks to a war between Russia and Greece an unexploited Oil became free on the western southern island. Didn't last that long, had to go back begging to the Greeks for some more.<br />
<br />
Saw something I'd never seen before. One of my cities defects to the Russians, but the Russians didn't want it so I kept it! Got a library built there double quick after that!<br />
<br />
By the time the GA's over I still need supercondutor, ecology, synthetic fibres and the laser to complete the spaceship and post GA these are taking 6-8 turns to research. Egypt seems to be my main rival in the Space Race and they're the ones supplying me with Aluminium. Risky, if they pull the plug I'm shot.<br />
<br />
Now, Japan are weak but have been faithful allies for years. The French are very weak, and only cling on in the southern islands but have been faithful allies for even longer. But, Japan has some aluminium. And I've got ROP with Japan but Japan and France have an MPP. Sorry Mates! An assault on France will net me all of Spice Island (just about, the Russians have all but killed the Greek presence there). Japan will be forced to declare war, and guess what is sitting ouside 4 of their 5 remaining cities. You guessed it, my armies!<br />
<br />
Now, at this point its midnight, and my flatmate walks in with his girlfriend, a litre of vodka and various other stimulants and insist that I join them. Be rude not too! 2am they dissappear (wonder why that was?) so the war was progressed fueled by the best part of half a litre of vodka!<br />
<br />
Needless to say Japan and France cease to exist (well France has one city in the middle of Egyptian territory), I've got me Aluminium and Egypt ain't getting no luxuries from me no more. Nor saltpeter! I got a few elite mech infantry in the bargain but no leaders of course. This was the only war I'd fought (apart from the few turn involvement with Russian cossacks 400 years before). These three elites proved worth their weight in gold later!<br />
<br />
Throughout this Russia is supplying me with rubber for spices and 2 gold a turn, What a steal!<br />
<br />
Still, get to synthethtic fibres and kick start the three components with some ICBM prebuilds. St Loius, in the middle of Spice Island is kicking out 88 shields per turn! At one point this was a totally corrupt city, but the FP built at great length really paid off down there.<br />
<br />
The laser is looking at six seven turns to research so I set off a few MA , upgrade my tanks and sit back to wait for the victory.<br />
<br />
Nerve wracking wait though. Egypt is more or less on level terms but doesn't have synth fibres so I know I'm gonna be alright, and one turn after we get lasers we launch. Also haven't a clue about the Russians they are by far the biggest, they've got Hoover Dam and various other wonders so must be an industrial powerhouse. I don't wanna give them Synth Fibres either.<br />
<br />
Unusually for me, not every city has a barracks, so bearing in mind the peaceful nature of the game I shuffle things around for the upgrade.<br />
<br />
Russia demands Synth Fibres, I really don't want a war with two or three turns remaining so I give in to their demand. Bastards then attack! They take out and raze New Orleans, which replaced Paris and is now a size 20, 80 production powerhouse. They launch a massive assault on Seattle (down near the chokepoint) which we just manage to hold on too thanks to those 3 elite mechs from the Japanese war. We destroy wave one, capture Marseilles on the south side of the choke and form a line on and around the border fortifications built around Seattle some 50 years before.<br />
<br />
By the way, modern industrious work kick! I don't think I ever had more than 10 the whole game, and these were often sitting around idle waiting for pollution. I'm chopping down the forests in tundra and replanting it just for something to do!<br />
<br />
So now I can't replace any MA or Mech Inf, they've cut off the rubber and as they're the only ones with any to spare.........<br />
<br />
Fortunately, some are still in production just about to roll out of the factory (nice, Stalingrad reversed!). I ramp Science up to 90% to finish the laser in time and I've just enough cash to allow the other 10% to go into luxury spending to cover the war weariness. I bribe the others into declaring war on Russia, sell everything I've been denying Egypt and try to hold out. The one and only time I ever spent anything on Luxury.<br />
<br />
The other areas of the Empire are either safe, unimportant or have enough free troops to go on the counterattack.<br />
<br />
They nuked Seatlle! Took out half the army with that and the assault, but the wasteland slowed them down and that's as far as they got. But, it dropped the laser out another turn. More nerves as no way could I get a spy into Moscow.<br />
<br />
We retaliated, in spades. Nuked my 'own' city, so what, it was only Seattle (sorry Bill, if the ruskies didn't get you I will!). Recaptured it, took out and razed the northern chokepoint city (Sverdlosk) and split their Northern ex french lands to get rid of some the bombers that were carpet boming Boston and Philedelphia. (well six out of about fifteen but it helped.) This attack was another first, a 1HP MA took out the last defender, a desparate gamble if ever I made one. And justly so, they got promoted to elite for their pains. Me, I think they should have got a medal as well! We brought them back to Washington to get their just rewards from a grateful female population :D<br />
<br />
Dropped ICBM's on Moscow and Kiev and nuked the battlefleet cruising the southern ocean. Egypt finished that off for us, about the only thing they did. Still, thy didn't blame us for the retaliation though I was a little nervous. Probably because it wasn't first strike.<br />
<br />
Two turns later it's all over, I'd even overbuilt the last component for safety's sake.<br />
<br />
All in all I have to say one of the most enjoyable games I've played. So different from my usual style, this one actually felt like a race at the end. Thanks Matrix, I reckon it was the map that did it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're probably right.  My early army was mostly swordsmen and therefore not upgradeable (maybe a hangover from playing my last game as Persia).  Russia's longbows &amp; pikemen weren't too scared.<br />
<br />
PS, Radegast, your game sounds vaguely familiar to mine - without the crazy nuclear action :nuke: :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillChin</div><div class="date">Mar 10, 2002, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question for everyone: Did anyone see any high level barb units?  I only saw the usual warriors and horsemen even late into the game.  Did thay take that out when they took away armies from goody huts?  Or is it because most units require some resource?  No, spearmen and longbowmen should show up.   I guess they took it out.<br />
<br />
In my game the word of the day is backstab!  The effing Greeks raze one of my cities in 1808.  I have a Mutual Protection Pact and am on gracious terms with them!  What a crock.  <br />
<br />
It takes a while, but I am making them pay dearly.  A small detachment of two infantry and one Calvary cut off their rubber and pillage all the squares around their capital.  The Greeks lack bombarb units to chip away at my infantry.  I only have enough force to take two cities in the first war (Calvary vs. Infantry).  The second war with tanks (1862) is going much better.  Effing Greeks you will pay for your treachery.  This makes two games in a row that a Civ that I have a MPP with attacks me.<br />
<br />
I ally with Egypt (imagine that after I fought against them in the last war).  Egypt losses its tech lead as it changes to Communism to deal with the endless war weariness.  I am still in Republic and at 10% luxuries to help with the war weariness.  Bombers are coming on line soon, so the Greeks are not long for this world.</div></div><hr />

Then I turned my gaze back on the rich (relatively speaking) lands of the French.  My few remaining Russian expedition forces doubled back and combined with the newly produced Horsemen from the south, made short work of the remaining French cities.  I allowed the French to keep 1 isolated tundra city at least until Knights showed up.  Once I had finished, I switched to a Republic and disbanded all my Swordsmen.  Only 3 Horsemen had survived the fighting (I hadn't produced many), and I kept them around to upgrade later.  I found it was faster and cheaper to not do any researching, just buying up techs everyone else had already.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was reading Aeson's story here &amp; was thinking about the last sentence of this paragraph (this was part of his first post in this thread).  Has anyone has considered the long-term effects of buying vs researching techs?  I know buying is faster and often cheaper, but how about the long-term effect of forking over money to your opponents?  Researching also-known tech is pretty cheap too.  Just wondered if anyone played this way...</div></div><hr />

On this particular map, because of the necessary early wars and poor terrain, I found it much better to sit back and buy tech, because it took me a while to get any sort of infrastructure.  Actually, what I first tried to do was 50/50 tech/$, but that just put me behind in both.  It wasn't until the beginning of the modern age that I went to 70 science and sprinted ahead of the AI.  Normally, on a good map, I can keep 3 or 4 techs ahead if I try, which is what I normally prefer since it gives me an advantage militarily and a head start on wonders.<br />
<br />
As for giving the AI thousands of $ for tech, I don't know that it helped them much.  I was busy selling several luxuries to them for 32$/turn each, so the $ just came right back to my pocket.:D</div></div><hr />

Question about ICS - how close do you build your cities? one square away from each other, next to each other, two squares away, what?<br />
<br />
What other acronyms are there? I know OCS is one city challenge, what about the others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 10, 2002, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ICS isn't really defined in Civ3 as any particular spacing pattern.  I tend to see it as building cities close together, not worrying about what size the cities can end up becoming.  I probably had ~100 cities at the end of the game, and only a handfull of them had needed hospitals/mass transits, some not even aqueducts. <br />

Here is a thread over at Apolyton that defines many of the acronyms and terms that show up on the Civ3 boards.<br />

So I built north up above Paris. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be hyper critical and maybe it is just me, but with the starting position, north of Paris seems like the worst possible place to build a city, especially the second city.  The land is crappy, no chance of defense, far from the capital (high corruption), no resources (vs. the very valuable iron).  Why not build a city by the cow south of Paris (maybe you did and north is a typo)?  Or by the game icon to the east of Paris?  Or at the iron?  All of these are closer to the capital, easier to defend, and have better terrain.  If you won on Prince (Regent) using these kind of tactics, you must have some other good tactics to make up for poor city site selection.  <br />
<br />
City site selection is one of many things that make for a successful game.  I suggest that struggling players build their first cities very close to the capital, one square away on the diagonal or two squares away on the straight.  A dense industrial core of three cities makes for easy defense and a big early production boost.  <br />
<br />
This month's map is unforgiving, so this start may not be enough to win, but it is almost sure to survive through the first age.  The starting build queue that I prefer is three warriors then a settler, three more warriors and another settler.  This may not always be the optimal start, but it is a good base for struggling players to build off.  I usually plant the settlers very close to the capital then decide what to do next.  On most maps, next, involves getting iron and horses then building an army for war.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there any way we can see the other players games, see how they were different/similar to our own?<br />
<br />
I too had lots of coal plants, because none of my cities got really large pollution was not too much of a problem. I've rarely built them in the past, usually I'll get the Hoover Dam. Personally, I think this is one of the most powerful wonders of the lot it gives such a production kick if you've got the factories already in place. Without the attendant pollution.<br />
<br />
What I missed out on here was not building solar plants in those cities where I could not put a nuclear plant. But normally, ecology comes because I need mass transit to combat pollution and by the time these are built then I'm wanting to produce Modern Armour in bulk.<br />
<br />
This ime, pollution wasn't a real pain I'd have been better off building the solar plant and scrapping the coal plant (which I forgot to do in the few cities that could build nuclear plants). I missed that opportunity because most most have far more rivers than this one, and I'll always try to settle near water if I can.<br />
<br />
Hindsight shows that I need to be more flexible in my longer term strategy(s). I always beeline for electronics and Hoover Dam. This time I forgot about the river requirment and it was only when I could build it that I realised I couldn't. And I'd used TOE to rush the relevant techs which might have been better used in a different direction.<br />
<br />
My normal game setting is Emporor with large of hug maps and 12 to 16 civs. So a samller map and 'easier' level should have altered my early strategy, but I was still playing to the emporer hapiness penalty, my settler cities should have been occilating between 4 and 2, not 3 and 1.<br />
<br />
Switched to democracy too late, anarchy was longer because I had more cities and the corruption ease (even if only a few gold/shields a turn) would have been a big help. Also 5 turns lost in 1500 is less of a cost than 5 turns in 1800.<br />
<br />
But I stayed a republic because that's what America is, and because I was expecting more war than I ever got embroiled in.<br />
<br />
This GOTM actually saw me get some early wonders, very unusual. Colossus by default, was trying for the library but was beaten to it so took second best.<br />
<br />
Sistine Chapel which really surprised me as I've never won that race before. But I suspect that this was because the start location for Washington was actually nicely balanced once it had been developed. Sufficient overproduction of food to allow the population for expoitation of the surronding hills and mountains.<br />
<br />
Another thing I did a lot of which I normally don't was swithcing land usage. Frequently I start with irrigation, switch to mines, switch back to irrigation and even occaisionally replant forests. All to the same tile. Again late game industrious workers are quick!<br />
<br />
Looking back, I think that purchasing a French worker on what was almost the first contact with them gave a great boost to the early infrastructure. During the land grab phase it's very difficult to produce your own, settlers are the priority so the additional worker, even though somewhat slower did help. And it must have hindered French development as well, I'd never sell off a worker that early for ~20 gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has anyone has considered the long-term effects of buying vs researching techs?  I know buying is faster and often cheaper, but how about the long-term effect of forking over money to your opponents?  Researching also-known tech is pretty cheap too.  Just wondered if anyone played this way... <br />
I've been thinking about it.  I don't think I have the &quot;final word&quot; but here are my thoughts:<br />
<br />
What is a tech worth?  Any tech can be researched in 40 turns at 10% (or the minimum percentage that gives at least 1 gold for research).  <br />
<br />
Early in the game, usually this means that you can research a tech for 1 gold per turn, or 40 gold total.  That's all those early techs are worth, and you can often buy them for even less.<br />
<br />
However, if you want to speed up research, even a little, you pay &quot;full retail.&quot;  Here's how to calculate it:<br />
<br />
When you have just selected a tech to research, play with the science percentage slider on the F1 screen.  Note two things each time you move the slider: The number of turns to research, and the amount of gold devoted to science.  Multiply these two numbers to get your total cost for the tech in gold.  The total will change slightly with each percentage.  The lowest number you get will be closest to the actual cost.  The earliest techs run in the range of 110 gold (if memory serves).<br />
<br />
You can usually completely recoup the cost of researching a tech if you can sell it three times (at greater than 10% research).  I consider this coming out ahead - you've gotten it &quot;for free.&quot;  If you sell it twice, your overall cost is about the same as if you researched it at 10% research or purchased it on the used market. <br />
<br />
So, it follows that the same applies to the AI.  Unless the AI can sell a tech 3 times, they haven't really gotten ahead by the sale.<br />
<br />
In many cases, you can buy a tech from more than one civ.  I would tend to buy it from one that is nearly broke.<br />
<br />
In most cases, different AI's will be the first to research different techs, and I believe they will slosh funds around trading among themselves - the money just gets passed back and forth.  A tech trading cartel helps all the members without much money (net of all trades) actually changing hands. It's very damaging to be omitted from such a cartel.<br />
<br />
Controlling a tech cartel seems to me to be hugely important at the beginning of the game. The way to control it is to be the middleman - two or more civs have contact only via you.  A civ that controls a cartel - either the player or the AI, stands to make a lot of money.  This control ends immediately when all the civs meet.<br />
<br />
Many of the techs that permit wonders usually are not for sale in a time frame that permits you to build the wonder, at least from my observations.  So, you'll just have to research, steal, or demand those, or forego building that wonder.<br />
<br />
What this means to my playing style is this: I will usually set science research at one of three levels - 0% (count on buying what I need), 10% (figure that strategically need the advance, and have determined that 40 turns out is ok, so I don't want to depend on being able to make the purchase), or max that I can afford (when the advance(s) are going to immediately make a big impact on the game).<br />
<br />
Full disclosure: I've still not made a really good Civ 3 score (yet!) - I'm a former Civ 2 player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spork</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm done, my very first GOTM! It was also my very first game using a patch, and it took a while to get used to the differences. This is a spoilers thread, so make sure you're ready for some.<br />
<br />
In general, I think this game went well. I learned a few interesting strategies in this one. I walked the settler to a better starting position and took Paris very early, helping myself to a rather productive homeland. I quickly made peace with the French (I didn't want their other towns) and turned my swordsmen on the Russians, who declared war on me after I refused to be intimidated by them. This was an ugly war, and after I took several of their poorly-defended towns, they wanted a truce and were willing to give me some of their own territory. I took it, but then re-attacked and finished them off not long after 10 AD. I finally got a leader, who built a Forbidden Palace, and now my civilization was a production machine. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as the Russians were going down they pulled in the Greeks and the Japanese on their side. Their attacks were feeble, but the swordsmen who defeated Russia would never pull off a raid of another continent. There just weren't enough. I eventually got peace with Greece, but I kept up my war with Japan. I took the city (in my game &quot;Eto&quot;) just east of the starting position. It was right on the coast, and very easy to defend. This became the focus of most of the skirmishes for about the next 20 turns, and swordsmen who shipped in from the forme Russian front held it heroically. This produced another great leader, who immediately built the Lighthouse, which turned out to be an incredibly useful wonder in this largely naval game.<br />
<br />
During these skirmishes I made a very odd strategic play: I found I had a ton of money, and I needed a huge army of swordsmen fast. So, I decided to destroy my own road to the iron mine. This meant that I could build warriors again. Most of my productive towns had barracks, and they cranked out a warrior every two turns. Very soon, I was knee-deep in veteran warriors, while my old-timer swordsmen were holding off the Japanese. I arranged for Greece to attack Japan from the south, which gave them a bit more to worry about. Then, I rebuilt the road and upgraded about 25 veteran warriors into veteran swordsmen. This barely made a dent in my treasury. The first action of the fresh swordsmen was a three-galley raid on Tokyo. Though it was not the capital, it was by far the most important Japanese city, because it was well developed and had Japan's only source of iron. After Tokyo fell, Japan lost the will to fight, and my swordsmen mauled them. They begged for peace and I gave it to them, after picking up three of their cities in the deal and leaving them only one (very crappy) town.<br />
<br />
While the battle of Japan was raging, I was so proud of the mass upgrading idea that I thought I'd do it again. I had my sights on Greece, but I thought they'd be much tougher than the Japanese. We were on the brink of the Middle Ages and I knew the Swordsmen couldn't do this job alone. So, while fighting Japan, my cities produced only horsemen, who all stayed at home. Again, I made it up to about 20. I got all the prerequisites for Chivalry from the poor Japanese as a part of our peace deal. In fact, I got almost all of my techs from peace deals. I wasn't going to wait around for Chivalry, though. I actually did research, and for five turns I was losing something like 70 gold each turn. But, at the end, I was able to upgrade all those horsemen. Well, not all of them, because here I did run out of money. At 80 a piece, this upgrade had to be done somewhat gradually. I first did about a dozen, and they blitz-attacked two Greek cities on the first round of an unannounced war. Forming a second front, the swordsmen that destroyed Japan came in from the north. The Greeks didn't know what hit them, and they got sliced up in only a few rounds. Their capital moved to an island colony, and that was their only town. In one of the last battles of this war I got a third great leader, who built the Hanging Gardens and set off a golden age. I was hoping to finish off Egypt before the it ran out.<br />
<br />
Egypt turned out to be a much tougher affair, partly because I had no town on their continent that I could pack with my troops. It's tough to storm a continent from two-person galleys, but I had enough of them to pull it off. I caught them just as they started making pikemen, but about half of their city's defenders were still spearmen. Egypt actually had the sense to build barracks before building their pikemen, and they defended valiantly. At least four knights fell at the battle of Thebes alone, and many more were hurt. Eventually, I took all their towns. I know I should have razed them, because it looked at this point that I was headed for an early conquest victory. I let them stand, though, and several of them reverted back to Egypt at very annoying times. What complicated the battle was the fact that Egypt was furthest along in island colonization, and I had to ship divisions of knights to all of these places. I should have planned this out a bit more. The knights ended up doing a lot of waiting for galleys.<br />
<br />
Then, I had to deal with the annoying &quot;whack-a-mole&quot; behavior that you get when you destroy somebody's last town. As far as I know, this didn't happen before the patch, and it seemed really random to me at first. Then I figured out that everyone has one free resettlement before they're wiped out for good. I'm sure that's in a FAQ somewhere, but if I would have known it, I would have acted differently. I was hoping to finish before year 1000, but I didn't--this random stuff had me going until 1080. I got a nice score bonus, but I'm sure many people will do better than 5150.<br />
<br />
I won't officially submit the game, or, if I do, it needs a disclamer. I realized after I started that I had been cheating, because I reloaded a couple of times when I screwed things up. The only reload that would have made an important difference in how the game turned out had to do with the barbarian uprising. It caught me totally unprepared and I lost all of my precious gold that I was saving to upgrade my troops. This was my first GOTM, and I guess I just like to reload sometimes. I'll try it next month with no reloading at all.</div></div><hr />

Once I had met all of the Civs, and had their maps, I plotted my first invasion.  I chose Japan for these reasons.<br />
<br />
1.  Their land was close to my capitol &amp; I could ferry armies over there quickly.<br />
2.  My Military advisor told me that their army was weaker than mine<br />
3.  Their land was much better than the French lands.  The grasslands near Japan and Greece borders are PRIME REAL ESTATE.<br />
<br />
So I invaded them.  It started out slow, but I eventually took all of their land and eliminated them.<br />
<br />
Of note, to keep my homeland safe, I allied with France.  This worked out very good because France pretty much kept Russia off of my back.<br />
<br />
I jumped my capitol to the rich Japanese lands.  On another message board, I beleive it was BillChin who discovered that the capitol always jumps to the city with the most nationals of your country.  Thanks BillChin, it worked for me!<br />
<br />
My next focus will be to take out the Russians.  I won't be able to do it alone, so I'm going to have to buy some alliances.</div></div><hr />

1- You are absolutely right. I thought you need saltpeter to have rifleman. What I can't understand is why the AI keeps throwing longbowmen after me if they can produce riflemen (same attack but 6 defense).<br />
2-I had around 15 cavalry and 5 infantry in a size 1 town. If 20 american soldiers are not enough to control one enemy citizen, then I suggest that they send their entire army to Guantanamo Bay. This revolt also cost me the loss of 10 artillery and a few ironclads.<br />
3- This is more than double defense, it's a joke. I have always used artillery in previous games, but with the new patch I believe they are useless.<br />

<br />
There is no change to artillery vs. units, only vs. buildings.  This makes it much more likely to take a city with improvements intact.  I like the change even though the percentage of misses is way up.<br />
<br />
The AI makes longbows because they are categorized as offensive units.  Also Riflemen are 80 shields, Longbows 40.<br />
<br />
If your culture controls all 21 squares around the city, you need double the pop in units to prevent culture flipping.  Each square in enemy culture adds a unit or two.  In my March game, the Egypt culture was almost double mine.  This probably increases the number some more.  You can probably add some more to deal with the close Egyptian capital.  Better to raze and resettle in this kind of situation.  If there is a valuable wonder, station troops just outside of the city (my 1.16 way of dealing with the issue).<br />
<br />
Emperor level is much tougher with the version 1.17f AI tech trading.  Bring your &quot;A&quot; game :)</div></div><hr />

In my battles against France and Japan, I didn't get one great leader despite using many elite fighters.  Now that I am fighting Russia, I have earned 3.  The first built an army, which allowed me to build the Heroic Epic.  The second came just before the epic was complete, and the third after its completion.<br />

There was no way I was building in the starting position!  I do wish I had moved further west though...<br />
<br />
I was able to kill off the French.  Before I could think about dealing with Russia the Japanese landed an escorted settler on my part of the continent.  I attacked.  After a couple thousand years of war I finally had to give in and let Japan have New York.  Russia had been attacking me off and on.  I had 8 catapults and used my first leader to make an army of swordsmen.  Held off the Ruskies and Japs for along time with those.  Finally lost my army and half my catapults.  Had another leader in the wings.  (Couldn't use him for anything else - I was way behind in tech and the wonder races and didn't have enough cities to build a second army.)  Used him for another army but lost it before I even got the third swordman in it.  Lost Washington (the Russians razed it) and made peace (had to give Boston to Catherine).  (I was able to build New Washington close by.)<br />
<br />
Now, back when I was cocky, I had built a few galleys thinking I could invade Japan.  They explored instead and I finally made contact with Greece and Egypt.  They only thing that has kept me going to this point is the fur exports to these two countries.  I'm still at peace, a democracy,  and can make infantry now.  (Though my country is so poor I still have pikemen!)  Greece and Japan have been fighting and I've managed to build 3 cities in the gaps left by their wars.<br />
<br />
But the best indicator of how badly I'm doing:  one of my cities overthrew my oppression but Japan refused to accept it (so I still have the city).  Another tried joining Russia but Catherine wouldn't have it either!<br />

What is the best way to deal with overcrowding?<br />
<br />
I'm a communist government, at war.  My cities are approximately size 8 and smaller.  I just upped entertainment to 10%.  I have 7 luxuries.  Are there any cities improvemnets which specifically combat overcrowding?The best thing for happiness IMO is a Marketplace. Marketplaces are fairly cheap to build but once you have a number of luxuries they have an enormous effect on happiness.<br />
<br />
If you have a Marketplace and more than two luxuries then you get the following number of extra happy faces:<br />
3 luxuries: 1 extra<br />
4 luxuries: 2 extra<br />
5 luxuries: 4 extra<br />
6 luxuries: 6 extra<br />
7 luxuries: 9 extra<br />
8 luxuries: 12 extra<br />
<br />
Nothing else comes close to this in effectiveness! Cathedrals etc. of course do also increase your culture. And JS Bach's is great, the best wonder for happiness I think. But they are just nice, Marketplaces and luxuries are a must. With the 7 luxuries you have, a Marketplace will increase the happy faces for luxuries from 7 to 16!<br />
<br />
I often really like the Smith's Trading Company wonder because of the number of Marketplaces I build. If you are milking a game and have 200 cities with Marketplaces (not to mention some harbors, banks, and airports) then Smith's saves 200 gold/turn just for the Marketplace maintenance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With 7 luxuries and in communism, just maintain a police force. You could also build Settlers and make new cities in the space your attacking force just created. :)<br />
<br />
Of course if war is not what you want, you need to build Temples etc. asap so your culture earns some respect.</div></div><hr />

I guess I'll take it.  Its my best finish ever in GOTM (I always lose).  <br />
<br />
My game was marred by a long war against Russia.  I dragged Greece &amp; Egypt in with me (Japan &amp; France were long gone).  This war lasted for hundreds of years.  I eventually killed of Russia.  It wasn't untill the very end that Egypt &amp; Greece participated, and even that wasn't much.  How do you get the other CIV's to participate?<br />
<br />
I killed of Russia in 1973.  Greece was eliminated about a decade later.  From the 1990's on, Egypt and I lived in peace.  Of note, we were not technologically advanced.  We only made it to Nuclear Power, tech wise in 2050.  I don't know if this has anything to do with such a low number of CIVs and much World War.<br />
<br />
Egypt had HIGH culture.  I had some small tundra fringe cities pledge allegiance to Egypt, only to have Egypt refuse them.  Interesting!  Was that done by them to avoid annoying me?  Were they afraid?<br />
<br />
In the last 2 GOTMs I've had very low culture.  I always build temples in every town early, but fail to complete any wonders.  Is this why I have such low culture?  If I get behind, how do I catch up?<br />
<br />
SirPleb, thanks for the advice on Marketplaces.  I will put that to use in the next GOTM!<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah...my score.  It was very low, somewhere in the mid 2000's.  <br />
<br />
Good luck to the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillChin</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2002, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine is over as well.  I have posted most of the story in drips and drabs, I'll summarize briefly.<br />
<br />
I get a free settler.  I build about four more cities (six or seven total).  I prepare for war with France.  Russia attacks.  I ally with France against Russia.  I win a long and bloody war (about 50 turns) and take all of Russia's land.  Next is Japan.  The first war vs. Japan only yields a couple of cities.  I finish off France.  I finish off Japan.  I ally with Greece against Egypt.  After being allies in the war, Greece backstabs me while I have MPP and Gracious relations with me.  I ally with Egypt against Greece.  I prepare an army for attacking Egypt, but my population creeps up enough for a Domination victory before the assault begins.  <br />
<br />
I got one leader the entire game.  Got him late in the game, after I had built the Forbidden Palace and did the free palace jump.  Saved him for Hoover Dam, but then did not need him.  Saved him for an Army of Modern Armor, but never got that far.  So I never used him.  :p <br />
<br />
My guess is that my score will be near the average.  I may need to attack earlier, but it is hard to overcome my caution at the start of the game.  I definitely need to work on my mid-game (early industrial age) as this is two games in a row where I got backstabbed by a Civ that I have a MPP with.<br />
<br />
I learned about the free palace jump.  It goes to the city with highest number of native citizens.  I experienced major problems with corruption with the peninsula start and no leader for rushing the Forbidden Palace.  I talked two long time posters, Eyrei and Zachariel, into giving the March game a try.  I hope to see their comments and learn from them, especially on dealing with corruption.<br />
<br />
Thanks Matrix and Thunderfall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beard Rinker</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2002, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Build Out<br />
<br />
This month's GOTM looked like a good start position.  Luxuries, lake, and a good mix of grass and hills visible right away.  How wrong this was, it was a small peninsula with the land near by consisting of all hills, mountains and tundra.<br />
<br />
I sent my scout out to explore the world and crammed three towns into the small peninsula.  I soon discovered the French and the Russians and saw their starting positions were much better than mine.<br />
<br />
After the first 3 towns, the closest available good land was just south of the French.  I managed to get a town there but this was already getting quite far from my capital.  An early war was definitely in the cards this game.<br />
<br />
Once iron and horses were revealed it looked promising for that first war.  Iron and horses appeared just north of my starting position and the French had neither.  The Russians had two sources of iron, one right near Moscow and a second one far east of their capital.  I quickly built cities near the resources north of my capital to claim them and began preparations for the first wars.<br />
<br />
First Wars<br />
<br />
The French were geographically the closest and the weakest of my neighbors and as such, were my first target.  No pop-rushing military units slowed preparations a little, but I don't think it would have helped much on this map anyway.<br />
<br />
I sent a small stack of horses, archers, and spearmen to Paris to cut all roads while I engaged them down south.  Declaring war on the French was my only diplomatic black mark until much later when I decided to milk the game.<br />
<br />
The Russians beat me to it and took the southern city so I gathered my forces near Paris.  Once the stack was a sufficient size, I razed Paris and razed all other French towns.  In hindsight, I probably should have taken them as the French were removed from the game and culture flipping wouldn't have been a problem.  However it was 3 AM an I wasn't thinking all that clearly.<br />
<br />
Once the French were finished off the Russians conveniently declared war on me.  They had a large number of forces wandering through the tundra north of my capital so the first priority was defense.  Catapults were now in the picture so I added them to my defensive arsenal.  The Russian's attack was quite clumsy and I managed to destroy all their forces with almost no casualties.<br />
<br />
I then captured their eastern most city located near a large cache of gems and got a great leader from the battle.  I captured one more city near another gems source and built a new city just west of that one on the Russian front lines.  In this city, I used the great leader to build a forbidden palace.  This placement improved the productivity of all towns in the former French territory and would make towns up to around Moscow quite productive (once they were taken of course).<br />
<br />
By this point the Russians had 3 cities east of Moscow and a number of cities west of Moscow.<br />
<br />
I then sent a mixed stack of catapults, spearmen, swordsmen and horses to Moscow.  This was a large enough force to travel around unmolested, but they would have difficulty taking and holding Moscow.  I used this stack to cut all roads to Moscow and cut the roads to the iron.  This left the three cities east of Moscow isolated and the rest of their empire somewhat crippled.  I then used the stack to ensure the roads werent rebuilt and to pick off any stray Russians.<br />
<br />
I built up my forces and captured the 3 cities east of Moscow at my leisure.  Once this was done, I razed Moscow and rebuilt on the same tile.<br />
<br />
Technology and Trading<br />
<br />
My technology strategy throughout the ancient and middle ages was to buy or trade for most technologies, keeping research at 10% throughout.  When selecting a research project, I would select a technology I didn't want or one I thought the AI would not research.  My reasoning was twofold:<br />
  Any important technology will likely be discovered by one of the AI opponents first and could be bought.<br />
  Any technology discovered is worth more if no one else has it.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I never sold my contacts and bought contacts as soon as available.  At one point, I had contact with all opponents except the Egyptians.  All others only knew about the opponents on their island.  I was able to broker technology between the two groups at premium prices until around the start of the middle ages.<br />
<br />
For most of this period, I almost always got a technology for less than 100 gold and often for free or at a profit through brokering.<br />
<br />
This strategy also allowed me to focus on military production.  No need for libraries, and gold was always plentiful.<br />
<br />
About half way through the middle ages (middle middle ages), technologies started becoming more expensive.  This may have been due to less contact between players and player attrition.  There were several wars, the French were gone, and the Russians were in bad shape and likely not doing much research.<br />
<br />
I started building libraries in some cities and increased my research percentage.  My form of government was republic so I was able to research technologies in a reasonable amount of time.  I still bought technology when available but seldom sold any technology I researched.  At that point, I started pulling ahead in technology.<br />
<br />
Securing Luxuries<br />
<br />
At some point during the first wars, the Greeks declared war on me.  I can't remember why but I think the Russians dragged them into it.  I never signed peace with the Greeks as they were on another island and their attacks were merely a mild nuisance.<br />
<br />
The Greeks shared an island with the Japanese and had two types of luxuries within their boundaries.  They were also located just south of my capital so any cities I built there would be moderately productive.  To me this seemed like ample reason for a full-scale invasion.<br />
<br />
I was still engaged with the Russians, but had grabbed pretty much all the territory I wanted from them.  I began construction on some Caravels with a Greek invasion in mind.<br />
<br />
As the invasion time drew near, I contacted the Japanese and signed an alliance with them against the Greeks.  By this time, I had signed peace with the Russians, built 4 caravels and upgraded them to galleons.  I would have sufficient troops for the invasion in about 5 turns.<br />
<br />
I invaded with 4 caravels carrying 5 cavalry, 5 riflemen, 5 cannons and a settler.  I landed on the first turn and was not attacked.  On the second turn I built a town and razed a nearby Greek city.   On the third turn I bought the barracks improvement and reinforcements arrived: more cavalry and some obsolete swordsmen.  The swordsmen were used to help rush a temple, library and harbor over the next three turns.<br />
<br />
In the following turns, I razed 3 more Greek cities including their capital and resettled.  The Greeks never mounted a counter attack, likely because of the difficulties the Japanese were causing.<br />
<br />
The invasion went much easier than anticipated which got me looking for other Greek targets.  Lo and behold, an island with spices due west.  I had 5 luxuries at this point and spices would make 6.<br />
<br />
I ferried some cavalry and riflemen from the conquered Greek territory to Spice Island.  More where ferried from the home island along with settlers.  I left adequate forces on the conquered land but they probably wouldn't be needed.  The Japanese were going to town with the Greeks and it looked as though they would clear them off the island within a few turns.<br />
<br />
The conquest of Spice Island went quickly.  During the battle I got my second great leader and used this to create an army.  This army was used to destroy the last Greek city on the island which would allow me to build the Heroic Epic, Military Academy and eventually the Pentagon.<br />
<br />
Wonders<br />
<br />
I didn't bother with any wonders until late in the middle ages.  This start position required efficiency and I couldn't afford to have a top production city out of commission for a long period of time.  Using leaders wasn't an option as they were scarce in this game; only two by the start of the industrial age.<br />
<br />
I thought about trying for The Great Library but decided against it as I was already getting technology as soon as it was discovered.  In despotism, the only use for money is trading.<br />
<br />
My first wonder was Magellan's Voyage, a late middle ages wonder.  The extra sea movement was nice, but I was more interested in triggering a golden age before F15.  Magellan's Voyage is an expansionist wonder so I would also need an industrious wonder to trigger the golden age.<br />
<br />
From this point on, I completed pretty much every wonder.  I had enough high production cities that I could use a couple of them for producing wonders.  At one point, I timed two wonders to complete on the same turn to avoid the AI switching after the first was completed and beat me to the second.<br />
<br />
When I completed Hover Dam, I triggered a golden age.  This was bad news for the Egyptians, my current military target at the time as I was able to produce a veritable flood of cavalry, infantry and artillery.<br />
<br />
to be continued...</div></div><hr />

The thing is, right, as you all know, the starting position is total bollocks. One of my two Galleys just mapped out the perimeter of the spice island, and no-one is bloody on it!. Why oh why didn't we get to start there?! I wonder how many times this Matrix geezer had to reroll the map to get such a bad position? ;)<br />

<br />
Also, I wondered if you could've squeezed another city or 2 around your FP since they looked a little spaced to me?<br />
<br />
It also appeared that your game could've been similar to mine wrt the end &amp; a Space Race.  Did you have much competition?  I didn't have enough time to invade Egypt to control them from finishing so I had to build mine immediately &amp; invade the 2nd last (Russia, in my game) to destroy theirs...</div></div><hr />

As soon as my scout set out, I saw the &quot;key&quot; to the position; the spot next to the cattle would be America's new capital. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
We established our Republic in 330 AD and ever after.<br />
<br />
Of course, packing more cities in closer may have resulted in a higher score, but I don't play much for score. I rarely even finish a game. I normally would have quit in 1650 AD when Pax Americana began.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, my game has just finished. The French were knocked out decently by me. But then there were the Russians. We've had some wars now and then. Usually they ended in advantage to Russia, and the last one made him kick my off the continent. But just before that I had built a city on an uninhabited island in the  south. I had two cities there when the Russians captured my last city and the only way to make peace with the Russians was to give one of those two to him, which I didn't want at first but when he landed about 6 cossacks near that city, I gave it after all.<br />
<br />
Now this is actually rather funny: I was in war-time because the Russians were slaughtering me. But when they got the continent I didn't want to be at war-time anymore, so I declared war with the Japanese in hope to make peace with them afterwards to get rid of war-time. But then I made peace with the Russians so I didn't had to declare war with the Japanese. But the Japanese did land 6 cavalry near my single city. I attacked them unsuccesfully, but then they still agreed to a peace treaty, though I had to give 111 gold.<br />
<br />
Waiting for someone to kill me finally, the Egyptians built United Nations, I voted for Cleopatra and so did two others. And I lost diplomatically with only one city left. :lol:</div></div><hr />

 Any town built in that spot will grow rapidly. Still, the geography as a whole was pretty bleak. With no rivers, I had to adapt to not having much income until the industrial age.<br />

<br />
Apparently, not always. :(<br />
I've stuffed my game because of this.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'd built the FP in Paris and was readying to jump the Palace from Washington (the start location) to my new settlements on the spice island. The intended target (Atlanta) was my biggest city at size 5 by (native) population. The Palace instead jumped to Lyon, which was size 4 but with a Temple, Walls, and the Collossus. Unfortunately, my Palace and FP are only about four squares apart now. :mad: Too bad. :(<br />

My guess is that it goes to the next highest rated city, according to the criteria by which the top five are shown on the F11 screen.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure the new patch took a role in the new difficulty along with the 3 billion year aged earth. :eek: <br />
<br />
I settled right at the original start point because it did not seem too bad. Well it was not long there after that the news from the scout sobered me up. When the scout found a settler, I established New York immediately cause no better site had been found, besides the city foot print provided a choke point to protect the wondrous lands to be discovered to the east.....<br />
<br />
I was in full blown world war around 300BC, all civs knew of one another by this time and things had been real peaceful until this time. This world war had the effect of slowing the tech race to a crawl. Anyway, I took the French out of the game around 10BC as the world war started to fade.<br />
<br />
Then I ground the Russians with swordsmen for the next 500 years. I got my only great leader in the Russian wars.   :crazyeye:  I shut down Washington city and moved my palace into Paris. I razed Moscow and reestablished Washington city complete with a Forbidden Palace, thanks to the great leader.<br />
<br />
By the time I went after the Japanese with my knights, their source of iron :lol: was dried up so they provided little resistance.<br />
<br />
The Greeks were a bit tougher but my knights were still the most powerful units because gunpowder was not yet invented.<br />
<br />
I had started to pop rushed temples in my cities to expand my borders and fill the gaps back during the Russian wars and continued through all the ages. :cool: <br />
<br />
This left me to square off against the Egyptians. By this time I had caught up to them culturally and my culture production was surpassing theirs. I spread out into remote areas as best I could, while I tried to gather my forces into a position to launch an attack and contain any of their further expansion. :king: <br />
<br />
I focused primarily on a domination win at this time (I knew I could fall back on a cultural win if required) but I had to start the war with the Egyptians because the out lying territories were slow to develop. I triggered the domination win shortly after the war started. :cry: <br />
<br />
If I would have continued on, with a cultural win, I probably could have milked out a score around 8000 on this map (I'll be interested to see the top scores). The domination win was far less but a good compromise. :goodjob: <br />

I think part of the reason is because the French and I are on such good terms (they're letting me conduct training operations in their territory...or at least, I was able to use that excuse successfully and without lowering opinion of Gracious when my workers entered French soil!), and the French are winning right now. But man, all I can say is Russia and Egypt got it GOOD! I hope the future maps aren't this hard, but I am very happy with how I am doing--this is my first game on Monarch. I'd like to see a Monarch with at least a &quot;normal&quot; starting position for the next month...but perhaps an Archipelagos map where each civ has their own eqaully-sized island or something similar. Also, I think I would prefer a Standard map with max civs just because I found the exploring aspect ended too soon...no, I don't know the whole map, but I do know all the civs, and have since about 1 AD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but the thing that bugged me about Small compared to Standard is that, because corruption is scaled according to map size (but workable city radius obviously isn't) I ended up with far more city overlap in an attempt to build a decent 'core' around my F/Palace.<br />
<br />
I don't like having any city overlap.<br />
<br />
(Infact one of the first things I do in my own games when I've founded my capital is see if it's capable of producing exactly 40 food, as this allows the entire population roster to be working every workable tile.)</div></div><hr />

Technology and Trading<br />
<br />
My technology strategy throughout the ancient and middle ages was to buy or trade for most technologies, keeping research at 10% throughout.  When selecting a research project, I would select a technology I didn't want or one I thought the AI would not research.  My reasoning was twofold:<br />
  Any important technology will likely be discovered by one of the AI opponents first and could be bought.<br />
  Any technology discovered is worth more if no one else has it.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I never sold my contacts and bought contacts as soon as available.  At one point, I had contact with all opponents except the Egyptians.  All others only knew about the opponents on their island.  I was able to broker technology between the two groups at premium prices until around the start of the middle ages.<br />
<br />
For most of this period, I almost always got a technology for less than 100 gold and often for free or at a profit through brokering.<br />
<br />
This strategy also allowed me to focus on military production.  No need for libraries, and gold was always plentiful.<br />
[/B]<br />
<br />
Same strategy here.<br />
You can set tech to 0% and then create one specialist scientist to generate enough for the 40 turn min.<br />
<br />
Saw an explanation where the AI devalues the tech based on<br />
the total number of civs (not %) that already know about the tech. So not trading contact significantly increases the $$ you can charge. As I was behind in tech in much of the early game, I quickly traded contact and my cost to purchase techs went down significantly. Not sure wich is better</div></div><hr />

All my cities except Washington died, most of them razed (die, russkie scum)! Anyway, the French were a buffer between me and the Russians. While the Russians were fighting the French to get to Washington, I loaded up a boat with three settlers (Washington WAS size-12) and sailed away just before they attacked, off to an island that no civ started on somewhat close to that area (I wish I knew about that island in the first place!). Anyway, I still am not too far behind tech-wise, but I would just like to thank the French for acting as a small buffer--without them, I would have lost completely! Now I am still alive...and the one thing I hope is that my score won't be lower because I am living longer just because the conditions are a bit rougher! (Yes, this is my first Monarch game, so I am happy to live as long as I am--it's after 1100 AD--and be right there with the computer as far as techs go at least, even if my army developments were very low!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is, I did some of the right moves, like establishing a city west of the French (New York, trying to reach the gems in the mountains - hadn't discovered iron working yet). Then Boston followed on that desert by the iron (popular site, it seems).<br />
<br />
Then the French establish a city west of New York, and I'm boxed in. The only way to break out seems to be to take them out, so I send out a force to capture Paris. Paris fell, but was recaptured in the same turn.<br />
<br />
Fighting moves to New York, and after three or four turns of heavy fighting, the French finally burns it to the ground. It's all downhill from there, I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />

I paid them tribute 2 times but they still won't stop! So I moved 10 swordsman and captured Minsk, and a peace treaty was signed soon after. :lol:<br />
<br />
I gave 15 Gold gift to the Russians after I signed peace treaty with them. They said &quot;This gift won't heal the rift between our people, Lincoln&quot;.  I wasted 15 Gold for nothing.... :cry:<br />

I have enjoyed peace with all Civs for the last 25 turns...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2002, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First GOTM. This is quite the start for the game.  I am not fond of starting in the mountains.  I made the right move by accident at the beginning.  I established a few cities to the north and west.  This allowed me to be a buffer between the French and the Russians.  Like everyone else I had to put a city near the iron once I found it.  I then switched to producing swordsman as fast as I could.  Once I had about 6 of them I attacked the French.  After a long war I finally settled with them only to be attacked by The Russians.  I was able to beat them back to a narrow part of land and get peace with them.  As a result of the war I got a leader and built my forbidden palace.  I should have moved my capitol instead, but I didnt think of that till much later in the game.<br />
<br />
For the next several hundred years I developed my empire researching and trading as fast as I could until I could build tanks (I had to trade for the rubber).  I built up an army of 35 tanks, and set out to make war.  The French were gone on the first turn.  This allowed me to get the Russians to declare war on me.  Over the next several turns I was able to grind them up, cutting of their supply of resources as I went.  After about five turns the Japanese attacked me in an alliance with the Russians.  This allowed me to get the Greeks and the Egyptians in the war against the Russians, and to hopefully not fall too far behind on the techs.<br />
<br />
After reducing the Russians to 3 cities I am now concentrating on the Japanese.  I wish I had known how close and easy of a victim they were earlier in the game.  I would have attacked them when swordsmen were the best units.  They have no tanks, or any offensive unit to speak of.  I now have one city on the coast and am in the process of ferrying over as many tanks as I can.  Hopefully they wont take too long, as I need to get out of the communist government and back into democracy.  My production sucks and I have no Navy to speak of.  Currently just a transport.  The Greeks and Egyptians have huge fleets sailing by all of the time.  Well it is 1802 and we will see what happens.  This is the first time I have tried to complete a game on Civ III so it should be interesting.  Up until now I have been playing to try to learn the subtle, and major differences between this version and the other two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Mar 22, 2002, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I posted some comments earlier on this thread, but now that I've finished the game I'll sum up my game and give my impressions. I had a lot of fun playing this map, and by a lot of fun I mean that I was sweating it out and working like crazy to stay alive for most of the game.<br />
<br />
In 4000BC the game starts, and I found Washington in the starting location because it looks good. And the location is good for that city. But my scout quickly reveals that the land around me isn't very good. I sent the scout south to start, which probably cost me a turn or two in exploring; never got the goody hut that a lot of other players claimed to find. <br />
<br />
I get my second city up around 3000BC, and build it SE of Washington on the coast. It looked like the only good spot at the time. So throughout the game I had this pseudo ICS city that was not right next to Washington but borrowed some tiles from it. Not sure exactly what I was thinking when I founded this city. I have two warriors out exploring at this time and see that France has only one warrior fortified in their captial. That's a little too tempting, so I &quot;treacherously&quot; attack them, capturing an undefended worker and getting their warrior in the field to attack my warrior fortified on a hill - with predictable results. A few turns later it is my two warriors vs. their warrior fortified in Paris. I belive the odds of winning are about 65% so I gamble and go for it - and fail miserably. The next 1000 years were spent recovering from this.<br />
<br />
So I'm at war with France and have NO units whatsoever now. Hmm... might be a good idea to build some archers. So I build one, and he's prompty attacked by a barbarian horseman out of the darkness and killed. :mad: Ok, let's try again. The next archer is also killed by a barbarian horseman out of the blue. :mad: At this point I'm seriously considering quitting the game. The French are bringing an attack force near (undefended!) Washington and I have to whip a spearman to defend it! :mad: :mad: This was the low point of my game.<br />
<br />
Well I made peace with the French next and got horseback riding from them in the settlement. I can now see the horses NW of Washington, so my next settler narrowly beats a French settler to them. I get iron working somewhere along here and send a settler to claim the iron, but France gets there first. I therefore build a city just outside their cultural border and attack the French two turns later. Their city is defended by only a warrior, which doesn't stand up to archers well...<br />
<br />
In this war, I raze some more French city and limit them to their capital and I think one other city. Paris was sooo close to falling, but I couldn't kill their last spearman. Anyway, I used the peace to get some cities up to the south of the French, but only as far as that region of desert. South of that, the Russians already have a city by the gems. I had just started attacking the French in an effort to wipe them off the map when Russia demands tribute. Since I don't want to fight another war, I pay. The next turn Catherine declares war! :mad: Grrrr....<br />
<br />
The good thing is that I took Paris on the next turn, leaving the French with only one city. The bad news was that I had nothing around to stop the Russian advance. I diverted almost everything south to my desert city, which became a chokepoint in the following battles. I rushed a barracks, city walls, and moved spearmen out of other cities, leaving them undefended to prevent the Russians from breaking through. They had so many more units, but I managed to hold them off. A few turns later I killed the French (no respawn, oddly) and things are looking up.<br />
<br />
Then I get this message: the Greeks have declared war on us! I should mention I had a city on the Greek mainland that I had founded to get their silks. Well fortunately the Greeks had no units better than archers, because my two defending spearmen quickly became elite. Every turn they would throw some warriors and archers at me, and at the end of the turn my spearmen would heal up from the barracks in the city. Then I get this message: the Japanese have declared war on us. No! I'm the victim of an AI feeding frenzy! The Japanese have units near my Greek city and they start attcking too. The balance is tipping against me there - and then a great leader pops out! [party] :bday: [party]<br />
<br />
No surprise, since my elites won about 10 battles, but still amazing. But there was no way I could hold that city for long, and since the city was size 1 I couldn't whip a gally to get him back to the mainland. I whipped a galley in the next closest city and had to hold out for three turns until it could get there. Talk about tension! One of my spearmen died and the other one was really taking a beating. Finally I got him out of there. The NEXT TURN the city falls. Whew! That was too close. I built my Forbidden Palace in Paris, which finally gave me a chance to compete with the other civs.  <br />
<br />
I signed ruinous peace treaties with Russia, Greece, and Japan to get them off me. Russia's was particularly bad - all my treasury and something like 30gpt - this is around 450AD. I have to run 0% science just to avoid a deficit. Ouch. BUT all of my cities are still mine, despite a (near) worldwide coalition to take me down. The AI would never get a better chance to defeat me and they failed. I finally got some peace and a chance to build badly needed city improvements. How bad was my early game? I didn't build a temple in Washington until 600AD! :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Mar 22, 2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was another war with Russia that netted me the gems city and several others, but not really a big result. The next big event began around 1300AD when Greece declared war on Japan - or vice versa, I don't know. Over the next 100 years, Russia and Egypt joined in the fight against Japan. It's another feeding frenzy - these AI opponents are viscious. :eek: Naturally I waited until Japan had been greatly weakened, then jumped across the sea and captured almost all their cities with cavalry. Japan was destroyed, btw. I was now on even strength with the other 3 civs, except in culture where I was pitiful.<br />
<br />
My luck was bad with resources too. The saltpeter in the desert moved on me, and there was (of course) no coal or rubber in my territory. I thus founded a city on one of the islands in the south to get the coal that was down there. Around 1700 Egypt sneak attacks me for no reason, capturing my coal city! :mad: Well I responded by taking one of their cities, but their navy was too strong and it was the wrong era for offense as infantry was around but not tanks. This was essentially a stalemate. But with all this AI warmongering both Egypt and Russia's democracies collapsed into communism - just what I wanted. As a result of this and building Theory of Evolution, I got to tanks first and did NOT give out the tech (duh). I had to trade for rubber, but 20 turns saw a good 20 tanks built. (By this time I had by far the best production of any civ, although I was only 3rd in size - the AI just does not build factories enough.) From there it was an easy conquest of Russia (where I secured my own rubber - they had no fewer than 5 sources!), slowed only by my desire to capture instead of raze their cities.<br />
<br />
I finished this around 1850AD. Who to go after next? Well I was petrified that Egypt would win a cultural victory - you should have seen their culture on the histograph - so I landed 16 tanks on their mainland and declared war. I captured the first city and rushed an airport, then started flying in first tanks, then modern armor. I razed all Egyptian cities because of their immense culture, and by 1878 I had wiped out all of Egypt's cities on their main island. :mwaha: A peace treaty gave me all of their cities except their capital. I had gotten Greece in on this war and collapsed their government to communism too. An interesting point is that I never built any nval units except transport ones; I was able to avoid naval warfare using airports and by bombarding their naval units with lots of artillery. In a close game, building naval units can sometimes be a waste of resources. <br />
<br />
The next 10 turns were spent moving my forces into a position to attack the Greeks. I had a choice to make: betray Greece with a ROP in order to cut off their ONLY source of rubber or attack in normal fashion and struggle through masses of conscripted infantry. I felt bad, because I never do this to the computer, but I did betray them :( and took out their rubber. The war began in 1908 and finished in 1942 with the complete destruction of the Greeks, as I had a lot of their workers captured and didn't want to risk the cities reverting. From there it was build up my score until 2050...<br />
<br />
...except that in 2016 a city that had been building a cathedral one shield at a time for apparently the last 80 turns finished it and expanded its borders, triggering a domination victory. D'oh! :smoke: I had sold my temples to ensure that wouldn't happen. Well, getting any victory at all was good after my terribly bad start. Score should be somewhat in the middle - I won't list it because I know we aren't supposed to put them on this forum. <br />
<br />
Lessons from Game:<br />
1) If the starting position sucks, build in the ICS style and manage the few good tiles. My pseudo approach to this helped considerably more than I though it would.<br />
2) If you're weak, buy tech! I was buying tech for most of the game since there was no way I could research it faster than the AI. Try to build Theory of Evolution to get ahead. <br />
3) If a war is going poorly, don't hesitate to sign a gpt treaty to end it. Russia could have crushed me at one time in this game but they were content with a painful gpt treaty. I wonder what they were thinking when my tanks rolled over the border 2000 years later. <br />
4) Take advantage of the AI feeding frenzy if you get an opportunity, like I did against Japan. The computer is bad at capturing cities, so you can sneak in with small forces and make big gains. <br />
5) Don't give up if your start sucks! It can be overcome with some luck and a lot of good planning. :king:</div></div><hr />

(Washington itself isn't bad...just that it's so cramped and you probably get split or have to go to war RIGHT away). When I first attempted the GOTM, it was my first Monarch game. I was destroyed around 1600 AD. Now that I have replayed it once, I am living and even thriving, researching just as fast as others (faster than the Japs), and currently taking over the Japs to try to get my points up even higher still! It looks as if I may even win. Granted I lost once, but no harm done AT ALL! I now will play on at least Monarch level when I play Civ 3...if doing good upon replay in THIS starting position is possible, then it's possible in ANY starting position. Just have to compensate! Of course, it also helps to know the map the 2nd time through, but the start is unusually bad, so I have confidence I can handle Monarch fairly well now ;)<br />
<br />
Anyone up for Emperor next month? If I can live to 2050 on Emperor, it'd be a HUGE boost of my confidence! ;) In the meantime, I'm gunna finish up the replay; if I don't win that (but I very well could), I will do a random Monarch map and never look back to lower levels (well, at least, rarely...still it can be fun sometimes to go back for a moment). And to think once upon a time I thought Monarch was impossible!<br />

Now if the GOTM people are mean, or just want to keep us on our toes, #6 will require totally different types of strategies. <br />
<br />
I've got to say that I really enjoyed Monarch+bad starting position better than I would have liked Emperor+good starting position, even if the two come out to be equally hard. It just felt good to scratch your way from being a marginal power on the little peninsula to being a multi-continental super-nation.</div></div><hr />

This gives satisfaction and further refinement ;) Anyway, that's just my suggestion, as the idea is to get better. Going back to Regent after Deity too will mean you will be better, AND be able to be satisfied that you are better ;) No I'm not saying this just for my own good--I'll be in training for most of May and part of June, then I've got a wedding to plan, so I'm gunna hafta bow out of the May, June GOTMs...I just think it's a good idea in general to naturally push people toward progression, and then give them a way after Deity to show they actually ARE progressing!<br />

<br />
This was also my first game on Monarch difficulty.  I settled immediately and put NY by the cow near Paris.  It seemed the only decent patch around. I did get the goodie hut east of Paris and got Ceremonial Burial.  What is funny is that I put Boston in the hills north of Washington before I learned iron working and horseback riding and missed the iron and the horse.  I was able to build a temple to get the horse, but I had to send another settler to get the iron.  From NY I sent settlers to found 2 cities west in the jungle.  I was waiting until I had a decent amount of horseman and swordsmen to attack France.  Since I had to wait so long due to my unfortunate placement of Boston, I was given an ultimatum by Russia.  I gave in once, but the second time around 400 BC I said no and it meant war.  I did not want war, since France was my target(and Russia was much bigger than I), so I trashed a Russian size 1 city (Sverdlosk)and they agreed to peace at no cost.  I switch to Monarchy and then attack Paris in 50 AD.  I am dead last on the histogram at this point and have been the whole game.  The war lasted until around 110 AD. I get a few French cities and some tech.  I found Seattle on the Greek island around 190 AD to get silks.  I am surprised the Greeks left the spot open.  250 AD I polish off the last French city.  450 AD I use a ROP to attack the Russians.  They are so much bigger that treachery is the only way.  I take out Moscow and Minsk immediately :) Two other Russian cities fall quickly and then it is a long slow war.  Finally I get a GL, build FP in Moscow, take  3 more cities including their source of iron and horses.  This war ends 670AD.  Then I focus on Japan who had made some ulitimatums.  I take five Japanese cities fairly quickly starting around 860 AD including Kyoto which has the Great Wall.  Then another fairly long war.  I got another GL and built JS Bach's.  Finally 1130 AD and I get 3 cities for peace.  I give one to Egypt on the other side of Greece.  Then turn and finish off Russia 1260 - 1305, finally switch to Democracy, then back to finish off the Japs 1330 - 1350.  In 1375 I attack the Greeks and take their 5 largest cities.  I stop in 1400 to consolidate and prevent war weariness.  I am pleasantly surprised that no Greek cities flip.  Athens was size 11 when I attacked it.  I did build 3 workers and kept alot of troops in it, but I have never kept a city that big before.  I would have razed it but, it had 2 wonders.  My warmongering ways now seem to catch up to me and Egypt and Greece sign a trade embargo against me.  Then I ask Egypt to go to war with Greece and they do in 1445.  By now I have cavaly and railroads and Greece goes down fairly fast.  I was surprised how effective cavalry was against riflemen.  Of course when you have 20+ cavalry it helps.  I rushed temples and in 1495 AD I got a domination victory.  When I looked at the top 5 cities they were all Egyptian.  <br />
<br />
I think my biggest mistakes were researching tech until halfway through the ancient era since no one would trade with me.  I seemed to be researching the same things as every else and basically wasting my money.  If I had just saved my money I should have been able to buy it.  If I could have put NY on the iron I could have attacked France much earlier.  I would have used the palace jump, but I only learned about it reading this forum.  ICS probably would have helped.  I also researched Military Tradition a little late since I did not notice the other civs had moved into the industrial age until they had researched 2 techs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ButSam</div><div class="date">Mar 24, 2002, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally found that if I traded to the east, until the Industrial age, I could trade techs for the gems, furs (once I took over Paris), and other luxuries I had lying around...that's what saved me (on the replay AND original...though I did a lot better on the replay as is to be expected). By the Industrial age, I had a solid basis to research. My problem the first time through (the one that counted) was that I built neglecting my military...and I didn't get the Iron source--France did...so I couldn't defeat France early-on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given the rotten starting position, I decided to put both Washington and New York at the shores near the starting position, instead of Washington in the middle, and the next few cities sat on the hills and never grew beyond size 6.<br />
<br />
Tried to be peaceful, but in 1750 BC Russia demanded 1 gold as tribute and I said no ...<br />
<br />
Thus started the Great War during which everybody else sided with Russia and kept invading my small territory :mad:. But we defended fiercely, our spearmen even killed archers in the attack and we never lost a city!<br />
<br />
Things looked bleak though when finally the Egyptian invasion forces landed on our hills in masses, but fortunately they accepted my peace offer or we would surely have been wiped out. Russia continued the war until in 560 AD some guy named Washington rose from the rubble, shortly after the Colossus started our Golden Age. :)<br />
From then on we were able to keep the peace; the AI tribes never fought each other in this game.<br />
<br />
Later, George would built us Bach's Cathedral ...<br />
the Forbidden Palace in Houston on the island south came sloooooowww but the site proved the best as Houston found coal and iron, and completed the Iron Works in 1495 AD.<br />
<br />
Step by step the USA climbed the ladder, always concentrating on infrastruture. In 600 AD we overtook France and claimed 5th place, in 1275 AD Japan was next and from then on we were unstoppable, until finally in 1760 AD we caught up with Egypt. Trading for 7 luxuries (Russia never offered us gems during the entire game, but they were nice enough trading their extra rubber) and putting cities in every open spot, the USA democracy prospered.<br />
<br />
That was, until 1772 AD when it appeared we had no uranium and could only get it from Egypt for 100 gold per turn ...<br />
<br />
But our people prayed and behold, 8 years later a source of uranium popped up in our lands and we were free once more.<br />
<br />
In the year of 1794 AD, Houston completed the United Nations, 10 years after Washington built the Apollo Program. Everyone was now in awe of our culture and voted for us (except Russia of course): Lincoln the Lion-Hearted victorious for a score of a measly 2557 points. :)<br />
<br />
In what is known as the Alternative History Line, the USA launched its Space Ship in 1838 AD which gave a score of no more than 2512.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In hindsight, I way overbuilt and could have <br />
begun my final science burst much earlier. Also, the Forbidden Palace could have been completed a lot sooner had I payed attention and developed Houston's city area with priority. <br />
<br />
In the early game, the late discovery of construction severely hampered the growth of my core cities. It also seemed that every tribe always researched the exact same tech. And of course the war came when I wasn't ready for it ... but who wants to give in to Russia, even for 1 gold? ;)</div></div><hr />

Horrible starting possition. <br />
Russia gobelled up all the good terrain and i was forced to build in deserts, hills, tundras and jungles. <br />

V.1.17f screwed me up to. None of the civs would trade. It was the typical situation with the tech tree where all the civs gang up on you. I hate 1.17f :mad: <br />

I could have waited longer and let the Russian conquer me over, but i retired with a score of 570.  It could have gone to 600 if i had some patience. <br />
<br />
I managed to eliminate France, because i cut off their horses, and had my city built near the iron so they had no horsemn or swordsmen. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Russia threatened us a lot.<br />
<br />
Well, I think the 1st could be because they had ample room to grow &amp; expand (&amp; also had the only river!)  Since most of us looked to knock off France, Russia may have seen us as weak?<br />
<br />
2. Generating leaders off of Russia.<br />
<br />
Indirect result of a longer &amp; tougher war against Russia?<br />
<br />
Something about Russia ;) ...<br />
<br />
I also wondered which AI civ chalked up the most wins or finished 2nd?  Egypt?</div></div><hr />

The start position was challenging, but I didn't go through the Russian terror that others had to deal with. I forced France to respawn early in the game thanks to an ancient pair of swordmen, and marched early to deny Russia the use of Iron. A troop of determined horsemen were able to raze a few cities and capture Moscow, effectively crippling them for the rest of the game. I let them eke out an existence in their diminished state and skirmish with France while I set my sights on Japan. I was planning on a massive knights' campaign to wipe them out, followed by the Greeks and the Egyptians, but a barbarian uprising forced me to choose between spending my treasury or financing their drunken revelries. I had built 7 cities in the hills north of Washington that could be counted on as a military backbone, and without money I opted for a longbowman army to accomplish my short-term goals. One boatload burned down the Greek capital, which more or less shut them up, while Japan put up a bigger struggle. In the long run I probably would have been better off mounting a delayed knights' crusade-those dang longbowmen just lay down and die where a knight would flee to fight another day. By the time Japan had been brought to heel I let them alone to mop up later, and conquered the grecian homeland with knights. But by the conclusion of this war I just didn't have the forces to be effective against Egyptian musketmen. I'd been keeping them poor the whole game through luxury trading, and with no allies to turn to for help they were sitting ducks, but still a tough nut to crack. I figured they would be best disposed of if I sent in an advance force of musketmen, then riflemen, to pillage every tile improvement worth messing with and destory their production ability. They went nuts rush-building forces who knocked themselves out trying to expel these stalwart defenders, and by the time I was ready to start razing I had a force of cavalry to burn their population 1 towns. Still, my worldwide genocide wasn't complete until 1780--I'm sure plenty of others finished before this date. Looking back I should have at least burned Thebes down while they were still using pikemen to weaken their empire, but they were funding my earlier campaigns and I was too scared of defeat. So I won, but I would've done better if I hadn't been so focused on short-term strategies. Hey, this was my first ever Civ3 conquest victory, give me some credit. And I'm not a milker, I just don't have the patience, so I doubt I'll ever get a high score that way. Maybe the gods of the Civ3 forum will send us a deity-level game to really test our mettle, and I'll be motivated to milk it. Great map, Matrix!</div></div><hr />

Concerning the tech tree, the AI always goes for the tech that takes fewer turns to be discovered. Dont follow the AI pattern in order to have techs to trade with the others. You can also buy old techs at quite attractive prices (30 or less gold coins or just the World Map).<br />

With v1.17f trade with the AI is more complicated, but I believe it was too easy before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I spent most of today playing this GOTM. I have one simple question, are they all this difficult? - I mean what a nasty starting place!<br />
<br />
First I got three citys in that little bit you start on, one down the bottom, one where you spawn and one by the Iron. I got the Great Libary wonder - it was the only way I stood a chance of keeping out with tech's. I attacked France, and starting loosing, then Russia joined in on my side. France was slaughted, I took back my lost citys and - to my extreme happyness - found that Russia was destroying, not capturing, citys! A huge gap appeared on the map. A quick rush of four settlers and I had more than doubled my city count. :goodjob:<br />
<br />
I was lucky enought to get the UN built. I won on the third/four voting run, after having time to butter-up Egypt and Japan so they would vote for me. :D<br />
<br />
I know the dealine is the 2nd of April, but when to the results come out? Also, I guess there is one next month. I hope it's easier next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeM</div><div class="date">Mar 25, 2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Like most this didn't look to be an easy Monarch game from the start, so I took some advice on tactics I've read in other threads.  Namely, forget researching - concentrate on money to buy the techs off other Civs.  ALthough there was some problems to begin with as all the other Civ's were stronger than me, and declared war straight away, however I did manage to keep up through buying advances.<br />
<br />
The Jap's seemed to have the best territory, so I soon attacked them with swordsmen - fairly easy to beat, however I hadn't realised that all that rich land had no rivers...! A thousand years later and tokyo is still size 3...<br />
<br />
Greece had all that rich territory with Wheat, dyes and silks so I pummeled them, actually easier than I expected.  Two swordsmen and one horseman did the trick.<br />
<br />
Kept trading, trading, trading but I had to catch up in the race. Fourth place behind France, Egypt then Russia.  Keeping Egypt as a pal (MPP) I attacked France with Cavalry.<br />
<br />
France had been begging Iron from me for ages, so it was only with a little suprise that the war was easily one.  Those French Musketeers took a toll on my Cavalry, but at last produced a Great Leader!<br />
<br />
Used him to build an Army (Just so that I could build the Heroic Epic) and left France with a few pitiful Arctic cities.<br />
<br />
Now I'm no.3, 1300's I think and only Egypt to trade with (I like the way the advisor keeps telling me &quot;X have signed a trade embargo with Y!  I told you they were evil...&quot;.)<br />
<br />
Rather follishly I got impatient and now I've started a war against Russia with only a few troops. I took one city easily, but they've got dozens of swordsmen that keep killing my exposed cavalry.  I've switched to wartime economy, but I can't produce enough troops.  I'm down to a few cavalry and my Army, plus a few riflemen...<br />
<br />
Defence, should be easy, but attack...They've got too many troops.  Japan, Greece and France provided a false sense of security and now I may find myself in trouble as I sue for peace...<br />
<br />
We'll see how it goes!<br />

<br />
It sounds as though your considering disbanding Washington to move your palace.  I wouldn't do this late in the game as there is too much to lose and there are no garentee where it will move to.<br />
<br />
You could always build a palace in a better location with a leader or even producing it normally.  Buiilding it normally is feasible in democracy if the city is not too far from your capital.  The city near the gems might be good or maybe a little closer to Moscow if there's enough production.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">whb</div><div class="date">Mar 25, 2002, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been quite a unique game -- the AI has done most of my researching and warring for me.<br />
<br />
The start went quite badly...  Having been hemmed in by France and Russia, I founded New York (south) and Boston (northwest) Without Iron Working, I didn't know the iron was there -- I was trying to get to mapmaking to jump onto the continent to the east.   But I got lucky, and both Boston and NY had iron next to them (I think the NY one might have appeared spontaneously, but before I discovered Iron Working).<br />
<br />
Anyway, France and Russia went to war with me. I took Paris and made peace with the French, but had to pay hefty gold-per-turn to get peace with Russia (the battle of Paris had left me with very little military still alive, and Russia's might was bearing down on me).<br />
<br />
When I met the Japanese (who thwarted my plans to expand east), I traded communications to get back in the tech race.  For the next thousand years or so, I survived by trading incense, iron and furs for technology.  Russia and Egypt went to a fruitless war (no cities changed hands) but at least that kept the biggest powers in the game occupied.  I was coming last, by the way.<br />
<br />
Maps changed hands, and the next race was identified -- the two continents to the south were uninhabited.  So, America started pumping out galleys and settlers from its four meagre cities.  France built the lighthouse, and started sailing for these new worlds too.  Egypt, expaning slowly east, for some reason didn't take these continents (maybe the war with Russia had their hands tied).  Greece woke up and threw everything it had at colonising these continents it hadn't noticed to its west.<br />
<br />
SE continent: I managed to found Philadelphia in a good spot, and Atlanta on the spice-fields.  Greece and France took the rest of that continent<br />
SW continent: Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle (all in ok locations) were as far as I got before the Greeks, French and Russians took the rest.  <br />
South Island: Miami squeezed onto the island at the far south, next to the Egyptians and Russians who had finally made peace with each other.  <br />
<br />
Tech-wise, the world was racing to industrial times.  I was still last.   But then the miracle: my foreign advisor appears with a shocked look -- the Russians declared war on the Greeks!  Soon the rest of the world (apart from me) joined in.  <br />
<br />
SW continent: Tours fell to America by cultural assimilation.  Greece razed the other French city and America quickly founded St Louis in its place.  Russia gradually razed all the Greeks cities on the continent, and American cities soon replaced them too.   Philadelphia slowly built the Forbidden Palace, a factory and the Iron Works, and became my most productive city.<br />
<br />
SE continent: Houston was founded to culture-bomb Grenoble and Dijon (which had no culture) -- a success.  The Russians razed all the Greek cities, and American cities replaced them.<br />
<br />
By the 1600s, America had taken over the SW continent completely, and only 1 Russian city (on hilly terrain) shared the SE continent with us -- and all without fighting a battle!  By about 1750, America had grown enough to be able to keep two infantry and one artillery in every city, and was finally building an offensive navy too (battleships).<br />
<br />
In 1788, Miami defected to the Egyptians, taking one of my two oilfields -- a sad and embarrassing miscalculation of the number of units required to keep my cities mine.  Russia and Egypt are back at war, and the Greeks are extinct.  On averaged score, I'm only 4th (behind Russia, Egypt, Japan), but I'm 2nd for population and 3rd for territory now.   I've been having to part-research techs before I can afford to trade for them now, but with Russia and Egypt now at war, I might be able to research my own tech lead.<br />
<br />
It's not going to be a high scorer, but a diplomatic or space race victory are still on the cards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2002, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started late this month again, just yesterday.<br />
The story so far, 10AD, is comparable to others here but not so bad. :p<br />
I started by founding Washington immediatly, getting the spice and sending my scout north. So I quickly discovered the French and later the Russians. I was only able to pop one hut again, the one on the northeastern tundra near Russia. I was so excited to see a settler come out of it but somehow a barbarian camp came out of nowhere on the hills west of it. So my settler and scout were trapped and after a while defeated. :mad: <br />
Meanwhile I had founded New York next to the cattle west of France and another city on a hill next to the iron. Both AI countries were researching several techs, which I bought and put to good use. But pretty early both France and Russia decided to ally against me and declared war. :crazyeye: <br />
At that time I had my first swordman built and others were almost ready. The French didn´t undertake any &quot;real&quot; attack, only some warriors agains my iron city which were easily repelled by the swordsman. The timing at that point couldn´t have been better. After increasing my military strength I drove on to Paris and captured it while razing another city near the horses, where I already had settled a hill city. This allowed me to make peace on favorable terms with the French, gaining some gold and techs, including MapMaking. I also gained a great leader, which was used to rush the Lighthouse at Washington. The French were no more threat with only one tundra city, so I turned towards Russia and sent my veteran and elite swordsmen there, still in the BCs. Russia itself was dumb enough NOT to build a road to their source of iron and I conquered Moscow after defending against various onslaughts of warriors and archers. The siege of Moscow also produced another GL used for the FP right there. The remaining cities didn´t pose much of threat and were consequently eliminated in the further process. :lol:<br />
At that time the first American galleys began their circumvention of the world, discovering all other civs and new uninhabited islands.<br />
Peace was signed with Russia in exchange for some more gold and a tech and a city. Now they only have 2 tundra cities left, which will fall shortly. But the extermination of the French proved to be a mistake. On destroying their last city, they somehow revived in the northern tundra region. Maybe they also had settled that place, because I saw one galley moving up there, I´m not sure. Anyway, they will also fall soon. :cool:<br />
It is now 1AD, I have one turn left to the discovery of Monarchy, several nice trades were accomplished selling my world map and even luxury trade with Egypt is going well.<br />
Because of this small map and bad terrain I will go for an early conquest, probably using knights. The outcome will depend on how well the remaining AI defends.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beard Rinker</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2002, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Continued from a previous post.<br />
<br />
The End Game Plan<br />
<br />
Date: March 4.  I had just completed taking Spice Island from the Greeks to secure my sixth source of luxuries.  I was ahead of all AI's in all the important categories: land size, production, technology, and population.  Furthermore, it seems chiefpaco, SirPleb and Aeson have finally cracked how the domination victory threshold is calculated.<br />
<br />
With 4 weeks to complete the game and the game essentially won, it looked like a milk run is in order.<br />
<br />
My strategy for maximizing score was as follows:<br />
  Take the maximum territory allowed without triggering domination.  At this point, I held about 25% of all land and coastal tiles.<br />
  Maximize population.  This means the priority tiles are food producing tiles regardless of their distance from the capital.  Production and gold are only required for building an infrastructure and keeping the AI's in line.  All military requirements can be met from the core cities and any improvements in new cities can be bought.<br />
  Maximize happiness.  There are several ways to do this.  Taking the last two luxuries is the most obvious as they are worth 4 happy faces per city each with a market place.  Another way to do this is to place cities close together, keeping their working population sizes small.  Small cities can be kept happy on luxuries alone or with a few cheap improvements.  They also grow quicker.  A town with an aqueduct and marketplace can grow to size 12 with up to 11 happy working citizens (2 born content + 20 happy faces from lux = 11 happy citizens).<br />
<br />
My plan for accomplishing this was as follows:<br />
 Settle all high food areas.  Currently, there is a large high food area south of my Greek holdings which are empty (thanks to the Japanese) and could be quickly settled.  All new towns in high corruption areas will be crowded closely to minimize the required improvements.  The aim of this approach being minimizing the number of required city improvements and keeping the city sizes to 12 or less.<br />
  Build or dedicate some towns to exclusively producing settlers.  These will be used to quickly settle or resettle high food areas..<br />
  Remove Egyptians from Egypt to claim last two luxuries.<br />
  Decimate remaining AI opponents.  This will greatly simplify populating all of the high food areas.  It will also allow me better control of my borders as culture-producing improvements can be skipped or removed to prevent border expansions.<br />
  When nearing the domination threshold, fine-tune the ground utilization of the core cities.  This might include disbanding cities in areas that cannot be fully utilized or removing cultural improvements to prevent border expansions.<br />
<br />
Thus far in the game, I have one minor diplomatic black mark from the ancient era and only the Russians know about it.  This plan will certainly call for a number of diplomatic transgressions and depending on my form of government, this may have negative consequences.  My choice was to stay as a republic and possibly change to democracy after the military phase if the extra cash is required.  My reasoning was as follows:<br />
  This is my current form of government (no anarchy to get there), and I have the Universal Suffrage wonder.  By taking out one AI opponent at a time and keeping the battles as short as possible, war weariness should be minimized.  Production, gold and research are also adequate for the military phase.<br />
  Democracy was ruled out as it may fall into anarchy during the military phase.  The extra production, gold and faster research would be helpful but not essential.<br />
  Communism was ruled out as the only form of rushing is population rushing.  This contradicts my objectives of maximizing population and happiness.<br />
  Monarchy was ruled out as this is an inferior form of government to republic.  The no war weariness attribute is appealing but going into anarchy to get there and the reduced production, gold and research are too high a cost.<br />
<br />
The Milk Run<br />
<br />
With the plan laid out, I switched three lower production cities to producing settlers.  The first few settlers were used to build towns near the forbidden palace and a granary was rushed in each of them.  These towns were also used to produce settlers as needed.<br />
<br />
In no time I was producing 1 or 2 settlers per turn and founding the same number of towns.  The former Greek territory filled up quickly even with the tight city spacing I was using.<br />
<br />
My current military objective was Egypt.  I was researching towards electronics with the goal of building the Hoover Dam, triggering a golden age and flooding the Egyptians with cavalry.  However, while I was settling the former Greek territory, I noticed the Egyptians had discovered replaceable parts.  Cavalry against infantry!  This could get very ugly.<br />
<br />
I sent two galleons down the east and west coasts of Egypt carrying 2 riflemen, 1 cannon and a cavalry each.  My thought was once I discovered replaceable parts (I would get it with the completion of The Theory of Evolution wonder), rubber would be revealed and I could rush in and cut off their rubber supply then follow it up with a large invasion.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I realized the folly of this plan before starting a war with the Egyptians.  If lucky the rubber would appear within quick range of my galleons and in the open.  The landing party could then cut the supply but would likely end up fodder under the Egyptian cavalries hooves.  The Egyptians had lots of ironclads so reinforcements would be difficult.  Not only that, I was still two techs from electronics and the Hoover Dam.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I had easy access to what was left of Russian land and they had not discovered replaceable parts.  If I attacked the Russians, I would at least keep up my expansion momentum.  The Egyptians would have to wait until tanks.  As it turned out, they had two rubber supplies, one of them under a city.<br />
<br />
I declared war on the Russians (2nd black mark in the game) and immediately captured two large Russian cities.  The next turn, I attempted to take a small town on a hill and lost my army and several cavalries without taking the town.  Perhaps they sensed I was going to raze the town.<br />
<br />
The Russian attack stalemated at this point so I switched tactics.  All available cannons were upgraded to artillery and three cities were dedicated to producing artillery.  I also sent in some settler/infantry pairs to start the resettlement process.  No need to wait for their towns to be removed.<br />
<br />
This tactic broke the stalemate.  After several artillery barrages, that hilltop town fell and was razed by my cavalry.  After taking a few more towns with the artillery/cavalry combination the Russian defenses were quite weak.  Many towns were taken with cavalry alone.<br />
<br />
I had the Russians down to 1 tundra town near their starting position and 4 more towns at random points on the map.  Since I had captured some towns and didn't want to risk culture flipping, the Russians had to be wiped out.<br />
<br />
I negotiated a peace treaty, getting their 4 remote towns in the negotiations.  I them promptly destroyed their last town.  Another diplomatic black mark, but there was little the Japanese or Egyptians could do to me by this point anyway.<br />
<br />
With the Russians gone, I considered an Egyptian invasion again.  The Hoover Dam and the start of my golden age were only 2 turns away.  Although I was still four techs or about 30 turns away from producing tanks, the artillery/cavalry combination worked well on the tough Russian cities and I reasoned they could have similar success against the Egyptians.<br />
<br />
The closest point to the Egyptians was a town on the west coast of the former Greek land.  Galleons could travell from there to Egypt in one turn.  I could have 4 galleons and a couple of ironclads at the rally point within a few turns giving me an invasion force of 16 units with reinforcements arriving every two turns.<br />
<br />
The Egyptian invasion was similar to the Greek invasion but slower.  I built a town at the landing point and rushed some improvements.  All Egyptian cities on the island were razed and the choice locations resettled.  The biggest difference from the Greek invasion was artillery were used to soften up the cities, pounding all defenders to 1 hp before the cavalry moved in.  There were some cavalry lost to 1 hp infantry and a mild Egyptian counterattack, but casualties were light.<br />
<br />
While the Egyptian invasion was under way, I engaged the Japanese in a different kind of war; a cultural war.  The Japanese had 3 isolated towns in the former Greek territory that were located on good ground.  Temples and libraries were rushed in the surrounding towns with the goal of culturally assimilating those towns.  My culture was approximately double the Japanese so their was a fair chance these towns could be assimilated while engaged with the Egyptians.<br />
<br />
During the battle with the Egyptians, another great leader emerged.  I decided to take a risk and used this leader to move my palace to the middle of the former Greek land.  My reasoning was as follows:<br />
  This would speed up development of the new towns in the Greek land.  Even though I only needed to buy a couple of improvements per town, there were allot of new towns and the war effort also required gold.<br />
  This would give a boost to the cultural war with Japan as the towns I want from them would be much closer to my capital.<br />
<br />
This strategy did have risks however.  All towns near Washington would have poor or no production and the towns near the new capital may not be able to contribute much before the end of the game.<br />
<br />
Shortly after relocating my palace I was caught attempting to plant a spy in Japan.  Japan declared war while I was still evicting the Egyptians from their home island giving me a two front war.<br />
<br />
By this point, I was so far ahead of the Egyptians and Japanese that it didn't prove to be much of a problem.  The momentum lost on the Egyptian front was more than made up for on the Japanese front.<br />
<br />
It's difficult to tell if a late game palace move was beneficial.  The location was certainly better, but the cities around the palace were not able to help much until well after the wars were complete.  The added gold they provided did help in rushing improvements late in the game.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the game consisted of fine tuning my empire.  All cities were groomed for maximum population and happiness and border expansion was stopped just under the domination threshold.   Three opponents were left at the end, the Egyptians, Japanese and Greeks and all were located in areas consisting of tundra, hills and mountains.<br />
<br />
By the time my empire was groomed to its maximum potential, all but 1 or 2 working citizens were happy and nearly every tile in my territory was being worked.  This was done with luxuries set at 0%.  Most towns had a maximum population of 12 or less and all towns had marketplaces.  According to SirPleb's score calculator, my internal score was over 17,000 at one point.  As per the rules, I won't say what my final score was but it should be at least in the top 10 this month.<br />
<br />
The Final Bit of Cheese<br />
<br />
The only decision left in this game was the victory condition.  Since the game was milked until 2050, there is no difference point-wise for any victory condition.<br />
<br />
When making this decision, all victory types were still possible although diplomatic victory would be difficult.<br />
<br />
Awards are given for the highest score for each victory condition.  After looking at the high scores, I noticed that the award for highest score by retirement in 2050 is always the lowest of the high scores.  Blinded by lust for an award of any kind, I decide to finish my game with a histographic victory.<br />
<br />
Side Notes<br />
<br />
Being expansionist this month did not prove to be much of an advantage.  I only got one goody hut and it was empty.  I think the Russians got all the rest on our starting island as they had way more technology than me when I first met them.<br />

At one point early in the game in the Japanese and Russians were at war.  The Japanese had two miserable towns on the north eastern coast of our home island and the Russians were located west of the former Moscow.  The Japanese would send one or two lonely archers marching 20 to 30 tiles through forest, over mountains and across a desert in futile attempts at attacking the Russians.<br />
<br />
When taking Spice Island, I noticed one of the cities had access to coal and iron.  I thought Iron Works may be possible but by the time I built a town there and expanded my borders, the coal had vanished.  Iron works was available later in a city near the former Greek capital but by that time it wasn't needed.<br />
<br />
Despite this obviously cheesy attempt at getting an award, I am looking forward to the new award system next month.  Fastest finish for some victory types should allow for more diversity in play styles.  All we need now is a scoring system to match and these new awards should provide us with the raw data to develop one.<br />
<br />
Milking a game requires skill and even more patience.  You need to expand your territory and population as fast as possible while at the same time keeping as many citizens as possible happy. It took me until March 4 to get to the point where I felt the game was won and it then took me until March 26 to complete the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">whb</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2002, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished my game last night.  Having seen the replay, I've noticed I got some dates wrong in my last post (eg Miami defected in 1766, not 1788), but not by much.<br />
<br />
My plan for a diplomatic victory was scuppered sadly -- I had the whole world happy with me, and Catherine and Cleopatra had gone to war with each other again, so things were looking good.  But then, Cleopatra persuaded Joan to join in the war.  15 years before I finished the UN, the Russians wiped out France.  The vote went 2 for me, 1 for Catherine, 1 for Cleopatra -- result inconclusive.  I needed Joan's vote, but she was gone.   :(<br />
<br />
Russia made peace with Egypt soon after.  <br />
<br />
Having seen the Russians wipe out Greece and France, I got nervous and signed an MPP with Egypt.  Russia soon went to war with Japan, so I think I did the right thing.<br />
<br />
Then the tension came...  I was heading full-pelt for a space race win, and was jealously keeping Computers from everyone else.  When Catherine turned up demanding I hand the tech over, I said no, and we were at war :eek:  Egypt came in on my side, under the MPP.<br />
<br />
Now here's the problem: Russia had been supplying me with rubber.  While I had upgraded to a mostly mech inf army, I only had two tanks.  Neither Egypt nor Japan could spare any rubber.  :cringe:   So, every bomber and artillety unit in America moved to defend Paris and Boston, damaging Catherine's forces and making them go home for repairs before they could attack.  A trickle of tanks were let through to die in attacks on my mech inf &amp; artillery defended metropolises (esp Boston, which was on a hill).  F-15s gradually took out Catherine's air force.   With a few bombers and a cavalry, I destroyed the Russian city of Orleans (which had been defended only by an infantry), and that helpfully removed Russia's uranium supply.  I built two or 3 nukes (2 tactical, 1 ICBM) but didn't use them.  Eventually, Russia agreed a peace without tribute.  <br />
<br />
The F15s had tiggered a golden age, which carried me through the years of spaceship production to a final launch.  :beer:<br />
<br />
And to add the cream to the cake, Russia and Egypt had reduced each other enough in the war that America was #1 for population and territory at the end! :)</div></div><hr />

my internal score was over 17,000 at one pointWow, that's impressive, very nice! Of course more dates are what we need to estimate your actual score and you carefully left those out :lol: I'm sure looking forward to seeing the result! (BTW my internal score maxed at 15500 on this one. You clearly milked it better :))</div></div><hr />

After looking at the high scores, I noticed that the award for highest score by retirement in 2050 is always the lowest of the high scores. Blinded by lust for an award of any kind, I decide to finish my game with a histographic victory. <br />
<br />
:lol: <br />
<br />
I tried the same thing, it's mostly a guessing game.  I don't think I scored well enough to place, but an award was still a possibility.  I figured Cultural might be the black sheep this game, but then SirPleb had to go for it too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Mar 29, 2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Continuing story from 1AD:<br />
They didn´t defend so hard at all, at least not in the beginning.<br />
It all began with the invasion of Japan. I had made RoPs with all of them and used them to my best. The Japenese were relatively easy to defeat, just spearmen against my knights and a few swordmen. It didn´t take long and soon my forces were able to move in position for the attack on Greece. :p<br />
The greek Hoplites did put up a decent fight but with overwhelming numbers and steady reinforcements it didn´t take too long either. I made peace with them for some hard to get cities and went on to the last target.<br />
The Egyptians were in the process of upgrading to pikemen when my attack began. So it did take some time but in the initial attack I captured their capital and the 2 northern cities, thus cutting them off from their iron supply. They also didn´t have much offensive units to mount a decent counterattack so it went into the same direction as before. :lol:<br />
But when I captured the remaining Greek cities they unfortunately respawned and it took me at least 10 more turns to get my forces to that place. :mad:<br />
Anyway, sooner or later it ended with another reasonably well score. I´m sure milking will bring up some better scores, but much earlier conquests would be awesome! Let´s see.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

by the Egyptians   , although I ended the game in 2024 with<br />
map domination.  If I had tried to avoid the map domination,<br />

cinder.<br />
<br />
My game went significantly different than others I've read here.<br />
Joan and I were peaceful to begin with, I built New York on the<br />
cattle square, then saw where the iron popped up and built<br />
Boston there.  Joan and I ended up at war against the Russian<br />
menace and beat them back, but then I lost a city by cultural<br />
conversion to Joan.  Realizing that she didn't have iron, but<br />
she and everybody else had a big culture lead on me, that<br />
meant war.  I wiped out the French,  then went back to war<br />
with the Russians.  I'd expand, make a peace, start losing cities<br />
to culture, then have to fight again.  The Russian cossacks almost<br />
did me in, but we rallied and crushed the Russians after Washington<br />
built the Forbidden Palace in Buffalo.  Meanwhile,<br />
the Japanese and Greeks had been harassing my rear every so often.<br />
Eventally, the Greeks wiped out the Japanese, so then I had to<br />
wipe out the Greeks with Egyptian assistance.  Then, of course,<br />
that left the Egyptians, who were by that time so far ahead culturally<br />
that I was toast.</div></div><hr />

Got a conquest victory 830AD with final score 7050.  I could of gotten higher if I stopped making knights in near the end and went for settlers/land.   Here are some key points.<br />
-Took Paris very early with first warrior.<br />
-Disbanded and rebuilt Washington and Paris is new capitol.<br />
-Peace with France for 2 techs and gold.<br />
-Rushed to horsemen and produced them nonstop from 3 or 4 barracks.<br />
-Took out Moscow quick with horsemen and eventually Moscow was left with 1 tundra city.  Got a leader to make FP in Moscow.<br />
-Peace with Russia for 2 techs and gold.<br />
-Took out Japans iron producing city (Tokyo?) then Kyoto.  Got my 2nd and final leader and made pyramids there.<br />
-Back home Colossus finished building and triggered Goldgen Age.<br />
-France built Great Lighthouse and I captured and eliminated them.<br />
-Now its around 10AD and I'm finishing off Japan's spearmen with my horsemen.   Chivalry in about 5 turns, which I'll need for hoplites.<br />
-So far I've had my science at 70-80% whole game and entertainment at 0-20%.  I have a 3-5 tech lead.  I should have skipped literature since I made no libraries.<br />
-Once I got chivalry I dropped my science to 10%.  While finishing off Greece I started war with Egypt and took out its iron city.<br />
-My knights finished off Egypt.  Egypt had 5 swordsmen, archers, spearmen and warriors.  No pikemen.</div></div><hr />

Got a Domination Victory at 2050 AD.<br />
<br />
Building two wonders in the Capital in a row really me slowed my Expansion in the Start. (After taking out Russia and French...)<br />
<br />
And my dumb Idea to wait and take out Egyptians first also blew me score.<br />
<br />
But I had a lot of FUN and when I was waring against the Japanese in the Industrial Ages I used only Naval units and a Combo of [Marines/INfantry] + [Artillary]. NO tanks... even if I could.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nbarclay</div><div class="date">Mar 31, 2002, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely not a good starting position, and I'm a bit jealous of those who got a settler from a goodie hut.  All I got was some lousy maps, and a free settler would have saved me from being hurried into building New York on top of the cattle south of Paris instead of beside them.  (France had a setter essentially next to mine, so waiting another turn could have spelled trouble.)  Worse, it looks like 1.17f changed things so a city founded on top of a bonus resource can't benefit from it.<br />
<br />
For the full story, read &quot;The Greatest Voyage&quot; on the Apolyton stories forum.  (I did include a spoiler alert.)<br />
<br />
The end result was a space race victory in 1810.  I'm sure I could have milked it for a higher score than I got (not that I scored particularly badly), but playing for score instead of running my nation like a nation takes too much of the fun out of it for me.<br />

<br />
I normally go for peace, building up my economy.<br />
<br />
The land between france and Russian I set up 2 cities, and another just past the mountains near paris to get the furs, and when iron was found there was an iron in its footprint :).<br />
<br />
Then I went on to becoming a Large naval power, trireims found an island south of the Russians and then found the 2 large land masses east of that, between Egypt and Greece. So I ended up by game end with cities on 6 different land masses.<br />
Never did loose an American founded city but a few of the cities that were captured in military actions, did change a few times. (but who really cares about 1 pop cities with nothing)<br />
<br />
You can often tell when a civ is about to attack. (perfect time to get a multual defense pack with their rival :).<br />
<br />
My first big war was with greece for the land mass south of washington, next to greece, started with a settle city race and ended up with me in control of the heart of it.<br />
Next major one was egypt was moving tons of navel forces towards the small island next to them and south of russia.<br />
so got a Defense pact with russia (for 1 tech) and then fought off the egyptians. then greece attack me and the defense pack ended up being a hindrenace.  I was suffuring from War fatigue and if I got peace with egypt or greece, russia's pact would bring me back into war.<br />
<br />
Russian a few years latter decides it want to crush france. but I've blocked (and fortified) the border with russian so russian attacks me to go though my territory to crush france.<br />
Anyone ever seen what 10 bombers and 2 carriers can do to cities. :) I bombed any city in range back to the stone age.<br />
<br />
oh well it was a fun game.<br />
<br />
The best game is the one you just lose or just win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeM</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally submitted my gotm sav this morning, hopefully Matrix will accept it, grovel, grovel.<br />
<br />
I played slightly differently to most, from what I 've read a lot of people took out France and Russia first, but they seemed to strong for me and the Japanese/Greek territory looked much richer so I went for them first.  Russia turned into my worst enemy nearer the end, but the didn't get tanks so they had no chance.<br />
<br />
Couldn't decide on what victory to go for, but I had run out of time to submit the game so I took the Space victory.  Would have preferred Diplomatic as I haven't done that one yet, but there you go.<br />
<br />
Lord knows how long it will take to complete gotm6 as it's on a large map...</div></div><hr />

I've kept my word. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">civ_steve</div><div class="date">Apr 04, 2002, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just as I thought would happen, I played until 11:30 pm April 2nd, and couldn't quite pull a domination victory out of the hat.  No submittal for me, Sigh!!<br />
<br />
Quick recap: scouted around, felt I had to beat the French to the area South of Paris to have any chance.  My settler and two warriors against his settler and 1 warrior meant Victory for me.  I established New York just north of the Gem mountains, and started a road back to Washington.  A barracks and several veteran warriors later and Paris was mine, after he gave me all his techs for a peace which didn't last long.  (The AI seemed to make contact and trade techs amazingly fast.)  Boston was then founded next to the hills SW of Paris, and I eventually made my FP there.  I never did change my palace away from DC.<br />
<br />
The Russians attacked me several times over the ages.  Each time I beat them back and took some cities.  I suppose if I had pushed the issue, taken Moscow, then arranged my palace and FP like Zachariel did, this would have worked better, but I didn't finally kick the Russians off my starting continent until mid 1800's.<br />
<br />
The Japanese took out the Greeks in the early 1700's.  I allied with Alexander, and eventually beat up the Japanese in the early 1900's.  Egypt and I have had Naval-Air battles, but only limited land battles.<br />
<br />
So, its now 1953, and we're a few techs into the Modern era.  France and Greece are totally gone.  Russia is down to 4 cities on spread out islands.  Japan is down to 1 city on a remote island.  Egypt is culturally well ahead of me.  I own two continents, the spice island and most of the mountainous island, and I've been rushing settlers out to fill in the gaps, but still no domination victory!  I must be really close.  Oh well!</div></div><hr />
