Canadiens: William King, Alanis (couldn't find a prominent female in Canadien politics)<br />
Númenóreans: Aragorn, Arwen (Yes he is a descendant of the Númenórean line)<br />
Wanderers: Cedric Greene, Cyrillia (my tribe w/ my &quot;preferred&quot; name and the name I gave to the woman who appears in my dreams)<br />
Musicians: Jimi, Janis (The cities are names of bands though it hasn't been updated in a couple of years)<br />
Dominarians: Tawnos, Ashnod (from the TCG Magic: The Gathering)<br />
Romans: Biggus Diccus, Incontinentia Buttucs (not a new tribe just new leaders, got to love &quot;Monty Python's Life of Brian&quot;)<br />
D'Harans: Richard Rahl, Kahlan Amnell (from the book series &quot;Sword of Truth&quot;)<br />
Also I've been thinking of adding a tribe for the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series but can't come up w/ a name.<br />

You forgot Kim Cambell who was Prime Minister for a week and a half when Maloruny resigned &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/rolleyes.gif&quot; border=0&gt;.  And Chretien was elected for his first term. (Now on his third http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/goodwork.gif )<br />

<br />
<br />
I remember looking throught the Hall of Fame and someone there had used the Aiel as a civilization name.  I am sure that you could use just about any of the cities as well.  I assume Rand would be the male leader - who would you make the female one?  Elayne perhaps? Or Aviendha if you use the Aiel?<br />
<br />
Just a side note to people who use custom civs:  do you write in corresponding city names for each one you build?  I know that playing as the Americans I run out of cities early and writing them in becomes a hassle after a while.  I end up just numbering them at times.  <br />
<br />
Just curious.<br />

<br />
As Kev said...I think the Aiel would make a perfect tribe w/ Rand leading as the Dragon Reborn.  If you were going with a female leader, my vote would be for Egwene and the rebel half of the white tower -&gt; even tho she can be a real pain in the butt at times.  Then there is Matt, reputedly everyones favorite character from the series and his band of merry men.  There are just so many possibilities...you could even form an army of the dark led by one of the Forsaken or even the Darklord himself. *shudder* very kewl &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />
<br />
Plz let me know what happens...I love that series.  There was a thread in the off topic section about favorite openers and I almost chose &quot;The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend&quot;....., but I had to go with the author that Jordan himself is ofter referred to, the father of fantasy himself.<br />

<br />
I have names of cities for all my custom tribes, just seems to make sense as the extra cities tend to run out kinda fast and it gives the custom civs a feeling of belonging. <br />
Also I think I will go w/ Aiel and have Aviendha as the female leader. <br />
Finally William King was someone I found in an encyclopedia when I created the Canadiens 4 years ago, just someone involved in Canadien politics.<br />

But it's tough to find city names when only one city is real!!!  Or Merlin of Chaos.<br />
I had Bilbo Baggins as my leader once, very scary.  Caramon of Krynn, or Elminster of the Forgotten Realms all my personal favorites, but the one that tops them all is ELRIC OF THE MELIBONEANS.  Elric whooped serious a** and had no qualms about going apes**t and killing all of his followers.  Plus he had a terrible addiction (to his sword) always a plus when running a country.  <br />
