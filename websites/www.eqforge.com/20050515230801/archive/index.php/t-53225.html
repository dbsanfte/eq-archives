We are descendents from two great families stemming from Noshuret. Those would be the House of Atrous and the House of Lifespanius. I am Prince Diutius, ruler of Gorina. My family and I run a semi-relaxed set of laws in Gorina as we are still a very small city. We are very glad you chose to visit Gorina and hope you will chose to stay. There are many benefits for starting on the ground floor, so to speak. OK, let me start off by showing you the family tree.<br />
<br />
Prince Diutius Lifespanius<br />
Princess Caia Lifespanius Helena- wife<br />
Praeditus Lifespanius Maximus - son<br />
Diutia Lifespanius Bellona - daughter<br />
<br />
This thread is still under construction, listed below are some facts about Gorina and other odds and ends. This will also be a place for family conversations and other relevant discussions.</div></div><hr />

Diutius slowly walks the Despot inside his home and directs staff to assist him. &quot;Right through those doors you'll find pools and women to help you. I shall join you in a moment.&quot;<br />

Ribeena, Gontskius Maximillian II, and you Katie should take the road back to Noshuret by the fastest means I have available, to  attend the wedding. We must not delay. Then I hope Maximillian II will return for the battle (and Katie too, if she wishes to live here).:)</div></div><hr />

helena, princess of gorina, now owns the lands around gorina as atrous died of old age.<br />
the citizens of gorina will surely benefit of those ownings. my first step was to build up defence of the gorina territories... 2 legionaries should be enough for the first step.<br />
<br />
in the next days, people who moove to gorina will be able to lent land for usage. so if you like to build up something, for example a farm, you can do so. the ownership will not be transferred, only the right to use and live on the land.<br />
<br />
the administration of this territory will be given, as before, to my beloved husband ditritus.<br />
<br />

OOC:<br />
cyc, we had to pay 5 shield for the troops. also we need to pay 2shield+2food for their maintenance.<br />
please reflect this when you give out usage rights to people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honorius:  I am proud to be a guest of Princess Helena and Prince Diutius.  I salute them.  However, if you’ll excuse me, I have to leave for a short while. <br />
<br />
 Honorius leaves their palace, where the dinner is being held.  He meets with his warriors and his niece Cornelia, who had been told to march silently to a location behind the palace.<br />
<br />
Honorius:  My warriors, we will execute our plan as discussed. <br />
 <br />
 Honorius motions for a group of four warriors and Cornelia to sneak around to a hut next door to the palace, whereas the rest of his force, including him, moves to the rear and waits.  The warriors near the hut next door, including Cornelia, begin their part of the plan.  The warriors begin creating a commotion on the road in front of the hut, and pretend to attack Cornelia.  <br />
<br />
Cornelia:  Help!  We are under attack!  I am being assaulted!<br />
<br />
 The unit of legionaries that was to protect Helena and Diutius rushes out of the palace to help Cornelia and defend the city. <br />
<br />
Honorius:  Now we attack!<br />
<br />
 He leads his warriors into the rear entrance of the royal palace.  Approximately twenty warriors rush into the hut, intent on killing the Prince and the Princess.  They surround them and start to attack them with their axes.  Their bodyguards are at the next house, fighting the four warriors, and no help for Helena and Diutius could possibly arrive in time to save the Prince and Princess. <br />
<br />
OOC:  Permission to kill was granted by Chieftess.  Whether the assassination was successful or not is for Octavian to decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. The boy is yours. Feel free to name him.<br />

With that, Katie departs and heads to Penguinadua, her new home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@ Bootstoots - Just so you are aware, the Gorina Palace is no longer a hut. We are on the virge of perfecting Masonry. We have Granaries with walls. The Palace is very large with baths and walkways (as stated in previous posts). Also, not only do the Royal family have their personal guard with them at all times, the Jade Commandos are at the Palace. I doubt the personal guards at a dinner would give up their posts to run all the way outside to quell a disturbance. Nice try though. See you in the history books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OOC:  Octavian will decide whether it was successful or not.  I just wanted to spice up the storyline a bit.  The Jade Commandos may be in the city, but they are not in the palace when the assassination takes place.  Maximillian Gontsky went to the palace to procure a place to live, not to station his Jade Commandos there.  Also, the soldiers may leave their posts, as they are probably on guard to protect against Nero Viviano, and they probably would have thought that he had finally decided to attack.  In addition, the palace wouldn't be too grand, as we don't have masonry yet.  I will change &quot;hut&quot; to &quot;palace&quot; in my post, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Conflict Manager: First off, boots, I don't like the fact that you just fabricated a bunch of people following your character.  If I had seen a group of actual characters organizing on the forums, I might've been more receptive in the following outcome...<br />
-------------------<br />
Honorius leads his group of twenty to the Palace of Gorina, intent on destroying the city's royals.  Just as they break down the gate protected the residence, they find the contingent of warriors, previously raised by Atrous and placed under Diutius and Helena's control.  A few were gone, checking out the previous distraction.<br />
<br />
Without fear and with overconfidence, they charge into the waiting warriors.  In the battle that ensues, 15 of the group are killed, 5 escape, and Honorius was captured.  He is brought before Diutius...</div></div><hr />

<br />
 A group of seven warriors, the five that escaped plus two from the diversion, as well as Honorius's niece Cornelia, travel back to the Peesea house.  They spot Julius Peesea, Honorius's nephew, back at the house. <br />
<br />
Warrior:  We were participating in an attack on Diutiutus and Helena, ordered by Honorius.  His guards attacked us, and 15 of the attacking force plus two warriors in the diversion were killed, and Honorius was captured!  We are the survivors.<br />
Julius:  An assassination attempt?  By my uncle?  Why did he do this?  You may come back to this house.  I will try to build the remnants of this unit back up to normal strength.  I will have to go to the palace of the Prince and Princess and proclaim that I had no part in this attack.<br />
<br />
 Julius goes to the Palace, where Diutius and Helena are angry and slightly shaken by the attempt on their lives. <br />
<br />
Julius:  Your Royal Highnesses, I decree that I had no part in this cowardly attack on your lives.  Also, my sister Cornelia and the remaining warriors should not be blamed for this, as they were merely following orders from my insane uncle, who may have killed them if they disobeyed.  Do what you wish to Honorius, but please recognize that he is the only one to blame for this disgraceful attack. <br />
<br />
 Meanwhile, in another part of the palace...<br />
<br />
Honorius:  Please don't do this to me!  I'll do anything...<br />
Guard:  Shut up!   He kicks Honorius in the buttocks <br />
Honorius:  Not the dungeon!<br />
<br />
 The guard roughly shoves Honorius into the dungeon below the palace, chains him to the wall, and leaves him there with some moldy bread and a pitcher of murky water.</div></div><hr />

Noting that the assasination attempt kind of spiced up the normal goings on here at the Gorina Palace, Diutius feels good, maybe even a little younger. &quot;More food, more wine for everyone. Especially the Jade Commandos&quot;. <br />
<br />
Not being able to find the missus, Diutius confronts the Captain of the Guard, &quot;Have you seen Queen Helena? She seems to have been frightened into hiding. We should have an all out search to find...wait a minute, cancel that order. Bring me some more wine!&quot;  :)</div></div><hr />

One could get a clear view of Gorina Valley from there.<br />
<br />
After a long pause Diutius speaks, &quot;We have ruled Gorina for many years, Helena. We have always tried to be fair in our dealings with the people. We have always sought to protect them and make sure they were well feed. We have built this city up from a small town to one that could supply Fanatica with a Settler group. And we are now building the first Granary to store food in, so that our citizens lifespan will be longer. Yet, in our dungeons is a man who attempted to take our lives last night. A citizen of Gorina, no less&quot; Diutius moves closer to Helena, &quot;Do you think this is the first sign of unrest for the people as a whole, that could possibly encompass all of Fanatica?&quot;<br />
<br />
Helena lifts her still beautiful eyes in to the twilight rays of the morning and looks at Diutius, &quot;What you say may hold more truth than you know. Fanatica is being ruled by the Royal Families, but the nation has been without a true Despot for sometime now, since the passing of Atrous and those that would have followed him. Perhaps it is time for you to claim the title.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I have been thinking the same&quot;, Diutius nodded. &quot;Very well then, today shall be the day when I make the announcement. We shall have a Despot once again.&quot;</div></div><hr />

DUE TO THE RECENT DECEASING OF MY BELOVED FATHER, THE GREAT DESPOT ATROUS, I FINALLY GOT OWNERSHIP OF THE LANDS OF OUR FOREFATHERS<br />
<br />

<br />
additional notice:<br />
we need people building things! apllicants should state their request in here. we wont accept all applicants, but the most promising will be given land for usage (not that this does not include raising units or ownerhip on that lands. only peaceful creation of goods will be supported).</div></div><hr />

See this post by Plex (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=973150#post973150) for details.  When Aza died, those warriors reverted to command of Atrous.</div></div><hr />

I would like to oversee the training of a group of warriors. They of course would be loyal to you, but I would be their captain and comand your will during battle.<br />
<br />
This is but a small and humble request. If it is not granted please grant me citizneship anyway and perhaps a small job under you in the city. I have been well trained for battle as well as many woodsman skills.</div></div><hr />

The Lifespanian ownings (Helenatica) have their thread here (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=54255)... but if you want land, helenatica can only grant you usage for a business. If you want to own land you need to go to the despots thread... and request it there. This will not be in Helenatica though.</div></div><hr />
