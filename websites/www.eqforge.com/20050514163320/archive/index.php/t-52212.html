Secondly, the only fighters present are those that are specifically mentioned, unless you get the despot's approval to use his resources from the land to raise an actual contingent of registered troops.  <br />
Otherwise, there's no actual conflict, something that I would need to decide the outcome of.  Tone down the organizational level a bit, before I need to act.</div></div><hr />

it is RPG, if the nation is at war in the DG, we post story threads about the conflict (remember sirjohn's volcano island thread?).</div></div><hr />

Any nation we would have is still in the ancient age!  We don't even have a code for warriors to organize along!  We don't know foreign nations to fight with!<br />
<br />
Also, the point in the reorganization along the lines it has taken was to allow for realism: you will lost conflicts.  It is very unrealistic (and unchallanging) to win all the time.  There needs to be a third party rolling the die.</div></div><hr />

(OOC: I know we can't have characters from the last game in here, but he's only going to appear once.)<br />
<br />
Noldodan:  Hello.  I am Noldodan, and these (gestures to his companions) are my... relatives, Nambanoldo and Poldothar.  The small, wiry one, Nambanoldo, is a budding craftsman, very good at designing and building weapons.  He has already made a few improvements to the basic spear and axe, and has developed the &quot;sling,&quot; a device for hurling rocks great distances.  Poldohtar, as you may have noticed, is rather large and muscular.  He is a master with the spear, axe and sling.  And now, I leave them in your care.  I am sure that you will find a use for them.<br />
<br />
Noval Gontsky:  What?  Wait just a second here... Hey?!  Where did he go?  (Indeed, Noldodan seems to have disappeared from the shelter)  Well, that was certainly odd.  (Turns to Nambanoldo and Poldohtar)  What am I going to due with you two?  (He sighs)  Well, first off, who are your relatives?<br />
<br />
Nambanoldo:  Well, my father is Perianoldo, a scholar in the village, and Poldohtar here is my cousin.<br />
<br />
Noval:  That's it?<br />
<br />
Nambanoldo:  That's it.<br />
<br />
Noval:  Then who was that here in the shelter?<br />
<br />
Nambanoldo, looking around:  What?  We just came here on our own.  We never saw anybody but you.<br />
<br />
Noval, softly:  I must be getting too superstituous and seeing things...  (Louder)  Well, I guess I have to decide what do do with you two.  Namba, you go and make one of these &quot;slings.&quot;  I want to see it.  Poldohtar, you go outside and practice your weapons skills.<br />
<br />
(Nambanoldo nods, gestures to Poldohtar, and heads outside)</div></div><hr />

 It is a pointy rock, made of pure Jade. It is triangular and smooth <br />
Jenna: If we could figure a way to get these at the barbarians without us getting hurt, we could protect ourself. Hm... Bob! Get me a bendable branch! Jackie, i need some of that twine your always using. SaaM... you just pretend to help. Everyone bring the stuff overhere. I've got an idea...<br />
 Once the things were brought together, Jenna assembeled them and formed a bow and arrow <br />

He carries two large stone axes, one in each hand.  Across his back he has a bow and quiver of arrows.  He wears something unusual amongst the people here: armor.  His armor is of animal hide; leather armor.  It can stop arrows and knives from piercing the skin.<br />
<br />
He stops out of the shadow and into the light, surprising the Jades.  His features are not those of the locals; they are those of the barbarians.<br />

Noval Gontsky: It's a barbarian! Get him!<br />
<br />
Germanicus Arturius: Yield, Jade Commandos.  I am one of you, I am Randomanian.<br />

The warrior puts down the axes as a sign of friendship.<br />
