The capital is named by the first President. The country name should be discussed and polled (when we discover what civ we are). <br />
<br />
Well, technically we don't have to do it this way.  I think it would be cool to collectively name the capital.  We could do that and then institute a naming queue for government officials.  Anyone else want to name the capital in this way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Immortal</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can go either way, though Ill nth this collective proposal./</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm fine with either method. Just get it decided before the first chat. ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Actually we would need this by the second chat if I'm elected Pres. The first chat will be the opening ceremonies and game start. City settlement location will be brought back to the forums and the second chat would have the capital founded.</div></div><hr />

I think we should lookat city naming in a whole new light.  Looking at our civ name and geography, come up with groups of city names for certain regions in the nation.<br />
<br />
Take, for example, the mass renaming of cities under Feodor and Cyc in their respective provinces in DG2.  All of them were renamed on a theme, and it made them look coherent, neat, and well-planned in compariso to the rest of the nation.</div></div><hr />

 Oh. I think this is a good idea. Toss in the collective naming of Capital idea as well. eventually we can have provinces that each have uniqe errm...qualities. It would make for a more interesting nation imho.<br />
<br />
 Or, one could do the collective naming of capital thing. And decide for a common theme for the entire nation, that each namer of cities and provinces would be required to stick to.<br />
<br />
 Last but not least. First president/chieftain names the first settlement/city/capital. Then we proceed with the naming of cities according to COC.<br />
<br />
 As for naming of provinces, we could do something similar to the governmental elections. A name nomination thread, then a poll from the most popular names (if possible to find any name(s) more popular than the other names....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Apr 29, 2003, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We could combine the naming queue with the theme / geographical feature idea.  We could have a thread with city name suggestions that follow the chosen themes and let those in the queue choose their city name from the suggestions.  We could also vote individuals the special priviledge of naming a city anything they want or of having a city named after them.  Which ever way we decide to go we should continue to use the city name registry concept from DG2.  Knowing ahead of time what a city will be named will avoid in chat delays.  :)</div></div><hr />

For the regular citys, there is a list of city names in the citizen registery.. We could just choose from them...</div></div><hr />

There was no concensus for a name from the citizenry when we founded it. If discussion leads to a renaming of the capital we can always do that later.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panzer</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds like 'not sure yet', is that just co-incidence or am I just imagining things?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually it did start out like that. When I registered in the citizen registry I wasn't sure what city name I wanted yet so I put down &quot;not sure yet&quot;. Then, figuring on the peculiar sense of humor around here ( ;) ) I figured I better change that to something city sounding in case it came up in a queue before I changed it and I ended up naming a city literally &quot;Not Sure Yet&quot;. Noshuret was born. I came back with a city name and was going to edit my registry and I realized that I really liked the sound of Noshuret. Dignified and ancient sounding. Rolls off the tongue. Plus, a humorous genesis. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wasn't the latin for a city/town &quot;urb***&quot; (i forgot the declination model). Just a memory from my latin classes (let the classical education of the Collège des Jésuites be blessed forever!).</div></div><hr />

Although Urbs/Urbis is the literal word for city, Regia meaning royal (particularly a dwelling) was also used in poetry to mean the capital or royal city.<br />
Geek mode off</div></div><hr />
