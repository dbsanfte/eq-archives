2. Do you believe that established players should help newer players to get involved and get into office?</div></div><hr />

I do everything I can to get newer people into office, starting with giving them some exposure by appointing them to mayoral positions.  I also think that people with executive positions should not be allowed to hold another position that term, and will support any reasonable legislation that comes through with this goal in mind.<br />
<br />
I have experience in quite a few offices (VP, President [briefly], Domestic Leader, Foreign Affairs Leader, and Governor).  I am a Monarch/Emperor level player, and intend to concentrate on expansion until we have achieved our manifest destiny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You've probably seen it in my signature, and it's true.  I love to Gov.  I've been involved in the demo-game since DG1 and have never been, or wated to be, anything but a Governor.  In fact, my first post ever at CFC was to nominate for Governor of Asphinxia.  <br />
<br />
Shaitan, to answer your second question first, I believe it is one of the primary directives of any Governor to encourage active involvement in Government through the appointment of Mayors.  When I came to my first province, it had no mayors and virtually no citizens.  By the end of that term I had recruited more than a dozen new citizens to positions of responsibility.  Most of these eventually went on to become Governors of nearby provinces, whereas they might have otherwise dropped off.<br />
<br />
I wish to devolop and implement a series of Provincial Guidelines which give more say and power to the Mayors in running their own cities, with the Governor as an overseer rather than a dictator.  This allows real participation for mayors.  Also I believe there is scope for the establishment of provincial positions to look after worker movements, millitary adn inferstructure portfolios.  As I have always maintained, there is NO point giving mayorships to people already well established in the demogame.<br />
<br />
To answer your second question, I am running for two positions, Governor of Capitoline and Domestic Leader.  I feel that if I am not Governor, I can still make a good contribution to the province as domestic leader.  In the unlikely event that I win both positions, I would take the Governorship of Capitoline.</div></div><hr />

I must say I have a feeling that AlmightyJosh's reign would result in mostly more 'venerable' citizens becoming mayors. <br />
<br />
Now that is a piece of unfounded, ingnorant and frankly offensive codswallop.  I'm not entirely sure what you are basing this upon eyrei, is it merely a backlash at the idea of empoweing newer citizens??<br />
<br />
Lets look at the last time I engaged in significant numbers of Mayoral appointments...<br />
<br />
I appointed:<br />
SAaM<br />
CivGeneral<br />
Ehecatl Atzin <br />
Bearnstien<br />
Raven1er<br />
BCLG100 <br />
Toasty<br />
Danke<br />
and later neutral leader<br />
<br />
... among others (unfortunately I could not get a comprehensive list due to a problem with me acessing the archives, these are just the ones I remember well)<br />
<br />
All of these were appointed to either Mayoral positions or positions of responsibility and given a REAL say.  Every one of them was either a brand new citizen or had held no positions in government beforehand.  It is also intersting to note that the vast majority of governors (and many leaders) for the later terms of that game were home grown in my province and, after being introduced to government in my province, went on to become some of the greatest contributers to our nation, and the nations we have founded since in other demogames.<br />
<br />
Lets see..<br />
I can find no record of you, eyeri, being a Governor in any term but the one just passed and in that term the first two mayors you appointed were:<br />
Cyc<br />
Almightyjosh<br />
<br />
hardly 'new' players are they??<br />
<br />
<br />
If we look at records, rather than idle conjecture, we see that I have a very strong histrory of involving new players actively in the province that I govern, with a view to them being able to take on any positions they wish in the future.<br />

<br />
Maybe you are, but I am interested in allowing newer citizens to become mayors AND investing REAL power in the role.  <br />
<br />
No doubt by your comments you mean that you would prefer new citizens to take a ceremonial role, shutup, and vote for you at the next election?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">May 28, 2003, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To get back to more positive material, there are a number of initialtive that I wish to initiate in Capitoline province.<br />
<br />
First of all, I would like to establish a Provincial Council, (made up of the Governor, a depudy Governor, and the city mayors, as well as any 'cabinet' members (people with specific responsibilities)) that has some control over provincial issues and the ability to direct the Governor.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I wish to establish a news network, with regular updates and a weekly news summary PMed to citizens of the Province.<br />
<br />
Fianlly, I want to move away from the idea that 'everyone lives in the capital until they move'.  In fact, untill you choose somewhere to live, you don't live anywhere!!  Capitoline should be working to attract citizens just as hard as any other province, and that is what I would do as Governor of Capitoline.</div></div><hr />

I based my comments on your 'cheerleading team' who will undoubtably receive whatever mayoral appointments they wish.  I also appointed Sir John and Peri as mayors, though you decided not to mention that.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, by the number of views to this thread it looks like this debate went pretty much unnoticed.  All the more reason for me to work on getting the Debates moved to the Main Forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you will take a second away from your unfounded beligerence, you will notice that my so-called 'cheerleading team', which I assume is those people who believe I would make a good Governor of Capitoline, is infact largely based on the fact that they have either:<br />
<br />
a) Respected my input in a previous Governor position(s)<br />
<br />
b) Were established in the game with my help.<br />
<br />
What you are alledging is that I garner my support from a base of people who wish me to give them jobs, which is ludecrous.  I have already stated that I wish to allot a significant amount of power to my mayors, and that I wish them to be newer players in the game!!  What more do you want?  A declaration signed in blood maybe?</div></div><hr />
