Next turn chat. (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=57647) <br />
<br />
This chat is scheduled for roughly 48 hours from now.  I realize there are two run-off elections taking place that will end at the time this chat is scheduled to start.  The last chat of term 2 was cancelled and if we are to wait two days to see who is to be culture and domestic leader and give them time to get their departments in order properly we'd have to wait almost a week to get this term started.  Since the candidate's in both run-off elections will end up being the leader and deputy of their respective departments I do hope they can work together for the next two days to come up with turn chat instructions for their departments.  I will remind everyone here that in cases where no turn chat instructions are posted for a given department or province then I as president will make any needed decisions.<br />
<br />
NOTICE: Please reserve this thread for instruction posts by Department Leaders. This is not a discussion thread.</div></div><hr />

As the TC starts at 00:30 GMT, which is 02:30 my time I am unable to join. I regret this. I will make sure my instructions are posted, but don't expect me to join.<br />
<br />
For the future; is it possible to pick an earlier time ? I like to join the TC as well. around 20:00 GMT suits me fine. Even 22:00 GMT is fine. And in weekends I'll make time for the TC. In weekdays 02:30 is just too late (or too early). <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mr. President, in the absence of the Domestic Dept., I request that the Sci Rate Slider be moved up to 80% (-4gpt). This will allow us to finish researching Currency in 8 turns. I do not believe we need to raise the Lux portion of this scale, especially if we connect the road (3 tiles) from Lake Asphinxia to the Hills of Elephantine.<br />
<br />
After completing research on Currency, I belive we should bypass the Republic Tech and move forward into the Middle Ages. According to the latest Science poll, the citizens of Fanatica choose to move toward Education on the Tech Tree. Therefore our next course of research should be Monotheism, then Theology, then Education.<br />
<br />
Once we have finished researching Currency, the Science department does not have a problem with trading this Tech to other nations, but without the increase of the Sci Rate, we probably won't make enough to be worthwhile.<br />

A pre-build of the Great Wonder Sistene Chapel should begin in Gorina as soon as it's finished with its Colosseum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buildqueue:<br />
<br />
Nar Shaddaa: spearman (8 turns) , temple (15-20 turns) (to get the fish), granary (to properly prepare is as a settler/worker factory), settler, worker, ...<br />
<br />
Skunkworks: Worker (6 turns), settler (~15),  temple, settler, ... <br />
<br />
[list=1]Requests:<br />
  I request to revolt after we have researched currency (~8 turns). That will give Nar Shaddaa time to finish it's spearman. <br />
 I request to road the tiles marked by a brown line in attached picture. First of all to connect Skunkworks, second of all to generate some extra commerce after (or even before) we get Monarchy and thirdly to have a road on which our settlers can travel fast to build cities in the west of Esquiline province. The red circles are the designated locations for our Canal cities. How Nar Shaddaa is going to be connected is up to the Governor of Capitoline; Gingerbreadman.<br />
<br />

<br />
 I also request to send in 3 settlers; 2 to build the canal and 1 to start a city further west. I leave the location up to you; I trust you to do it properly. Fionn has posted an idea here:<br />

I'll finish with a good-luck wish;<br />
I will throw over my Saturday schedule to be able to attend the T/C on Saturday, July 5, around 9 am EST which is 1400 GMT. <br />
<br />
P.S. If it is my turn to name a city; let it be &quot;Klixus Major&quot; (latin for Greater Klixe).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The evil Aztecs built Chalco on our side of the bay.  Then Montezuma had the nerve to demand that our glorious Legions leave his territory!  Donsig's reply was WAR! <br />
<br />
Two Legions were lost but Chalco was destroyed.  Another escorted band of Aztec settlers was captured.  It did not take long for the war to expand.  Our former enemy, Cleopatra, has allied with us against the Aztecs.  Soon afer this alliance was cemented America declared war on us!  Both Egypt and Greece have allied with us against the Americans.  We lost two warriors in Greece.  they fell at the hands of American swordsmen but not before killing off one of the enemy swordsmen first!  We have destroyed an Aztec jaguar warrior while Egyptian forces have captured two escorted Aztec settlers.<br />
<br />
Our nation has grown with the addition of four new cities.  Both of the proposed canal towns in Esquiline province have been founded.  Another city was planted southeast of Regia Doughnutia and a fouth sprang up south of Memphis.  We also have three more settlers ready for form cities!<br />
<br />
We have mastered the currency technology and have advanced into the middle ages!  However, the wars have proved unpopular leading to the downfall of our government:  we are in ANARCHY!</div></div><hr />
