<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a cloudy autumn morning, a black-hooded figure walks down a darkened road towards an Egyptian patrol.  The patrol consists of 3 spearman, each a new recruit trying to stay warm in the autumn wind.  The notice the figure.<br />
<br />
Soldier 1:  Halt!  Who goes there?<br />
<br />
GM:  (In Egyptian)  Ah, Private, it is good to hear the Queen's Egyptian again.  I have spent the last 2 weeks in the land of the heathen Fanatican dogs, scouting for a countattack to push their main assault off-balance.  Tell me, is Commander Nassar around?  I must give him this report...<br />
<br />
The man reaches into his cloak as though to pull out a scouting report, but instead draws his sword from its scabbard and with one fluid motion severs the head of one spearman.  The other two spearman are in shock, but one quickly recovers and attempts to bring his spear to bare.  But he is not fast enough, and receives a sword through the chest, followed by a swordstroke that shatters his shoulder.  Finally the other patrolman recovers and thrusts with his spear, only for it to be cut in half by the lone swordsman.  The spearman ttries desperately to protect himself with a shield, but it is beaten away and he too eventually succumbs to the onslaught.  This done, the Fanatican warrior wipes the blood from his sword on the tunic of a dead Egyptian, and rifles through their clothing until he finds what he was looking for.  A map of the surrounding area, showing the location of Egyptina patrols to be avoided and more importantly an Egyptian light cavalry camp to the northwest.  The Fanatican places this map in his cloak and continues up the road to the northwest, into the heart of danger and the home of glory.<br />
<br />
OOC:  Folks, this is my attempt at starting a pass-along story to revive this RPG.  The rules are simple: post a chapter continuing the last person's post, and leave yours open-ended so people can add to it.  Anybody can join at any time.  This is about a jounrey through the Egyptian war zone, so please try not to get too far off topic.  And finally, don't kill other characters without their permission, s'alright? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Penguinadua, there is a woman. She longs for excitement and fufilment. She is Baroness Contessa Liza DiSaaMuel <br />
Liza: Just call me Liza. Liza with a Z.<br />
 Anyway, Liza wants something to do. She hears of the Egyptian War and what may be happening to her country. She also hears of a journey to Thebes to try to sort out Peace <br />
Liza: I must go! SaaM, you stay home and tend for Helenatica. I have to leave here. Leave these halls of learning and that stage. And especially your oboe... I must flee for my sanities sake. Perhaps I can help bring an end to this war.<br />
SaaM: But what if you perish?<br />
Liza: If I am not home within the next year, carry on, carry on. Goodbye, SaaM<br />
 And so, Liza has left her ivory towers in exhange for a pair of walking shoes, a big stick and a map. <br />
Okay.. there were 2 song refernces 10 points if you get both of them. And no asking &quot;is it___?&quot; You must write out a story and at the end, like here, put your guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After the scuffle with the spear patrol, the Fanatican (stil unknown to the Egyptians as Grandmaster) decides to make camp for the night.  He finds a spot in a nearby woodlot that will offer him some cover, and sleeps the half-sleep of those who know that hostiles with swords and spears are right around the corner.<br />
<br />
In the morning, when he awakes, he sees a figure coming down the road.  He hides in the brush several feet back from the road, sword drawn, until he hears singing in the Fanatican tongue.  He leaves his cover and approaches the traveler.<br />
<br />
GM:  A warzone is no place for a Fanatican lady like yourself, ma'am.  Perhaps you should go home.<br />
<br />
Liza:  First off, call me Liza.  Second off, no.  I am here to travel to Thebes and put an end to this war.  I think the igger question is, who are you, and why are YOU here?<br />
<br />
GM:  My name is of little consequence.  I am here for mcuh the same reason you are, although I imagine our means of ending this fighting are ratehr different.  Well, if you insist on traveling to Thebes, you will need and escort.  The Egyptians resent us fr our sucesses against their cities, and have taken to doing rather dishonorable things to any Fanatican civilians they find unprotected.... especially the ladies, sadly.  Come, we should move, a patrol will likely come this way soon.  Tell me, Liza, how are you at riding horses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Liza and Grandmaster approach the horsefields <br />
Liza: How am I, you ask? It takes most people a week to get paperwork between Gorina and Penguinadua. Takes me.. 4 days. All due to technique. Lets get ready to ride.<br />
 And with that Short Entry , the 2 grab some horses and ride off towards Thebes, hoping OTHERS will join them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OOC: Meh, stole my fire there SaaM... i was planning a glorious raid on an Egyptian light cavalry camp to steal the horses.... oh well. :(  Guess I should come up with a new idea. ;)<br />
<br />
IC:<br />
As the two ride from the horsefields, they happen upon a company of Fanatican cavalry.<br />
<br />
Cavalryman: Hail, travelers!  This is a warzone, and we strongly suggest that all civilians vacate the area.<br />
<br />
GM:  Indeed, but we are on a mission.  This young lady here must reach Thebes, and I am to escort her.  Tell me, soldier, have you experienced much combat of late?<br />
<br />
Cavalryman: No, it has been quiet around here.  Word is the Egyptian Resistance has given up after seeing the fall of that last city.  But you never....<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a arrow flies through the air and hit the cavalry officer in the neck.  Grandmaster instinctively jumps off his horse, and pulls Liza down off of hers.  More arrows fly from the brush by the side of the road, and 3 more cavalrymen fall.  The group is now reduced down to 4 dismounted soldiers and the two travelers.  They get behind their horses, taking cover from the fire.  Then they hear a bloodcurdling warcry.<br />
<br />
Resistor:  Cleopatrahu Akhbar!<br />
<br />
13 Egyptians armed with a random mixture of spears, Khapesh swords, shortbows, and farming instruments charge out of the bushes towards the Fanaticans.  Grandmaster draws his sword and waits until the nearest Egyptian is right upon him.  He leaps out from behind his horse, taking down the spear-armed Egyptian and driving his sword through his heart.<br />
<br />
GM:  Liza, can you work a spear?<br />
<br />
Liza:  Yes, no problem.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster throughs her the spear, just in time for her to point it outward and skewer an oncoming bowman.  The cavalrymen are fighting in close quarters too, killing Egyptians but also taking casualties.  Two Egyptians with swords try to encircle Grandmaster, but he fights both back with his quick-moving sword.  He finally cuts off the sword hand of one, removing him from the fight.  The other drops back to pick up a fallen man's bow, but as he reaches down to get it he takes a swordblow in the back, followed by a backslash that nearly removes his head.  Liza holds off an Egyptian with a timbering axe, jabbing with the sharp point and batting him away with the blunt end.  Finally, when all is done, 13 Egyptians and 7 Fanaticans lay dead in the road.<br />
<br />
GM:  Still want to go to Thebes, Liza?<br />
<br />
Liza:  Indeed.  Now more than ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anthony hears of growing Violence towards traveling Fanaticans. He is growing bored of his life, and decides to leave for Thebes to stop the Egyptian menace. He leaes his wife Alia home to teach Romanate. He saddles his horse and rides off. His skills in Romanate will help him, and maybe some friends.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Hours later, Anthony comes to a inn on the egyptian border. He goes inside and finds every egyptian dead.<br />
<br />
Anthony(in fanatican tongue): My gods! What in the name of Alpha happened here!?<br />
<br />
Out of the shadows a figure emerges. Anthony poises himself to fight, but the figure speaks Fanatican.<br />
<br />
GM: Hello fellow brother. What brings you here?<br />
<br />
Anthony(Seeing he is Fanatican): I have come to stop the Egyptian menace. What are you doing here? And who is that? (pointing toward Liza)<br />
<br />
GM: My name is of no concern. And that is Liza.<br />
<br />
Anthony: Hello Lisa.<br />
<br />
Liza: It is LIZA with a Z!!! Anyway, who are you?<br />
<br />
Anthony: I am Anthony DePaolo II, son of Antonio the Conquerer, and I have come to use my skills in Romanate to stop Egypt.<br />
<br />
Liza: Exactly what we are doing. Where are you heading to?<br />
<br />
Anthony: To Thebes, the heart of Egypt.<br />
<br />
GM: Hmmm.... Good. We are going there too. What is this, Romanate?<br />
<br />
Anthony: Romanate is the Skill of self-defence. Anyone who is an Expert can defend themselves without weaponry, and can use weaponry effectively.<br />
<br />
GM: Defend without weapons? Outragous!<br />
<br />
Anthony: Just draw your sword and try to attack me. You will find that I can move fast enough to evade you, or I can stop your sword with my hands.<br />
<br />
GM takes a swing and Anthony evades with amazing agility. GM takes another swing and Anthony catches the blunt sides with his hands. He thens trips GM, and Anthony pulls out his katana.<br />
<br />
Anthony: Now do you beleive me?<br />
<br />
GM: Very well. You are skilled in your art, maybe I would like to know your secrets.<br />
<br />
But they hear Egyptians coming, and rush out the back door. On to thebes they go. What obsticales are ahead, no one knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Behind the inn several Egyptian horses are tied to posts.  Their masters lay on the ground inside, and have no more use of them.  Grandmaster and Liza, who had lost their horses in the ambush, each take one.  Grandmaster now carries the dagger of an Egyptian soldier alongside his sword, and Liza has the spear and shield of another dead Egyptian.<br />
<br />
The three horsemen ride through the woods to the back of the inn rather than taking the main road, for on that road is nearly an entire regiment of Egyptian swordsmen.  When they emerge from the forest, they take a dirt path that eventually rejoins the road well away from the Egyptian army.  They continue along the road towards Thebes, and after several hours' riding they spot a small village on the horizon.  As they crest a hill, they have a perfect view of the town.  And that is when they notice that the town centr is burning.  Closer examination of the scene shows arrows flying back adn forth across streets from building doorways, civilians trying to flee and being mowed down in the crossfire, and Egyptian soldiers rushing through the village with torches, burning everything they can find.<br />
<br />
Anthony:  What's going on?  I thought that was an Egyptian village....<br />
<br />
GM:  Look, over in those buildings to the far left.  Fanatican soldiers are holed up in that bath and those two stores.  I think we porbably attacked and occupied the town, and now the Egyptians are counterattacking and trying to destory the city so we can't have it.  I heard about something like that... they're calling it a &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy I think; destroy everything you leave behind as you retreat so the Fanaticans can't take it.  They're massacring their own civilians so they don't join Fanatica.<br />
<br />
Liza:  What can we do about it?<br />
<br />
GM:  We can fight.<br />
<br />
Anthony:  Against all those soldiers?  There must be 3 companies down there!<br />
<br />
GM:  Three of us against three companies?  Sounds about right to me.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster draws his sword and spurs his horse forward.  He charges down the hill and into the burning town.  The other two riders follow behind him.<br />
<br />
At the base of the hill stands a platoon of Egyptian axe warriors, watching the city burn and waiting to enter the fight as reserves.  One of them turns to look up the hill just in time to see a mounted warrior charge down upon him and cut him open with a sword.  The other look to see what happened, and another is felled by the fast-moving, sword-wielding warrior.  They lift their axes, but axes are useless in defense.  In the next minute two more fall.  Then two more riders arrive.  They join the skirmish, and together the three kill all 8 Egyptians.  They enter the city on horseback, and see that almost everything is ablaze.  Down the street, with their backs to the riders, are a company of spearman, now armed only with torches, for they are pillaging, not fighting.  This is to be there downfall, and the three Fanaticans charge into their backs and cut them down in lines.  They try to fight back with the torches, but the battle is hopeless.  Only one Egyptians survives, and he runs to tell the other two companies what is happening.  Before he can get very far, a Fanatican regular shoots him down with an arrow.  The man had been hiding behind two empty barrels, but had not fired because he had only one arrow and would have been too vulnerable.  He comes out from hiding and takes three spears from the fallen Egyptians.<br />
<br />
GM:  Okay, let's split up.  Anthony, Liza, you two go right and engage 2 Company.  Him and me will go left, engage 3 Company, and relieve our boys that are pinned down.  Let's go.<br />
<br />
The two riders go right, and Grandmaster and the regular go left.  Liza and Anthony manage to get the jump on 2 Company and are able to kill 15 of them before they are even able to bring their weapons to bare.  When they finally do, they find themselves no match for the close combat skills of Anthony and for Liza's mastery of the spear.  Meanwhile, 3 Company had been looking in the direction Grandmaster was coming from, and saw him before he could get close.  3 Company turned out to be a light artillery company, made up of archers and slingers, with no close-quarters weaponry.  Grandmaster knew that if he get inside the effective range of a bow, he could easilly defeat them.  He raised his sword and charged straight into the Company.  His horse was hit once with an arrow, but was mostly missed because of the speed at which he came straight at the soldiers.  From only feet away, mounted atop a horse and wielding a mighty sword, Grandmaster was almost invulnerable to artillery.  He cut down the archers in droves, killing 25.  The other five were handled by the Fanatican regular, who killed the last one before dying of an arrow wound.  His companion fallen, Grandmaster rushed ahead to free the trapped Fanaticans.  He found they were pinned down by only 4 archers, who were so concentrated on firing at the trapped men that they didn't even notice the man close in behind them and draw a dagger.  In one motion, lightning fast, he wrapped his hand around the one archer's moth and cut his throat.  The second archer turned, and saw the hand come at him as it plunged the Egyptian-made dagger into his heart.  The other two took aim at Grandmaster, but he was able to lift the dead Egyptian in front of him, and his body intercepted the missiles.  The warrior then charged the archers down on foot, and cut both of their bellies open with his sword.  With the artillery silenced, the Fanatican soldiers were able to evacuate the burning building moments before it collapsed.  In the middle of a burned out village now stood 23 Fanatican soldiers.</div></div><hr />

The mere thought of killing citizens would make any decent Fanatican want to heave. Should peace be brought? Or should we not bother and turn arround? Is the price of our lives worth more then the price of innocent Egyptian civilians?.....<br />
No... No... we must do what we have come to do. Onwards, my friends! To Thebes. We must speak with Cleopatra herself or die trying. <br />
Anyone have any problem with humming? I feel like humming. Hmmmm hmmm hmmm hmmmm hmmmmm....<br />
Anthony: Stop! Its driving me mad.<br />
Liza: Okay.. ill sing quietly to myself...  Oh the only one who could ever reach me... was the son of a preacher man... <br />

In one dream, Cleo is sitting at a table, and all his friends heads are on it. He is alive, watching her eat them, and drink their blood. She then plunges Grandmaster's sword into Anthony's heart, and kills him. In his second dream, Cleo is lying dead on the floor. Several Jade's are also dead with long scratches across their faces. Anthony is bumbling around as if drunk. On his arm are 3 long finger nail scratches. The finger nails seem to have had posoin on them. Anthony looks up at the ceiling and everything goes black. At this instant he awakes with a start.<br />

Anthony: AAHH!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The travelers continue on in the morning.  CivGeneral, relative of a Despot like he is, has his own horse, and he and Mara ride together.  Anthony, Liza, and Grandmaster are each astride their own Egyptian warhorses.  As they travel down the road, they come across an old blind man, a young woman, and her young daughter.<br />
<br />
Woman:  Please sirs, please stop.  We have been on the run for 4 days, fleeing the destruction of the city.  We have no bread and no water.  Can you please help us?<br />
<br />
GM:  What do you all think?  Can we afford to stop and help these people?<br />
<br />
Liza:  Do we have a choice?  Look at them!  They need us!<br />
<br />
GM:  Very well then, we'll give help you.  Tell me, is there a military camp around here?<br />
<br />
Old Man:  Yes, there is a camp of irregulars in the hills about 2 miles to the east.  They're the ones who burned our village.  Why?<br />
<br />
GM:  Give me an hour and I will have you all the bread you can eat and all the water you can drink.  Mara, Liza, stay with these people and see if there is anything you can do.  Anthony, CivGeneral, come with me.  It's time to go &quot;shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
CG:  Shopping?  What?<br />
<br />
Mara: Don't mind him....<br />
<br />
The three horsemen ride off, as the ladies attempt to doctor the wounds of the man and woman and ease the ordeal for the child.  After about a mile of riding, the mounted warriors enter thickly wooded hills.  The broken terrain is perfect for a band of guerillas to hide in.  And sure enough, that is what they are doing.  The horses pick their way slowly through the underbrush, until Grandmaster notices a light.  He dismounts and walks, crouched, to the end of the woodline.  Here is a clearing, in the center of which burns a bonfire.  Arrayed around that bonfire are 3 canvas tents.  Seven horses are tied to a tree off to one side of the camp.  A number of Egyptian irregulars, armed with all sorts of weapons and farming implements, are walking around the camp, oblivious of the death that awaits them.  Grandmaster signals his two companions to dismount and come forward.  This they do.  All draw their weapons, and on Grandmaster's mark, they burst into the camp.  They manage to take down three guerillas whose backs were to the woodline.  All of these men held bows, and the attackers immediately took these weapons.  They each took aim at enemy guerillas who were looking the other way, and loosed their arrows.  More Egyptians fell dead.  Anthony and CivGeneral continued picking off guerillas with the bows, as Grandmaster drew his sword and slipped into a tent.  The man in the temp was so shocked that he didn't even react, and was quickly slayed by his assailant.  Grandmaster rifled through the tent, and managed to find the man's rations, plus those of other soldiers, and some extra bread and waterskins that are stored in a trunk.  Grandmaster figures that is enough to feed the three people they have met, and leaves the tent.  Almost all of the guerillas have been shot down by the CivGeneral and Anthony, and those who still live are hiding in the forest.  The three then each people pick up sticks and light them in the bonfire.  They torch the tents, and then remount.  Riding at full speed, they make it back to the road in but a few minutes, where they hand out the food and drink to the old blind man, the young woman, and her daughter.<br />
<br />
Woman:  Thank you, sirs!  How ever did you get this much food?<br />
<br />
GM:  Lets just say we took it from some people who won't be needing it any more.<br />
<br />
With that, the Fanaticans ride off again, every mvoing towards Thebes.</div></div><hr />

Later that night, after everyone has gone to sleep, Anthony has the &quot;dreams&quot;. But this time it is only the one where cleo is dead. He starts to understand them, but he is still uncertain. Every night he tries to figure it out, but to no avail. He needs something to help his vision grow stronger....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before they go to sleep, the three get to talking again.  Liza and Anthony are already sound asleep in their tents.<br />
<br />
CG:  So Grandmaster, you never did end up telling us what you have been doing for the past few years.<br />
<br />
GM:  Most people wouldn't want to hear about it.<br />
<br />
Mara:  Really?  Why?<br />
<br />
GM:  It isn't a pretty story, ma'am.<br />
<br />
CG:  But we would like to hear it.  Now you have me curious.<br />
<br />
GM:  Alright, if you insist.  Now, I'm sure you know about the various nobles who rule their little fiefdoms all over the Empire.  Well, where I lived before this, the ruling noble was particularly agressive.  It turns out the neighboring kingdom also had a warmonger as its lord.  Anyway, the two fiefdoms went to war.  At first our territory was winning, but then the tide turned.  The enemy launched a massive counterattack with archers, swordsmen, and heavy cavalry that pushed our forces back to the very village I lived in.  The town was built around a stone fortress, so the troops and citizens began to evacuate themselves into the fort.  But my family was too slow.  I was only young at the time.  The enemy soldiers reached our home before we could leave.  They killed both of my parents and torched the house.  I survived because I was able to sneak up behind one of them, cut his throat with a cooking knife, and steal his sword, with which I fought my way out of the house at the age of 10.  I ran and hid in the woods until the siege was over.  They eventually brought in siege artillery and leveled the fortress with the enter village in it.  That was when I realized that while honorable war between two nation-states is one thing, dishonorable war between neighboring factions of the same nation with atrocities like the ones I experienced cannot be allowed to continue.  So I dedicated my life to stopping it.  I spent a year in the woods training with the sword, learning to master the technique, building my strength.  Then I went t the land of that had waged war against my home.  I slipped my way into the Prince's palace and killed him.  He wasn't even armed.  I drove a sword through his heart and left the body right there on his throne.  Then I left right through the front door, and nobody was the wiser.  I've spent the last 8 years doing that.  Fighting a guerilla war against the nobility that destroyed my family with its stupid infighting.  I've traveled all over the country, as well as Greece, all the time learning and fighting.  And so here I am.  Still traveling and fighting.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral and Mara Jade look at him with quite a degree of shock.<br />
<br />
GM:  Now that doesn't make for a very good bedtime story, does it?  Perhaps we had all best go to sleep.  Tomorrow will be another long day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mara and CivGeneral are in a middle of a battle, Right beside her is a Major in the Jade Commandos, a close freind of CivGeneral<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: C'mon, we need to get over that last ridge.<br />
<br />
JC Major: Ill see what I can do. Chances are that we would not sucseed.<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Then it is a risk we need to take.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: We better make it fast.<br />
<br />
The Group dashed across the feild, dodging arrows and blocking sword blows<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Gah, there is to many of them<br />
<br />
JC Major: Ahhh!!!, Ive been hit!!!<br />
<br />
Mara looks behind her and noticed the Major has suffered a mortal wound in his chest<br />
<br />
JC Major: Go, on with.... ...out me. If only we could find a way to dispurse them, then it would be much easyer. Ughhh, uhhhh.<br />
<br />
The JC Major soon colapes and dies<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: CivGeneral, we need to retreat. We are taking heavy casualties.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral, heard Mara's retreat cry and was one step ahead of her. Soon an arrow is in the path of CivGeneral's back. as soon as the Arrow reaches 1 inch from CivGeneral's back, Mara Jade wakes up in a cold sweat<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Noooooooo!!!<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: Huh? what? Whats going on?<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: I had a dream. Everything was going well untill the Major was killed and then you.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: Whoh. Freeky. And let me guess, there were too many troops<br />
<br />
Mara Nods<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: I am afraid we may have to disguise ourselfs in order to disrupt there military line.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: We can ask Grandmaster to see if it is alright.<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Right, and Ill try to grab some Egyptian clothing for our desguise. Ill go in as a dancer and you as my bodyguard.</div></div><hr />

(A note: This dream takes into effect my ruling about RPG2 being like the Sumerians- Gone but known)<br />
Liza is by the sea, in a quaint little Village. All around her are voices <br />
Voices: Goo Goo Goo Joob... Dada... Cu...per....Ta...Nia...Make angry love to the fish!....<br />
Liza wakes up in a cold sweat<br />
Liza: What the hell was THAT<br />
[i[Who knows... Who cares....[/i]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The group wakes up in the morning, each having experienced an odd dream.  The break camp and head out on the road again.  They are unopposed for the entire day, and cover much ground.  During the long, uninterupted trek, they get to talking.<br />
<br />
Liza:  So does anyone have a plan how we're going to even get in to Thebes?  I would imagine its pretty heavilly guarded...<br />
<br />
CG:  Well, me and Mara can go in in disguise.<br />
<br />
GM:  Very well.  I'll go in my usual way.  Liza, Anthony, however you two want to do this is fine.  Go in my way, go in disguised with CivGeneral and Mara, or find your own method.  What matters is that we get into the city.<br />
<br />
Mara:  And what is your way, Grandmaster?<br />
<br />
GM:  The same way I got into your palace.  Walk right in, and give the guards a good reason not to get in your way.<br />
<br />
Mara:  Define &quot;good reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
GM:  Oh, staying alive for instance.  Like I've always said, you can get farther with a sword and a smile than you can with just a smile.<br />
<br />
CG:  But what if there are too many of them?  Like in Mara's dream?  Or if you don't scare them.<br />
<br />
GM:  Don't worry.  If it comes to it, I'll force my way in with steel alone.  So what are you two going to do?<br />
<br />
Anthony:  I think I'll go in disguise with CivGeneral.  Liza?<br />
<br />
Liza:  I'm just a young girl wandering through the countryside.  ;) The guards will let me in.<br />
<br />
GM:  Very well.  The plan is set.  By this time tomorrow, we will be at the gates of Thebes.  Twenty-four hours after that, the war will be over.<br />
<br />
Anthony:  I'm not so sure.  You saw in that ambush before, the Egyptian soldiers are fanatics.  They'll fight even if we make peace.  What if this whole thing doesn't work?<br />
<br />
GM:  That is a strong possibility.  If this fails, the war will continue, and we will all certainly die.  But what if it doesn't fail?  What if tomorrow the war could be over?  Isn't that worth trying for?  Isn't that worth dying for?<br />
<br />
Liza:  Yes, you're right.  We have to end this war.  We have to get to Thebes and we have to do all we can.  Come on, let's hurry up.<br />
<br />
And so they continue on at a faster pace towards the Capital of Egypt, and a possible end to the Egypto-Fanatican War.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mara Jade: Ill go in as &quot;Arica&quot;, CivGeneral will go in as &quot;Mustafa&quot;, and Anthony should go in as &quot;Mohammed&quot;, an Egyptian Colonel.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster: Sounds good, How is the plan going to work?<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: &quot;Arica&quot; will get the troops distracted with her dancing, I would stand guard, and &quot;Mohammed&quot; would change. the battle plans around<br />
<br />
Anthony: Hehe, it would be quite. *ahem* interesting to see the plans changed and watching them fire in the other direction.<br />
<br />
Mara puts on an Egyptian dancer out fit, CivGeneral gets out a Turbin and an Egyptian Saber sword, Anthony puts on an Egyptian Colonel's outfit.<br />
<br />
OOC: Note - The names in quotation marks are there desguised name. The real name will be intact to make the identification easyer.<br />
<br />
Mara Jade &quot;Arica&quot;: Ready &quot;Mustafa&quot;, Ready &quot;Mohammed&quot;.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral &quot;Mustafa&quot;: Ready when you are<br />
<br />
Anthony &quot;Mohammed&quot;: Lets set the chaos in motion.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you can implement Anhtony's dream into the story when you get to Cleo... If you're real good, you'll know what to do ;).<br />
<br />
Anthony &quot;Mohammed&quot;: So, are we just going to stand here like turkeys on a rainy day?<br />
<br />
Mara &quot;Arica&quot;: Come on then. Mustafa, lead me please ;)<br />
<br />
CivGeneral &quot;Mustafa&quot;: With pleasure ;)<br />
<br />
They walk into the headquarters, and an Egyptian Private stops them.<br />
<br />
Egyptian: Where are you going?<br />
<br />
Anthony(In Egyptian tongue): How dare you stop me! I am a colonel, now step aside!<br />
<br />
Egyptian: Oh yes, sorry. Go right ahead.<br />
<br />
The trio walks in. The soldiers are amazed by &quot;Arica's&quot; dancing. &quot;Mustafa&quot; stands guard making sure no one nabs her while &quot;Mohammed&quot; changes the plans accordingly. On the night they &quot;visit&quot; Cleo, there should be 2-5 guards in the palace, as opposed to the 10-30 guards.<br />
<br />
Anthony: Ready, let's go &quot;Mustafa&quot;<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: &quot;Arica&quot;, let's go!<br />
<br />
Soldier: Awwwe, you have to take her away?<br />
<br />
Mara: Yes, now move!<br />
<br />
The soldier grabs Mara and starts to sun off. CivGeneral just watches cause he knows Mara can take care of herself.<br />
Mara takes out a knife and slits the soldiers threat, and then walks away, snickering.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: Good job. Now we should be going.<br />
<br />
The other soldiers stand back as if the three were rattlesnake posoin.<br />
<br />
Anthony: Now, we must get into the palace and meet Grandmaster and Liza.<br />
<br />
A little voice goes, &quot;LIZA WITH A Z!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meanwhile, at the entrance to the Theban Palace, home of Celopatra herself, a black figure lurks in the shadows.  He makes not a sound, and his movement is invisible.  The Royal Guards at the door to the Palace do not see or hear him.  That is, until he emerges from the shadows behind them.  He wraps is arm around one's neck, dagger in hand, squeezing hard enough to prevent him from making a sound.<br />
<br />
GM:  Good evening, gentlemen.  I am here to see your Queen Cleopatra.  This is a social visit, so there is no need for armed guards to be present while I am speaking with her.<br />
<br />
Guard:  We can't do that!  Now get out of here, or we will be forced to kill you!<br />
<br />
GM:  &quot;We&quot;?  One of you is as good as dead right now if you don't let me in.  If you do, you will both live.  The choice is yours.<br />
<br />
Trapped Guard:  For God's sake man let him in!<br />
<br />
Guard:  No!  It is our duty to defend the Daughter of Osiris!<br />
<br />
GM:  Very well.<br />
<br />
The cloaked figure begins to press the dagger against the guards throat.<br />
<br />
Guard:  No! Don't!  We'll let you in!<br />
<br />
GM (releasing him): Excellant.  Now, both of you run along and make sure not to tell anybody about this.<br />
<br />
The two guards unlock the door, then start to walk away as quickly as they can.  Grandmaster turns, takes aim, and throws his dagger into the back of one.  He falls instantly.  The other turns to see what has happened and gets a rod of ice-cold steel through the chest.  He cannot even cry out, and crumbles to the floor like a rag doll.  Grandmaster opens the door and enters the Palace.<br />
<br />
Inside, he finds a shadow and hides amongst it.  He waits for several minutes until his companions arrive.<br />
<br />
GM:  Good, you are here.  I trust the plans have been altered as desired?<br />
<br />
Anthony:  Yes, and we should be going now.<br />
<br />
GM:  Why?  The throne room is right over there.<br />
<br />
Anthony:  You mean we're going in tonight?<br />
<br />
GM:  Yes, of course.  That was the plan.<br />
<br />
Anthony:  But the change in plans won't be enacted until tomorrow!<br />
<br />
GM:  Then we must go ahead with their original plans intact.  We cannot afford to wait until tomorrow.  Tomorrow the garrisons will be on full alert.  Tonight they are not.<br />
<br />
CG:  Why is tonight different then tomorrow night?<br />
<br />
GM:  Today was the Egyptian National Holdiay.  Celebrating the &quot;birthday&quot; of their nation as was recorded in their damned infidel mythology.  The mead is flowing in the taverns and the hashish is burning in the barracks.  They are in no state to fight tonight.  Tomorrow they will be sober.  That is why I planned the attack to go today.<br />
<br />
CG:  Oh.....<br />
<br />
GM:  We've waited long enough.  Let's move.  The plan is this.  CivGeneral and myself will enter the throne room to &quot;negotiate&quot; with Cleopatra.  Anthony, you will stand guard out here and watch for patrolling guards.  Mara, you will be our backup if one of us falls in there.  And Liza, we're counting on you to be the level-headed one who can actually make a peace settlement.  Wars are won by killing soldiers and talking with politicans, not the other way around.  Now let's go.<br />
<br />
Sword in hand, Grandmaster pushes open the throne room door.  He and CivGeneral step in, and see the look of shock on the faces of the Royal Guards.<br />
<br />
Guard 1:  Who are you?!<br />
<br />
GM:  That is of no consequence.  You will leave now.<br />
<br />
Guard 2:  Like hell we will!  Be gone with you, intruder, or feel the sting of my steel!<br />
<br />
GM:  I'm shaking in my boots.  Now get out, before I become angry.  You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.<br />
<br />
Guard 1:  Oh really?  Well take this!<br />
<br />
The two guards rush Grandmaster and CivGeneral.  CivGeneral draws his ornate royal shortsword, but does not have a chance to use it.  In a blur of motion, Grandmaster raises his sword and makes a single fluid spinning motion, cutting open the chest of one guard and deflecting the blow of the other.  The guard is shocked, and doesn't react in time to deflect the sword that is braught down upon his right shoulder with enough force to shatter the bone and throw him to the ground.  Grandmaster plunges the sword into his heart and then looks up at the Egyptian Queen.  He see four more guards come out from behind her throne.<br />
<br />
GM:  CivGeneral, you take the two on the right.  I'll take the left.<br />
<br />
CG:  Works for me.<br />
<br />
Again the guards foolishly charge the two men, and again they become playthings for the warriors' blades.<br />
<br />
GM:  Well, m'lady, I must say that you need a better protective detail than that.  Soldiers of such poor skill would be security guards at gladiatorial matches in Fanatica, certainly not Palace Guards.  Or maybe I just picked a bad time?  After all, today is National Hashish Day or something, isn't it?<br />
<br />
Cleo:  It is the Egyptian National Holiday, the day our immortal nation was ordained by the Gods!<br />
<br />
GM:  Right, right, I forgot.  I am truly sorry.  Let me introduce myself.  I am Grandmaster of Vaniria, and I am your nation's worst nightmare.  This here is CivGeneral.  He is the future King of Fanatica.  And I take it you are Cleopatra?<br />
<br />
Cleo:  Yes, I am.<br />
<br />
GM:  Good, then I am in the right place.  I would be quite disappointed if I had killed those guards for nothing.  Anyway, we are here to discuss with you the war between our nations.<br />
<br />
Cleo:  Oh, the one I am winning?  From what my advisors tell me, Fanatican troops aren't even in the country, and we have taken several of your cities.  They say my people are fanatically loyal to me, you know.<br />
<br />
GM:  Funny, the leader of ancient Babylon was told the same things before his empire collapsed.  Let me fill you in on the truth.  Fanatica has taken control of much of your country.  You power is slipping.  We have turned your once-formidable military into a scrap heap.  And we are not done.  I am here today as an embassery of Fanatica.  I wish to end this war right now.  Therefore, I make you this deal.  If you sign a surrender document right now, and order your troops to stop fighting, I will allow you to live and this city to stand.<br />
<br />
Cleo:  How dare you threaten me!  I am a Queen!  And what are you?  A bloody peasant!<br />
<br />
GM:  I figured as much.  Perhaps I had best just turn myself in.  Please call you finest Military Police unit, and have them come and arrest me.<br />
<br />
Cleo:  Royal Messenger!<br />
<br />
Messenger:  Yes, m'lady?<br />
<br />
Cleo:  Get the MP's and have them arrest this man!<br />
<br />
Messenger:  Yes ma'am.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later the Palace MP's arrive.  They have short swords and manacles out, ready for use against the two intruders.<br />
<br />
GM:  About time you got here, boys.  Please, come put those chains on me if you will.<br />
<br />
An MP officer approaches with the chains.  He gets within three feet, when there is suddenly the high-pitched song of thin steel cutting through the air, and his head falls to the floor.<br />
<br />
GM:  Who's next, then?<br />
<br />
[i]The MP's run from the room, deserting their &quot;immortal&quot; leader./i]<br />
<br />
GM:  See what I mean?  Now, are you going to surrender or not?<br />
<br />
Cleo:  No, I will never surrender.</div></div><hr />

Mara Jade: Charming Place<br />
<br />
Liza: Enough Gawking, lets move<br />
<br />
Mara runs up to CivGeneal's side, Liza runs up to the right of Grandmaster. Mara, CivGeneral, and Grandmaster walks up to Cleo herself. Mara and CivGeneral Pulls out an iron Knife, Grandmaster still has his sword out<br />
<br />
Grandmaster: You are surounded. What are you going to do now?<br />
<br />
Cleo: I would rather Die than Surrender<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Then you dont happen to hear about my Jade's List?<br />
<br />
Cleo: Jade's List?<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: All of my Targets ends up in the liast. Hense being &quot;Jaded&quot;<br />
<br />
Cleo: *Gulps*<br />
<br />
Grandmaster: YOu better do as we say, or<br />
<br />
Mara Jade makes a cutting action to the thought with her fingers. Soon Anthony barges in<br />
<br />
Mara, GM, Liza, &amp; CG: Anthony!!!<br />
<br />
Cleo Dips her fingers in a poisonus substance and sneeks behind Mara<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: What are you doing here?<br />
<br />
Anthony: Helpiung you, of course. Mara Look out Behind you!!!!<br />
<br />
Mara Jade Trips Cleo and backflips Cleo onto the floor<br />
<br />
Cleo: *Ugh* Mara is to strong....<br />
<br />
Cleo looks at Anthony<br />
<br />
Cleo: Maybe your little Freind is worthy<br />
<br />
Anthony: Heh, I dont think So. Be prepared to be killed<br />
<br />
GM: Anthony, NO!<br />
<br />
But it is too late. Anthony and Cleo engage in a spectacular brawl. Pucnhes, kicks, blocks, counterattacks, evasions, everything. Then, Cleo scratches Anthony right down the left arm. He screams in terror, and in blind fury, punchs Cleo in the chest. Cleo goes flying back 6 feet. Her chest was crushed, be she is still alive. Grandmaster rushes to her, and holds his sword at her heart.<br />
<br />
GM: Do you surrender now?<br />
<br />
Cleo: NEVER!<br />
<br />
GM plunges the sword into her heart, Mara Jade Slices Cleo's Neck. Cleo dies instantly. But now, they have to help Anthony. He was hit with some kind of posion, and must be cured. He starts bumbling around, and finally falls down.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster, CivGeneral, Liza, and Mara: ANTHONY!<br />
<br />
Anthony(as they all hudle over him): It was nice fighting with you. (He suddenly starts to convulse). Help..... me..... Don't let the darkness come!!<br />
<br />
Anthony faints, his face wet with cold sweat. The group knows they must find a Karabala to get him cured.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: There is a Fanatican Karabala outside Thebes, if we hurry, we can save Anthony!<br />
<br />
GM: OK, CivGeneral, help me carry him. Mara and Liza: lead the way.<br />
<br />
They hurry out with Anthony. His time is running out..... Will they make it in time to save Anthony?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The others cannot understand a thing, but the carry on.<br />
<br />
Anthony: It's coming! I can't stop it! HELP! Please, don't let it! DON'T LET IT!!!<br />
<br />
Again, no one understands him. His eyes start to turn a dark black color(the whole eye, not just the iris), but no one notices because he is on CivGeneral and Grandmaster's shoulders.<br />
<br />
Anthony: The Darkness! It is coming! I'm... I'm...... I'm losing my eyes!<br />

Karbala: Right away.<br />
<br />
Karbala and CivGeneral work up a liquid concotion that would help Anthony. Suddenly Mara Jade goes into a trance like state<br />
Mara jade's Trance<br />
Mara Jade: Huh? Where am I?<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #1: You are in the land of mysteries, Mara Jade<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #3: You have the potion to cure your freind<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: But, CivGeneral and Karbala are working on it now<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #2: Bah, Witch Doctors and Alchemists dont posses the potion to cure Anthony<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #1 Walks to Mara Jade and hands her a vial of the potion<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #3: You must remember these words.<br />
<br />
Anceant Walkers 1,2 &amp; 3: Aquas, arrakis, melange, amal, lifestanus<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #2: If you fail to say this, your Freind would certanly die.<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #1: Come Mara, let us show you whats going on in Anthony's mind<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: O.. O... ...Ok<br />
<br />
The Anceant Walkers escourt Mara Jade to a wall, Suddenly the wall sworls around and suddenly Mara can see Anthony in a maze<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Anthony!!!<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #3: Anthony cannot hear you<br />
<br />
Anthony: Mara? CivGeneral? where are you<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #1: Mara Jade, you best return back. and dont forget the words<br />
<br />
Suddenly Mara Jade snaps out of her trance<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Whoh, that was wierd<br />
<br />
Karbala: This should be the final product?<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: are you sure that it can neutralize the poison<br />
<br />
Karbala: I am positive<br />
<br />
Mara Jade reaches into her pocket, then pulls out the potion. Mara is shocked to realized the trance was real<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Wait!!! You are giving him the wrong liquid.<br />
<br />
Mara Jade pushes Karbala out of the way. In the process, Karbala drops his and CG's flask onto the floor. CivGeneral stands in amasement, soon CivGeneral hears a voice from one of the Anceant Walkers<br />
<br />
Anceant Walker #1: Let Mara Jade give Anthony that potion, dont let Karbala interfear<br />
<br />
CivGeneral holds Karbala down<br />
<br />
Karbala: What are you doing? Have you gone mad?<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: No, I have heard the Anceant Walkers, and Mara Jade was in a trance.<br />
<br />
Karbala looks at admasement<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: I hope this works.<br />
<br />
Mara Jade pours the potion into Anthony's mouth<br />
<br />
Mara Jade:  Aquas, arrakis, melange, amal, lifestanus<br />
<br />
The Anceant Walkers looks on and vanish. Anthony beguins to turn normal, nolonger is he convulging and having Alucinations. Anthony is returned to normal, but he will bear the scars of his wonds, his Eyes will be Perminately Black<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Whoh, it worked<br />
<br />
Mara Jade runs up to CivGeneral and Hugs him<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Ive did it<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: I knew you had it in you.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster: Now if we can stop getting mushy about it, we have an Empire to destroy.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral &amp; Mara Jade: Right</div></div><hr />

Liza: Cool! Now that we've played Miracle worker, how about we go and mess around with Thebes a bit. Who wants to pillage?!?<br />
All: We do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With their friend healed, the travelers decide how they will go about ravaging Thebes.  Grandmaster has laid a large map of the city and surrounding area on the table.<br />
<br />
GM:  OK, here and here are guard barracks.  Inside each of those barracks is more than 100 troops.  Each barracks has its own armory, stables, food supplies... everything an army needs.  If we could destroy those barrack complexes somehow, we could put some major hurt on the bad guys.  Similarly, this building here is the Decagon, the centralized command post for the entire Egyptian army.  Hitting that hard enough would disrupt the entire military, and maybe give the Legions a chance to wrap up the remaining pckets of resistance.  And finally, these two roads are the lifelines into and out of Thebes.  If they were to be disrupted, it would make it nearly impossible for Egyptian reinforcements to get to the city quickly.  That is vital if we are going to go after the other targets.<br />
<br />
CG:  So, what do we hit the targets with?  I mean, we don't have any artillery or anything.<br />
<br />
GM:  No, but we have fire.  And on top of that, whale oil.<br />
<br />
Mara:  Whale oil?<br />
<br />
GM:  Whale oil.  CivGeneral, you're an alchemist, correct?<br />
<br />
CG:  Yes.<br />
<br />
GM:  Then I am sure you have heard of naptha.<br />
<br />
CG:  Greek fire, isn't it?  But I'm not sure how one makes it. <br />
<br />
GM:  It's jellied oil.  The Greeks use some sort of oil that I've never actually seen, but I think the same process can be applied to whale oil as well, and we have plenty of that available right in the city market.  Liza, I need you to go into town and purchase as much whale oil as you can.  Also, purchase some candle wicks, and several clay pots.  Can you do that?<br />
<br />
Liza:  Sure.  I'll be back shortly.<br />
<br />
Liza leaves to buy the ingredients for the killer cocktail.<br />
<br />
GM:  Alright, what we'll do is this.  We mix up some naptha, and put them in the clay pots with wicks.  We'll place them attack key points in the barrack installations and in the Decagon, and then set them off.  They should start a nice sized fire.  If do this at night, we might be able to burn the entire city garrison while they sleep.  While that fire is burning, we can launch a small raid with conventional weapons, go in there and troch thing that weren;t hit with the naptha, maybe cut up some soldiers.  Then we withdraw.<br />
<br />
CG:  And the roads?<br />
<br />
GM:  Roadblocks, fires, digging up sections of road, changing signs..... whatever we need to do to put it out of service.  Everyone alright with that?<br />
<br />
The nod their agreement, and all sit down to wait for Liza's return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Liza returns about 2 hours later, dragging a wooden cart loaded with clay pots, a box of cotton wicks, and numerous vessels of whale oil.<br />
<br />
GM:  Excellent.  Friend Karbala, do you by any chance have any sulfur, lime, or phosphorous?<br />
<br />
Karbala:  Indeed.  I have been experimenting with them to find cures for ailments.<br />
<br />
GM:  Would it be alright if we were to use some of your stock?<br />
<br />
Karbala:  Certainly, friend.  If it will help end the tyranny of these Egyptian mongrels, then use it all.<br />
<br />
That said, Grandmaster and CivGeneral go around the house collecting the necessary items.  Two large bronze pots are placed on the table.  They are filled half-way with whale oil.  The sulfur, lime, and phosphorous is then mixed into the oil, and the oil is beaten with a large spoon until it becomes a stiff but amorphous jelly.  It the naptha is then poured into the clay jars, and a wick inserted.  The process is then repeated, until they have 15 jars of naptha and have expended their supplies of oil.<br />
<br />
Mara:  So that stuff burns?<br />
<br />
GM:  Yes, incredibly well.  I have seen it used in combat.  During the war between my home town and our neighboring province, they attempted to make a sea landing behind an enemy fortification so they wouldn't have to engage the keep.  The enemy used catapults to throw jars exactly like these at the ships.  Those that hit shattered and set the entire ship ablaze.  Those that missed floated in the water, and when the ships crashed into them they shattered and burned, creating a layer of fire over the water itself.  Not to mention that it clings to human skin like no other substance I have ever seen.  This will be our weapon for destroying the Egyptian military presence in Thebes.<br />
<br />
Liza:  So what now?<br />
<br />
GM:  Now we wait for nightfall.  At midnight, there is a shift change in all three buildings, and the rest of the soldiers are asleep.  That is when we strike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That night before the raid on Thebes, Anthony walks up to Mara.<br />
<br />
Anthony: Mara, I want to talk to you...<br />
<br />
She turns around.<br />
<br />
Anthony: Thank you for saving my life. You have my deepest gratitude, and I want to repay you.<br />
<br />
Anthony takes out a box from his pouch.<br />
<br />
Mara: Is that.... is that the spice!? Isn't it your last ounces?<br />
<br />
The spice Anthony has given Mara is a sacred spice. It is very rare, and only found in the ancient desert of the Giant Worms. It has powerful effects. It greatly improves the immune system, and sometimes, when eaten long enough, will turn one's eyes a deep blue. If it is eaten longer too, one will start to have visions of the future... This powerful substance is called Melange.<br />
<br />
Anthony: I know it is my last ounces, so I am giving it to you. It saved my life, and it may save your's too. This is what is giving me vision, so I will have to travel to the Ancient Desert soon, when our odyssey is ends, but I know it will not... You can join me if you like, but it is a hard journey.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral walks in.<br />
<br />
CG: Come on you too, we must go now. The raid is beginning.<br />
<br />
They walk out, and Mara eats a piece of the spice before they leave.</div></div><hr />

CivGeneral: Thanks<br />

CivGeneral eats a piece of the spice<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: Well, Anthony can be the Best Man. After the War, we should unite and go with Anthony as our little vacation<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With Mara and CivGeneral's.... &quot;romantic needs&quot;..... out of the way, the warriors set out for the raid which they hope will set the Egyptians off balance and knock out Thebes once and for all.  Under cover of darkness they move, slipping into the city through a small breach in the western wall.  Grandmaster and CivGeneral each wield swords, Mara holds a spear, Liza cradles a shortbow, and Anthony carries the incendiaries.  They split up inside the city, with CivGeneral, Mara, and Anthony going to one barrack complex and Grandmaster and Liza (with Grandmaster no carrying some of the jars) to the other.  At exactly 11:58 both teams arrive at their objectives.  They watch, invisible in the darkness, as the guard shifts change inside each structure.<br />
<br />
GM:  OK, while they're distracted, let's move.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster runs up to the building wall, crouched down, and places a jar against the wall.  He takes a long hemp rope covered in clay that is wrapped around his shoulder, and places it into the jar.  This will serve as a time-delay fuse.  Simultaneously, CivGeneral does the same at his objective.  The fuses are lit, and the clay causes them to burn slowly and also conceals the small flame, so it is not noticed by the guards.  Grandmaster and Liza then move on to the actual barracks, placing two of the jars against the east wall and setting them with a single, two-branched time-delay fuse.<br />
<br />
CG:  That should take care of the barracks, right?<br />
<br />
Mara:  I think so...<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
GM:  Alright, that's enough for this building.  Let's move on.  For my next trick, I'll burn the armory.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral's team moves to the guard tower that overlooks the city.  A team of archers is stationed atop it, bows facing outwards, ready to shower the city with death if need be.  A jar is placed at the base of one support leg, and cotton ropes soaked in whale oil are tied around the others and placed in the jar.  A time-delay fuse is then set in it, and the team slinks off into the darkness and waits for the fireworks to begin.  Meanwhile, at the other camp, Grandmaster slashes the throat of the lone guard defending the Armory, and slips inside.  He places the incendiary charge, but decides to wait on the fuse.  Before lighting that he loads his pack with arrows and whatever small weapons he can fit in there.  He then takes a bow, lights the fuse, and runs from the building.<br />
<br />
GM:  Alright, let's take horses from the stable and get out of here.<br />
<br />
Liza:  Sounds like a plan.<br />
<br />
They sneak into the stables, where Liza silently dispatches the two guards with her bow.  They untie two horses, mounted, and ride out of the camp at full speed.  They ride for several minutes, into the heart of the city, where they become just two more faceless Egyptian citizens.  Approximately 15 minutes after the first charge was set, a pillar of fire reaches into the air.  Shortly after that, more appear on the horizon.  Soon, the entirety of the two barrack complexes are engulfed in flame.  Nobody knows what is happening, and nobody notices five people slip into the shadow and head towards Military HQ.<br />
<br />
The Fanaticans emerge from the shadowy back-alley right outside the walls of Military HQ, the Decagon.  The gate guards, as well as many of the men stationed inside, had rushed off to help at the barracks', or to alert high-echelon commanders of the situation.  This makes it easy for the five combatants to get inside.  They approach the outer wall of the section of the building belonging to the Army Department.  Here they place the last two jars of naptha, and set them with much shorter fuses.  They run away from the area, leave the walled complex, and slip once again into the shadowy darkness.  They stay only long enough to see the jar shatter as the super-heated jelly burst into flame, setting the highest seat of command in Egypt aflame.  They than flee the city, to the relative safety of the Karbala's hut.</div></div><hr />

Anthony: No doubt the Egyptians will come looking for us. We should keep moving around, attackin Cleo Loyalists. It would be a shame to disband ourselves after all we have done...<br />
<br />
Karbala: You are correct. You are fantastic people. You must continue to stop Egypt, and even fight tyrants all over.<br />

Well, now that the Egypt war is over, what am I going to do now? I heard from some Egyptian merchants about the Peace deal. How we managed to get audiences with Emperor Xerxes, Chairman Mao and King Hammurabi. I also heard that we may end up in a revised governmental system... Caste system... Stupid... When will the people rise up and take command of their own lives? Well, all I know is SaaM most likely is busy learning Persian, Babylonian and Chinese. Last thing I need... More languages for him to annoy me in. He can already do it in Regal Fanatican, the Latin dialect, Italian, Sicilian, the Penguinadiuan dialect, the Gorinan dialect, Noshuretian dialect, Queens Egyptian, Greek, both Spartan and Athenan dialet, Aztecian... Aztecian.. Is that EVEN a word? I am a weirdo... Well, at least I will be able to yell at him in Mephian Egyptian.  But what to do with myself now? Join a peace corps? Start a business. Knowing SaaM, hes most likely started something to do with paperwork filing. These stone towers have given me an idea... Perhaps, but mabey.. All I need to know is the land stats of the DiSaaMuel province. Mabey SaaM has the paperwork done... Did I just say Mabey, Paperwork and SaaM in one sentence? Of course he has it done.  (OCC- I dont :)) Mabey when the true heir to Helenatica returns, SaaM will be able to continue just doing Paperwork and stop worring about all of Southern Fanatica. Well, all I care about now is getting home. Mabey I can pawn off all these relics I have. Wonder if anyone wants something called a Sphinx...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The war was over, and the question was what to do now.  Go home?  Keep fighting?  Grandmaster could not know what the others were thinking, but he considered what he himself would do.<br />
<br />
GM:  The war with Egypt is over, but my war is not.  I will return to Fanatica and continue to fight as I have been fighting.  But no longer as a guerilla.  I have a province now, and have been assured of rank elevation by CivGeneral.... I will raise an army, and with that I will fight against the unjust nobles of the land.  My army will stand for justice, and all who would resist my fair justice will be cut down like dogs in the street.  But first, there is one more thing I must do here.  The Egyptian military and political leadership has been decapitated.  The only thing left to take out to bring about the total collapse of Egyptian society is the destruction of their unholy religious authority.  Yes, I will carry out one last strike, and finish Egypt off for good....</div></div><hr />
