		<div>Exiled from Celtonia for crimes of sedition and for refusing to use modern printing machines, Daftpanzer, the Mad Celtic Scribe, sits in a shed in the frozen land of  Alaska and writes his epic work... <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpscribe2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<b><u>“History of the world so far, according to the Celts”</u></b><br />
<br />
The World:<br />
The sacred number of Two is repeated in the geology of this world. There are two great continents, simply known to the Celts as the Home Continent and the Other Continent. Two oceans and two polar seas separate these continents. The Other Contient has two large islands, known as Alaska and Gotland. The Home Continent has two small islands/archipelagos, called Coritan and the East Isles. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpr5000.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
The Humans:<br />
Human civilisations began to develop all around the world at around 5000bc. Little is recorded from the first 3000 years of civilisation. But by 2000bc, 14 separate civilisations had been well established, dividing up much of the world between them. <br />
<br />
On the home continent, there were:<br />
The Celts, The Inca, The Portuguese, The Byzantines, the Mayans, The Hittites, and The Dutch.<br />
<br />
On the other continent, there were:<br />
The Aztecs, The Spanish, The French, The Germans, The Iroquois, The Americans and The Scandinavians.<br />
<br />
The Celtic History:<br />
Tales tell of the first expedition of Celtic clans to create a second city, and how it was ambushed and massacred by native tribes. But these ‘barbarians’ were gradually defeated, and eventually more cities were founded as the Celtic culture began to expand. Wise and enlightened leaders emerged to weld the clans into a unified civilization. Celtonia was born, with a destiny to enforce peace and justice throughout the world.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpr2050.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(World by 2050bc)<br />
<br />
Soon the Celts came into contact with another civilisation, the Incas. The Inca were warlike and already very powerful. Soon they had completely destroyed and absorbed the Portuguese civilisation. Regrettably, the Celts had helped this by destroying a Portuguese attempt to colonise in Celtonia, mistaking it for hostile expansion. The Inca then entered a long period of war with the Celts in the north and the Mayans in the south.<br />
<br />
The Incas expanded into Mayan land, but in the north the Celts were able to fight back. The Celts had access to iron and, with their elite Gallic Swordsmen, they fought the Inca to a standstill and even claimed some land.<br />
<br />
After this first period of war lasting centuries, there was again a time of uneasy peace. It was during this time that the Vikings arrived after making the first trans-continental voyages, creating colonies on the northern tip of Celtonia. The Vikings and Celts would live in peace for a long time. The Vikings established a colonial empire at a very early time in history, with colonies scattered all around the world. But they never had any real focused military power beyond their own homeland. <br />
<br />
Inspired by the Vikings, Celtic voyages later managed to make their own ocean crossing to reach the other continent. The Celts were able to establish contacts with all of the civilizations of the world at a fairly early time in history. The Celts were able to profit from this by trading ideas and technology between the continents. Celtic colonies were also created on small islands off the home continent during this time.<br />
<br />
Later the ‘medieval’ age dawned, and there were several centuries of renewed war with the Inca. The Celts were among the first to use armoured medieval infantry and concentrated trebuchet artillery. The Celts tried hard to push south, but at the walls of the Inca capitol they were painfully forced back by the Inca, who were also developing new weapons. The Celts now paid the Byzantines to enter the war against the Inca. The Byzantines had a powerful force of armoured horsemen. This time, the Mayans, Byzantines and Celts smashed the Inca power for good. <br />
<br />
The Celts took control of much of northern Inca land including their capitol. But further south, they did their best to help the Inca survive, while the Mayans, Dutch, and Byzantines tried to take the last Inca lands.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpr1550.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(Celts overrun Incan heartlands around 1550bc)<br />
<br />
The Celts now established a strong nation in the north of the home continent. Relations with the Byzantines turned sour after they tried to destroy the last free Inca cities, and also tried to attack the Viking colonies on the north of Celtonia. <br />
<br />
Later, on the other continent, the Aztecs were wiped out by Germany, before the Celts really knew what was happening. Two civilizations had now been destroyed, and the Celts were determined the Aztecs would be the last to suffer such a fate.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpr1475.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(Aztecs fall to Germany around 1475bc, while France begins a long conquest of Scandinavia and the surviving Incan empire continues to be partitioned)<br />
<br />
Back home, there was war with the Byzantines, Hittites and Mayans in turn. The Hittites did the most damage with the first use of massed cavalry in a surprise attack, almost crippling Celtonia. The Dutch had a short-lived expansion into parts of the old Inca empire, but were later threatened by the rallying Mayans. The Dutch held out only because of their elite mercenary pikemen, until the Celts intervened and occupied much of the mayan lands (including their wonder-filled capitol) for some time. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpr1250.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(Short-lived Hittite and Dutch expansion)<br />
<br />
At the end, the Celts were the strongest single power on their continent, with their allies the Dutch also strong in the south. Gunpowder weapons and new cavalry tactics had now arrived, revolutionising warfare. With their borders seemingly secure, the Celts abandoned the old monarchy system in favour of a very productive democracy.<br />
<br />
Celtic influence spread to the other continent when Spain, and later America, declared war. A first attempt at invading Spain was a disaster, despite the Spanish having only five main cities and medieval technology. Around ten Celtic divisions were completely massacred. This disaster could only be avenged by a complete defeat of the Spanish. Meanwhile, the island of Alaska was captured from America in the first successful amphibious operation. The Celts then returned to Spain in force, this time with improved rifles, and much of the country was finally conquered. Only one Spanish city remained free.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, after conquering and colonising the Aztecs, the Germans were later attacked by both their neighbours, the Iroquois and the USA. Germany could not hold against these two powerful nations. The USA grabbed the Aztec lands, while the Iroquois overran much of Germany. The Celts provided a refuge for the German king, giving the Germans one of the cities captured from the Incas on the home continent, half a world away from Germany. Their civilisation survived as Berlin was overrun.<br />
<br />
By now Scandinavia had gone into decline. They declared war on the Celts, who replied by annexing several Scandinavian colonies. The Scandinavians also suffered losses to the Americans, and lost most of their homeland to France. In the end, they were exiled to a single large island with only three main cities. Meanwhile, the industrial age dawned for the Celts, with others following later. Many nations began to use new improved rifles in battle. <br />
<br />
The Celts also pioneered the use of steam power and railways at this time. They also developed ironclads, the only nation to do so. Celtic naval power was to gradually increase far beyond anything else in the world, with the new resources and technology available. Meanwhile, cavalry attacks remained the normal tactic on land. The Celts began to lean away from democracy towards communism as a form of government for their widespread peacekeeping areas.<br />
<br />
The Iroquois and the USA looked set to dominate the world with their powerful alliance and increasing industry and technology. But then the Iroquois turned on the Americans in a surprise betrayal. As the Iroquois overran much of America, with only Washington and a few tough northern cities holding out, the Celts saw a chance to intervene to prevent a single Iroquois superpower. ‘World war one’ began.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpr1009.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(Start of world war one, 1009bc. Greatest Iroquois expansion. Most of spain has been conquered by Celtic forces)<br />
<br />
The Celts attacked from Spain, and later landed in occupied Germany to return those cities to the exiled German control. The French also attacked the Aztec lands after they were bribed to join the war, and the USA was still holding out and fighting back. After an exhausting war the Iroquois were defeated and brought to peace, although their homeland was mainly untouched. The Celts became the worlds leading power, able to fight on both continents. And they needed to be, as the Celts now had few friends.<br />
<br />
Liberating all of Germany was a major achievement for the Celts. They also helped restore the borders of America and returned much of Spain to independent control, but still held onto the Aztec lands. Only a little actual Iroquois land was occupied after ww1. <br />
<br />
But France now became fascist and even more aggressive. The French overran Spanish lands almost as soon as the Celts had made them independent. The Celts were forced to hand over an island colony captured from the Vikings as a home for Isabella as all Spain was conquered and badly looted by the French fascists. It was not long after ww1 and the Celts still had hopes for a long period of peace. But on the home continent, the once-friendly Dutch had also begun to expand too much. <br />
<br />
Additionally, the Hittites seemed weak and were now threatened by the Byzantines again. The Hittites and Byzantines had fought each other on/off for centuries, and usually the Byzantines had the advantage. But the Celts had often intervened to prevent conquest by either side.<br />
<br />
As France began to take land from newly liberated Germany and also the Iroquois, The Celts saw no option but to declare war on all of the aggressive nations. The Celts declared war on France, and later declared war on the Dutch and the Byzantines at home, to safeguard Hittite and Mayan land. ‘World war two’ began.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cp952.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(Start of world war two, 952bc. Greatest French Expansion)<br />
<br />
Celtic technology was by now gaining a lead over the other civilisations. Militarily, the Celts had better ships, infantry and artillery than the rest of the world. The Industry and infrastructure of Celtonia was also second to none. The Celts were, however, facing much of the rest of the world at this time.<br />
<br />
The French fought back hard. Their attacks broke through fortified infantry, destroyed whole Celtic cavalry armies and captured cities, some of which were fought over several times. But as the years passed the French wore themselves out with careless attacks. The Celts made more progress after clearing Spain of all French control and concentrating on the main front in the old Aztec lands and Scandinavia. <br />
<br />
In a series of massive battles, the Celts and the Iroquois fought the French all the way through into Scandinavia and then into northern France itself, where peace was eventually signed. Meanwhile the Byzantines also caved in after years of battles and skirmishing in the border regions, pressure from American naval attacks and troops landings, and finally the Celtic occupation of their eastern cities.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpr934bc.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(World after defeat of France)<br />
<br />
It is now the year 934bc. To this day, fighting with the Dutch continues. But the Hittites and Mayans look safe, and it seems only a matter of time before the remaining Dutch empire is dismantled, wars come to an end, and the Celts can reshape the world or even claim most of it for their own. However, in the fallout from the French war, the Iroquois have claimed some of Germany and Scandinavia as theirs and are still at war with France, which now becomes an issue for the Celts… <br />
<br />
The government of Celtonia is also more militaristic and corrupted than ever before. The future is uncertain…</div>

In 934bc, the people of Celtonia were hoping for peace any day. The great war on the other continent seemed to be over, after France had been defeated. On the home continent, Byzantium had also made peace with the Celts. Mayan Crusaders continued their long tradition of warfare, and together with Incan forces they attacked Byzantium in the Amazon jungle area.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/mayaincbyz.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(Mayan Crusaders continue to fight)<br />
<br />
Only the stubborn Dutch now stood in the way of final victory.  While the peace treaty with France was being signed, Dutch troops conducted a surprise landing on Coritan island, a Celtic colony just off the south coast of the home continent, near Holland and the Hittites. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/coritanbow.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(Dutch land on Coritan)<br />
<br />
The island had never been attacked since it was settled in 1975bc, over a thousand years ago. Antique longbows filled much of the island’s armoury. Luckily, there were also some riflemen infantry on the island, and the Dutch attack was repulsed. This was perhaps a warning that Celtonia should be looking after its outposts more carefully, as future years would show…<br />
<br />
Inland, however, the Celtic forces were closing in on the last of the Dutch outposts in Mayan and Hittite lands. As the only enemy left, their defeat seemed inevitable. Peace was finally on the horizon… <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/Iroquoisfcp.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
But there was a problem. In the chaos of the war with France, the Iroquois had established holds on certain territories that did not belong to them – part of Germany and a large part of Scandinavia - and now they would never give up these lands voluntarily. <br />
<br />
The Celts had come close to being able to reshape all the troublesome border regions of the world, or even to take control of them for and extended period. Only the recent Iroquai occupations in Scandinavia and Germany stood in the way of this. <br />
<br />
In the Celtic capitol city of Navua, deep in the peaceful homeland of Celtonia, the high command now met to make the decision – to rest with the current situation and accept peace once the Dutch were defeated, or to go and make a whole new enemy. <br />
<br />

<br />
There were several arguments for waging war on the Iroquois – it would lead to the liberation of all German land, the unification of all Scandinavian lands, and also the protection of weakened France from further Iroquois attacks. The historic and culturally important city of Paris was already under attack from hordes of Iroquois cavalry. <br />
<br />
Even if the French forces had done some terrible things in Spain and elsewhere, the Celts did not want to see such actions repeated again if they could prevent it. The thought of the fascist Iroquai horde plundering and looting one of the worlds great capitols was too much, even if the old French army had been one of the most bitter enemies the Celts had ever fought.<br />

<br />
However, this great war had already stained the lives of far too many, and there was a strong desire to end the fighting. There was also an official right of passage agreement still existing between the Celts and Iroquois, which had been signed to allow Celtic forces to help protect the Iroquois from France at the start of the war. <br />
<br />
The Celts and Iroquois had also just been fighting alongside each other against a common enemy. There had never been any formal alliance, but turning against the Iroquois now would still be a form of betrayal. Overstretching the military was another concern. Holland remained undefeated, and now all of Mexico and Spain now had to be garrisoned, tying up large numbers of infantry forces.<br />
<br />
While the generals and commanders were debating their next move, some unexpected news interrupted the meeting… The USA had just declared war!</div>

<br />
The USA had recently signed a mutual defence treaty with Holland, and it seemed they intended to fully honour the agreement. The Celts where surprised and saddened by this, and they had no issue against the Americans.  All expected the war with the Dutch to be over soon, but now the Dutch had dragged another nation into the fighting.<br />
<br />
However, the Celts were not immediately worried by the threat of the American forces, since the USA was on the other side of the continent from Scandinavia. But the war was now going to be extended for a number of years in any event, until the Americans would accept peace one way or another. Hopefully there would still be no need for major fighting with America.<br />
<br />
So, undaunted by the American declaration, the Celts went ahead with plans to attack the Iroquois. A last attempt at diplomacy failed, as commander Hiawatha refused the Celtic demand to release all German and Scandinavian territory. War was declared, and the Celts had gained two new enemies. <br />
<br />
The Second World War had entered its final phase of insanity, violence and destruction, after which the Celtic nation and the whole world would never be the same.<br />
<br />
Where France had failed and fallen, the Iroquois and the USA now rose to challenge the Celtic attempt to dominate the world scene. Celtic confidence was high after recent years of success, and steep growth in industrial and military strength. By now the Celts also had access to much of the world’s strategic resources. But most of the huge occupied territory was also very war-torn, with very minimal industry, agriculture, or trade. The cities had been devastated, and the remaining foreign populations seemed increasingly unhappy with the Celts.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/politiug3.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
 <br />
By contrast, the Americans and the Iroquois had largely rebuilt their nations since ww1, when they had fought a devastating war against each other. Now they stood strong once again, with well-developed railways and industry. Although, thankfully for the Celts, the pain of the last war was not gone. There was still ill feeling between the two nations, preventing them from working together as close allies.<br />
<br />
Despite gaining two new enemies, the Celtic people and their leaders still had hopes for a quick victory and peace any day. A quick strike against the Iroquois and the Dutch, and it should soon all be over, or so it was thought. The Iroquois were not as powerful as they had been at the start of world war one, when they had almost conquered all of America, Germany, and Mexico. However they were still one of the world’s most powerful nations, and they were still motivated by fascist ideology. Success would depend on taking the imitative and striking out first.<br />
<br />
There wasn’t a moment to loose. Iroquai troops around Reykjavik soon found themselves under fire from long range celtic artillery, and the battle for eastern Scandinavia began…<br />
 <br />
The Celtic cavalry armies of the other continent, battle hardened by decades of fighting with France, advanced rapidly into the Iroquois-occupied territory, backed up by an ironclad squadron off the coast. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/iroqzone2.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
The Iroquois riflemen put up a brave fight, but the odds were firmly against them this time. For once, the Celts had the advantage of surprise and of superior numbers. The flag of Celtonia could now be flown in all of the ancient Scandinavian cities, although some of these were little more than smouldering ruins. <br />
<br />
Simultaneously to the battles in the east, a fierce battle had begun near Paris, where most of the southern Iroquois forces had been gathering. Celtic and Iroquois cavalry were soon going head to head in the surrounding countryside. Although the Iroquois held their ground, enough damage was done to the Iroquai forces in the area to ensure that the French capitol would hold out, and the Celts broke off the attack and left the isolated Iroquois at the mercy of the French.<br />
<br />
And so, with the first stroke, the scattered Iroquai forces in the south had been ‘neutralised’, France seemed safe and Scandinavia was united under Celtic protection. It was hardly a walkover - The Iroquai had put up some brave resistance, and the Celts had taken casualties. An Iroquois fleet had also been spotted heading south, looking for trouble. But so far, in terms of the overall strategy, all was going well for the Celtic commanders.<br />
<br />
There was one remaining objective for this war – removing the Iroquois occupation of Leipzig in Germany. The scattered forces encountered so far were obviously just a small portion of the Iroquois’ true strength. Leipzig was close to the Iroquois heartland, and it would be a much tougher challenge to capture it. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/plibleip.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
The plan of attack was to gather troops from the home continent, land them on the coast of Germany, and then move inland to directly attack Leipzig. The Germans, although neutral and at peace with the Iroquois, had agreed to let Celtic troops pass through their land. The Celts had liberated all of Germany from the Iroquois in the last world war, and now history would be repeated to recapture one last city. <br />
<br />
However, to carry out this plan, the Celts needed to use much of the troops that were still fighting against the Dutch on the home continent. Although the Dutch forces were now relatively few in number compared to the Celts, the war there had dragged on for many years. It took time to advance across the large southern plains, as there were no railways at all, and the Dutch frequently counter-attacked. The Celtic generals were also being cautious, as they did not have a great number of troops themselves.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, the Celtic High Command were now putting pressure on the commanders on the Dutch front to abandon this cautious approach and finally put an end to the war there. Cavalry reinforcements were arriving on the scene after the end of fighting with Byzantium. It was decided to launch a risky, large-scale cavalry assault with little infantry or artillery backup. <br />
<br />
A cavalry attack was launched at the end of 935bc, and by 934bc two separate cavalry forces were soon deep beyond the current front line. In the west, they seemed to take the Dutch by surprise, and soon Ugarit was captured after only a short battle. It had been captured just in time, as several divisons of Dutch troops had been on their way to reinforce the city. The Dutch occupation of this Hittite area had been one of the main reasons the Celts had gone to war with Holland in the first place. Its capture seemed to signal that the end was near… <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/Uguarit.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
Riding with the Celtic cavalry into Ugarit was Army Commander Orgetorix. Years ago, while working as a ‘diplomatic agent’, he had been here when the Dutch first took the city. Now he witnessed the same situation from a different perspective. <br />
<br />
Orgetorix still regretted the civilian lives he had endangered last time he was here. He half-hoped to see one of them in the city, to know the Dutch hadn’t kept them prisoner or executed them. But the greater pain on his mind now was the thousands of Celtic soldiers who had already been killed or horribly wounded under his command.<br />
<br />
Soon Orgetorix received word from high command that, due to his recent victories, he had been promoted to Great Leader of Armies, the highest rank in the Celtic military. Ranks mattered little to him, as he just wanted to do his best to end the war…<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a second Celtic attack over on the east coast arrived at the last Dutch stronghold in Mayan land, the city of Calakmul. In a surprising turn of events, the Dutch defence there had been weakened with help from some Berserker adventurers from Gotland. But there was no time for thanks, as the Vikings were still at war with the Celts also. It seemed the Vikings were fighting everyone these days. A three-way battle began, but soon the berserkers had taken heavy casualties in the face of modern weapons, and it was down to the Celts and Dutch.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpdcb1.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
The Celts tried a coastal bombardment run with some of their latest destroyer ships, but this had little impact on the Dutch defences. It was time for the cavalry to charge into action.  The cavalry attacked Calakmul again and again, taking heavy casualties, but also gradually braking down the Dutch defence. Normally the cavalry would withdraw to regroup, but there was no time, and in any case they were too deep in enemy territory. The Celts had to capture the city no matter what, unfortunately the defences were surprisingly strong. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpdcb2.jpeg" border="0" alt="" />  <br />
<br />
The battered and disorganised Celtic cavalry continued to attack, almost pushed beyond breaking point. For days, the battles continued, each side refusing to budge. But in the end, it was the Dutch who caved in first. Some of their troops were poorly trained, and lacked the discipline for this kind of warfare. A lot had been asked of the cavalry troops, perhaps too much, but they had delivered nonetheless.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/Calakmul.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
Finally the Celts had achieved all they wanted against the Dutch. The Celtic commanders held their breath as peace negotiations were started. The recent advance left many important units in weak positions and vulnerable to counter attack. But then came word that the Dutch government had agreed to sign a historic peace treaty. Finally, it was over… <br />
 <br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/dender.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
The Dutch now accepted the loss of all their former empire, except for the strategic city of Yaxchilan, an ancient mayan city which the Dutch had held for centuries. Elsewhere they were left with only the traditional, national lands of the Dutch culture, which the Celts had not invaded. The lands of Holland’s former empire, which the Celts had helped create in the first place, now formed part of the ‘peacekeeping occupation zones’ that were spreading across the world. <br />
<br />
In future, there were plans to return ancient traditional lands to the Mayans, which they had lost for centuries. However, the Mayans were currently aggressive fascists and the Celts did not want to add to their resources. Ownership of the central land of the south was also disputed between the Dutch, Hittites, Mayans and even the Incas, all of whom had all been dominant there at different times in history, before the Celts arrived. The Celtic high command decided to continue holding on to all of the land for now, to ‘ensure stability in the region’, at least while the war on the other continent continued.<br />
<br />
All the old enemies had now been defeated, and for the Celts it was a cause for some celebration, but also some sadness. World war two should have been over, but now the powerful nations of the Iroquois and the USA where standing in the way of final victory...</div>

		<div>While the year 934bc had ended with good progress against the Iroquois and the final defeat of the Dutch, the Celtic generals had almost forgotten about the USA – who had entered the war against the Celts and were not planning on just sitting around…<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/flaggy.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
 <br />
The Celts first fought a war against the USA around 130 years ago, at a time even before the original invasion of Spain. During the war the Celts captured the island of Alaska and fought a series of small naval battles. Since then, the Celts had been in eastern America during world war one, but this was to liberate American land from Iroquois control. The Celts and USA had never fought a real land war, and it was easy for the Celtic High Command to assume that this would be the case in the current war.<br />
<br />
In 933bc, disturbing reports began to come in from the colony of Yacuida, an important base for the Celtic navy on the coast of the East American peninsular. The Americans were sending a surprisingly strong force against the defences of the outpost, defences which had been neglected for years. <br />
<br />
Yacuida was created by Celtic settlers at the end of world war one, on uninhabited coastal land that was technically part of the USA. But after liberating several American cities from the Iroquois, the celts held onto this land and claimed it to help ‘secure the region’. A fairly prosperous community of shipyard workers and ocean traders had since developed there. It seemed the Americans were still bitter about this land-grab, and where determined to force the celtic colonists off their continent.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/yacatak.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
Originally the outpost had been well defended. But many troops had been taken away to fight the Dutch and French in the previous decades, and the remaining garrisons were not equipped with modern front-line weapons. No attempt to reinforce the outpost had been made since the Americans declared war, and it would now take some time before troops could be sent over from Celtonia. <br />
<br />
Still, there was some hope that the outpost could hold, especially if the Americans tried to assault one of the two huge fortresses guarding the perimeter, where they would surely take heavy losses. Transport ships were being organised to enable an evacuation if necessary, although they would take some time to cross the expanse of the western ocean. <br />
<br />
Soon the American forces were closing in, and the true strength of their forces and their intentions became known. Their attack simply bypassed the western fortress, closing in on the city. The old Celtic cannon batteries in the fortress did their best to bombard the American flanks, but to little effect. <br />
<br />
At the northern fortress, there now occurred a strange episode in the war, the exact facts surrounding which have remained a mystery ever since. A small American cavalry assault force suddenly took control of the northern fortress, the Celtic garrison wiped out with very little or no American casualties at all. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpfortdes.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
(American troops inside the captured Celtic fortifications)<br />
<br />
Where the defenders somehow tricked into letting their guard down? Did an American agent sabotage the defences, causing a huge explosion in the ammunition storage? All that is known for sure is that the American cavalry division took control of the fortress, setting up a position only a few miles from the outpost of Yacuida itself. <br />
<br />
Celtic defences had now been blown open, and were down to two riflemen divisions overall. Much of their old cannon artillery had been captured at the northern fortress and was now in American hands. Yacuida was now very vulnerable, with little in the way of inspiration to give hope to the defenders. A very large American force closed in for the kill, as the Celts were forced to abandon their western fortress to make a last stand in the city. Old celtic transport galleons tried to reach the city to evacuate the defenders, but they were still only halfway across the western ocean when the final battle began. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/big_yacuida3.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
The overwhelming American force soon began to break through the desperate celtic defence. The scattered Celtic navy could send only two warships ships to the area - a destroyer and an ironclad. These ships fought bravely against a large American fleet of frigates, but could make little impression and had to return east to protect the approaching transports. Yacuida was now surrounded and overwhelmed by land and by sea. <br />
<br />
The Americans, using the cannons captured from the Celts, and together with their frigates just offshore, launched a damaging barrage against the defences. Still the Celts held their ground defiantly as Americans now launched a the three-pronged attack with all their forces. <br />

The Celts had hurriedly set up defence lines around the colony but these were soon overwhelmed. American riflemen stormed into the streets. Pockets of Celtic resistance were quickly smashed, and the city fell. Most of the dead and injured were from the Celtic side.<br />

In Celtonia, the communist government declared a day of mourning. For the first time since the Hittite war centuries ago, Celtic national citizens had been brought under foreign rule. The overstretched Celtic forces had been caught off guard, shamefully allowing their comrade warriors and people to be overwhelmed and defeated…</div>

		<div>Hi again <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smilie" class="inlineimg" />, thanks for replies<br />
<br />
Sorry I cant plan in advance when ill add another bit, it all depends when i can write more and when i can go online. I intend to update a hell of a lot more than last time anyway (arg now ive said it)<br />
<br />
I do want to launch a celtic spaceship, to plant trees on a new world <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smilie" class="inlineimg" /> Although, it looks pretty certain the game turn limit will end before that and there be a points win. Id like to carry on after the 'end' tho. As far as i know, all it means is you dont see the score or replay when you quit, and all the a.i players carry on as normal?<br />
<br />
The 'other game' is Rise of Nations, since its got equivalents of most of the units that are in civ3, but running around and shooting at each other. I like playing around with screenshots, trying to make them like 'battelfield photos' etc... <br />
<br />
Ah about the aztec and portuguese land. Portugal is really the inca land now, because the inca land is celtic land.  Ive already played a bit further and given the Aztec land to somebody. Ill get to that with the story, eventually...<br />
<br />
thanks again for taking time to read this <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smilie" class="inlineimg" /><br />
<br />
trying a small update now...<br />
<br />
PS, i am wearing an anti-crucifiction helmet, which is also burning-at-stake proof. Just want to point that out.</div>

				<strong>The Battle of the Mountains</strong>

		<!-- message -->
		<div>The fall of a relatively insignificant colony became a major turning point in the war. It was still Celtic citizens, and Celtic homes, which had been lost to a foreign army. The impact was felt throughout Celtonia.<br />
<br />
The Celtic leadership made the most of the opportunity to build support for the continuing war. In the face of this direct insult to the Celtic forces, the high command ordered an immediate response to the Americans. The fact that Yacuida had been created on ‘stolen’ land in the first place, and that the Americans had valid claims to this land, was now forgotten. <br />
<br />
The Celtic government was resolved to rescue their outpost, and to achieve this, the Celts abandoned the idea of a troop landing in Germany against the Iroquois. Instead, there would be an even greater invasion force, landing on the coast of the east American peninsula, taking on the Americans head to head, and retaking Yacuida at all costs. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cparmarda2.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
An armada of ships began to assemble off the western shores of Celtonia. Modern troop transports and destroyers joined up with old veteran ironclads. Even older sailing frigates and galleons were called into service. The cruiser ‘Gallica’, flagship of and pride of the Celtic navy, prepared to lead the fleet. Simultaneously, hundreds of thousands of troops from Celtonia, Byzantium and Holland were converging on the coast.<br />
<br />
But these preparations would take many months to complete. Meanwhile, the chain of events had led to a change in the battle plan for the war with the Iroquois. There was now no chance of a separate troop landing in Germany. The scattered forces in Mexico, Scandinavia and northern France were given a new task by the high command: To gather together and fight all the way through Iroquois land themselves to liberate Leipzig. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/piin.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
For the army commanders this seemed to be dangerously ambitious. But with the promise of eventual reinforcements and heavy naval support form the most modern warships, it seemed just about possible. A two-pronged attack would be attempted, targeting the nearest and weakest Iroquai cities in the north and south, but ignoring the heavily protected capitol region of Salamanca. <br />
<br />
The northern attack would be a lower priority, designed to draw away Iroquois forces only. The main attack would be in the south, where the Celts would also take this opportunity to try and secure an unoccupied peninsular between St.Regis and the ocean. Celtic strategists had long desired to capture this land for use as a naval base.<br />
<br />
Forces began to transfer northwards from France and Scandinavia to the fortified mountain city of Cattaraugus as fast as they could. This vast troop movement was only made possible by the efforts of Celtic engineers, who had just finished repairing railway links built by France that had been damaged in the war. Railways now connected the whole western half of the other continent for the first time. <br />
<br />
The Iroquois forces had yet to react to the loss of Scandinavia, but it was known that they would soon launch some kind of retaliation. Sure enough, at the start of 933bc, the Iroquois sent a full-scale attack though the mountains with their own cavalry. The main assault forces of the two nations were about to meet head on in the highest, most mountainous and most difficult terrain in the world, the area the Celts called the Great American Mountains.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpgaMountains.jpg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
Celtic troops had already set up some fortified artillery positions on mountaintops along the border, but the Iroquois simply bypassed them, taking minimal damage from Celtic artillery fire. Now they were heading straight for Cattaraugus, where Celtic cavalry and artillery had been left without much support. The Iroquois lost Cattaraugus in ww1, but they still regarded it as their land. Together with the fact that most of the world’s sources of diamonds were in the nearby mountains, it is easy to see why the Iroquois wanted it back.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpmartil.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
The Iroquois advanced as quickly as they could, without any supporting infantry, trying to capture the area quickly before the Celts could respond. But their progress was slowed by the narrow passes and endless mountain slopes, and by continual attack from long-range Celtic artillery, hidden and fortified in the mountains beyond. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/iroqcharge.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for the Iroquois, the Celts had now controlled this area for several decades, and they knew the terrain well. Celtic troops had gained much experience in mountain fighting throughout the war with France, which they now put to good use. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/irqbomb.jpeg" border="0" alt="" />  <br />
(Iroquois cavalry advance under fire)<br />
<br />
Celtic artillery launched regular bombardments as the Iroquois progressed, eventually causing some serious damage to their cavalry divisions. As the Iroquois seemed to become weaker, the Celtic cavalry were able to mobilise and launch their own small-scale counter attacks. Conditions for the troops on both sides were terrible, and there was some absolute carnage as thousands of men and horses attacked each other among narrow mountain passes. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/irqb1.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
(Chaotic battle between Celtic and Iroquois raiders in a mountain village)<br />
<br />
In the following months, the Iroquois attack gradually began to break down. The reduced Iroquois force did reach Cattaraugus and also Toldeo to the North, and launched some ferocious attacks against these cities. But the Celts had now reinforced the whole area with everything they could mobilise. Further garrisons were stripped from Spain and Scandinavia, and sent straight to the front lines. There was to be no repeat of the defeats suffered against France. After some bitter fighting, most of the remaining Iroquois cavalry were eventually driven off and sent retreating beyond the mountains, under fire form artillery all the way.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/irfvci.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
Simultaneously to the battles near Cattaraugus, a fierce naval battle was fought off the Scandinavian coast. A fleet of Celtic ironclads caught up with a larger Iroquois fleet of frigates and galleons. The Celts could not risk an Iroquois troop landing in the south while most of their forces were engaged in the north – these ships had to be sunk or turned back.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/irship.jpeg" border="0" alt="" />  <br />
<br />
The Iroquois frigates, although obsolete compared to the latest Celtic ships, were still capable of carrying damaging weapons. In the exchange of cannon and shellfire, the ironclads took some heavy damage, some almost sunk, with many crew casualties. But once again, it was the weaker hulls of the Iroquois ships that came off worst. By the end of the battle, they were all burning or lying in pieces at the bottom of the ocean. There had already been some smaller naval battles off the Spanish coast, and there would be more after this, all following the same pattern as in all of the recent wars. Although sometimes too scattered to tackle a concentrated enemy fleet, Celtic ships continued to control much of the enemy coastlines.<br />
<br />
Back on dry land, the Iroquois had just lost a major part of their assault forces, and it seemed they would be unable to launch a serious attack again for some time. Despite being outnumbered by the Iroquois to begin with, the Celtic forces had remained largely intact. However, the Celtic attack plans had also been thoroughly wrecked. Instead of advancing, many important units now needed to be rested and reorganised. Celtic confidence was at least raised by having fought off some of the best of the Iroquois forces on land and at sea. Celtic weapons and tactics had proved themselves yet again. Perhaps their ambitious goals given to them by the high command could actually be reached in a few years…<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the lead ships of the Celtic ‘liberation armada’ had been sailing for days across the western ocean, and now had sighted the eastern coast of America…<br />

				<strong>Celts arrive in America... Dutch return to war...</strong>
			</div>
			<hr size="1" style="color:#a62a2a" />
			<!-- / icon and title -->
		
		
		<!-- message -->
		<div>At the end of 933bc, only a few months after signing a historic peace treaty with the Celts, the Dutch suddenly declared a renewed war with Celtonia. The American government insisted that, by the terms of their mutual defence pact, the Dutch now had to rejoin the war to assist the USA. The Dutch had no choice but to accept. The Celts had not anticipated this, as the Americans had only joined the war to assist the Dutch in the first place…<br />
<br />
This was either a serious oversight by the Celts, or a clever manipulation of the loosely defined diplomatic laws of the world by the Americans. Either way, Celtic troops that had been withdrawing north to the Celtonian heartland were now forced to turn back. Some units were even moving through Dutch territory at the time of the declaration, and were left vulnerable. The Dutch took advantage of the confusion as best they could, and renewed fighting began in the south of the home continent. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/dgbtwcp.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
It seemed that, for any hope of peace, both the Americans and the Dutch would need to be brought to negotiation at the same time. This seemed quite far away…<br />
<br />
All of this meant fewer troops were available for the fight on the other continent. Celtic High Command still remained fairly optimistic about the global situation. But for the ordinary people, the final, lingering hopes of a quick victory had now been crushed. The Celts prepared for more long years of war, a war that had already lasted over 22 years. There were frequent riots in some parts of the occupied territories amongst the non-celtic citizens, and even some disturbances in Celtonia itself. Uncertainty about the future seemed the main cause. Would the war ever end? <br />
<br />
<u>Yacuidan Coast, 932bc</u><br />
 Long months had passed since the Americans had conquered the Celtic colony, but at last, the Celts were returning. Naval intelligence had reported that one of the old coastal fortresses near the city had been left unguarded. Perhaps the Americans were not expecting the Celts to return so soon, in which case they misunderstood the determination of the Celtic command to retake their lost ground. <br />
<br />
From the destroyer at the head of the fleet, land had been sighted. The fortress could be clearly made out, and it showed no signs of life. The cruiser Celtonia signalled to the rest of the fleet that no American ships had been sighted in the area, and that troop landings could go ahead. Transport ships moved to the front of the fleet, and began to head towards the shore.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpnavalland.jpg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
For the troops in the landing ships there were a few anxious minutes. For those who could look out ahead, the walls of the coastal fortress were coming nearer and nearer. Tactics of amphibious warfare were still not very developed. None of the troops were trained or equipped to land under fire. If the Americans were garrisoned here, it would be a massacre... <br />
<br />
The ungainly landing ships ploughed into sand and shingle not far from the fortress walls and cut their engines. There was silence for a few moments. Many troops expected a hail of gunfire to start, but there was nothing. Cautiously, Celtic troops began to leap ashore and advance up the beaches towards the fortress. As the troops spread out to investigate the area, the fortress was confirmed to be completely unguarded. The Celts were soon inside and setting up their own garrison. <br />
<br />
Following behind the first wave of troops was ‘Great Leader of Armies’ Orgetorix, who was soon setting up a temporary headquarters behind the walls. The Celts now had a position that seemed immune to counter attack, only a few miles form Yacuida. But, frustratingly for Orgetorix, supply problems and difficulties in bringing in the last of the troops meant there would have to be several months of waiting and organising before the Celts could break out of their beachhead. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/thereturn.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
The Celtic invasion force numbered in total 19 divisions. 6 Infantry, 5 Artillery, 8 Cavalry. It was not the biggest single force the Celts had ever assembled. The Celtic commanders had wanted to send a lot more. The liberation of Germany had in ww1 had been accomplished by sending an initial force of 24 divisions, and even then it had taken years of hard fighting and reinforcements to succeed. But due to recent developments, and the increasing overstretching of all military forces, this present force was all that could be spared. <br />
<br />
Still, the Celtic troops were eager to fight, to liberate their people. And against a single city, there were good hopes of success, provided the Americans did not immediately counter attack with the full strength of their army…<br />
<br />
Local American forces had soon been alerted, and hurried telegrams were sent to Washington, where Comrade-President Lincoln and his generals considered their strategy. The Americans had already stormed the fortress once, would they attempt to do so again, to wipe out this new Celtic threat? <br />
<br />
<u>Western Coast of Celtonia, 932bc.</u><br />
Meanwhile the American eastern fleet, unaware of the Celtic invasion plan, had arrived off the shores of Celtonia, with its own mission to bombard the coast and harass merchant shipping. It was a bold move for the Americans, who knew all about the powerful new types of ship the Celts had developed. But their gamble paid off, as the Celts had sent just about everything from the western ocean to protect their invasion. <br />
<br />
The Celts did manage to scrape together some ships, including the famous cruiser Gallica, to double back and engage the Americans.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpfireship.jpeg" border="0" alt="" />  <br />
<br />
The Gallica, escorted by a small destroyer flotilla, managed to attack the rearguard of the large American fleet off the Celtonian coast. After a brief exchange of fire, the Gallica spotted what seemed to be a smouldering and crippled American vessel, a smaller and older kind of frigate, which had been left behind as the Americans continued on. The Gallica moved in, preparing to send across some small boats to try and board the vessel – perhaps something of intelligence value could be recovered before it sank? <br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cruzboom.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
Suddenly there was an enormous explosion. From a nearby destroyer, celtic sailors watched horrified as a huge cloud of smoke and spray obscured the entire outline of the Gallica and reached high into the sky. The ‘crippled’ American frigate had been packed full of powerful explosives, a carefully laid trap. Slowly, the huge cloud began to dissipate. Few of the onlookers expected the Gallica to still be afloat or even in one piece. But it gradually it became visible, belching flame and thick smoke, listing to one side, and with what seemed like a massive hole along one side of the ship.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/cpbuship.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /> <br />
<br />
The crew of the Gallica suffered many deaths and casualties. The ship remained operational, but only just. The crews were able to get it back to port, where it was eventually repaired and sent back into action for the last years of the war. <br />
<br />
If the ship had been sunk, the loss of the prised Celtic cruiser would have been a major propaganda boost for the Americans. Even the damaging of the vessel was widely publicised. It was a shock for the Celts, but their pride in their navy continued nonetheless. In the following years, new victories would be won on the seas, and eventually, even more powerful ships would enter service...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, however, the American fleet had just carried out a bold and successful operation off the Celtic coast, doing much to boost morale for the enemies of the Celts. The weakly-defended coastal trading city of Agedi received a terrifying bombardment before the Americans left, causing little actual damage, but it did at least bring the war back to the Celtic homeland and its citizens. <br />
<br />
Sadly for the Americans, the success of their fleet was short-lived. Sailing back west to their own shores, they encountered a stronger force of the Celtic fleet around Yacuida. This time the ‘Celtonia’, sister ship of the Gallica, and the only other cruiser in the Celtic navy, led the destruction of many American frigates in a fierce but one-sided battle, where the Celts were able to make full use of their advantages in ship technology. The western ocean was now more or less secured for the Celtonian navy.<br />
<br />
All throughout the rest of 932bc, there was little fighting on land. The beachhead near Yacuida remained quiet, and the troops along the Mexican/Iroquois border continued to rest and reorganise. There was some fighting in the south, as local forces continued to fight off the last remnants of the failed Iroquois attack on Cattaraugus, but no major battles. <br />
<br />
Around the world, Celtic forces were preparing for new campaigns, and a final showdown with all their enemies. World war two was nearing its conclusion, but there were still several long years of fighting before the end. Meanwhile, the defences of the vast occupied areas were becoming too stretched…</div>

Every pirate is a little bit crazy. You, though, are more than just a little bit. Like the rock flint, you're hard and sharp. But, also like flint, you're easily chipped, and sparky. Arr! <br />

Hey, thanks.<br />
<br />
Daft - I think you should overthrow Lincoln and establish Ralph Nader's puppet regime in America. <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Wink" class="inlineimg" /> You should also let trees vote there (OBVIOUS!). <img src="images/smilies/lol.gif" border="0" alt="" title="lol" class="inlineimg" /><br />
<br />
As a sidenote, &quot;comrade&quot;, despite popular beliefs, is NOT a title of a communist leader. Its more of an analog of &quot;mr&quot; and/or &quot;mrs&quot;.<br />
<br />
p.s. Congratulations on the new pace. Keep it up!</div>
