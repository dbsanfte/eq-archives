<br />
I have been working intensely for weeks with this my first Civ2 scenario, and I'm finished! Almost! I realize there's still much playtesting to be done, and adjustments of play balance, minor changes to the techs, units and grapx etc. So you'll have to wait a week or so before I upload it. But here is some info + screenshots just for an appetizer! ....SORRY! No screenshots. it seems they have to be html, and not more than 20k, so they would be so bad quality, that I prefer not uploading them!<br />
<br />
You'll have to do with a little back info.<br />
<br />
My original idea was to set the scene for the terror of the viking raids of the 8th through to the 11th century in western Europe. -To really make the &quot;feel&quot; right. The vikings should be savage and heathen. And militarily very aggressive. I came upon the idea of a new way of using nukes. &quot;Christianity vs the Terror from the North&quot; -or Diplomacy/Development vs. Nuclear Weapons/Raiding&quot;.<br />
<br />
The vikings should have powerful nuke ships, with a little alteration to the graphics and sounds. The path of murder and destruction would be the pollution that followed these attacks. Hunger, epidemics -the casualties of war. And the monks were there to sing their prayers for the dead. (&quot;clean up pollution&quot; -prayer &quot;p&quot;).<br />
<br />
The objective of the christian world would then be to send a stream of missionaries (agents) to convert nordic cities to the new faith (diplomats=missionaries).<br />
<br />
Well, so long so far. Setting up the scenario has been, and still is, a lot of work. But I have had to scrap many ideas along the way. First of all, it was possible to make the AI PRODUCE these new weapons (the viking nukeships), but it had a tendency to hid them in the cities, and not wage war with them, and they so were never used for anything but defense situations -not as the powerful weapons they were. Instead of aggressive nordic militarilism, I got a &quot;sit-tight on your nukes&quot; kind of situation.. where the norsemen and danes didn't quite expand as expected. <br />
<br />
So, after a little rethinking, I decided the development had to be a bit more subtle. It involved changing the tech tree (again...!), and the units, in a careful way.<br />
<br />
PLAYING OBJECTIVES<br />
BASIC PREMISE<br />
<br />
The Norsemen and Danes start off with very aggressive weaponry. They have powerful naval units, naval wonders, and Danelagen pays all their city improvements with cost of 1. Viking warriors are cheap, can attack from ships, and can raid (paradrop) within 6 squares of the encampment or city they are based in. Furthermore, they are costfree for tribal kingdoms (viking fundamentalisms).<br />
<br />
But there is a problem. City growth. The vikings cannot build abbeys and monasteries, manors and mills, which allows higher production and city growth. And as the viking empires grow (by military expansion, primarily), the more necessary it is to get the economy and the science up and running. -If they want to keep the war effort going -that is!<br />
<br />
It is vital for the norse and danes to carve out their empires as fast as possible, to keep the economy running (from tributes and new cities), and to hinder the growth of the continental nations as well as the anglosaxon/celtic (which will probably be the best playground for viking expansion in the first place -because the continent is too big a piece to swallow just yet).<br />
<br />
For the vikings to keep this empire, it is necessary at one point to switch to the new religion, Christianity, which involves all the good science/economic advances (as well as a lot of scrap ones). One needs to take considerate care at this point. Do it too early, and the empire falls apart, from the sudden military pressure from the outside. Do it too late, and the empire scrambles to dust from lack of economy within.<br />
<br />
The thing is, that all the vikings weapons technology seem to become obsolete with this new christian faith. Suddenly there is a thing called chivalry, and siege towers. And feudalism, manorialism, heresy, cathedrals, etc. etc. Suddenly their ships can't sail as far as they used to (wonders obsolete) -and finally their viking raiders become unavailable, and so does the terrifying dragon ships. Everything gets more expensive, and more difficult. Of course, the danes and the norsemen can steer free of these new techs, but for how long, before the<br />
christian nations eventually become too strong, economic-wise, scientifically -and militarily?<br />
<br />
The strategy for the continentals and anglosaxon/celts, must be to try and buy off the vikings, either by money, diplomacy, or militarily, or even better yet : scientifically. Give them all the christian techs they want, but make sure that their military empire don't get too strong in the long run.<br />
<br />
Strong alliances, palisades, watch towers, city walls, chivalry, diplomacy, and a good money bag ---all this is neccessary to make things go the way they did in the history books. -turning their weak feudal monarchies into strong medieval war machines!<br />
<br />
How does that sound for an opening?<br />
<br />
And of course, the Holy Roman Church must play a significant part. I noticed that the AI is very fond of Area3 units (air superiority) and it doesn't care if they are landbased and very weak. So it is an excellent way of getting the AI to produce a bunch of useless priests to be massacred by invaders!<br />
<br />
The map consists mainly of western europe and<br />
scandinavia, with som rogue tribes in the east played by barbarians. Also, there's some new terrain called villages, baronies and abbeys, with appropriate rich ressources, to simulate the relative wealth of medieval europe, in contrast to the north.<br />
<br />
TO BE RELEASED SHORTLY!<br />
Please give me a hint by mail (hardjoy@worldonline.dk), if you would like to take part in playtesting. I really would appreciate some serious comment on the play balance etc, from the outside!<br />
<br />

The scenario is done with the original CIV2, so there is no events, except for those generated by barbarians and the tech tree itself. You can play as the Danes, Norsemen, Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Franks, Frisians and the Germans (Holy Romans), and I hope the game will be playtested thoroughly enough, so as to make it enjoyable whoever you chose to be.<br />
<br />
Of course it will be a rather different experience from say the weak Celts to the rich Holy Romans/Germans, but I want to put in some quirks that make the smaller powers<br />
objectives seem more feasable.<br />

PS : Does any of you guys (you too, Circee) feel like participating in the playtesting? I have two playtesters now, but<br />
I think the more suggestions and testing reports, the better the revised edition will be.<br />
<br />
Send me a mail, and check out the betaversion if you like!<br />
-NB! Sorry, but there's no nuke ships in this temporary version. I removed them for playbalance sakes, but I think I'll put them back in. -also to make the western powers more challenging.<br />
<br />
I just have to make sure they don't tip everything in favor of the vikings. The AI can't figure out how to use them anyway, so they're only human player toys!<br />

<br />
The reason why the &quot;swedish&quot; vikings aren't in it, is because the scenario is focused primarly to the raids in England and Western Europe, and the Swedish tribes primarily raided in the East, though it might be difficult to differentiate in these terms.<br />
<br />
It's a little difficult really to talk about &quot;nations&quot; as such in those times, but to my knowledge there were a load of mostly danish and norwegian kings, who battled intensely for the supremacy of Scandinavia (mainly through control of the rich fields in England -Danegeld), but no swedish. The &quot;swedish&quot; tribes of Western Götland and along Götaelven subordinated themselves mainly to strong &quot;danish&quot; kings. (neither Denmark or Sweden was really nations as such). The scenario is really about the forging of those nations, and the coming of christianity and strong medieval monarchies. The &quot;swedish&quot; tribes are represented though, partly as &quot;norse&quot; cities, and as rogue cities (barbarians). There was a lot of fighting going on surely in these parts, but the danish kings ultimately proved to be stronger, mostly due to alliances with the christian Church. Lund and southern sweden are assigned to the Germans, due to the early bishoprics and abbeys in those parts.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I need all 7 tribes to maintain game balance on the continent (franks and germans fighting for the &quot;middle kingdom&quot; of Lothar (allied to the frisians), and Anglosaxons fighting the &quot;Celts&quot;), so there's no slots left! England is also difficult to differentiate, because it mainly consisted of  a number of small petty kingdoms, eventually united by King Alfred the Great of Wessex, and (after the invasions) the danish kings Sven Forkbeard and his son Canute the Great.<br />
<br />
But I might do another scenario about the Eastern Vikings and the Rus, something like &quot;The Viking Road to Byzantium&quot; -that could be very interesting!<br />

Mike, I'll give you a hint when it's finished in this topic. I just finished the second beta version, but I'm afraid there is still some bugs due to the constant revisions, and it's a huge work to find them and pick them out. But, in a couple of days.

<br />
For weeks now my social life has been deteriorating, but now...! I'm going to have a life again!<br />
<br />
I just uploaded the first public version of <br />
this my very first Civ2 Scenario &quot;Hammer of the North&quot; -simulating the Viking Raids of the 8th through to the 10th century. The scenario should be ready for download in the downloads section sometime soon, hopefully.<br />
<br />
It's a big one, for size, especially in regard to sound and the altered &quot;tiles.dll&quot;. It takes up a lot of space, but I think it is worth it, as it really enhances the overall impression of the scenario. But neither the sounds or the tiles.dll is necessary in a strict sense to play the scenario. But they DO make the scenario more of a different experience and enhances the atmosphere greatly!<br />
<br />
The scenario is written for the standard Civ2 Game, but is fully functional with the MGE <br />
version, and in fact, is a very entertaining multiplayer game.<br />
<br />
As this is the first version, there might still be need of minor fixes and I'm going to make a final update when I have got more play reports and bug reports etc. If you experience anything funny or strange, it might be intended, but also might be a bug.<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate any comments, criticisms, bug reports, play reports that anyone of you might have. You can post them at my email adress : hardjoy@worldonline.dk or in this forum. Thanks a lot!<br />

Morten, perhaps you can ask Thunderfall if he can post the DLL stuff in a separate zip (like usually the sounds) so that the player can download the &quot;normal&quot; scenario data without downloading the whole package? It would save a lot of time for us &quot;slow-modemers&quot; http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif, and one who likes the DLLs can still download them separately...<br />

I'll probably think twice next time I do a scenario.<br />

So be sure to go ahead and download it, and tell me what you think about it. I would really appreciate some feedback, as this is my first scenario attempt! Is it too hard? Too easy?

 Click here now to go to the downloads section! (http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2scenmed.shtml#hammer) <br />
<br />
Now, when you downloaded the scenario, I should probably note a few things here to avoid some confusion. There are two tiles.dll's. -the first (the smallest) in the folder &quot;dlls&quot; is for the Classic Civ2. The tiles.dll file in the &quot;dlls2&quot; folder is for the MGE version. Originally I expected Thunderfall to post these files separately, but they all come with the package. (-which is kind of okay -if you have both versions, you can play single player with classic Civ2 (best compatibility) -and multiplayer with the MGE version.)<br />
<br />
Thunderfall, if you can work this out at some time, I'd be very grateful. It doesn't seem fair to me, that people with another version of the game should spend time downloading the file for another version (even if their own version is included). -On the other hand -there is no hurry at all for my sake. Just do it if or when you get the time and opportunity for it. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
It's not a big problem. As a player, you just have to be aware that these folders (&quot;dlls&quot; folders) hold files for the different versions -and they should not just be zipped into your main Civ2 directory. They will not work unless they are placed with the right version of the game. -Of course you can do it this way if in doubt: copy'n paste in the first one, if that doesn't work : Go with the next.<br />
<br />
Otherwise always keep safe copies of your original files, and follow installation directions in the accompanying documentation.<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />

-Norse and Danes allies? ALLIES? -what a frightful idea! If those two get together, there'll be no hope whatsoever for christian Europe! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/redface.gif -Besides they did wage war against each other every so often. In fact most of the wars of the viking age originated as conflicts between scandinavian kings! -So the far better if the europeans tribe at least have some chance to make &quot;friends&quot; with one viking tribe against the other. And probably more realistic historically also.<br />
<br />
-In fact, I think they have a truce and peace to begin with, so they can make allies, but the chances for this are very slim, as one will probably sneak attack early in the game. A good thing for the challenge, I think. Are the norse giving you a hard time, eh?<br />
<br />
-How about the tech race? -Have you thought about conversion? -or are you still turning their offers down? -If you are too aggressive, you'll have a very hard time if you get around to the strong continental cities before 1177! -Of course, a few nuke ships might do the trick... Aachen, Hamburg, Worms, Kiev, Prague, Novgorod -Objectives, have you got them? -Or are the Norse getting those?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2001, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, finished my game. I have thrown everybody out, except for the Norsemen. You were right about the ally-stuff. <br />
I started with the Anglo-Saxons, I beat them very easily, and only one city was left: Wessex. But because I wasn't paying much attention to research, I couldn't beat the mighty defence in there, so I had to play for research. I had a fast peace with the Frisians, after I had taken Utrecht and Frisland. Later, they traded a lot of techs with me, which helped me very much. after that, I killed them in one turn. The Germans were very hard in the beginning. I could only take the cities nearest to Denmark. Later, I tried THE VIKING TACTIC (I think). In Denmark I let all cities build Royal Warships (or something) and a Hirdemen/Swordmen/Royal Swordmen. I loaded the swordmen (1) on the ship, took the ship to a city, destroyed the two/three units inside and conquered it with my unit on the ship. After doing this, I had all the important German and Frankish cities in my hands. I did the same to Dublin, the other cities were already Norse, but by doing that I killed the Celts as well. The last pieces of the Franks were very hard. I used a lot of Siege Towers to finally destroy them in 1174 A.D. I also conquered all the Rogue cities. The Norsemen only got a lot of cities in Scotland and Ireland, and just three in Europe (two of them in the Baltics).<br />
<br />
Final Score: 1320<br />
Rating: 79% <br />
Level: Prince<br />
Objectives: 32 of the 42<br />
Danish decisive Victory<br />
People: about 22.000.000<br />
<br />
I think it's a great scenario, and playing it is a lot of fun! The best is I think the fact that you can't conquer a city with land-troops only, at least not without heavy losses. You really need the ships.<br />
<br />
I think you should send the game to kobayashi and John Valdez, they're very good at pointing out things that should be improved and such. They're very good reviewers. <br />

<br />
I guess the Anglo-Saxons must have built up very heavily in Wessex -But I did put a few Royal Guards in there to make sure Wessex wouldn't fall right away. -I think the level of difficulty is alright for the Danes, don't you think?<br />
<br />
-I played a game with the Anglo-Saxons recently, also in Prince level, and I only managed to throw out the Danes after 1177, in the years 1200+ or so. -and still it was a decisive defeat, according to the victory conditions. I lost just sooooo many troops in that fight. If you can achieve at least a marginal defeat with the Anglo-Saxons, I bow in respect.<br />
<br />
It could've been done earlier, because the english have access to good defensive units, and can lay a siege quite effectively. -And just one bribed warship might make the difference. I found that an effective strategy for the english is to go for marketplaces and manors (to boost watch tower and military production), and -give a bunch of christian techs to the vikings- to pacify them a little. But I must've given them too many techs, as suddenly they had the same defences as myself.<br />
<br />
-I also took Danelagen back, which gave my economy a well-deserved boost (with the wonder there). Switching to tribal kingdom, and producing some viking hirdmen also helped with the siege strategy. -I think the anglo-saxons -or anyone else- should receive a great amount of money if conquering Danelagen (event). Also, without worry you can increase the amounts of money gained for conquering some of the other great cities, -mainly for the europeans. The Danes for one thing have good money for a long while, as long as they keep Danelagen. But Dorestad should pay off quite good (500-1000 gold? -is that too much?) -and Hamburg, Aachen and Worms, maybe?<br />
<br />
I'll get back to you soon with the events. I just need to get some thinking done, about how the game should be balanced with these in mind. Also, since the game runs with objective victory, no new wonders can be built.  I need to rethink the wonders a little bit, and I might assign some of those wonders to the minor powers, to make them a little stronger. I think the veteran crusaders is a very good idea, as they might give the europeans a final chance to get something done. Maybe they should also get some free siege equipment earlier on, to simulate reinforcements, mobilizing for war etc. (btw, the catapult is too weak in my opinion) -And a money boost if they can take vital cities. -Hedeby, Jelling and Kaupang should pay off good if they fall to the europeans.<br />

<br />
BTW, I found it extremely beneficial, playing as the Norse, to go straight for the danish throat. They are immensely strong if they first get going, but comparatively vulnerable at the outset.<br />
<br />
It is higly realistic that the Danes and Norse should be at war, and it's a problem if it doesn't occur (but it usually does). They have similar interests and are bound to go for the same cities sooner or later. I'm not sure it has to be in the events, though. I think perhaps we should concentrate on the createunits events (and perhaps also changeterrain! -more baronies with Feudalism tech!), to make it even harder for the vikings still towards the end of the viking age, so that the last period of the game will simulate vikings on the defence as christendom conquers the north, rather than it's a race for the Norse and Danes to get the last objectives. -The objective system will have to be rearranged anyway, so that the Anglo-Saxons and Celts will actually have a minor chance of winning the game, if they can stand (and perhaps gain) ground in Europe and on the isles. Its unrealistic that they need to conquer all the world in order to win. They should have at least a minor chance.<br />
<br />
But I need to give it a little more time. I've played the scenario a LOT lately, mostly multiplayer, and I think there are some really unrealistic (and OFF) aspects, that need adjustment. Like siege engines coming into the game FAR too late, and far too weakly. The basic framework works, I think, and it's a lot of fun (especially multiplayer), but I'd like to give it a little more historical depth, and your events-file adds into all that.<br />
<br />
If you come up with other ideas for the events, don't hesitate to let me know! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

But the event I'm talking about is rather small, and that way there is even gonna be a war (or a chance) if one of the players is the Danes or Norsemen. If the player is a veteran in civ, he'll get it done to get all the cities in Europe and a great part in Britain and Ireland as well without having to start a war.<br />
