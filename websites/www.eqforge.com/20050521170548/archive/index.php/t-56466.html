<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hereby propose this as an amendment to our constitution, to help rectify the situation posed by mid-term vacancies and to allow expulsion from an office under certain conditions of prolonged absence. Article D is replaced entirely by this more detailed amendment.  <br />
D.  Offices shall be filled by elections occurring at the end of <br />
each calendar month and shall be filled for one-month terms.<br />
      1.  In the event of a vacancy in an office, <br />
the deputy for that office shall assume the powers of that office for the<br />
 <br />
remainder of the term.  If there is no deputy or if the office was <br />
newly created and had no office-holder, a mid-term election shall <br />
be held if the vacancy occurs more than one week before the end of <br />
the term.  If the vacancy occurs less than one week before the <br />
end of the term, the office may remain vacant until the beginning <br />
of a new term.<br />
      2.  In the event that an office has no confirmed candidates <br />
when the elections begin, the new President shall appoint a <br />
citizen to hold that office at the beginning of the term.  <br />
The appointee shall have to be confirmed in a poll of the <br />
citizens before taking office.<br />
      3.  An officer may be removed by Presidential decree if he/she <br />
has not had any activity on the Democracy Game forum or has not <br />
responded to an important request within seven days and has not <br />
stated absence, or if an absence lasts for longer than two weeks.  <br />
The officer must have received at least 48 hours of notice by the <br />
President before being expelled.</div></div><hr />

I would like to respond to this but I dont know if it is ethical for a member of the Judiciary to get involved in making laws. <br />
<br />
Respond away.  You are first and foremost a citizen, i.e. a menber of the Congress, and as such are part of the lawmaking body.  Also, as JA, it is appropriate for you to comment on the constitutionality of the proposed amendment (i.e., would it conflict with any other articles of the constitution that are not being changed).<br />
<br />
Personlly, I am against this amendment.  I commend bootstoots on his initiative and I do agree that we should have some legislation in place regarding filling mid-term vacancies.  However, I do not think this legislation should be in the form of a constitutional amendment.  Article A of the constitution allows for lower forms of law and I think it would be best to clarify our prodecrues for filling mid-term vacancies through one of these lower forms of law.<br />
<br />
Before we can do this we must first decide what it takes to enact a lower form of law.  Here is the discussion thread on that topic. (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=52802)   There was also a poll on the suject. (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=1001804#post1001804)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that Donsig. I am very much in favour of fewer laws. Also I believe that the Constitution should be left alone unless there is an immediate need for change that cant be accomplished by other means. The Constitution exists only as the basis of our society. Fine tuning should be done by laws or by accepted precedent.<br />
<br />
Regarding D1.<br />
<br />
The results of the recent Reviews have set a clear precedent for this. <br />
<br />
In the instance of the ruling on the VP, it was declared that it was constitutional for offices to be filled by those who received the next higest number of votes.<br />
<br />
Also it was viewed as mandatory to hold elections for all offices listed by the Constitution. Offices created mid term should be filled in this way. This was done successfully for the governorships of Aventine and Esquiline.<br />
<br />
Therefore I believe precedent makes the need for this ammendment unneccessary<br />
<br />
Regarding D2.<br />
<br />
I dont believe that this will be a problem and if it is, it is not critical enough to be a constitutional ammendment. <br />
<br />
Regarding D3.<br />
<br />
I completely agree with this idea. I am sure people will want to refine the mechanics of this but it is, in essence, a very good idea<br />
<br />
I hope you don't think that I have been too harsh<br />
Regards :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Donsig, if you or someone else proposes a new CoL that included this, I would certainly approve of it.  However, I doubt that a CoL will be passed without Shaitan.  Therefore, I believe that a constitutional amendment will be necessary.  Peri, regarding D1, I see your point and agree that that is probably not necessary.  On D2, I think we do need this amendment to clarify the issue of unfilled offices.  From around term 5 to term 8 last demogame, offices would regularly go unfilled during elections, and the president would appoint people to the unfilled positions.  They would be approved by the Council (all department leaders) which doesn't seem to exist in the new demogame, therefore I proposed a citizen poll in amendment.  Under the DG3 precident, it seems that we'd have a second nomination/election for the same office within a few days and there may well be no office takers again, forcing it into a third cycle, and so on, all within a few days.  Therefore, we need to have a constitutional amendment to define what occurs when no person accepts nomination for a position during nominations, and presidential appointments seem to be the best way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I appreciate what you are saying. However I still think that people should volunteer for office rather than jave it forced on them. If someone is prepared to accept the appointment then that person should be prepared to stand before the people in a proper election.</div></div><hr />

Whenever vacancies occur, they should be filled, and quickly.  A Presidential appointment is the best way for this to occur.  But that's another discussion...<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I like the proposed amendment, and would prefer to see it in the constitution itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We do not need to propose a comprehensive Code of Laws in order to get one law passed.  If we are ever to have a code of laws it can be built up from scratch as the need arises.<br />
<br />
If you think the only way to accomplish your goal is to pass aconsitutional amendment then I wish you luck in your quest.  I do suggest that you take a look at what it takes to change the constitution...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not see how turn based terms and elections would be a nightmare.  Letting our leaders know exactly how many game turns they are alotted would allow our leaders to bring the focus of this game back to the forums while still accomodating turn chats.  It is distressing to hear our President knock down an idea that he has obviously not even thought much about.<br />
<br />
Even if we set aside the supposed *folly* our President speaks of, there is still no reason to change article D of our constitution.  There is no reason for our President to make or take any heat to lessen the troubles of future Presidents.  Whether we hold special elections or have an appointment / confirmation process to fill vacant offices mid-term the process will take time and the department in question will remain leaderless and the President will have to step in and make needed decisions.<br />
<br />
Since the replacement process takes time either way there is no benefit to our citizens in having them relinquish their right to chose their government officials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Donsig, they might well be a nightmare if a president decided that he/she wants to play one turn per t/c so that he/she stays in office for a long time.  They would probably not be a nightmare, but I would not want a power hungry President trying to stay in power for as long as possible.</div></div><hr />

I could not agree more with this sentiment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Donsig would you be kind enough to outline the arguments for turn based terms. I am not familiar with this concept and would like to know what has been said on the matter.<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I'd like to suggest is that replacing out-of-communication leaders after a set number of days leaves us open to the chance that the leader is suffering something outside their control.  Take the situation with AlmightyJosh -- his internet connection was severed by city maintenance, and it took several days to get back online.  In such instances, the deputy should temporarily take the office -- it should not be considered permanent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are exactly right d8575.  That is in fact the whole point behind having deputies.  They are there to step in and act for the absent leader but they should not officially become the leader unless the original leader formally resigned or is impeached.  We should not be so quick to try to replace leaders who are absent for short periods.<br />
<br />
As for turn based terms and elections, the idea is to base terms on a fixed number of Civ 3 game turns.  For example a term could be 60 game turns.  There is a calculator that allows one to determine what game year it will be x number of turns from any other game year.  The calculator allows a schedule to be constructed where in the beginning and ending years of  each term are given as well as the game year at which elections should be held.<br />
<br />
The reason I think turn based terms are superior to calender based terms is that if the president knows he or she has 60 turns to play he or she will be more likely to stop a chat if there is something important to discuss.  Stopping the caht and allowing the citizens to make decisions in the forums is much better than a spot vote in the chat.  I think that president's (especially near the end of the month) are reluctant to stop chat's since they lose their ability to play (and hence their power) at the end of the month.<br />
<br />
I doubt we'd ever have a president who would play one turn at a time just to prolong time in office.  The power of the presidency lies in the number of turns he or she can play and not the mere length of time in office.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plexus</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is unneeded overregulation, sorry Boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cpt Kaos</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we should leave it be for now. If at a later date we need an amendment, then we can do it. The old adage if it isn't broke, then don't fix it does apply here. Also I don't want to open the to over regulation. Let the constitution be a living document and let it work through these problems. If it can't then we help it evolve so that it can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An amendment is certainly needed.

<br />
If we are worried about presidents(or DPs) forging on in the chat when there are important matters to discuss, I think that should be remembered and handled in the election process.  In a perfect world, that person just does not get to be president anymore.<br />
<br />
I believe this very strongly and therefore have not had a turnchat go to 10 turns once in this term.  While that may look like a blemish on my record on the surface, the truth is that I stopped the chat every time I felt there was something that needed discussion.   So it can be done, although I know there were issues to the contrary in the past.<br />
<br />
My main reason for not wanting turn-based elections is that I believe it will alienate newcomers from the game.  The Democracy Game is duanting enough to new citizens, and would be more problematic if we did not follow a static schedule.  Also, now that I am the new mod in town, I am going to talk with eyrei about efforts to promote the DemoGame and I think it would be easier to facilitate this with a set schedule.  But now I've said too much...  :D<br />
<br />
As far as Article D goes, I am starting to agree that it should stay as-is, as long as we better define it in the Code of Laws.  How we do that will take some more discussion, however.<br />
<br />
My apologies if my previous comments seemed flippant, donsig, but I guess they were.  Please substitute the above for my previous error in judgment.  :)</div></div><hr />
