<br />
The history of our family goes back to the beginnings of our nation. The Current family members as well as their relations to other families of our glorious nation is shown later in this thread.<br />
<br />
Our family ownings are claimed to be the province of Hellenatica. A Map of those claims will also be shown in this thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
Definition of Family Membership<br />
The Family Membership for the Lifespanian Royal line in strictly limited.<br />
A lifespanian Family member marrying a non-Lifespanian will keep his/her family name as second middle-name, but wont give it to the husband/woman as middlename.<br />
The children will be reviewed by the existing Family members, and some of them, normally the firstborn of each generation, will be &quot;adopted&quot; into the family and will hold &quot;Lifespanius&quot; as second middle name from then on.<br />
An example for this is Bellona Lifespania and her husband Caeser Jade.<br />
Duitia Lifespania Bellona married Flavinius Jadius Caeser in 1025BC, and as such Bellona was from then on called &quot;Duitia Jadius Lifespanius Bellona&quot;.<br />
Of her first generation of children, only Rubinia was adopted into the Lifespanian Family (as firstborn child). Avita as second born was not adopted.<br />
As such, Rubinia's name was Caesaria Jadius Lifespanius Rubinia and Avita's name was Caesaria Jadius Avita.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all our land claims have been secured by contracts with the despots of fanatica and other nations. we will not allow any person to annex any land claimed by us.<br />
<br />
the ownings are owned by the lifespanian family but may be run by different persons later on as they grow larger. we also may give usage rights out to other persons later. just aks in here from time to time for details.<br />
<br />
the area which is claimed or owned by the lifespanian family is called HELENATICA after the founding mother of the family line.<br />
<br />
she was the first person to be allowed to own land, and thus she started the family ownings which were over the time extended to the size they have now.<br />

<br />
Ah, hello Bellona. Beautiful day, isnt it? I've just realised something. My son Neo is technically a relative of yours. His father was Draculus Roberts Lifespanius. His mother was Mellita Lifespanius, who as we know is the daugther of Brefius, the father of Diutius. Now, correct me if im wrong, but isnt Diutius your grandfather? So if your grandfather is my sons greatgrandfather, making YOU his great aunt... Aint that a hoot?<br />
<br />
(I think I got the math right there)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 26, 2003, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure dear Baroness, but the line of Lifespanius was royal due to their relation to Helena. As Diutius left her with the children alone, she is now technically the founderess of the line. As such you could be noted as further relative, but not part of the line itself ;-)<br />
As you see, also only one of the children of Bellona and Caesar is noted. This is because of each Childhood, only the firstborn will be adopted into the Lifespanian Line. Also the husbands, as you will surely see, wont be adoptd into the line... they temporarily get the name, but wont inherit it to their children which dont belong to the line.<br />
<br />
This ensures that the lifespanian family line is of clean blood and relation, and that no influence from other families, except the minimim necessary for reproduction, is coming into our family traits.</div></div><hr />

But before I do, I have a letter to deliver to you from the DiSaaMuel's. Since they own my village, I'm kind of their messenger.\<br />
The message reads: <br />
 Dear Bellona.<br />
Hey, Its Fortuna. Listen, I hear you're giving out land. Well, I have an idea. Many of our ehem... *neighbors* have started making these drawings of their land called Maps. Smith tells me all about them. They seem really... odd. Well, anyway, as you know, since I do your income and your production, I was thinking. Why dont we start one of these Map thingiees? Can I grab some Penguinadua land and start a map shoppe? <br />
Thanks, <br />
Fortuna <br />
Well, anyway. Here is what I preach of. In the heavens, there one deity with two personalities, the Red Deity and the Blue Deity. Both are both good and evil. All humans must choose between the two of those. Many side with the Blue Deity and believe in whatever they want. But there are those among us who side with the Red Deity. We can achieve a sort of inner peace, controling the world around us. We are the Chosen People. However, we are under constant moral attack by those who choose the Blue Diety and believe themselves to be all powerful. They have become corrupt by the evil web of green decit that the Blue Deity weaves on .05% of his followers. They are agents of him and they do any and all evils he requests. Our mission is to stop those who have become corrupt. But, however, we will not be able to do so until our Savior, The One, arrives. He is prophesised by our Oracle. This is our mission, our goal. We must wait the arrival of our savior, The One. Then all the world and all Fanatica shall be saved.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Dearest Morpheus, please tell Fortuna that i gave her some more land.&quot;<br />

&quot;Please make it heard in the land of helenatica and disaamuel that we will give out lands both to atrousia and disaamuel (OOC: post is here (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=1014055#post1014055)). we will also give back some land to fanatica itself to clean up our borders.

The DiSaaMuels will be very pleased of this new land. They plan on begining a small, productive province from here.<br />
Now, as for the ability to know, unfortunatly there is no way but one. Neoism. The new order of things. It is the name of the religion I preach. One must not accept that they will be controled. The foundation of this diety can be broken. He is not all powerful, as one may believe. He has the ability to be stoped and contorted to what we believe is needed. To succesfully begin training, one first must renounce all that is associated with the Blue Deity. These things are:<br />
1) Evil towards self<br />
2) Evil towards others<br />
3) Acceptance that the Deities control our entire lives.<br />
<br />
These are the fundemental principiles. One must do this to renounce the Blue Diety and take up the Red One. But be warned, the acceptance of Red Deity is not an easy one. There are those that love the Blue so much, they will give their lives to protect it.</div></div><hr />

Dearest Scrobius, it is not possible at the moment to grant land of helenatica for other citizens, as we need the land to support our glorious army. But of course you will be considered as applicant for the deputy leader of troops.<br />
The only things which are missing in your application is you character's stats or a link to the character post and the charisma rating. Also your character need to live in Gorina.<br />

to simplify the ruling and controll of our troops, the administration of helenatica thinks about splitting the 1st helenatican regiment into 2 divisions each controlled by a leader.<br />
the overal controll will then be given to a regiment general.<br />
so we maybe get more helenatican people into a job ;-)<br />

EDIT:<br />
changed into 2 divisions...<br />
<br />
split will be:<br />
<br />
2 divisions with 6 legions each. each division controlled by a divisional commander<br />

the 2 divisions combine into the 1st helenatican regiment<br />
this will be controlled by a general. he will also have direct controll over 3 spearmen to defend the command centre in the field.</div></div><hr />

Character Name: Scrobius Pantonius<br />
<br />
Character Gender: Male<br />
<br />
Character Status: Alive <br />
<br />
Character Health: Good <br />
<br />
Character Age: 26<br />
<br />
Caste: Common<br />
<br />
Agility - 12<br />
Discipline - 12<br />
Charisma - 13<br />
Constitution - 17<br />
Intelligence - 11<br />
<br />
Belligerent, Intellectual, Mercantile<br />
<br />
Scrobius is a man who is looking for a better life. He grew up as a woodsman with his father, who also taught him to fight. He has now entered the city.<br />
<br />
Clearly Scrobius doesn't have a 15 charisma but you didn't say he needed it for deputy and its only two points. Also, with the war happening I did not expect to be granted the land for training troops but I apreciate that you recognized the request.<br />
<br />
Also, I did not need to come off egotistical, though I kind of like it now. I have posted in the previus and thread and then here when I was informed that it was closed. In both cases I have made specific requests but also citizenship. &quot;If it is not granted please grant me citizneship anyway and perhaps a small job under you in the city.&quot; Yet none seemed to go recognized.<br />
<br />
Is it TAming of the Shrew?<br />
<br />
And now way IC:<br />
<br />
Scrobius: Well, I certainly have been living in Gorina since arriving in Gorina. I hope this is a sign that you are accepting my citizenship.<br />
<br />
I deeply appologize if I have come off rash and disrespectful. I came to this land hoping to help raise up some troops and lead them in your name. Since then we have become involved in a war with the horid Egypt and I grow eager to go into battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
II Corps: lt. General Arlena Gorinia<br />
II.1 armored division: lt. General Arlena Gorinia<br />
II.2 armored division: mj. General Scrobius Pantonius<br />
<br />
lt. General Arlena and mj. General Scrobius, please immediately take over command of your units.<br />
<br />
lt. General Arlena, please report with the complete II Corps immediately to the despot. the II corps is &quot;lent&quot; to the fanatican army for the war against egypt. so report at the despot thread to receive commands and to meet the general under which the II Corps will serve.<br />
you will be allowed to post unit order for your corps in the conflict thread.<br />
<br />
ooc:<br />
note that the troops of helenatica are sworn into the royal family and the province, noone else. if they have an interest conflict between their orders and the lifespanian royal line, they will decide to follow the royals :-)<br />
<br />
both of yours job is the roleplay. so go to the despot thread and the war-thread and roleplay ;-) have fun!<br />
<br />
as soon as possible i may increase the number of legions under your command, too. i decided to give arlena the command over the corps as well as the division due to lack of applicants. i may introduce a 3rd division later on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the roleplay of all things happening in the field should take place in the HMC (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=55021) thread. Remember the only person receiving direct commands from the despot is the lt. general gorinia. She then gives her command to the divisions.<br />
<br />
The roleplay should contain storylines about the field camps of the soldiers, some side stories possible and such things ;-)<br />
<br />
You will have free controll of the II corps to roleplay this thing, but i expect the roleplay to be superb and unmet in the history of rpg's!<br />
<br />
If we get some soldiers-caracters to join the army, this experience would even be better... and always remember to write it like a good book ;-) not too fast... span the storylines over multiple days...<br />

<br />
the commander of our mobile corps, lt. general Arlena Gorinia, has beed found assassinated in her tent at the frontline camp of the corps.<br />

due to the lack of command resulting from this cowardly attack on our leadership, Lieutenant general Maximus Veen and Major general Julius Aqaurius were promoted, where Maximus Veen is now the new commander of the corps.<br />
<br />
The dead body of Lieutenant general Arlena Gorinia will be transferred to Gorina tomorrow morning. She will be layed out at the palace mousoleum before she will be burried with full military ceremonies in the royal graveyard at mt. gorina.<br />

Nevertheless, if my children have grown up one of them will inherit everything. Preferrably if there is a girl, she will inherit all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lucentio, the current ruler of helenatica, will be on a journey the next days. Neo, his father, will be given administrative controll over helenatica. Maxius will be given controll over the HMC.<br />
<br />
HERE ARE THE RULES FOR THEM TO OBEY:<br />
<br />
1) no land of helenatica is given away to anybody except for usage of the resources. the ownership must stay with the lifespanian family. also, those contracts must be temporary until lucentio returns.<br />
<br />
2) the defensive troops of helenatica must not leave the province. if any attack or rebellion occurs inside helenatica, ALL existing helenatican troops immediately go back to their homeland to defend it.<br />
<br />
3) any unit killed will be replaced with the helenatican shields. a list of the approoved structure of the army is in the first posts of this thread.<br />
<br />
4) the HMC (part of the army) is completely controlled by lt General Maxius Veen. He can raise people and restructure the army as he wishes, but he can only raise units to replace approoved ones.<br />
<br />
5) as soon as lucentio returns all goes back to him to controll.<br />
<br />
6) neo or his decessors can use any leftover shield, food or commerce to do what he likes in helenatica. even build things. or feed people. or give it away to others.<br />
<br />
OOC:<br />
<br />
7) stuck as a mac will have controll over any of my units for storytelling and roleplay until i come back<br />
<br />
8) civgeneral will controll the hmc during my absence<br />
<br />
9) my absence will be from now until the 25th or 26th<br />
<br />
that should be enough now :-)</div></div><hr />
