<br />
Please look at the save and share your insights on our war against Egypt.  They now have something of value to offer us --- Monarchy, Construction and three new contacts!<br />
<br />
However, is this enough to sue for peace?  We can get all three contacts plus one of the techs.  If we get Monarchy, we can trade it to one of the civs that has Construction.<br />
<br />
Also, our upgrade gold is fading fast.  We have 6-8 legions headed for the frontlines to assist our wounded soldiers, but is that enough to reach the objective we discussed before today's chat(taking Thebes and Heliopolis)?<br />
<br />
Please lend your thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems clear that we are hurting Cleo. The terms for peace have improved since we took Memphis. since we still have a sizeable force (when they are all healed), perhaps we should think about just one more city. If we sustain heavy casualties like losing 4 more legions then get the above terms but if we can take another city we might get someying even better from Cleo.<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, Peri.  My main concern is our lack of upgrade cash.  After that comes the opportunity to get 3 new contacts and a new government form(and more trade bait) without spending a dime, although admittedly I haven't looked into the prospects of purchasing these contacts with other civs.  My guess is that the cost would be pretty high.  Plus, I don't know what more we can expect Cleo to give, except maybe slightly more gold.<br />
<br />
Another thing that I found quite alarming was the FA screen.  All nations but Azteca are annoyed with us.   This would probably be rectified a show of mercy to Egypt.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I would rather hold off on ths war and wait until we can attack with a unit that has a bit more attack power(Knights, of course).  I feel that our conquests to this point fall a bit short of justifying our casualties on the field(which was more like 8-10 last turnchat, including 4 Elites), not to mention the treasury lost to maintain our upgrades.  <br />
<br />
So, that's my case.  We have a solid land base from which to build, so I propose that we start maximizing what we have.  I truly believe that that is a much faster way of becoming a world power than taking away an extra city or two from Egypt.<br />
<br />
Please let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

The President's peace plan is tempting but I'd like some idea of the chances of gettig a great leader if we continue to fight.  If all our elite units are gone and we plan to resume the war with Egypt at a later date I would be inclined to support the President's peace initiative.  If we have elite units on the front lines and want this to be our final war then we should press on till we get a leader.</div></div><hr />

FA likes the idea of getting the Contacts now. Other nations will charge us for them, but Cleo will give it away for stopping.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to this flip calculator (http://forums.civfanatics.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=983054) Memphis has a 5,50% chance to flip and 43,20 % chance to flip within 10 turns. We require 16 troops to prevent it from flipping. <br />
<br />
Those are numbers that indicate that we have to do something about it. Capture Thebes, starve the city, garrison troops, build up culture in the city; anything.<br />
<br />
I think stopping now will lead to the flip of Memphis. Was that worth all the Legions who sacrificed their lives for our Nation ? <br />
<br />
The short term gains of the techs and the contacts are not worth it. We can buy them from other Civs. I think we should go for Thebes and then get a profitable peace. We might get Heliopolis as well in the peace talks. <br />
<br />
The longer we wait and capture more Egyptian cities and land the more they have to offer for peace and the short delay in tech and contact will be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great, now we even have Rik Meleet proposing continued war.  :lol:<br />
<br />
FYI, the units on the front line are wrecked.  There is one more Elite unit(at 2/5 now) in the field, and healthy units are another 5-7 turns away<br />
<br />
It's seems are only valid reasons presented for staying in this war have been to make right the wrongs of the past.<br />
<br />
- Well, I'm not giving up this small amount of gold so we may as well go to war.<br />
<br />
- Well, we are about to be attacked so we might as well start our Golden Age.<br />
<br />
- well, we already wasted our Golden Age now so we might as well fight on.<br />
<br />
- well, we lost alot of Legions fighting, so we should press on in their honor.<br />
<br />
The previous administration got us into the first predicament, I admittedly talked us into the second, and then everybody bought into the third.  Do we want to keep making the same mistakes?  Let's end this thing, so we don't have to do the fourth.  If we buy into that, I can't wait to see the fifth.<br />
<br />
I hope that now everyone can see why I thought this war was such a bad idea and why we should get out now while we can.  What is our next excuse to stay in this war going to be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that the war was an incredibly bad idea. I have no sensible arguments against making peace. It is just the warmonger in me that says 'just one more city'. We have at least 15 legions in the fiels that will be at full strength in a few turns. Their blood will buy us at least a bit more territory before we allow Cleo to give us the goods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But Peri, using Rik's &quot;flip stats&quot;, won't we be putting our efforts into taking another city we could possibly lose to a culture flip?<br />
<br />
Let's cut our losses and put the contacts and tech spiral we can get from Cleo to good use right away.  We can use those Legions to either defend Memphis(risky), or start some kind of Maginot Line south of Memphis.</div></div><hr />

If we take the capital they memphis wont flip that very quicly... when we are seeing that our legions cant go on fighting anymore well ask for peace. by then he will be beaten or so beat up that hell give us anything we ask for :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mr President.<br />
<br />
I am not viewed upon as a &quot;warmonger&quot;. In fact I don't even think I am a warmonger. If even I want to continue the war that must mean something. I will explain my reasons for this apparent 'change-of-mind', which is of course is a paradox. <br />
<br />
We have spend a lot in this war. Our whole civilization is supporting the war-effort (cities I mean, not citizens). I don't want to loose the prices we have been fighting for so hard and long (or too hard and too long). Memphis will flip, as it is too near to Thebes. By taking Thebes it will reduce the flip considerably. <br />
<br />
Egypt now has something to offer. But it won't offer all that we want; 3 comms + monarchy + construction + gold. If we press on and hurt them more I expect they will offer all. If we make peace now we'll be behind or have to pay deerly to get back in line. If we fight on it will be given to us on a dinner-plate. <br />
<br />
Let me quote you and reprhase the last point and add some more:<br />
- Well, I'm not giving up this small amount of gold so we may as well go to war.<br />
- Well, we are about to be attacked so we might as well start our Golden Age.<br />
- well, we already wasted our Golden Age now so we might as well fight on.- well, the war has hurt us as well so stop, count our losses and forego the chance we'll get a real price.<br />
-well, we are jumping from one priority to the next without focussing on 1 goal, so let's continue the goal-less-jumping. <br />
<br />
I was against the war when it started, I was against the first continuation of the war, I was against the second continuation of the war (the one where was decided we'd take Memphis and Thebes and Heliopolis) and I am still against the war; but I am more against signing a peace when we don't do what was agreed upon. At least charge at Thebes and then see what they want to offer now. Better still take or raze Thebes, get Heliopolis in a peace-deal (together with the techs and the contacts) or if they aren't prepared to give it, take Heliopolis as well. <br />
<br />
Remember the The Egyptian war goals (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=54957) Poll? It's conclusion was and still is: &quot;Take Cleo's cities till we can get a profitable peace (this includes the possibility of getting Pyramids, along with Negotiations)&quot;. The peace that is proposed now is an UNprofitable peace. So we have to continue, as much as I don't like war it is the choice of the people and promissed by the President; the former and the current.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you figure that my proposal is unprofitable peace, Rik?<br />
<br />
Profitable peace is not always measured by the amount of land we take.  I met each civ leader on our continent and found that making peace with Egypt will allow us to acquire a tech that no one will even give us right now, plus contacts that are worth roughly 80-85 gold a piece.<br />
<br />
Also, the Aztecs don't have Monarchy so we can trade that to them for Construction.  Why spend more of our blood in the hopes of adding Construction to a deal when we can get it by other means?  Why wait to introduce ourselves to a good part of the Western Hemisphere(and get their maps) just because of an outdated poll?  Why squander a chance to get something from the Aztecs for Monarchy before someone else beats us to it?  You once said(and I'm paraphrasing) that we should aspire to change our strategies to meet the needs of changing circumstances.  Why change that philosophy now?<br />
<br />
I must admit that I somewhat see your point about profitable peace.  If we are to take what Egypt is offering against what we have invested in this war, it would most likely not turn a profit in the ledger books.  But pursuing the war means continuing the investment, so the numbers will never add up to our liking.  I tried to make this as clear as possible when we had a chance to keep El Amarna, and you were one of the few who came to the same conclusion.  <br />
<br />
Finally, I resent the implication that I have been leading an administration of &quot;goal-less jumping.&quot;  I believe my stance has been pretty consistent since we had a chance to take El Amarna.  Taking that deal then would have been profitable peace as we had no figures in the loss column at that time.  I couldn't stress that enough.  The people disagreed, and here we are.<br />
<br />
Let's end this foolish war and become the nation we can be with what we have, which is more than enough for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds like the primary idea behind continuing on to Thebes is that taking Egypt's capitol would reduce the chance of Memphis flipping back.  Unfortunately this is not the case, because Egypt's new capitol will be Giza, which is just as close to Memphis as Thebes is.  The only advantage to be gained there is that Thebes has over 100 culture and Giza has less than 100 (it has only expanded once).<br />
<br />
Also note Memphis is currently 100% resistors.  If we put MP there to quell resistance and it flips, we lose the units.  If we get peace then resistance will fade quicker, which lowers the flip risk.<br />
<br />
Building another all-Roman town near Memphis, dogpiling it with Roman workers, and building up culture might decrease the chance of a flip, but moving Egypt's capitol one tile further away is not likely to help much.<br />
<br />
If we can find some way of keeping a city in the Memphis area, we can deny Horses from Egypt, which will give us an advantage once Chivalry is researched.<br />
<br />
Here's an alternative plan.  How about we pillage the road between Thebes and the horses (inside Egyptian territory) before getting peace.  This way, if Memphis flips back they don't get the horses right away and we have a momentary advantage.  If we get to knights before it gets connected, then we'll be closer to being ready to finish Cleo off.<br />
<br />
Lest you think this last thought (finishing off Cleo later) is too bloodthirsty, there has been quite a lot of discussion in the GOTM forum lately about how one can enhance a spaceship victory by expanding to close the domination limit first.  We'll have to take out one or more neighbors before going peaceful to make sure someone doesn't beat us in the race.<br />
<br />
In the meantime after peace is obtained run down the population of Memphis by building workers and grow it back as Romans, or maybe even better yet pop rush a library to get culture as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cross-posted from the &quot;Contacts!&quot; thread, here is an update on the trade possibilities.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify the amounts being discussed:<br />
<br />
I checked it again, Cleo will give Monarchy, all 3 contacts, and all her gold (92) for peace.<br />
<br />
Monty should give Construction + 40-50 gold for Monarchy, according to the tech calculator. He has somewhere in the 30's for available gold, forgot to write that exact number down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, d.  I checked it again too and can't believe I missed that......  <br />
<br />
The extra 92 gold sells this proposal even more, and we can get Construction from the Aztecs for Monarchy.  Plus we can open up trade opportunities with our three new friends.</div></div><hr />

I dont think we should go into another war after this untill late ancient early middle... We need to build some now and make our citys better... <br />
<br />
I usualy tend to plan ahead for the future :). But jumping back to the present. We should start to get our maps together and start ploting locations on where our settlers should settle. We should also develope our infrastructure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deep_Thought76</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is about my first post here, but I'll add my 2¢.<br />
<br />
If the main argument for continued war is that Memphis may flip back to Egypt, why don't we just write the city off?  There doesn't really seem to be an easy way to keep it from happening.  We can try to fill it w. units, or take nearby cities, but I get the impression we don't have the manpower right now to wipe out all of Egypt (is this correct?).  Unless we do that, there's always a flip risk.<br />
So, I agree with what's already been said: we should take the deal, pull back, and build cities, improvements, culture, etc., reducing the risk that way.  And if they do secede, big deal..  We can always conquer them again later.  The difference of one city is outwieghed by what we can gain from the peace terms, and switching away from building only legions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cpt Kaos</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the idea of peaceful expansion for the moment.  We sorely need to expand west and build up our infrastruture. Also working to build up our culture points while strengthening our armies is a good way to lie low until we are ready to rise up again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do partially agree with the stopping of the war.
