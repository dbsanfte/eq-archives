<br />
It almost appears that we have another chokehold by the capital (I hope it is). A future warrior could explore that area. I also had to make room for a coastal city, as we picked continents I believe. The blue tiles are the future city sites.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
There's other worker priorities that I'd like to see, and those include:<br />
<br />
- More workers in the near future<br />
- Road and mine the tile 1 NE of Gorina.<br />
- Mine the other wines by Noshuret<br />
- Build a road to possible city #3 (S of Noshuret - where the warrior is standing)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one south of the capital looks to be a gold producer. Also, I'd need to explore more of the west to see that terrain. BTW, Shai appointed me as the DP for the next turn chat, so I know where we should explore. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, the one southwest of Gorina looks like it could have some production potential, but if we are going for a settler factory or just a high production city I would say south of Noshuret. With the worker we have right now, I would say imnprove the terrian NE of Gorina, then if it is no longer needed near Gorina, have it go work on the Wines at Noshuret. By that time it should be time for our next settler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's an updated one. Cattlefish could be a worker factory for us with that cattle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good work CT. :goodjob:<br />
<br />
Would it be possible for Gold Rush to be moved Southwest one tile so it doesn't overlap with Gorina?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to agree with naervod. Gold Rush is well beyond the optimum curruption/waste perimeter of Noshuret, so placing it right on the gold won't make that much difference. We'll lose the 1 grassland tile, but that's not a biggy. Good work, the second map was really needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's still a possibility that Inner Valley could be a FP with the palace elsewhere. But, remember PDX? That was somewhat away from the capital, and had lots of production.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gingerbread Man</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A well laid out plan. If this were a poll, I'd vote yes.<br />
<br />
At the moment, I cant see any objections. I think Gold Rush is on a good site as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great River could also be placed 1 SW, but there's a bonus grassland there. It's one of those areas that we'll just have to explore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 11, 2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually liked Shaitan's suggestion of a possible capital move to Gorina. If we've got desert and water around Noshuret, regardless of what our island looks like, that may not be a suitable spot for our hub of non-corruption. If the capital is moved to Gorina, then I would say back-off Gold Rush to the gold so as not to crowd the new Capital. Just something to keep in mind. Why hamstring ourselves for 1 grassland tile?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back on topic, I like the proposed sites, though I would prefer that yet to be planned sites east of the capital were founded before those in the far west.</div></div><hr />

There are holes in it, that is, areas where it was hard to place cities. Depending on what we do, we could lose 2 normal grassland tiles (nothing compared to the spices and gold we lost around the capital in DG2). There's 2 sites with just a red dot. Those are possibilities.<br />

Part One<br />

Part Two<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's possible, to fill out the land, that SW mountain could go 1S of those 2 forest (or 1 N, 1 NW). However, this will leave the tile 1 N of the fish (1 S of the current location) open.<br />
<br />
For the Cresent Mountain area, I'd really like some more of it explored. Also, the area between &quot;The Ranch&quot;, &quot;Desert Fog&quot;, and &quot;Lake Asphinxia&quot; should also be eplored.<br />
<br />
If you're thinking of a port by Wheatfish, the only way is to have Wheatfish 1 to the NW, and a (VERY) small port 1 SW of the lake. Ships WILL travel through the port, lake and chokepoint city.</div></div><hr />

Do we feel we havea  chance at securing these eastern cities? Everything to the west is safe. Can we manage to do the eastern ones? <br />
If not, I'd like to have a say on getting them... :Evil:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still feel that we should block off the Eastern landbridge, claim only &quot;To Dye For&quot;, and settle to the West.  I feel that the Dyes are the only thing to the East that we absolutely have to have.<br />
<br />
Expanding to the West will allow us to build an empire on our terms, which would then let us take the East on our terms.  Remember, we are not 100% sure that the West is entirely ours.  We shouldn't squander the chance to claim a good part of it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bill_in_PDX</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Donovan.  From a pure strategic perspective, lets secure the area facing Cleo, we know she will try the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirp</div><div class="date">May 20, 2003, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've made some proposed city placement plans for our next few important cities:<br />

 http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/DG3_BC1250_East-Sirp-dotmap.jpg <br />
<br />
The numbers are in order of priority:<br />
<br />
(1) is a highly productive site near our capital which gets the cattle online asap<br />
<br />
(2) pushes toward Egypt and gets a highly fertile and productive site.<br />
<br />
(3) is a necessary squeeze between Nar Shadaa and Gorina, and has the advantage of getting the iron in our cultural radius without cultural expansion.<br />
<br />
(4) pushes towards America and grabs some highly fertile land<br />
<br />
(5) gets the wine and settles some nice land near our capital<br />
<br />
(6) is on fresh water near some very, very fertile land.<br />
<br />
(7) is a push toward Egypt and gets the iron before they do.<br />

<br />
we also need a bit more exploration to the direction the american unit is at... are they down there or are they just exploring in that direction? if they are there, how far are they from us?</div></div><hr />
