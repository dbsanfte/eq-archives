      <td colspan="5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vanidar was born on a clear autumn day to a small ordinary family of wood elves. Vanidar, which means Silverleaf in the common tongue, was so named because soon after his birth a single leaf which seemed somehow to hold a silvery-grey cast, as if twilight had settled within, came to rest upon the young <i>arran's</i> outstretched palm. This leaf having the rarest of all the color patterns of the Eld Trees of the Fay,  was held by many as a blessing from the Goddess Tunare. <br><p><br>As a boy, Vanidar was very different from his childhood friends in that he often left home for hours, sometimes days on end exploring and discovering the wide world without. He was never much of a student nor did he seem to hold any interest in the Leather Store owned by the family although every now and then he would bring in a few pelts for his <i>Athir</i> and even learned to make a few items himself. He always seemed more interested in the animals and the plant-life around him and was considered a loner, almost an outcast. Vanidar actually prefered things this was as others invariably got in the way whenever he was exploring. <br><p><br>It was on one such excursion when Vanidar's family, laden with goods to sell in far off Ak'Annon, was walayed and brutally murdered by a Vampire and his Werewolf henchmen in the Lesser Faydark. Their bodies were to be found later by a very worried Vanidar. <br><p><br>After this He joined in with the local Rangers and learned more about the natural cycle of nature which makes all life possible and of the foul creatures that had slain his family and how their undeath in turn disrupts that same cycle of life.<br><p><br>Now counted among the journeymen rangers of Kelethin, Vanidar travels the world helping those he can and safe-guarding the delicate balance that is the web of life. Too, he steadfastly battles the undead and necromantic forces in all their forms, hoping to one day rid all Norath of their foul taint. <P></font></td></tr>

In the dark mists of the past now lie many battles and many memories, both bitter and sweet;  and while the road has been hard so too has it been rewarding.<br><p><br>For a time he stayed with his Dwarven Brethren learning their ways and helping the residents of the Butcherblock Mountains as best he could. Eventually he was called upon to assist the Bloodforge Brigade in several matters. The Blood Sabers of Antonica had tried to infiltrate the Dwarven city of Kaladim. Worse, there  was a Traitor who had thrown in with the Blood Sabers. Trumpy Irontoe, a dwarf privy to many Dwarven military secrets needed to be stopped before it was too late. Vanidar and a small troup of the Bloodforge brigade were dispatched.<br><p><br>The journey to Qeynos was indeed a long one and more than a few brave souls were lost along the way. Upon reaching the city Trumpy was removed. But a huge and intricate conspiracy was uncovered and Vanidar took it upon himself to unravel it. <br><p><br>From the guards of Qeynos to the dark depths of the Split Paw Gnolls, to the stronghold of Highpass Hold he struggled against many forces; often working in secret and attacking from the shadows. It seemed that there was a faction of guards both in Qeynos and in Highpass that were lieing in wait for the day when the Blood Sabers would take over the country side and wrest control from Antonius Bayle. There were found ties to the High Shamans in Split Paw as well. What was worse is that the ringleader of this vast conspiracy turned out to be Kane Bayle, Antonius's Brother. Eventually, with the aid of many an adventurer Vanidar was able to make known the plans of the Bloodsabers and thawrt aside any chance they had at a conquest. <br><p><br>His deeds won him much recognition both in Qeynos and the Karana's where he was named a Hero; and in Kaladim where the Bloodforge Brigade honored him with a position of respect among their ranks. <br><p><br>After, he traveled the lands in search of the Undead that had plagued his life for so long. One day, after talking with the Forest Master of Kithicor Woods, Morin Shadowbane, he discovered that there was a new  threat to the lands. It seemed that a Race of Shadowed men had been sent from the Altered planes for some unknown purpose. They had been reported to use Ghouls as messengers of sorts and with a fire in his eyes Vanidar accepted the task of tracking down and intercepting one of them. <br><p><br>After recovering the maps carried by the ghouls it was determined that some kind of a mass assault was to take place but when was still a mystery. In thanks for his efforts Vanidar was given a sword forged by the hands of Morin himself and quenched in the Rains of Karana. <br><p><br>Finally, Vanidar had proven himself as a Ranger. Journeyman no longer he was now an elder of the Woods and used his knowlede to help the people of both Antonica and Faydwer as he could and to teach those who would follow in his footsteps, just as he still followed in the footsteps of those who came before him. <br><p><br>It was some years later that Vanidar met Stormi Wethyr. A young Druid of Tunare who had taken up guardianship of the areas in the Eastern Plains of Karana. A wood elf like him, Stormi was both enchanting and  solid in her faith. She was an angel in the night who leaves not but a soft whisper in the breeze passing through the trees. She was as beautiful as the stars and the moon in the heavens and at once Vanidar fell hopelessly in love with her. <br><p><br>Such a relationship was very hard for Vanidar to accept as he had distanced himself from the world after his family had been stripped from him. But slowly, Stormi was able to bring out emotions and desires that he had never known were possible. Vanidar would find himself singing at nothing at all as he walked and the world was filled with color and was more vibrant somehow now than it had ever been before. Most of all he found himself searching for ways to bring joy to Stormi. He would do anything to hear her laugh, a sound as magical as the falling rain on a spring morning. And when she smiled it seemed that Vanidar was a child all over again standing in awe looking up at the sun for the very first time. It was not long before Vanidar arranged for a secret meeting high in the mountains. There, in a glen next to a pool fed by a waterfall, Vanidar asked Stormi for her hand in marriage while the moon and the stars wheeled accross the sky overhead.<br><p><br>Vanidar would never forget that night. But, his dreams were not to be realised. Not long after their engagement Stormi disappeared. She had been kidnaped by some unknown power, and everything shattered inside Vanidar Moonwhisper in a whirlwind of fury and anguish and despair, and from out of its core rose a fierce determination. Vanidar could guess who was responsible. He had built himself quite a reputation in the decades of his life. Chief among those was his hatred for all that was undead and especially for the vile forces of Mistmoore. The trail of her captors indeed led to the ancient stronghold of the same monster that had taken his family from him so many years before. <br><p><br>It was here that Vanidar now turned his attention. A cold fury burned him like the likes of which this world had never seen before. He meant to rescue his beloved, or if he was too late to avenge her death. The battles that Raged within the walls of Mistmoore are now the subject of legends. Like a demon unleashed Vanidar swept through the Castle aided by allies of adventures long past. They were a whirlwind of death and when they were finished not a sound stirred within the walls of Mistmoore. But Mayong, the Vampire Patriarch, was no where to be found. Nor was there any trace of lost Stormi. <br><p><br> Vanidar walked away from that scarred but much more capable than ever before. He had aquired powerful magics and weapons so heavily enchanted that they hummed. He had come through the fires of the deepest of hells and had emerged victorious. He had been tempered by those fires, and made far stronger. <br><p><br>Tunare saw this. She also saw the beginings of a true Champion. She gave him a quest. A quest to find and bring back objects of power that were being used by the forces of darkness to plague the world. Once again he set out, fading into obscurity for years untold. Then, one day he came back again. What his adventures were is not recorded here and Vanidar has never uttered a word of it to anyone living. However, he brought back with him objects of great power. He was dressed in a magical suit of chainmail. The links so finely interwoven they seemed lighter than the finest of silks. Yet more amazing was that these links seemed to be alive. Living vines if Ivy formed into rings; leaves still breathing the warm air of Norrath. Such a suit of Armor could have only been bestowed by the gods themselves many have claimed. <br><p><br>Vanidar also carried a bundle wrapped in silk. This he brought before Mayson Trueshot, the Forest Warden of the Greater Faydark and Captain of the Faydarks Champions. Slowly the bundle was unrapped and Vanidar presented a Bow that shimmered in the moonlight. For he had found once again the enchanted bow of Karana himself, once thought to be lost for all time. The Rain Caller was his to weild. <br><p><br>To this day Vanidar wanders the earth, healing and teaching those he can and safegaurding the residents of Norrath against the demons from without. And still he searches for his lost love..... <P></font></td></tr>
