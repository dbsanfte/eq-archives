<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I encourage all citizens of our fair nation of Fanatica to vote for me as Chief Justice.  I ensure you that I am the best choice for CJ.  I have been a very active member of this demogame.  I have a large amount of experience, including three terms as Public Defender, one term as Culture Deputy, one term as Trade Deputy, one term as a PSC board member, where I have recently become active, and I am the mayor of Skunkworks.  I have also founded the channel #debates, where demogame chatroom debates are held, and have recently been chosen as an election office co-owner to replace CT.  This was all accomplished in the three months that I have participated in the demogame.  I have proposed a number of proposals, including repealing the incumbent rule, having a new CoL (both DG2), two constitutional amendments, three Judicial Reviews, etc.  I have been an active member of the Judiciary, participating in Judicial Reviews when they were called, and helping to acquit Donovan Zoi when a PI was filed against him, and preventing further trouble by getting him not to file a PI against Chieftess.  It should be noted that I have never been afraid to voice my opinion on the constitution in Judicial Reviews, as can be evidenced by my occasional dissenting opinions.  I must say that the last term in the Judiciary was the most enjoyable for me, because the Judiciary was more active and I had the chance to participate more.  I also plan to write a CoL and propose it during this term.  The CoL will clarify such things as Article D in our Constitution, the process when a vacancy in an office occurs, and other things that are not clear in our current constitution.  Unlike my opponent, I believe that the Judiciary should play an active role in writing and helping to write new amendments, laws, and standards and approving them via constitutional means.  In addition, if I win multiple offices, I will accept Chief Justice as my first priority, declining the others.  In conclusion, I encourage all citizens to vote for me, I will do the best job that is possible as Chief Justice and I will certainly help to improve the demogame.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all. I am still the newbie here. This is my first demogame yet I have been a very active participant. I held the office of Judge Advocate this past term and I believe that I have made an enthusiastic contribution to the game. <br />
I regularly post in the threads. I am currently a historian and cartographer for our great nation. I am also heavily involved in ensuring that the polls are constructed fairly and I am responsible for the final draft of  Poll Standards. I am also very active in getting people to participate more in the game as many will tesify. Also I often post discussion threads and polls.In addition I have also helped with this election process providing regular updates in the Nomination Tracker. By voting for me you are voting for someone who regularly contributes to this game and is keen to get new players involved and encourage them to stand for election.<br />
<br />
Like Boots I too have been very active in the Judicial thread. However more of my findings received the support of the Bench. So although I may lack experience, my judgement is sound. The main difference between us is our view of the role of the Judiciary. I firmly believe that the Judiciary exists only to judge, not to make laws. Separation of Powers insists that the Judiciary remain independent of government for our society to be free. People of Fanatica if the judges start making laws as well as judging you by them, then there is no one to ensure that you are treated fairly. I believe that the Judiciary should be impartial and independent of government. As Chief Justice I will ensure that our rules are interpreted in the best interests of the people.<br />
<br />
If you agree that the Judiciary should only exist to judge the Constitution and not to make your laws which is your sovereign right then Vote Peri</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FionnMcCumhall</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm tough choice, both capable of the top dog of the bench. Maybe i should flip a coin ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is probably the toughest election for Chief Justice we have ever had.  As Fionn McCumhall has stated, Fanatica should be proud to have either of these two fine candidates step up to the big chair.  Both have been involved in extracurricular activities that have greatly enhanced the Democracy Game, and I think both will have long and storied careers in our great nation.<br />
<br />
That said, I cast my vote for Peri.  I like some of the ideas he has and would like to see more discussion on them.  Also, there are some minor embellishments by boots regarding my PI case, but I still feel that he handled the situation objectively and professionally.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, this was a tough choice and I would be proud to have either of these two serving as Chief Justice.  But in my mind's eye, I still picture Peri at the helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In rebuttal to the laws point...<br />
I believe that the Judiciary has some of the most expertise on laws, and should certainly help to write them.  The principle of separation of powers works well for democracies with thousands to millions of constituents.  When only around 20 people are active, everybody needs to lend a hand in the lawmaking system, especially those who know the most about them.  Keep in mind that the Constitution clearly states that all citizens are in the Congress, which is a lawmaking body.  Therefore, the members of the Judiciary, as members of Congress, have every right to propose new legislation, just as any other Congress member.  Therefore, I would be honored to write a Code of Laws in the next term, and I will make sure to do so.<br />
<br />
Also, I want to remind voters that I am still a relative newbie compared to many other people who participate in this demogame, with 3 months of demogame experience.  Though it is true that my opinions have not been supported as often by the Judiciary as a whole, this is most likely because I hold my own opinions on how to interpret the constitution.  Simply because the Judiciary found against me doesn't mean that my judgement is unsound.  I have written out detailed reviews and explain my position thoroughly.  I believe that having an occasional dissenting opinion is an asset; it shows that you always support your opinion and do not let it be swayed by other opinions.  I do not want this to sound like I am alleging that Peri can be bought, but in all of his reviews (except for the dismissal of charges against DZ, of which the JA must post the first review), he has waited for the CJ opinion before posting his.  I, on the other hand, have never had a problem with posting a review before anybody else, and I have posted the first ruling on almost every judicial review.  In addition, simply because an interpretation of the Constitution was ruled one way doesn't mean that the ruling can't be overturned at a later date.  <br />
<br />
And DZ, where did I embellish my part in your PI case?  I said that I helped to acquit you in the PI case, which I did by acting as defender and by reviewing against it.  I also said that I got you not to file a PI against Chieftess in return, which you stated was because of my intervention by a post in the Judicial thread.  I do not see what was embellished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not one to criticise my opponents so I do take exception to the mud slinging done by Boots in his last post. I am sure you did not mean it to come out like that. I know this is a campaign for election but it would be nice to stick to the issues rather than personal attacks. Therefore I would be grateful if you could retract the offending lines. :)<br />
May I draw people's attention to the Judicial Thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?threadid=54846) which demonstrates my impartiality, sound judgement and integrity. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">boots, the main thing that comes to mind is that when the PI first broke, the first PI from you stated that you were not sure if you if you would be able to acquit me of the charges, after which Peri and donsig quickly(and thankfully) dismissed the case as having no merit.  I guess I just didn't feel that you went &quot;above and beyond&quot; to prove my case.  This doesn't mean I am not grateful. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not wish to make an issue of this but if Boots admitted that not only he believed a breach of the constitution had occured when it had not, but also that he could not win a case that would be impossible to lose then this seriously calls his judgement into question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was not sure I could win it because I saw an inadvertant breach of the constitution.  I had never had a PI before; the past two terms were quiet; and I didn't know if I could defend DZ on that issue.  I was not sure if an accident would be considered a legitimate excuse, and I was trying to get DZ a lenient punishment, probably No Punishment or at the very most Warning.  I was afraid that an impeachment could result; I was only doing my job as defender to advise him to take what I believed to be the best possible path for him if it came to trial.  I was afraid that a part of the constitution was violated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I retract my previous statement that DZ may have accidentially violated the Constitution.  I thought at the time that he did, but I was wrong as can be evidenced in the chat log, where CG assumed responsibility for troop orders.  I have edited this part out of my post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plexus</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going to have to lend my vote to Peri, you were heads, Peri, and heads it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too voted for Peri. He seems the obvious choice to me. Although Boots has made some good calls in his three months, I do not consider him unbiased. I believe the reason he made the statement about DZ in regards to the PI (see above) was because of his close ties to Chieftess. A move like this is not something I look for in a Chief Justice.<br />
<br />
Go Peri!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you mean by close ties to Chieftess? It's true that I want her back and supported her actions here, but I would have done the same if it were her being PI'd by DZ rather than the other way around.  I am impartial in my rulings; it was just that I thought I saw a violation of the constitution when I saw the PI.  Fortunately, I turned out to be wrong.  I assure you that I will be fair and impartial as Chief Justice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please vote for Boots. He has gained Experiance from the Judicary Branch since Day 1. Boots has proven himself for this possition.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eklektikos</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Peri has my vote here. His calm &amp; analytical approach to demogame matters makes him a great candidate for this particular job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly I would like to thank Boots for a hard fought campaign. It was a very close one.<br />
I would also like to thank everyone for voting and give special thanks to those who had the confidence in me to fill this role. Therefore I amannouncing that I shall be accepting my election as the new Chief Justice for Term 3.<br />
<br />
Glory to Fanatica</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to congratulate my opponent Peri for his hard-fought victory.  I look forward to a new term with you in the High Bench.  I really liked this election campaign, it was very interesting.  Peri, if there's someone other than me that I want on the CJ bench, it's you.  Congratulations!</div></div><hr />
