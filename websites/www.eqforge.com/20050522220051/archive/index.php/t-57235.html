I can't help but notice that donsig received 8 votes in rapid succession, whereas CG and Fionn received none.  Also, no unusual amount of votes rang in in the other polls.  I suspect that there may have been a DL fraud involving several DL's.  I have contacted Thunderfall on this issue, and he may conduct an IP scan.  I am not accusing anybody of fraud, but this needs to be investigated.  I ask that the moderators in this forum give this issue their full attention.  I would also ask that if anybody did this, please contact TF and be honest about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boots and I have Discovered that discrepency around the time Boots has posted his Post #16. Somewhere Between My Post #15 and #16 There was a Huge Jump on Donsig's Side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is important that we do not rush to judgment here as an election is still in progress.  I have sent a PM to Thunderfall explaining the details of this matter, and myself or eyrei will update the citizenry on any new details as they come in.  If you have any further concerns on this matter, please PM one of us.  Do not post here.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see any reason to suspect any foul play here, and I may even be able to offer an explanation.  Many people who used to be involved in the demogame vote in the presidential elections and no others.  It is perfectly normal for this election to receive more votes than the others.  Also, there are those (myself included) who may have started voting and then stopped for some reason.  Currently, I have been interrupted twice while trying to cast my votes, and still haven't finished.<br />
<br />
Further, I have seen this phenomena before in other elections.  Particularly, the group that often hangs out in the chat room usually votes earlier than others (because they find out the polls were posted first), and tend to vote for certain candidates.  Thus, a candidate sometimes will get a large number of votes early on, and then end up losing the election as the rest of the populace votes.  This seems to be the case here...<br />
<br />
There is also no way to tell who voted in a poll without running a gigantic search of every poll ever posted, so I wouldn't expect Thunderfall to find anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">eyrei's right -  there are always people who draw in outsiders and lurkers for the vote.  donsig's been here since the beginning, and has simply drawn out those who support him who aren't necessarily active.<br />
<br />
Besides, the Presiential election has historically drawn out more voters than all the others.</div></div><hr />

Great Fionn. The election between the 2 is too thrilling for me to &quot;waste&quot; my vote on the 3rd place candidate, if it possible to &quot;waste&quot; a vote if it goes to an able candidate.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's happened.  In the Term 1 elections for Domestic, I received the first three votes, but then only received three more throughout the election.  *sighs*</div></div><hr />

In the Past, I have made several attempts to make it to President. In the last Term of DG2, I made it to Vice President. In Term 1 of this Demogame, I was the Military Leader. In Term 2 I was automadicly appointed Vice President after CT has left.<br />
<br />
I beleve it is about time for me to get a chance to be president. Like Donovon Zoi, I to never had a chance on becoming president.<br />
So People, I encourage you to vote for CivGeneral. I will surely bring good times to Term 3.<br />

Give CivGeneral a chance at the Presidancy, Vote for CG.</div></div><hr />

I thank you, DZ, for your cooperation on this matter.  I would like it if TF could place an IP scan to figure out if a user that frequents the demogame has a large quantity of DL's.  This will help to settle this beyond all reasonable doubt.  AFAIK, there is no way other than an IP scan that could be done to prove or disprove any &quot;foul play&quot;.  I would appreciate it if he could do that before we officially consider this investigation closed.  In the meantime, however, these election results would stand.<br />

BTW, Go CG!  Around 10-15 minutes to go and you only need one more vote to tie it!</div></div><hr />

I talked with Thunderfall in great detail on all our options, and wouldn't have posted with such finality if there were more that could be done.  And regarding your idea of checking everyone's IP for DL's, I am not about to put all of of Fanatica through such an ordeal for this.  This matter is closed.  :)<br />

On a more serious note, I think it is about time we considered doing away with secret ballots, at least in the presidential elections.  If our election thread was not a poll but a thread where each citizen had to publicly post his or her vote we could avoid divisive allegations such as those made during this election.<br />
<br />
Please note I have scheduled the first term 3 turn chat for a scant 47.5 hours from now.  there's much work to be done so let's get to it! :whipped:</div></div><hr />
