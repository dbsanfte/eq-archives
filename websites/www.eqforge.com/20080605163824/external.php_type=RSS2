			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>OK, here's the situation: Me (Joao), HC, Bismarck and Qin are on the continent. Bismarck is Christian, the rest of us are Hindu. Since I border Qin, we are at war.  I move out the single defender (war elephant) from one of my cities, Qin captures the city with a chariot. He now has two christian cities and one hindu, so of course he switches religion, never mind that this will make his best buddy HC a wee bit upset with him, the one hindu city is his capital (granted, it will fall to me pretty soon, but anyway ...) and he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell to keep the city he just took.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Why is it that we treat criticism of religion, be it christianity or islam, differently than criticism of, say political views. Newspapers can make fun of political parties and their leaders but they seldom make fun of religion because it &quot;offends&quot;. Why is it we never think of all the republicans we offend when we criticize or make fun of George Bush. Or why can newspapers mock socialists without anyone condemning it. Why does not free speech apply to religion? Why should newspaper care about they offend christians or muslims more than they care about offending republicans or socialists. <br />

<br />
A norwegian newspaper has been criticized for publishing this picture after the bombing of the danish embassy, because it &quot;offends&quot; muslims. Why on earth should they care? No one cares when they criticize our political parties.<br />

By the way his t-shirt says &quot;I am Mohammad and no one dares to print me&quot;.<br />

<br />
What I'd like to do is take a few maps which were made for Vanilla civ (and Warlords &amp; BtS as well), and convert them for use with the FfH II mod.  At the moment, attempts to load the maps with the FfH mod cause CtDs, so worldbuilder editing is not possible.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have been a builder player from my first game of Civ 1 and that meant that I built every improvement in every city... without thinking.  I have gotten better and I don't build everything any more but the problem is now the opposite:<br />
<br />
I tend not to build anything at all.  The problem is that I don't really understand the use of the multiplier buildings generally.  I read Aabraxans great article but it is a little too much on the tech side for me.  What I would like is just a plain statement of fact about markets and banks'.<br />
<br />
When do I build a market and do I always add a bank if I built the market?<br />
<br />
When do I NEED to build a market?<br />
<br />
I don't build granaries until my city proves that it is going to grow. (say size 7-8) Is there a time when you really need to build that granary even if the city is not going to be a long term growth city? (assuming you have the technology :scan: )<br />
<br />
When would it be good to build a library/university?  Many people seem to object to these as well.<br />
<br />
I love my culture buildings so I won't ask about temples/cathedrals at all, at all.  :lol:</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I recently reinstalled XP Home and after getting my wireless card up, I hit up nvidia.com to download the latest drivers for my video card.  Once I ran and installed the drivers I reboot the machine and am stuck in 800x600 at 4-bit.  <br />
<br />
Uninstalling the drivers got me back to XP default VGA graphics, but whenever I updated to the latest version (175.16 released May 16, 2008) Windows felt like I couldn't go any higher than 800x600 4-bit!  For now I have resorted to installing the drivers that came with the CD when I bought the card and that has been working fine so far.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have a clue what is going on or have had similar problems?</div>

Time to give some :love: to the Catholics.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
for one, modern Catholicism as is present in &quot;liberal&quot; countries seems as one of the coolest religions around.<br />
<br />
Let's not focus on the bad stuff, like the past, the scandals, and the conservative reactionary parts.<br />
<br />
But let us focus on the forms of Catholicism that are very open, free en tolerant.<br />
<br />
Even I as an atheïst must admit that some Catholic priests are very cool: i remember having lessons from an (ex-)priest who was one of the most open-minded smart guys I ever knew and shaped the way i think. <br />
<br />
Also some aspects of the &quot;cultural&quot; catholicism are just too good to ignore, both material and spiritual.<br />
<br />
So, for once, think of Zarn, and show some sympathy to the Catholics.<br />

Now that the candidates are in place, I want to throw out another one that I used a lot in the 2004 election, and thats <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/" target="_blank">http://www.electoral-vote.com/</a><br />
<br />
Electoral-Vote has a daily updated electoral college map, based on the latest polling data. It also breaks down every single house and senate seat, with their polls, and useful backgrounding information.<br />
<br />
If you want to stay abreast on what the latest numbers are, check it out. I for one, am very surprised to see that CT is so close, and that some of the southern states are also close (South Carolina with 3?)<br />
<br />
Early, but I thought it might be a good resource.</div>
