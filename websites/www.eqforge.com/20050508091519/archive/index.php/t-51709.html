<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for? <br />
<br />
I am running for FA and Science. I am running for these because they reflect my interests. I have always been involved with Science and I feel that it is time to reclaim my throne (really the seat next to the throne...). I am running for FA because I feel that we need a dove to be our face to other nations so that we can possibly win space wise.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
Yes. I am running for FA and Science, as previously stated. If I were to win both, I would have to think before I chose, depending on who was second.<br />
<br />
 3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for? <br />
<br />
For Science, I have all of DG2 as a chatrep and sometimes deputy.<br />
For FA, I have nothing but dependability and constantly being in the rooms when it comes to TCs.<br />
<br />
 4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves? <br />
<br />
Turn chats are a MUST. They are needed to keep a nation thriving. And as for offline preturn, they help and should be allowed.<br />
<br />
 5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws? <br />
<br />
Yes/No, seeing as we are going to rewrite them. I can say as of now, its not the best thing to disregard the laws.<br />
<br />
 6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents. <br />
<br />
Well, lets see... Nows normally the time I'd make a wisecrack about Penguins. But lemme think. For science, Im fluent in the tech tree and have helped divise queues. For FA, I can talk with leaders and not annoy them while secretly stealing all their cash.<br />
<br />
 7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game? <br />
<br />
Monarch is actually my prefered level. Emperor SGs are helping me get used to that level and I hope to go Deity sometime this summer.<br />
<br />
 8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
Hmm.. that said 8, but I assume it means 1. For FA, I hope to actually meet people. For Science, it depends on who we are.<br />
<br />
 9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Not this term.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naervod for Domestic and FA<br />
<br />
1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
I am running for FA and Domestic because I want to broaden my DG horizons and get away from the boring consistency of the Judiciary. I also feel that I am a hard-worker and could bring sucess to the department I head.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
I am running for FA and Domestic. If I won both I would take Domestic, but I don't expect to win against Chieftess. <br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
For FA I have worked with the FIA last game. In the Civ2 DG I have held the post of FA Minister before. Also, I am very good at negotiations in the Civ3 game.<br />
<br />
For Domestic, I was Deputy under FionnMcCumhall for a term, and that alone has helped me to learn alot. I was also Domestic Deputy for a term in the Civ2DG.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
Turn-chats are essential to this game. Without them, this would barely be a democracy. however, offline pre-turns are acceptable.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
How could I not be after serving five Judiciary terms? If we are going to change them, I am good at grasping new concepts. Also, only in extreme circumstances is it not OK to follow the laws.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
For Domestic, I have good early-game skills in terms of finding suitable city sites and improving the terrain. For FA, I am an expreienced negotiator, able to take advantage of a civilzation as much as possible and also I am able to weasel out of a sticky situation. Also, I am a hard worker and am responsible. I know that wasn't one sentence, but what can I do? ;)<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
Monarch and Regent are my preferred levels. I am getting OK at Emporer and like SAAM plan to go Deity this summer.<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
For Domestic I will try and find some good suitable city sites to build the foundation of our civilization on and start the beginnings of a superb infrastructure. For FA, I want to meet civs and try and get as much as I can out of them without getting into a war.<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
A two day camping trip in two or three weeks and a one day camping trip on Memorial Day weekend.<br />
<br />
In conclusion vote naervod for Domestic and FA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am running for science leader.<br />
<br />
1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
I feel my experience in posting polls, and with CIV3 will be valuable to the nation.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
I am also running for governor.  I would take the governor position over the science leader position.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
I was one of the original players when the first demogame started, and have held various positions including domestic leader, president, VP, and foreign affairs leader.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
I believe this should be up to the DP.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
I helped write some of them.  On occasion, a particular interpretation of the laws can actually harm the game.  It is then the duty of government officials to do what they think is best.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I am a skilled civ3 player, and an experienced demogame player.<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
I normally play on monarch with occasional forays into emperor.<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
I plan to post clear and informative polls to determine our research path.  Beginning with whether or not we want to try for the Great Library, as this is a decisive factor in how our research path should be set.<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
No</div></div><hr />

2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
Only 1<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
I've experience in this department and ran the department several times in the past.<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
They're fine the way they are.<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
Not all, but most. And it is never appropriate to break laws.<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
I know this department well, have ran it before, and am overall knowledgable of the subject.<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
Monarch<br />

Yes, one starting now, and one at the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
I want to guide the start of the game, as the opening moves are often the most important.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
President<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
I've been in the demogame for over a year, and I've held the presidency, domestic, trade, governorship and FA deputy.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
They're great to see what the public wants. Offline turn chats should only be done if the moves are changable and won't mess up another leader's instruction, such as has happened in the first demogame. <br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
I'm still getting the gist of the new laws, but they're pretty much like DG1.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
My experience and attention to detail in the game will be valuable at the start.<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
Regent and monarch. I also play at emperor level from time to time.<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
Efficiency in getting off to a good start.<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
None that I can forsee.<br />
<br />
For Presidential Candidates Only <br />
<br />
10. At what time are you planning to hold turn-chats (assuming you will hold turn-chats) and why do you feel this would be a good time<br />
<br />
7:00pm EDT on weekdays, 12:00pm EDT on weekends. Since we are in the early part of the game, I might consider turnchats every 3 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The debate questions are extrememly old and recycled from DG2 so I'm going to ignore them and just wing it here. Hope nobody minds. ;)<br />
<br />
I'm running for President of our soon to be great nation for several reasons. My game skills are particularly critical in the early stages of the game. I am a rock squeezer. I will get the absolute best output from our early limited resources. I've also got a fair bent for the legislature. Several of our citizens have expressed trepidation over our minimalist ruleset. As President I will be in a position to keep things running smoothly and show just how we can all function in a cooperative environment without a huge and burdensome ruleset. The relatively short chats at the beginning of the game will also allow me to hold most chats at the typical 7 PM EST (24:00 GMT) time spot. Later in the game when chats get longer as a result of longer turns that will not be possible.<br />
<br />
I am not hedging my bets by running for another position. This is the only office I want right now because it is the best position for me to be in for our nation. As the returning players know, and the new players will discover, I am very dedicated to this game. My skills and that dedication in the President's chair will ensure a strong start for our nation and a suitable legacy for the next President to assume.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Incidentally, if anybody has a fresh question feel free to PM me and I will post and answer it here for all to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plexus</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
I am running for culture minister because I have been involved with culture for a very long time and have implemented many new ideas into the department. I am running for President because I am a long time, dedicated person in the demogame.<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
I am running for both the Presidency and the cabinet chai of culture. If I win both, I will be taking the presidency.<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
I have been involved with the demogame for almost a year this may. I have many terms of the culture ministy under my belt, although I am new to the presidency.<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
I have always gone against closed session chats and I question the democratic implications of prechats.<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
I know all of our DG2 laws, and I will learn what ever new laws we decide to implement in DG3.<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noldodan</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
I am running for the position of Domestic Leader for the purpose of guiding this essential department through the initial stages of the Demogame.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
Just Domestic.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
I was governor of the Eldarinórë province for two terms last Demogame.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
As I and many others last Demogame said, Chieftess' offline turn 0's were a very good and time-saving idea.  I say we officially adopt them, but otherwise leave them alone.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
After a couple lessons in Demogame law last game, I believe that I am well aquainted with the laws.  It is never appropriate not to follow the laws.  If you wish to do something outside the law, either change it or be prepared to face the consequences!<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
I have experience with governing cities from the previous Demogame, and am also a perfectionist at heart, devoted to making each city the best that it can be.<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
I normally play at Monarch myself, so no problem here.<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
I plan on putting population and territory growth at the top of my priority list, over both shields and commerce.  This will lead to a slow start, however, once we get into the ADs, this will lead to very large production and commerce levels.<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
I will be leaving for one weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All candidates for Executive positions should respond to these debate questions.

<br />
1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
<br />
I am running for both Trade Leader and Public Defender. I wasn’t going to stand at first since this is my first Demogame and I wanted to get a feel for the mechanics of it. However I then realised that the more I get involved the more I’ll get out of it. I would prefer to be Trade Leader because I have a better understanding of how to make that department successful.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
Since this is my first Demogame, I can’t call on a long list of glories. However I am a keen player of CivIII and have played it constantly since it was first released. (Yes I know, Get a life!!) Accordingly I have developed a keen understanding of the game and if elected I know I will serve you well and make our nation prosperous.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
Until I actually experience this first hand I am not qualified to comment on the established procedure for conducting the game. However I will enthusiastically campaign for change if it is deemed necessary and look for new ways to improve the experience for all.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
I am familiar with our constitution and understand that all our other laws under review. The laws of our nation must be followed always. If any of our laws are contrary to the interests of our nation then the people in their wisdom will change them.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I will do my utmost to serve the people and make the Trade Department successful.<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at?<br />
If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game? <br />
<br />
I usually play at Monarch and sometimes the higher levels for a more challenging game. <br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
The priority for this department is to secure resources in the greatest quantity possible. They are essential to the success of our nation. They will make our own citizens happy, allow us to develop and not lastly allow us to trade with our neighbours. To this end your Trade Department will seek out new resources and exploit them for the good of our people.<br />
I also want to keep bureaucracy to a minimum and ensure the utmost level of participation from you the people. I will encourage discussion on all aspects of policy and propose trade deals for your consideration. I will also ensure that the will of the people is carried out in the game. <br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please feel free to message me with if you have any questions about my candidacy, and ideas that you might have to take this department and our nation forward.<br />
Thankyou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FortyJ</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
I am running for President and Trade Leader.  I chose these offices because I believe I can make a difference in either of these positions.  My organization skills, attention to detail, and previous experience in the position make it possible for me to carry out the responsibilities of this office efficiently without sacrificing citizen participation.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
I am also running for Trade Leader.  If I am so fortunate to be elected to both positions, I would elect to serve out the first term as President, because I feel like I could do the most good in that position.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
I have held several leadership positions in DG2, including serving as President during the pivotal Great Indian War.  In addition to demogame experience, I have gained a fair bit of managerial experience which should prove especially helpful in this position.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
Turn Chats are a critical component to the demogame.  They should remain open to the public at all costs, including Preturn turn chats.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
I am as familiar with our new laws as can be considering the short time that we have had them.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I have an adequate grasp of Civ strategy.  I also pride myself on seeking advice from both the executive council as well as the citizenry as a whole.  I am quite proud of the turn chats that I hosted last game and consider them to be some of the most inclusive, most informative, and most involved chats of the game.<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
I typically play Regent-Monarch, depending on how much of a challenge I am in the mood for.  On rare occassions, I'll boot up an Emporer or Deity game, but that's typically only after an exceptionally brutal day at the office.  In short, I feel extremely comfortable playing the Demogame at any level, primarily because we're all playing this together.<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
As President, I would coordinate the efforts of each department and emphasize advanced (aka. contingency) planning.  I would also work closely with the governor to maximize our production and growth in the critical early turns of the game to ensure a good start for our nation.<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
None planned at this time.<br />
<br />
10. At what time are you planning to hold turn-chats (assuming you will hold turn-chats) and why do you feel this would be a good time?<br />
<br />
EST: Tuesdays @ 2100 &amp; Saturdays @ 1000 EST or<br />
GMT: Wednesdays @ 0100 GMT &amp; Saturdays @ 1400 EST<br />
<br />
This schedule offers, what I consider, to be the best compromise to all citizens no matter where they are around the globe.  Thus all citizens should be able to attend at least one chat a week, while maximizing the time between chats to allow for sufficient discussion and polling on sensitive issues.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
Well, generaly I am running for Fanatika's betterment.  I feel that I can play the game in the way to best give Fanatika a good start.  Besides, what would a new DG be without me continuing my Presidential aspirations with a futile hope for another month?  ;)<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
Well, three actually.  Mainly, to make a point about the lack of documents attached to the constitution...<br />
But, in the unlikly event I win more than one, I'd take President, Trade, or JA (in that order)<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: Too much to count...  President one term, Trade leader .5 terms, Chief Justice 2.5 terms, Public Defender 1 term, governor 3 terms, Vice President 4 terms...<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
Offline preturns are fine, so long as nothing irreversable goes on.  Otherwise, I'm in favor of the use of turn chats.  They are an excellent instrument for citizen involvement and better on-the-fly decisions than closed door seesions.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
What laws?  I hardly noticed that there were any left...  I am, though, familiar with those that are left.<br />
Rules must never be broken - they were put into law by the community.  Fanatica allows for an open discussion environment - one that allows us to discuss any bad rules for possible change.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
Vote Octavian's doughnut for experience and dedication to this democracy game.<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
Monarch level is a nice stroll through the park, with the occasional bump for me.<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
First off, we get the game started, find a neighbor, and build a road to them!<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
For Presidential Candidates Only <br />
10. At what time are you planning to hold turn-chats (assuming you will hold turn-chats) and why do you feel this would be a good time<br />
<br />
Wednesday and Saturday evenings, EDT.  A majority of our citizenry are Americans on the East coast, and evenings are generally the times they are free anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
Early conquest can set the tone even for an ultimate peaceful victory, such as Spaceship.  I believe that I can work with the citizenry and our elected President to bring this forth.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
Only Military.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
Two terms as Military Deputy(taking the reins for a good part of one term), two terms as Domestic Leader, one term as Vice President, one term as Judge Advocate and one term as Governor in DG2.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
We should adopt the offline(or online preturn) chats for diplomacy or trade only.  In late game, the DP should be allowed to use this concept to make &quot;reversible&quot; military moves(by rail within our borders) to keep the chat flowing during the live chat.<br />
<br />
No closed door sessions, please.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
Yes, and since we are starting with a more barren set of laws, it will be incumbent on our leaders to act with the will of the people in mind.  You can count on that from me.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I believe that all three of us are highly qualified candidates, but I can guarantee that my Military thread won't include countless posts about the Maginot line, or &quot;scary clown&quot; avatars.  :D<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
I am playing comfortably on Emperor now.  I can endure a two-front war on Monarch, but this is obviously not recommended. ;)<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
In the early stages of the game, I would like to use units to eliminate &quot;fog of war&quot; threats from unpredictable barbarians.  I would also try to secure Iron and Horses as quickly as possible.  I believe that early conquest of weaker civs will set the stage for the rest of the game, even if we are planning a peaceful victory condition in the late-game.<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
No</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
I have been the Military for Term 2 and Term 6 &amp; 7. I have been well tranded by Falcon02 himself<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />

<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
I beleve that the Turn Chats should continue the way they are. IMO the Military Needs to know what is going on with the game. I am against a Close door policy, I am for the Pre Turn chats as long as it helps speed things up so that we dont become bored when the DP is doing queues and worker orders<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
Yes, I am very familiar with the laws. IMO, it is never good to not follow the laws. With the New Laws that are being planed to be writen and pasted, I would also help with the Judicary Department<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I shall Make sure that &quot;Unnamed Nation&quot; will have adiquate defenses agaist Barbarians and other Civs that dare to attack us.<br />

<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
I normaly play on Emperor, I defenatly feel confedent playing on Monarch (Since it is now a peace of cake now ;) )<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
As answered in question #6, but I shall explainit more further. I will ensure we have enough units for exploration and defenses against the rouge Barbarians.<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
I have no plans of having an absence :).<br />
<br />
For Presidential Candidates Only <br />
<br />
10. At what time are you planning to hold turn-chats (assuming you will hold turn-chats) and why do you feel this would be a good time <br />
<br />
Well, since I am running for the Presidential Ticket I shall answer the question.<br />
I will Hold the turn chats at 8:00pm EDT on Wed and Friday (Since we are starting, I would throw in Sunday) The reason for the time is conveniance on my part.<br />
<br />
Speech: I have grown in many ways in the last Demogame, I was Military Leader for 3 Terms, but I have also held many odd-jobs rainging from Trade Deputy and Misc, Chat rep possitions wich helped me learn more about how each department funtions so that I can run the Military Department more efficently and Cooperatly work with the other Department.<br />
<br />
Vote CivGeneral for Military Leader</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eklektikos</div><div class="date">Apr 27, 2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
Because I greatly enjoy the military side of the game and feel that my experience with its various facets could be of great benefit to our newborn nation.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
Running for just the one, as always.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
In general I'm a competent Civ3 player who favours military strategy over domestic micromanagement, so I am well suited to a post that specialises in that aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
In demogames past I have held the military leadership for one term, during which I pushed hard for a strategy of early aggression which more than paid off in the long run. I held the presidency twice, presiding over the start of two wars which greatly increased the nation's power and production base.<br />
Additionally I have held the posts of Governor, Public Defender and Domestic Leader on various occasions - giving me a very good idea of the vital inter-relations between departments.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
Personally I favour leaving this up to the discretion of the president. I certainly believe that short offline sessions to carry out a specific action and offline preturns could be hugely beneficial to the flow of the game.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
As we are now on a new set of laws only recently enacted, I could not swear to actual familiarity. I will, however, ensure that I do become so ASAP. I do not consider it appropriate to violate the laws at any time - we just need to be careful as to which laws we choose to pass.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I am an adaptable player, with no fixed agenda for our opening strategy in this game. But definite ideas of what our options should be. I also write in a clear and easy to understand manner, which is a great advantage when attempting to communicate regarding vital issues of strategy and policy.<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
I habitually play at Emperor level.<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
Depending on the civiliation we are given by the RNG and the size of world, I may advocate another strategy of early aggression, or one of high speed organic expansion. It is too early to say for sure.<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
I will be away celebrating a relative's birthday over the last weekend of May. That is the only absence I anticipate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amirsan</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess I'm pretty late in this debate (thats what you get for having school from 6:00- 2:00 and no one to take me from my aunts house...hhmmmmmm)<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
--I am running for the Science Leader because science is one of my favorite aspects of CIV3. I love to manipulate the AI research capabilities and take it to my advantage. (Made an article in Strategy Article Forum). I think being ahead in science is actually winning regardless of what your military is to others. I'm also running for Foriegn Affairs because I like Foriegn Affairs. I love how when we meet an opponent we can write about them. (Ilove the Forums in the Government Forum)<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take? <br />
<br />
--If I win both positions I would rather take the Science Position. As you know... I love CIV3 Science.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
--Well I have been playing CIV3 for about 1 year or so (dont know if that counts compared to some of you guys:)). I just started in around Term 6 of DG2 and the only positions I filled was governors of Hafen Land and Gem Mountains Province.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
--Well I do love knowing what are Country is up to from turnchats so I can say I like turnchats. But I dont get the offline turnchats (does that mean keeping secrets of our orders from Citizens?????)<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
-- I am pretty familiar with the laws- dont think I broke any- but you shouldnt break the laws If they were made not to be broken (I think Im sounding like a teacher...ooo...)<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
-- I think the citizens should vote for me because I think I have much potential. I have only filled 2 positions in the past and nothing else. I dont think I was very able to show what I can do in my favorite departments. Everyone else I am running with pretty much had many different positions and that is why you are probably voting for them. But you gots to give some people a chance :cry: :cry:<br />
<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
-- I have just finished Regent and I played about 4 succesfull Monarch Games with my own strat. Move in on up!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
-- I dont know If I should tell my GREAT science Que I have made... but I wont. But I plan to make us very advanced in the Ancient Age. As for Foriegn Affairs- I think we should make some peacefull expanding with our enemies unless they actually seem to threaten us in the Middle Ages.<br />
<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
-- Not that I know of. :D :D<br />
<br />
