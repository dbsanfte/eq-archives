Should we go right up against Egypt? (Our culture is about the same - minimal chance of a flip on both sides according to my culture calculator - this is something Culture should do. *hint* *hint*). I'm thinking about 1S and 1SW[b], [b]2SW (1SE of the cattle), OR, 2S and 1SW (1 E of the easternmost dyes) of El-Amarna for our next city. then S/SW of their for another, and then by the iron/gold.<br />

BTW, I REALLY don't think we should be wasting ANY workers to build a colony on that iron!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then what you are saying, CT, is that we should wait 20 turns before we can even upgrade our Warriors to Legionnaries?  I hope that nothing happens in those 20 turns, as will be quite ill-prepared.<br />
<br />
15 turns to build a Temple; 5 more turns for cultural expansion.  <br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, I wouldn't even be considering a Temple in Gorina right now when Settlers are so important to our cause.  You yourself are unhappy with the fact that we have so few cities.  <br />
<br />
On the plus side, I am happy with your choice of city sites, although I would found a city in those Northeastern hills ASAP.  Doing so would give us a great strategic advantage should we ever go to war with Egypt.  Missing out would give us yet another obstacle against this powerful civ.</div></div><hr />

Err, sail? Or was that just roleplay?<br />
<br />
It's a small lake - no boats can be built. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, those coastal gaps can be used as port cities.</div></div><hr />

The Gaps would be good for Port cities in the Future</div></div><hr />

Oops....my Civ2 days coming back to me.  :lol:  Never actually tried that practice in Civ3.  Oh, well....still looks like a wonderful site nonetheless.  ;)<br />
<br />
The good news, I guess, is that we won't have any barbs popping out of that lake either.  :D</div></div><hr />

And great shall be the city that sits on Lake Asphinxia. ;)<br />

Of course, the DG1 lake was 21 tiles. I kind of miss that barb galley.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So we wont even manage to get half those cities because we only have 2 settlers in the queues, one to the west and one to the east :-P<br />
<br />
So as i see the plan, we urgently would need 4 settlers, 2 to the east and 2 to the west...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's why we need more settlers. ;) Can't do much with 5 cities (and one of those grows slowly). We only have 4 workers, too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have come up with a plan to build a city in our west, to connect the iron and link Nar Shaddaa up with the rest of Fanatica.  The city would be built on the red dot:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">postitive about that one:<br />
road to nar shaddaa will be completed with the city+iron connected<br />
<br />
negative about it:<br />
distance to gorina imho too close. we should be 2 distance to nar shaddaa and 3 to gorina, not 3 to nar and 2 to gori... gori will need to be more productive as its less corruptive than nar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here is my proposal:<br />
the blue dot.<br />
it should expand the culture borders along the blue lines and thus include the iron without being too close to gorina...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, great minds, but I have to go with the Red Site.  ;)<br />
<br />
1.  It is certain that we get the Iron by building it(immediate city radius).<br />
<br />
2.  It has access to fresh water and can therefore be irrigated. It will take quite a few turns to get water to the Blue Site.<br />
<br />
3.  Just walk a Settler to the Red Site and its built;  Blue Site will take more turns.<br />
<br />
<br />
We can work to make sure that Gorina retains use of all of its tiles when it becomes a Size 20 powerhouse.  Right now, time is of the essence(you say so yourself, CT) so we should be concentrating on which site can help us now.<br />
<br />
That site is the Red Site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't even gotten to the priorities yet. We should build towards the grasslands (and connect the iron via a city ONLY when we're ready). This discussion was meant to be for the eastern area of our expansion, not the west. We WILL GET TO THE WEST SOON. That's why I divided it up so we can see where we're building, THEN set priorities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about putting the dye city on the non-shield grass between the easternmost dye and the northern cattle, and then adjusting the rest to match?<br />
<br />
It would overlap with Inadatto, but no big deal because there is no water near Inadatto to irrigate, so it won't grow anyway.  Founding on the tile I'm suggesting puts both the dyes and cattle in the immediate radius without sacrificing  much, and it is far enough from El Amarna to be unlikely to be a culture factor, as long as we don't wait too long to put a temple there.  If nothing else all of our towns in this area will grow to size 6 / 12 w/aqueduct quickly.<br />

<br />
wouldn't it be advantageous to have both the dyes and the cattle within the city's first radius?</div></div><hr />
