Welcome to the famous &quot;Jade Pub&quot; in Fanatica!<br />

This Pub has one of the most Oldest Recipes that has been passed down from Generation to Generation from the Jade Family.<br />
<br />
It all started when Ceaser Jade made up a Drink that pleased his Royal Court. Using the Finest yeasts and Herbs and Spices. Came up of what is now the Jade Beer<br />
<br />
Soon Ceaser Jade mixed and matched several different Herbs and Spices to create more Drinks.<br />
<br />
Now, Mara Jade and CivGeneral has decided to continue with the tridition. CivGeneral has also applied his Hobby in Alchemy to create even newer Drinks.<br />
<br />
You can also join us at the chatroom #jadepub, where all our waiters and me await you as operators to have a nice and interesting talk.<br />
Orders used in the chat should be placed as post in the forum for trackability. If we take orders in the chat, it is logged by a waiter and the log is passed to the bookkeeper for reference.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pub is a self-organized business. The waiters will work by deciding for themselves how they will run this pub. The only rules except the general pub-rules i set up are rules on how orders are placed and handled together with the FRA.<br />
<br />
Rules for Order-Handling<br />
1) the first waiter seeing a post will have to deliver it<br />
2) each waiter gives a receipt for the recipent of the order in a standardized format (see later in this mail) in the pub-thread<br />
3) the waiters can organize for themselves how they work together to optimize the service for our clients<br />
<br />
conslusion: main point is that orders and receipts have to be logged in any way and that the bookkeeper must be noticed of where to find them if not in the pub-thread.<br />
<br />
Format of Receipt:<br />
The Receipt has to have the following information:<br />
<br />
<br />
Client: [name of ordering person]<br />
Order: [list of what was ordered]<br />
Gold: [sum of gold client pays according to pricelist]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Transaction logging to FRA<br />
Shaitan collects all receipts to post them in the FRA.</div></div><hr />
