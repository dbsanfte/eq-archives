      You agree, through your use of this service, that you
      will not use this forum to post any material which is knowingly false and/or
      defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene,
      profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person's privacy,
      or otherwise violative of any law. You agree not to post any copyrighted
      material unless the copyright is owned by you or by this forum.&nbsp;</FONT>
      <DL>
       <B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Use descriptive subject lines &amp;
       research your post.</FONT></B>
      
      <br><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">This reduces the chances of
       double-posting and it also makes it easier for people to see what they do/don't want to read. Also, scan the subjects of the last several days'
      posts to make sure you aren't duplicating
      posts.&nbsp;</FONT>
      
       <p><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Keep the focus.</FONT></B>
      
      <br><font size="2" face="Verdana">Each forum has a focus on a certain
       topic. Questions outside the scope of a certain forum will either be
       moved to the appropriate forum, closed, or simply be deleted. Please post your
       topic in the most appropriate forum.&nbsp;</font></p>
       <P><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zero tolerance on piracy.</font></b><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
       Posting links to warez sites and program cracks are not allowed on the forum. Anyone found guilty of participating in piracy activity 
       on
       the forum will be punished.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Spam is not tolerated.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Spam is considered posting topics or messages on our forums that contain no point,
      relevance, or contain subject matter that doesn't directly allow other
      member participation. Topics directed to a particular user, posting
      several times consecutively as an appendage to ONE post, and posts in
      threads that have NOTHING to do with the subject matter are all considered
      spam and will be deleted on sight. Contributing to/or intentionally
      posting spam will not be tolerated.</FONT>
      <P>
      
        <B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Keep your files small.</FONT></B>

       <br>
      
      <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Currently we have the vB [img] tag and the
      file attachment feature
      enabled. Please keep your file sizes small - not everybody
      has a fast connection. Also remember to compress your saved games with a zip program
      before attaching them to your posts.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your file is bigger than 100 KB, you must use the
        <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=18822">Easy Upload</a>
      feature to upload the file to the file server first. DON'T split it into a
      few 100 KB files and attach them to your posts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Keep your signature brief.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      This forum has a signature feature that allows you to "sign" your posts with a customized block of text.&nbsp;
      However, large signatures that take up more than 5 lines are not permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone would agree that people are much more interested in reading your ideas than looking at your signature. It's annoying to see posts that have signatures that are much bigger than the messages in the
      post. Please keep your signature brief.&nbsp;<BR>
      </FONT>
       <P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Multiple accounts are not permitted.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Create one account, make sure you're satisfied with the name, and keep it.
      Be sure to choose your user name carefully. If you wish to change your
       user name for whatever reason, please contact <a href="mailto:thunderfall@civfanatics.com">Thunderfall</a>.&nbsp;</FONT><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><B>Postcount titles
       &amp; avatars.</B><BR>
       Each 
      poster has a title and an optional avatar image shown below his/her username.
       The default titles are Chieftain, Warlord, Prince, King, Emperor, and
       Deity. The minimum postcounts required are listed below:</FONT></P>
     
       <blockquote>
        <P><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chieftain (Minimum Posts: 0)<br>
        Warlord (Minimum Posts: 100)<br>
        Prince (Minimum Posts: 300)<br>
        King (Minimum Posts: 600)<br>
        Emperor (Minimum Posts: 1000)<br>
        Deity (Minimum Posts: 1500)</font></P>
     
       </blockquote>
       <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"> You can give yourself a custom title once you have
       30 posts. You can also
       put a picture, or avatar, under your name. There are hundreds of Civish
       avatars for you to choose from. If you have 300 or more posts, you can
       give yourself&nbsp; a custom (non-animated) avatar. The dimension limit of custom
       avatars is 65x65 pixels and size limit is 4 KB. You can change your title or avatar in
       your <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/usercp.php?s=">User
       CP</a>.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
     
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Behave as you would in a public
      location.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      This forum is no different than a public place. Behave yourself and act
      like a decent human being. If you're unable to do so, you're not welcome
      here and will be made to leave.</FONT>
       <P><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Respect the authority of moderators</font></b><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
       Public discussions of moderator actions are not allowed on the 
       forum. It is also prohibited to protest moderator actions in titles, 
       avatars, and signatures. If you don't like something that a moderator did,
       PM or email the moderator and try your best to resolve the problem or 
       difference in private. If it's not resolved or if you don't receive a 
       reply from the moderator after 24 hours, you can then PM or email

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Your rights to Freedom of Speech don't apply here.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      You are welcome to have opinions. You are welcome to question certain
      subject matter posted on these forums. You are welcome to dislike a
      certain post or disagree with it. Though we typically condone people to
      express their opinions and ideas, we have the right to delete yours if
      necessary, should we consider it abusive.&nbsp;</FONT>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Advertising and solicitations are NOT
      permitted.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Posting of advertisements, chain letters, pyramid
      schemes, and solicitations are inappropriate on this forum. You are ONLY permitted to advertise
      your site in your signature or in the "Other Civ-Related Sites" forum if
      it's a Civ site. The exception to this rule is to inform
      others of sites that provide a service to benefit them. For example,
      posting a thread regarding a new free web space provider is acceptable
      providing there's nothing in it for you except the satisfaction of helping
      your fellow members.</FONT>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Read the FAQ.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Before you start asking questions regarding the forums, read through <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/misc.php?s=&amp;action=faq"> the
      FAQ</a> first. Many times you will find the answer there. </FONT>

      policies at any time.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      It is YOUR responsibility to read announcements regarding policy changes.
      Ignorance is no excuse. Announcements are located in the first row of each forum's topic list

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Failure to follow these guidelines may
      result in removal of your posting privileges.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
