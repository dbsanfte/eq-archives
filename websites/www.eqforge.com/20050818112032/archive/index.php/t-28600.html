Took quite  a long time to make first contact, so I could not really take advantage of my early techlead :(.<br />
Lots of space around me so its gonna be quite a build up.<br />
We'll see what happens</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemming</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, so far i really like this game :)<br />
i was lucky in the beginning and popped a settler out of the first hut, the following huts also gave me 3 techs, warriors and only 2 barbs...so i had quite a tech lead in the beginning.<br />
<br />
i first met the aztechs and the russians and as i said i was about 4 techs ahead. together with my 3 or 4 cities i was easily leading the pack in the beginning. a few turns later, aztechs and russians had made contact with the other civs and, you know it, they traded like crazy. gone was my tech-lead, from now on i was lagging behind by 3-4 techs :(<br />
<br />
i concentrated on expansion...i managed to secure both sides and the bottom of the lake so i have quite enough room to grow in the future. i think this part is critical, if you leave these locations to montezuma/catharine/bismarck you have very few room to expand.<br />
<br />
as time goes by, i buy contacts to all the other civs, and behold, i am still leading scorewise by ~50 points, quite a surprise for me (this is 300 BC)...i'm building settlers like crazy, my main priority is now to grab all the land i can get. unfortunately this leaves me rather weak in terms of military and science...<br />
<br />
later i rushed to literature, and i hope i can build the GL (i was prebuilding in paris) so i can catch up techwise. so far this game is a peaceful one, but i plan to go to war as soon as i'm done with settling and building up a knight or cavalry-army...i think having / not having the GL will make the difference in my game.<br />
<br />
here are some screenies:<br />

<br />
i got the GL, got 7 techs in one turn (boy, i was lagging behind!), switched to monarchy and have now settled all the remaining space...i've set my tech rate to zero, i'm building a huge horseman-army that will later be upgraded to knights, and soon the aztecs and germans will be my first target...i only have to think about where to put my FP...a leader would be nice, too :)<br />
<br />
btw, are faceman and i the only ones who are playing? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, looks like this game will go fast, must be some of the changes in 1.29f. Some weird pricing of techs early on but then things started looking familiar again.<br />
<br />
Anyway, 1625BC and I have embassies with every civ, so I know where they are all located because I've seen their capitals. No other civ has any techs that I don't have. I'm looking pretty good on the power graph, top of the score chart and I'm just starting to really kick in some expansion and I've got a city producing veteran units.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemming</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">whew, this game is really intense with everybody on one landmass...in my game its now 1130AD, the aztecs are history and i am quite unable to stay even in the tech-race...i really dont know whether i should buy or research the techs, right now im 3-4 techs behind, not good :(<br />
<br />
although i have the biggest empire, i really dont know what to do about my lack of science, soon the AI will have cavalry and i'm far away from it...so i think conquering germany with a cavalry-blitzkrieg isn't an option any longer...<br />
<br />
maybe i should stay peaceful, build up some universities, libraries etc. and try for a cultural / diplomatic victory? well, time will tell...maybe i find my lost focus :)<br />

here is a screenshot of my world:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simplybag</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I knew I would love this game before even loading it up. France is my favourite nation, or at least among my favourites (as they often change), standard size map is what I always play and i'm a regular monarch player. My map looks about the same as the ones that were posted above and I haven't had a single war so far but i'm leading at military size and techs. My FP went to the town where Lemming's Chartes is located and now i'm really going strong at everything. The southern area started becoming productive and i'm about to conquer the aztechs. I don't think I will go on any more warmongering after that though, these standard rules make corruption too much of a hassle for faraway towns so I will attempt a peaceful victory. <br />
<br />
Oh, in my game America has been destroyed by England (in yours they're bigger), Russia and Germany. Was quite nice of them to destroy most of their towns, gave my settlers the chance to get some cities for ourselves :)<br />
<br />
Well, I don't expect much to happen in the game anymore, a short war against Monti, integrating his cities into my empire and then only building up my towns and going for either spaceship or UN victory. The starting position was just too good to make the game a competition (Maybe I shouldn't celebrate too early, maybe it won't have saltpeter, coal, rubber, oil :)) but with the current tech lead I think I would be able to conquer the world with my knights if I really needed to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greg Loader</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Early game, and I decided to chance attacking the Aztecs.  I was successful in destroying them and they appear to have re-spawned east of Russia.  <br />
<br />
When I destroyed their city, all of their troops on the field dissappeared!!!(a la Civ2)  Is this a change with 1.29, or have I just not noticed this before.<br />

hehe, thats funny...i have built my FP in...Chartres :) gave me an important boost in my war with the aztecs...<br />

<br />
with saltpeter you dont need to worry...if u conquer the aztec land, there will be a lot of saltpeter, unfortunately in the french homeland there's none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simplybag</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good, then I did the right thing by conquering them (task done now) :) I got my GA by building Smith's and i'm now boosting through the middle ages. I got a GL in the war with aztechs and I used it to rush build Leonardo's. That's another change I just noticed in 1.29 (maybe it was introduced before but I only realised it now): GLs now always have a movement rate of 3, instead of the movement rate of the unit that triggered it. <br />
<br />
I should have Cavalry quite soon, techs only take 4 rounds during the GA at the moment, well, maybe Germany would be a nice enemy, I'm quite undecided on that issue :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frankenchrist</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i beat the aztecs and the russians only to have both of them regenerate.  A wierd thing just happened in my game.  There was a barbarian uprising near one of my cities, but the next turn there appeared to be uprising's in 4 seperate places, each with a stack of 15 barb horseman.  It will be safe to say i will lose all my gold next turn.  That will set me back a bit, but it is still early (270 BC).  I wonder if this happened to anyone else?  Hopefully i can get enough settlers to build cities in the old aztec/russian territory and split the continent in half, which i think would be very advantageous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ah, the respawning :) i was very lucky with that...before taking the last aztec city, i made peace with them and demanded everything they got including a city i havent even on the screen yet...it turned out, that it was on a small island in the middle of nowhere :) so i was quite happy to take it, because after conquering the last aztec city in their homeland they were gone for good as there was no space left for a respawn ;)<br />
<br />
about the barbs: i also had a massive uprising, i think it was also in 250BC or so...they appeared at three cities...i traded all my gold before they attacked so they &quot;only&quot; stopped my production and reduced those cities to size 1 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gargouille</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First contact near an Aztec City,  then American / Russian Scouts from East and all the others Civs before 1100BC.<br />
The Iron on sight is at a fair distance on the other side of the Big Lake.  The weak Aztecs have Iron and are the only Civ in reach of that precious Iron.<br />
<br />
Then Restless Barbarians in 530BC,  2 Hordes of 16 Crazy Horsemen by-passed 2 Elite Warriors and headed towards a City (I hate them).  I spent my Gold buying Techs (including Monotheism) and German Embassy.  The following turn the Barbs  ransacked the City for 1 Gold each.<br />
<br />
In 450BC, I am researching Republic at 40 turns (19 left).  I have not yet reached  the Iron and the Aztecs just built a City nearby.  The civilized map is revealed.<br />
5 Civs at 200 points and Russia/Rome/Aztec near 160 points.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simplybag</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, i'm finished. As expected there were no real problems in the game. I invented steam power sometime in the 13th century and when my two mainlands were completely connected I set my workers to automatic movement. They kept running into Russian <br />
territory and that annoyed me as it slowed them down of course. So I decided to visit Catherine with my cavalry. Russia was no longer after just 3 rounds (I could attack from 2 sides :) of war. <br />
Later on that turned out to be a wise decision. There was no oil at all in my &quot;old&quot; territory, but 3 in the Russian territory <br />
so I was pretty lucky to decide that way :) <br />
<br />
Since my GA in the middle ages no invention has taken me longer than 4 turns, so I was just attempting a quick and peaceful victory. I'm not the kind of player who enjoys checking out some tool to see how many more tiles I can own before I get domination victory and milking the game isn't enjoyable either (I do like wars, but didn't want to start any because it would have slowed down my research). The only &quot;milking&quot; bit was in the last 3 turns when I put research to 0% and luxury to 60% to get a few more points for happy citizens :)<br />
UN victory seemed a bit risky to me, Germany-Iroquois-Rome had MPPs with each other and I was allied to England. Could have turned out to be a 2-3 result against me. <br />
<br />
That's it, spaceship victory in 1788. <br />
GOTM10 was just the other way around than GOTM9 was: in GOTM10 I expected it a very funny game due the great starting position, nice civ and good map size. The start kept my hopes up but then later in the game it got too boring because there was nothing to do. in GOTM9 I first thought it was unwinable for me, so far behind in tech etc, but in the end I still managed to achieve a victory and the game was undecided until the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kb2tvl</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey guys.  I did similar but a few things different than what was mentioned.  First, i started the game and while expanding, got owned by all the civs. =(  So I restarted and placed my cities a bit differently.  About where brest is located, i placed my fp.  I also positined my other cities to the edges of the land mass.  This allowed max future expansion.  It took 19 turns to build the fp.<br />
<br />
My original borders kept to the inside of the lake with the exception of the southern half.  I made beelines to the insence, silk, iron, and second spawn of horses.  In that region, I built my cities.<br />
<br />
The key difference between the first game and my second was building a few graneries and temples the second game.  In both cases I had barb uprising and rushed troops to aid my beleagured cities.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, I took out the aztecs and obtained the pyrimids.  This really helped save per turn cash.  At this time, I started to build out these cities and look for mpp's.  Unfortunatly, the germans attacked and I called in help from other nations and the germans asked for peace after destroying a few of his minor cities.  Up to this time, no civ wanted to attack my musketeers...  I had a difficult time hitting my ga.  I was producing cav and still did not have a ga...  My tech was lagging but the where my units were obselete.   The civ was making riflemen where I was about 5 turns from getting nationalism.<br />
<br />
At this point, I obtained mpp's with germany and america.  I then declared war on the russians.  They dropped so fast that I had about 8 turns left on my mpp's.  So, I declared war on the Iroquois.  They currently have 1 city on an island and one that the germans did not take out yet.  I made peace and garrisoned my new cities.<br />
<br />
During my garrisoning, a city flipped and I will leave it for someone else to take out.<br />
<br />
At this point, i have steam power and about 4 turns from industrilization.  My civ is in monarchy and I dont plan on changing... except maybe to communist but i doubt I will.<br />
<br />
My next goal will be to obtain mpp's with all nations and get railroads/factories at my major cities.  This will be a long process but once done, I will look at taking out the gemans.... Unfortuantly, they will have panzers by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phaedrus</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my game the Americans are very aggressive.  I've already had two wars with them.  I reduced the Aztecs to rubble using my mighty army of arrogant Musketeers.  Great rendition of the snotty French laugh.  I got the GA with my first Musketeer victory and used the period to build a huge army of Musketeers and Knights.  They really work well together as an army.  I'm currently second behind the Americans who took out the Russians early.  I'm going to &quot;spend&quot; my army hurting the Americans as much as I can before I chill out and wait for tanks.  Great game so far.  Thanks Matrix.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirinus</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Constantly fighting massive barbarian uprisings, I spread around the northern side of the big lake. Great terrain for settling there.  In the beginning I mainly concentrated on expansion, building as much settlers as i could.<br />
Just in time to secure the iron source I moved to the south- western side of the lake and started building swordmen immediately, since the Germans unexpectedly declared war on me. When the Russians joined the Germans, it seemed necessary to sign an alliance with the Aztecs and the Romans.<br />
Well, with the help of my horse- and swordmen i conquered two small german cities and they signed a peace- treaty, giving me one more minor city.<br />
Meanwhile I had built the GL and immediately received 4 techs, quite a blessing at this point of time, since monarchy was among them and I could finally switch.<br />
The game went on mas o menos unspectular, rushing my infrastructure and culture, fightin the weak Russians for a short time and then turning to Monty, who didnt even manage to connect his cities. <br />
Npoleon and Richelieu gave me Sun- Tzus and FP.<br />
I bulit the FP in the middle of nowhere, in a minor aztec town, quite a distance south of the lake. It will be the center of my new territories, but thats still some campaigns from now.....<br />
My overall position is dominating, i have 1900 gold in my tresury and entered GA 5 turns ago. The strong opponents are America, that has attacked me several times by now, and the Iroquis.<br />
The Romans, Germans and British are quite weak, but they keep up in the tech race, which I have now entered with full power.<br />
Have to see, if I am going to be fast enough, when GA ends...<br />
 <br />
Nice map, i enjoy playing</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, the americans are really going nuts in this game...they waged two senseless wars with me, they crossed the entire russian land just to reach my border cities...i signed a few mpps so abe was shooting his own leg, oh well :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemming</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">another update from my game:<br />
<br />
its now 1832 AD, the french are a now a huge civilization, i already had the opportunity to win this game by UN-vote but they are all furious at me, so i didnt vote...i will try a domination victory i think or maybe im milking the game, but i think england or america will build a spaceship first...well, here are the details:<br />
<br />
after finishing the aztecs i decided to go right after the germans with my knight-army. to my surprise i had no problems at all, the germans were very weak with mainly spearmen as their defenders. soon they joined the aztecs :D<br />
i was still lagging behind tech-wise although the germans traded just a few techs to me, but now i was building libraries/universities like a madman...i really wanted to be the first to have steam power and industrialization. <br />
<br />
so the time after the german war was a peaceful one, lots of building and regenerating from the wars, switching to democracy and building sistine chapel. my next target should be the romans, i planned to attack them as soon as i got cavalry. unfortunately the AI players were still ahead in the tech race, so they all had riflemen at the time i discovered military tradition. it took quite some time to build up/upgrade my cav-army and when i was ready to attack, the roman cities were defended by infantry, OUCH :( so what could i do? i built lots of artillery and this combination slowly took down the roman cities. with the help of the english, caesar was finally history with me grabbing the most of his cities (btw, as u can see in the screenshot, england grabbed neapolis, which is by now surrounded by my empire, but still it won't flip to me :( so this looks rather strange to me...)<br />
<br />
another time of peace followed, finally i got the tech-lead and was first to build a tank-army. i decided to go after the iroquois next, again with the help of elizabeth (she was a nice slave to me, kicking my enemies' butt and i took all the cities :D) and this is where i stand now...im in the middle of the iroquois war, i took over most of his cities and soon he will be gone...i will then still need a few cities for domination but as i said, maybe im going for spaceship or milking the game, time will tell ;)<br />
<br />
all in all, i really like this game...heres a shot of my world:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simplybag</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I always find it funny how different the AIs turn out to be in different games :) In my game the Americans were the first to be destroyed and England was the only really competitive civ (offering more than world map and a few gold for top techs). So far the only thing that seems to be equal in all games I've heard about are the weak atzechs, in my game they only had 5 cities in their mainland and 2 colonies (in the Russian territory). Although their starting position wasn't that bad and they could easily have gone NW and settle there. The civs who started in the south had no effect to the game at all, they just were small and quite peaceful (apart from Germany who fought America in the beginning) and they seemed to be rather unimportant in all games as of yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pelman</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game is progressing quite smoothly. I am in 1560 and Germany has been recently taken out of the picture. They made the foolish choice of attacking me. I then made the choice of attacking back, forgetting that they had a MPP with England. At that time they were the only two nations with an MPP. I made alliances with everyone but America to destroy Germany. I made an alliance with America to destroy England. This meant that Lincoln would soon renege on his Alliance with Bismark to destroy Cathy. The upshot of all this was that the whole world was against England and Germany, and everyone thought that I was wonderful. Germany had been the number one superpower <br />
Anyway. I got my GA by completing the Hanging Gardens in my town where Lemming built Cherbourg. With this production boost, I completed Sun Tzu's. I actually own every Wonder except The Great Wall (Aztecs), Sistine Chapel (America), and Copernicus (Built by England - captured by the Iroquois).<br />
I just finished Evolution and I am now 15 turns from Hoover Dam.<br />
I built my FP in Lemming's Strausbourg. I am grabbing up all the territory in old Germany, and I am preparing to annhilate the Aztecs. They are pretty wimpy. Nine towns. I will send over a couple of Cavalry to their Island dwelling, and then I will finish them in a few turns.<br />
Ahhh. It is nice to be in the driver's seat with all the children safely strapped into their carseats. <br />

Germany was crushed many years ago, and only have two cities on the small southern island. They'll go soon. The Iroqois had a large empire, but attacked me, and i got them on the wrong end of a world war...hehehe....they're fairly weak now, and after the romans go, so will they.....and then i'll be left with just the amercians and english...but i think i'll leave them be and shoot for a peaceful win......or will i? hahah....who knows</div></div><hr />

after beating the iroquois, it was just me, lizzy and abe. i wanted to take a break from all the fighting, let time go by and wait for a cultural or histographic win, speak i wanted to milk this game...well, just out of curiousity i spied on the americans and i was shocked to see that they had already completed 6 parts of their spaceship and were currently building 3. OUCH! :(<br />
<br />
i really didnt expect that, abe was the smallest of us three, and lizzy didnt have a single part of the spaceship...to my surprise  the americans were also 1,2 techs in front of me, i guess i'm a really bad researcher :o<br />
<br />
well, what could i do? starting a war was not an option for me, they had about 100 mech.infs and i was lacking the necessary offensive power...so all i could do was to overtake them in the space race, although i was very skeptical about my success, because i hadn't built a single component :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
i switched some of my wonder-building-cities to SS-components, after 3 turns i had 6,7 components so i was regaining hope...unfortunately abe had completed now 9(!) and he just needed laser-technology to build the last component. i was also researching laser and i managed to get it 2 turns before america...i was still building on the exterior casing in paris and with a lot of micromanagement i beat abe by ONE SINGLE TURN...OMG, and this after hundreds of played rounds...i never felt so lucky about a victory, i really didnt expect to win in the end, although i was always the biggest and strongest throughout the game...another funny thing: england and america signed a MPP just before i finished the spaceship...england attacked during my final turn, so they really wanted to stop me :) but it was too late...now i'm sitting on alpha centauri and laugh about them :D<br />
<br />
well, my score wasnt that good, but i can say i really dont care at all, this was one of the most entertaining and thrilling games i ever played :D<br />
<br />
over and out...</div></div><hr />

 For NightTime; If you want good stuff from goody huts, don't pick them up with troops, wait for your city radius to open them, this gives you better goodies- I miss not being an expansionist civ, I always have trouble with barbarians early on, cos I don't usualy build many military units till Iron working (sometimes its nice to have archers cos they can upgrade to longbows later, and with all that shooting barbarians, they get to be elite prety quick- not that I got a great leader till the 1500s (cavalry, I love how I got to name the unit- sweet! Napoleons guard formed the first unit of a new cavalry army-they can't be upgraded so, in to the amy).<br />
<br />
With being a Industrious civ, I found that I was able to build roads faster than I could build setlers :) I soon had a running track circling the &quot;Big lake&quot; but then in order to trade any of my luxury haul, I had to build roads through the Aztec and russian territory- so the two civs that should have been a piece of cake were actualy much better than the Iroquois, cos I built all thier infrastructure for them!- and as the final straw, when I had completed my roads, the A.I. didn't want any of my luxuries, not even worth a world map/GPT arangement, only &quot;sorry no deal at the moment&quot;- mainly cos they were all angry at me for building their roads :(  <br />
<br />
Later when I made them happy by killing the Aztecs every one wanted my Luxuries, and tech trading- wow! I traded mass production to the germans, Americans and English for a total of 300 gold per turn- for twenty turns I was able to set my reserach to 100%, just from one tech trade. Same later for refining.</div></div><hr />

Instead of expanding for as long as I could, I only built 11 cities, and spaced them so that there would be little (and usually no) over-lapping. I could have gotten another 5-6 cities built, but decided to instead concentrate on building my cities up to prepare for a middle ages war. It's been all good so far, and I'm poised to get a domination victory as soon as tanks come online. The only problem, and it's a slight one, is that I created a bit of a monster in the process of taking England out. I took the English cities on the Island to the West of their mainland, and then conquered their civ (except for 1 city), but in the process I gave the Americans a lot of room to expand (because I only kept a few of the cities). The Americans also started a war with the Russians at about the same time, and conquered over half of their territory, and captures some cities from another civ (I forget which offhand). Ahh well, the bigger they are... . . :)</div></div><hr />

#1 Flexible use of defence forces---&gt; if you are being attacked from the north, its no use having armies of riflemen in your southern cities while your northern spearmen armies are being crushed under foot. (perhaps they are carrying out &quot;anti partisan&quot; duties- what the republican troops did for most of the spanish civilwar). <br />
#2 Upgrade old units---&gt;Frequently I attack an A.I. city, bombard with several artillery- kill the top defender; an elite infantry or rifleman, and discover that the only other defenders are spearmen or pikemen, or even horsemen! there are potentialy four or five good defenders in that city, but they are all hoplessly out of date- it doesn't cosst that much to upgrade, why is the A.I so reluctant to do it?<br />
#3 defend resources---&gt;don't have to explain that one.<br />
#4 regroup for attacks and concentrate on one target---&gt;in the middle ages the germans threw enough knights and pike men at me to kill my civ three times over (I only had five knights, a swordsman and six pikemen to defend my whole nation, due to a bad war against the aztecs) but they didn't use it all in one go, or in one location- I was attacked by two knights each turn for 12 turns, each at different cities (all well-defended by city walls) while thier pike men wondered stupidly in to my territory attepting to pillage my wine!<br />
<br />
I have to say, that when the A.I was being my ally that they behaved very cunningly indeed, displaying all the above traits to steal my rightfull victories and after waiting for me to reduce the Iroquios to a pitifull state they jumped in and killed off the survivors-leaving me with no reward for my butchery (apart from a greatleader).<br />
How is it that an A.I. can fight so well as my Allies, but so badly as my opponent? I guess its cos they are fighting another A.I.</div></div><hr />

No one else has industrialization yet.  I have all advancements in all of my cities (factories etc.) and have all wonders from the middle ages on (captured Shakespeare's Theater, Copernicus' Observitory, and Sun Tzu's, and built ALL the rest(haven't discovered Fusion yet).  Aztecs and Russians are long gone (with my cities in their place).  I've reduced the Americans, English, Romans, and Iroquois to 3-5 cities each.  Only the Germans have survived intact and my modern armor are stacked in Leipzig waiting to take out their legionaries.  All the rest of the map is the glorious French.  I could wipe everyone else off the map within another 6 turns, since I've eliminated all enemy cities except for a thin rim, and my entire empire is railroaded.  I got my first leader late, just a few turns ago, in spite of having Sun Tzu's and wiping out most of the other civs before this.  I'm very close to achieving a domination victory.  Which I could do, or I could milk the game for another 500 years or so.  Not interested in milking it forever.  The game's essentially over.

I guess it depends on if you actually want to win or not. Your map is pretty similar to mine at 700AD although the Americans did not take out the English on the main continent and I don't have modern armor yet. I still think I'll finish off the game even though I have control, almost every game you win ends up with a mop up at the end, one way or the other.<br />

It was a really nice game. I discovered the Aztecs really quick and developed my country in their direction and blocked them away from the lake. I managed to build the great library and was so able to keep up with the tech. I also managed to get Sun Tzu's and Leonardos Workshop. From there on it was easy. I destroyed the Aztecs, the Germans and the Romans. I planed to let it go easy from there but my spy was catched two times by the Iroques and they don't took it well. So I was knee deep in a war I didn't want. The Iroques were on my level so I had a hard time with them. I draged the others in the war and tried to get out ;-) <br />
I had the UN but I didn't start an election (I was not sure I would win:lol: ) So I kept building the space ship and it started 1894!<br />
By the way. I'm very happy I bought a new PC. The game is now much quicker now. I don't have to wait after each turn and I can even speed it up by pressing shift. <br />
Have fun playing the game! :cool: <br />

The lack of rivers is tough to deal with, as only 3 out of my 10 cities so far can irrigate.  I have figured that this is going to have to be an early warmonger game in order to take over some strategic resources.  This is my second chance at regent, and the first one was much easier.  Maybe the 1.29 patch has something to do with it.  however, I don't plan on losing, as I usually start slow.</div></div><hr />

How did you do it that quickly?  You always seem to have one of the top scores.  What's your strategy?  How do you start your game, first 30 turns or so?<br />
<br />
Admittedly, I warmongered late in the game when I developed industrialization and realized I had no coal, but there was some just over the border in Iroquois land.  Since I was in Democracy, I went ahead and started a war with 3 nations at once planning on about a 6-7 turn war, in order to avoid dragging out war with different civs at different times.  I also was able to gain the last 2 luxuries I needed.  I didn't really plan on warmongering.  I was thinking about space ship or diplo victory (all the civs *used* to like me) until I hit industrialization and realized I couldn't lay down railroad tracks because of no coal.  It wasn't a planned war, although it went okay (if I had planned it, I would have built my FP further east).<br />
<br />
The luxury layout in the game was great.  I was able to get 5 luxuries before fighting anyone, and so I was able to build libraries right off the bat without worrying about temples and happiness.  I like to warmonger late, once I have an imposing tech lead, and can sweep through vast territory quickly with little resistance.  Tech lead=military superiority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
Well I probably do different build sequences than most. :)<br />
<br />
I usually do something like scout/warrior,scout/warrior, scout warrior, granary/settler. Search the territory and find other civs and good building sites. <br />
<br />
Actual building queue depends on the civ and if you can build a granary, it also depends on the exact terrain that you have, like cattle or haystacks. But after that it is settler, settler, settler ....; my new cities build scouts/warrior, scout/warrior, worker, worker,worker; scout/warrior. I build alot more workers than most. I use the workers to build roads back to the capitol and then join them to the capitol and make improvements like mines. When my worker production is greater than my need at the capitol then I start building settlers in my next best city also and send workers their way. Usually after 5 or 6 cities are built I pick one that I will use for military use.<br />
<br />
Building on good building sites is probably the most important thing you can do. If you try to build a city every 5 squares or so there is no over lap etc., you generally build on sites that are less than great. It takes a mix and each map is different, I try and build for the terrain.<br />
<br />
Of, course you also have to shift gears once in awhile, you need other improvements, but things like how many luxuries you have or how big a city is governs that and the type of government that you use.<br />
<br />
Usually, I have trouble deciding what to research first. Not with the French though, it's writing and if it takes you 40 turns to get it, that can work out just right many times. Then, you have enough cash for embassies and are able to buy some techs for good prices. That's just what I did, early on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmarcl</div><div class="date">Aug 04, 2002, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this was my first GOTM. not to mention my first time playing above warlord (well, my second.  On my first time doing it, I got my butt kicked so bad that I stuck with warlord from then on.)  Surprisingly (at least to me), I did quite well.  I didn't quite manage to settle around the lake, but managed to keep ahead by one or two techs throughout the entire game.  By selling to other civs (generally the Americans and English), I was able to keep my science at 80 or 90 % the entire game.<br />
<br />
I only managed a few wonders-the Pyramids, Leo's Workshop and the Great Lighthouse.  Also, by keeping tight with the other nations, I was able to call on all of them to help me defend against the Aztecs in the late Middle Ages (I lost one city, retook it, lost it again, but before I could take it back, the Americans took it from the Aztecs.  I didn't retake it until much later when it culture flipped.<br />
<br />
My second war was in the late Industrial Era, after I had discovered Motorized Transportation.  The only oil closest to me was owned by the Germans-who had an MPP with the English (the second most powerful civ) and the Russians (number three).  I managed to secure an MPP with the Americans (the most powerful civ) and with the other two.  When I had about 30 tanks (I traded oil with the Americans) ready, I tried to place a spy in Berlin, and was fortunate enough to have them declare war on me.<br />
<br />
The war went incredibly well-I took two cities with oil, and ended up in the number one slot for military might.  I also captured five several other cities before I stopped fighting.<br />
<br />
I managed to win a Space Race victory in 1818 AD, but a fairly good margin (America and England, my two main rivals were still two techs behind me-techs which I avoided selling to them).  <br />
<br />
As I said, I feel I did surprisingly well (though not as well as most vetrans, I'm sure).  More than likely I won't play on anything less than Regent any longer. :D <br />

<br />
Lots of babrbarians - never got settlers but a few techs :) And lots of dispersal gold.<br />
<br />
By about 500BC I'd claimed almost all the land round the inland sea = one Aztec settler made it to the very end of the sea. I was tempted to leave them there, see what kind of nacy they might build ;)<br />
<br />
Nasty scare in 370BC - horseman uprising in the little tundra area. My valiant spearman held about 10 of them off, and the other 16 got polished off a turn or two later. (He got to elite, but died of course) :(<br />
<br />
By 10BC I was first in power, score and culture. With the Hanging Gardens and Colossus the French GA started in 50AD, gave me a good run up to the middle ages, although I missed Sun Tzus and ended up with Sistine Chapel and Leo's.<br />
<br />
Spent the 9th century sending a few intrepid galleys out across the seas, in the hope of finding something interesting. One galley made it all the way over to England, then sailed back around the continent. There's no much other land!<br />
<br />
I'd love that English island, just east of the main continent - it has a beautiful iron works location, but the English cities aren't set up for it :)<br />
<br />
Killed off the Aztecs in 1100AD, got most of their lands - the Russians got nothing, despite joining in :)<br />
<br />
Trundled through to the industrial age in 1500AD, decided the time was right to wipe out the Germans before the get Panzers. War started in 1550AD, I talked the Romans into joining in, which brought in Russia via MPP. Later on the others all piled in too, but Germany was dead by that stage anyway. The Americans took one German city, I got the rest. Major war weariness started in about 1590AD, and we staggered through to 1610AD before wiping out the Germans on the little 4 tile island.<br />
<br />
Managed to get Universal Sufferage and ToE built during the war, now part way through Hoover Dam. If/when I get it those nasty coal plants will be gone. The Germans had the Pyramids, which will make the post-hospital expansion faster.<br />
<br />
Despite 2 wars now, and trying my damndest to use elites to win battles, I still have no Great Leader. The FP is 60% built by now anyway. It's not in a good place any more - over by Berlin would be better - but I'm not restarting it now!<br />

I was conquering a lot, but never got a GL from battles. Then when the aztecs, iroquis and romans were slain i decided to take out germany. In about 10 turns i got 4 Great Leaders!!!<br />
One of those constructed Leonardo, and to my great surprise that triggered the GA.... but hey the manual says it may trigger the GA for militaristic civs, which France is not.... A bug?? http://forums.tactical-ops.to/images/smilies/o_O.gif<br />
<br />
Anyway this is my map in 790 AD, i am moving my troops to the east to get washington to secure the 8th luxury. I also expect to have cavaleries soon by the time my 50-some knights are ready to spread out on the American territory. Perhaps i might even try to milk the game out, something i have not done before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FACEMAN</div><div class="date">Aug 05, 2002, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as said I had a pretty good start. Settled not all around the lake, but grapped all key ressources. Had all key wonders early on though first leader only appeared in the 500s AD. Never in this game did I trade for anything... no tech no luxury no ressource. I was ahead all the time. Took out the aztecs with knights by raze&amp;resettle, and spared my GA till the industrial age, when I triggered it with a saved up musketman. Took out Russia with Cav, crippled America and just took out Berlin. Dont remember why Rome is gone ;)... <br />
Anyway, im leading by 8-9 techs@ the start of modern ages and just thinmking about how to win this game. As Im lazy, I have close to a hundred workers set on Auto... and my turn mainly consists of pressing ENTER. :)<br />
Im too lazy to micro another war so ill build a SS I think<br />

looking forward to September....<br />

I've recovered now and am leading in techs. Cavalry vs. pikeman (Great Library works wonders) and have killed the aztecs and Germans. Should get a domination victory. <br />

<br />
I'm not sure how much 1.29 changed the game, but I am sure the AI played very differently this time. First of all, I had big problems with barbarians. They killed a couple of my workers and a settler, this sets you back pretty far early on. Also, my cities got ravaged from 3 different sets of 20 horsemen!<br />
<br />
The big difference was that early on Germany just up and declares war on me, ok normal enough, but then proceeds to sign alliances with EVERYONE ELSE! :eek: <br />
<br />
The good news, of course, is that it was very early and so the far civs are not effective in war. Anyhoo, I survived, prospered, and eventually destroyed the Aztecs and then the Russians.<br />
<br />
Then the next interesting thing, I had a huge empire with very few defensive units or even offensive units and this caused the Iroqouis to follow Germany's example (and I just wanted peace... :o ). They immediately took about 7 cities (most of my cities were undefended). Of course, with my money (saved by not paying for military), I signed alliances with everyone and destroyed the Iroqouis pretty quickly. All the while I used settlers to regain and expand my territory. Rinse and repeat with the Romans who didn't learn the lessons of the Germans and Iroquois.<br />
<br />
With a huge lead in score and culture, I sprinted ahead to tanks and finished with a domination victory in 1838.<br />
<br />
My thanks go out the the Americans and English who so helped to make this victory a great one. :love: <br />

HOO HOO!</div></div><hr />

I had been experimenting with Deity level but keep getting battered and bruised...still learning.<br />
<br />
I have read many postings in the War Academy and was prepared (overly so) for encroachment.  I had built a Maginot line along my entire southern boarder with fortifications using my best defensive units.<br />
<br />
I was able to secure MPPs and ROPs with all other civs except the Iroquois (they seemed to have a death wish which was eventually granted).  With the line of forts, the other civs would walk up and turn around, :D.  They didn't get mad, they just went away leaving me the time to exand within.  That is a tactic I learned in the forums (use worker-defensive unit combos to build roads and explore, build settlers and move three tiles to the best locations always extending as far as possible).  Of course, you have to maintain choke points.<br />
<br />
I too got lucky with the first goody hut (a settler; my jaw hit the floor).  I also got an early lead on tech and only hit a couple of barbarian encampments.  Unfortunately, I did not have communication with all civs at the time and could not coax much gold or luxuries from the Russians, Germans, and Aztecs.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, the Romans were out early (I think it was around 750 BC).  I attacked the Aztecs early to get some resources (namely salt peter).  There was salt peter east of the lake in the desert but the pesky Russians plopped a city there and it took 400 years for it to flip!  Needless to say, I could not upgrade my Pikemen for a while and was using Knights for a long time; just took more of them to take a city.<br />
<br />
I got the Diplo victory in 1922, reloaded and won the space race in 1948.  Those rival civs will pay a lot for tech when they get behind.  Also, I found it very easy to keep all civs Polite or Gracious just by giving them small amounts of gold; I guess they are greedy. Only took 25 to 50 gold to get them from Annoyed to Polite), and about 100 to go from Polite to Gracious.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this was my first GOTM and it was good fun.  I think I have a better understanding of trade and diplomacy.  It seems critical (and maybe this is obvious to most) to have as many luxuries as possible.  Early trade helped me a great deal.</div></div><hr />

So from here on in when I take American or English Cities I will have to abandon tundra cities. I have the German down to one city on the tundra peninsula north of Paris, I will probably keep them there to the end. I have control of a small island of to the far east of the main continent so I won't have to do an Island chase later. I have just discovered Military tradition so after a turn or two of upgrades of the forces on the American and English borders will spell a quick end to both of those Civs existence unless I keep them to the end for a diplomatic victory. I have not broken any deals or razed any cities so the diplomatic option is still open.<br />

I have engaged in a number of limited skirmishes when necessary.<br />
<br />
War 1:<br />
I started off by attacking the Russians when they tried to put a settler up by the horses on the Northwest corner of the inland sea.  I declared war, took my 2 free workers, and proceeded to get America, the Axtecs and Rome to beat up on them too.  This resulted in Russia being in the state shown in the screenie.  I ended taking 3 cities on the northern coast.<br />
<br />
War 2:<br />
I decided that the Aztecs had some luxuries that I needed, and I wanted to complete my ownership of the south end of the lake.  I declared war, took their capital (which had built the pyramids) and 2 of their outlying cities, and then took some gold per turn.  I got the Romans, Iroquois and Americans in on the action.  Aztecs are no longer a threat to my domination.<br />
<br />
War 3:<br />
England and America were beating me to all the techs, and had about a 4 tech lead.  They were also stringing the Romans along.  I decided it was time to take the Americans down a notch, espescially when I saw that their city close to me (Cincinnati) was a potential site for Iron Works.  As soon as I noticed this after researching Steam Power, I took about 20 cavalry and blazed through 3 of their cities.  They quickly sued for peace, and gave me lots of money.<br />
<br />
I am looking forwars to Cincinnati being a great productive city, since I am building the FP in Tenochtitlan which is one city to the west of it.<br />
<br />
I now have a commanding lead in points, and finally have the lead in tech.  (Feels great to get Lizzy and Abe to cough up 30+ gold per turn for my science know-how)<br />
<br />
I've noticed others having the game wrapped up much earlier than I have here, but I have been having fun using diplomacy when fighting all my wars.</div></div><hr />

Despite 2 wars now, and trying my damndest to use elites to win battles, I still have no Great Leader. The FP is 60% built by now anyway. It's not in a good place any more - over by Berlin would be better - but I'm not restarting it now!<br />
<br />
Who do I kill next? <br />
<br />
Well, I did decide to move the FP build after all. It was going to be across the inland sea from paris, and with Germany added to my domains they were both in the same part of the country. Since it was only building at 2 shields per turn, I decided to convert it (to a marketplace, I think) and start again in Berlin.<br />
<br />
I had Berlin grow to size 12, while building cathedral, marketplace, factory - all rushed at 100s of gold. I had Hoover Dam too, so that gave me a pretty high potential. Then I mined all the grassland around Berlin to get all 12 citizens producing max shields - got it up to 4 shields per turn. Still 50 turns but better than 200.<br />
<br />
The I had to decide whther to do the communism thing to speed it up, or try another war and pray for leaders. Since going into and out of commie would cost 12 turns, I decided on war.<br />
<br />
America and Russia had MPP, as did England and iroquois. So that rather made Rome the obvious target! I got two of the others in alliances, to try to drag everyone into the war. <br />
<br />
We attacked in 1695, and in 1705 our first great leader, Napoleon, led his Cavalry of the Guard to victory, capturing rome itself. By his magnificent example, he spurred the German people to complete the Forbidden palace in record time. (I reckoned I needed the FP more than anything else).<br />
<br />
In 1715, the Curassiers Royale captured Pompeii, throwing up the hero Richelieu. He quickly withdrew to Rome, where he formed the Cavalry of the Guard into a great cavalry army, which swept south, capturing Hispalis.<br />
<br />
As word of these deeds sweeps France, our soldiers become bolder and our organisation notes their great examples (i.e. Heroic Epic and Military Academy will be built next turn or two).<br />
<br />
The Romans are now reduced to one city; the Americans stand between it and our armies, so we may be denied the final assault.<br />
<br />
I think the Americans have one Roman city (and one German) and the Iroquois one Roman city. Other than that the spoils of war have gone to the French.<br />
<br />
Once the Romans are dead there will be a period of consolidation - already we hear talk that wondrous new weapons lie only just in the future. With these &quot;land ironclads&quot; the French armies will sweep the world clean of unbelievers. Especially the Russians, who twice now have failed to join in wars despite having MPPs with warring states. catherine is clearly not one who keeps her word.<br />
<br />
This is fun. I love being able to name the elites. :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">falsfire</div><div class="date">Aug 06, 2002, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, as this is my first Game of the Month that I'll have enough time to finish, I thought I'd post my experiences with this game so far. I starting settling around the north side of the great lake, and also setup a couple cities southward; but as soon as I saw the iron round the other side of the lake I made a beeline for it and planted a city there.<br />
<br />
As soon as I met the Aztecs and the American/Russian scouts, I set science to 0% and proceeded to merely buy technology rather than trying to keep up.<br />
<br />
The Aztecs were my first target, as they were puny, weak, in my way, and their Jag's had pissed me off in ancient times by constantly popping goody huts and raiding barb villages just before I got there. I hit them with about 5 knights, that war only took 4 turns :)<br />
<br />
Just as I was consolidating my newfound lands in the former Aztec empire, the foolish Germans attacked one of my southern Aztec towns (I *hate*, I mean REALLY hate, how the AI always knows precisely how many defenders and what types ALL your cities have, even centuries before espionage...so they always know which city to attack). Anyhow, I made military alliances with everyone else vs. the Germans, and within about 15 turns they were finished. Still no G.L. Oh, and in the wonder race I was losing badly. I'd only made one wonder, the Pyramids, merely b/c the English finished the GL 2 turns before I would've, and I switched it to the Pyramids.<br />
<br />
Just as I'd finished putting the horseshoes on my 5th Cavalry unit, the idiotic yankees attacked one of my frontier towns with 8 knights. Yup, that was their entire attack force. Again, military alliances with everyone else against them. I was in Democracy by this time, so I crossed my fingers the war would be over relatively quickly. I never sign peace when I have an active military alliance with other AI's cuz they'll hate you for the rest of the game. Anyhow, that war lasted 25 turns. My democracy was on the brink of collapse from war weariness when the English finally finished off the last American town on an island. I had to stretch it out 5 extra turns like that cause the English signed peace with the Americans after about 8 turns of fighting and losing two of their towns to the yanks. I re-opened military alliance with the brits, but I'll remember that.<br />
<br />
Next target was the Russians, I again got military alliances with the remaining 3 civs (Iroquois, Brits, Romans), simply because the Russian empire was dividing my empire in two pieces. That war took 4 turns, thanks to my droves of cavalry, and the droves of Iroquois cavalry (yeesh! where'd they get all those...better watch out for them)<br />
<br />
So the way it stands now, in 1565 A.D., I'm into Modern Times researching ecology. All my advances come at 4 turns, income around 1200-2000 gold/turn thanks to selling my tech to the English and Iroquois. (The Romans are hopelessly behind...have been all game) Heading for either a diplomatic or spaceship win, diplo may work cuz the remaining three civs have all been polite or gracious towards me for the whole game. My score sits just over 2000, the next is the Iroquois at around 1100. Got the Hoover Dam, now I have 15+ cities with &gt; 75 production. Churning out tanks in 1 or 2 turns in many core cities. Dunno if I'll ever use them, but they're there in case the Iroquois attack. I control almost exactly half the continent, plus a little peninsula of land that separates the English from the Iroquois empire. Screenshots to follow when I get home tonight and edit this post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smoking mirror</div><div class="date">Aug 06, 2002, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ghaaah! I nearly lost the game!- I don't like to have too big a military, so many of the attacking units don't upgrade and just sit around costing money and I'd rather build a library than a rifleman. Any way, I was having fun seeing how small I could make my army (I had a tech lead and highest score/biggest empire and I was friendly with all my oponents) and the germans offered me a MPP. I don't usualy go in for Mpps, its always more effective to use Military alliances, but the germans were my best buddies, been good to me for many years, and gave me good return on my spare luxuries/techs and wanted to give me cash perturn for A Mpp, So I agreed.<br />
<br />
Any way a few turns later I was thinking about attacking the russians (I had all the land between the south sea and the big lake and the weak russians were acting as an anoying buffer between me and the American/english alliance- they refused to garden thier jungles so I had a 6 square wide area of mountains and jungle between me and the Allies) when suddenly the Americans declared war on the Germans! <br />
I planted a spy in the American capital (no fear of retribution if it failed- I was In a MPP and as soon as a combat occured between the Americans and germans I would have to decalre war on the Americans anyhow) and my military advisor proceeded to show me that My army was about 1/5 the size of the Americans    &quot;compared to these guys, our military is weak&quot;! <br />
I had just researched Motorized warfare (the americans had Flight and marines) so I switched all my cities producing hospitals over to producing Tanks (about 6 cities would build a tank next turn- and, very lucky this, my military academy had just finished its first army).<br />
<br />
The americans were moving all thier armed forces across my territory, trying to get to the Germans (I had given the germans motorized war, but it would be a while before they started churning out Panzers) the cavalry (about 30 units) charged ahead while the marines/infantry were having trouble crossing the russian frountier. I was still at peace but would have to declare soon, so I waited for the cavalry to get alost to my german border before askeng them to remove troops or declare war- I didn't have enough infantry to protect all my cities from partisan cavalry activity, and I could only draft one  form each city cos the Hoover dam was 6turms from completion and I needed to stay in democracy to get flight in 4 turns (later my bombers were to have great effect) unhappyness was to have a big effect in the comming war. When the Americans withdrew, All their cavalry went to the german border, while all the marines/infantry went to the russian border! I moved all my artillery, cavalry and the new tank divisions down to meet the undefended cavalry (all in one square, on grassland, unfortified) and in one turn I exterminated the american cavalry threat, turned my troops around and headed for the russian border.<br />
<br />
Its now about 16 turns later- the americans had a Mpp with the English and russians so I had a terrible time trying to keep my frontier cities, while my rail network was destroyed by american and english bombers; My luxuries are at 100% and my government is still in democracy. But my artillery and bombers are defeating any incursion across the border (the russians are now nearly gone) and with an exellent Tank army strike I captured a heavily defended American city and destroyed their entire air fleet.<br />
<br />
I am now much stronger militarily than any one else, my bombers rule the skies and my tank armies roll forward crushing all in their path- my panzer equiped allies help finish the american/british invades after Iv'e softened them up with artillery.<br />
I'm going to take a few turns of peace to get my luxuries back down and develop Mech infantry and then I'm going to try to wipe out the American/english threat- I need another great leader so I can be sure of getting the League of nations- but their time is almost up!<br />
<br />
I have realy enjoyed this game; I came back from the brink of disaster (30 cavalry would have made short work of my undefended empire) to celebrate a crushing victory! Perhaps my lesson is; rebuild your military after a war, cos a strong military in Civ III is a deterent as well as a weapon- Oh and never get in to Mpps unless you are very small an backward nation, large advanced nations don't need protection from weak nations! The germans were the weakest link in my alliance and their weakness combined with arrogance given to them by the assurance of my protection turned in to my biggest liability!</div></div><hr />

Cartouche Bee, assuming you don't go for the early domination victory (it sounds like you're planning to milk), once you take out America and England, I'd be interested to hear your best calculation of when you would have gotten a domination victory if quick domination were your priority.  I wouldn't ask publicly if a medal were involved, but if you aren't planning to go for the &quot;fastest domination&quot; medal, your performance won't give away anything about the current year to beat.<br />
<br />
Nathan <br />
<br />
Well that's kind of an interesting question, I don't think people use this thread to develop strategies so here goes.<br />
<br />
I can't calculate what the best speed should be but I certainly know it would be faster than 900AD for a number of reasons. So I would suspect some pre 800AD conquest or dominations because I'm sure that a focus on those strategies would cut more than 10 game turns off my current situation.<br />
<br />
So my reasons for not getting the fastest domination or conquest are as follows:<br />
<br />
First, I was not really warmongering, I avoided war until I was able to develop any land that I would take over. In a pure warmongering effort it is pretty much seek and destroy from the get go. Warmongering keeps the AI developing down their normal paths and weak.<br />
<br />
Second, my style was geared toward building, all my core cities are at size twelve with all viable city improvements including universities (not cathederals!; well one in Paris). I built a Forbidden Palace in a spot that would help me counter other cultures and enhance future building sites. These new core cities were supported with a fair share of the gross national product so that they would contribute toward the long term goals as soon as possible. This really cuts down on military production.<br />
<br />
Third, my discoveries of techs were geared to the long term game and not war. For instance, shortly after Gunpowder I triggered my Golden Age, about 700AD. Instead of researching to Military Tradition, I went for Economics so I could get the wonders on that path, namely, Adam Smith's and Copernicus. Caravels allowed me to send three knights in one ship over to a far island, to finish the last Iroquois city (and end that war) and gain a presence to deter the Americans and English from settling the islands too much. This decision meant that I was putting off getting Cavalry for 12 extra turns but that is 'strategy' that works toward an end result.<br />
<br />
Even though my Golden Age has just ended, 900 AD, I can research techs in 4 turns and still produce more than 500 gold per turn. I have plenty of forces and technology to combat the remaining American and English forces. Plus most of my core cities and terrain are fully developed so I am starting to develop fringe areas by rushing marketplaces and aqueducts.<br />

Somehow the AI noticed this and teamed up to kick my ass. Had to struggle through the middle ages until I finally cought up with the rest. Just in time for the great war :p <br />
<br />
Managed to make a few mpp against an allied block. This is what it looked like when the world when beserk. Nice Huh!!</div></div><hr />

The English and the Americans have just a small piece left (I am only 9 tiles from domination) but are in the final stage of the space race. Found out a really nice way to keep them accupied. <br />
<br />
They both have to make one component (SS Thrusters and Outer Casing). I check every 5 turns to monitor their progress. When they are near completion I sabotage their production. The dont dare to go to war, I am to strong and their only hope is space race victory. They are set on making that last component. Every 10 turns or so i set the production way back and having great fun about it. Just when they get their hopes up I take it away and they have to start producing all over. Could manage this till 2050 :lol: <br />
<br />
Actualy hoping for cultural victory but it won't trigger. I have a culture score about 157.000 now but still no cultural victory! A well I am still smiling every time my spy takes away about 10 or more turns of space component production.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had researched railroad first by a long way, but couldn't build railways because there was no coal in my empire, and no one else had the advance, so they couldn't see their coal to trade it with me. I eventually gave the advance to the English, but they traded the coal with someone else rather than me.<br />
<br />
I developed tanks first too, but had no oil- same problem. This time I attacked a random German city to get the oil supply by it. Rather bloody, but I got it.<br />

Now I have the tech for modern armour but I forgot to research rocketry- I cant see aluminium. Tsk. Surprisingly, everything still seems to be going OK. This difficulty level is very forgiving :)</div></div><hr />

I made contact with all of the civilizations early in the game and I have the map of the entire continent.  This will be much easier to blitz through than last months game.  I am currently ahead or just even with the AIs in technology.  I have been keeping the tech race even with all of the civs by selling and trading the techs for money.  I need the money for upgrades in the near future and to buy several horsemen to attack with.<br />
<br />
As soon as I had about 8 horseman I attacked the Aztecs.  They had about 5 cities and the war should be over soon.  I attacked in about 750 BC.  I have never gone to war this early with just horseman before.  So far it is very successful.  The nice thing is that the AI does not have much of a culture lead on me at this point.  I normally go for Iron and attack with swordsman, but the source of Iron I secured is not connected to my capital yet.  I also lost that city to the Aztecs as soon as I declared war on them.  I should have it back soon.  If everything goes as planned the Aztecs will not exist after about 5 more turns.</div></div><hr />

I think i will milk this game(for the first time) and see if i can beat CB and Sir Pleb(allthough i know thats virtually impossible ;) )<br />
I was lucky in the beginning and got a settler from the first hut. After that i rushed my military forces. On the way down to the aztec two of my forces became elite thanks to some huts(barb huts are not bad all the time) and because of that i took the aztec capitol very fast(i later found that they resettled at the english and american territory which was good because it slowed down their expansion. I found the russians soon after and managed to wipe them out before they got 3 cities. After that i had a hard time finding the place they respawned but found them on the other side of the former aztecs... they where wiped out quickly.<br />
The time was now about 2000 BC and i had got a large piece of the world so i decided to lay down my weapons and start to expand my empire. I placed some cities in strategic places to prevent the other empires to get much of the unclaimed land(i would later settle this land)<br />
From 2000 BC too 1000 AD i only expanded and researched... and builded ALOT of workers(about 170 :) )<br />
Around 950 AD i finally got military tradition to upgrade my 80 horsemen to cavalry but.... There where not a single saltpeter in my big empire(what are the odds) :( <br />
I had to take one of the german cities to get it.<br />
AFTER THAT THE BIG BLITZWAR STARTED:<br />
1000 AD: Took 1 german city to secure saltpeter<br />
1010 AD: Upgraded my horsemen.<br />
1020 AD: Moved my cavalry in position.<br />
1030 AD: Took half of the german cities<br />
1040 AD: Took the last exept for 3 cities<br />
1050 AD: Took one more city and made peace.<br />
1050 AD- 1100 AD: Moved my cavalry to the american border<br />
Around 1100 i  had railroad and i made a railroad system.<br />
1120 AD: Took all the american cities i a single turn<br />
1140 AD: Took all the english cities in a single turn(exept 2 cities on a small island).<br />
At this point i was close to domination victory and i still needed to take the romans, aztec and Iroqois. Then i surfed a bit on this homepage a found 2 wonderfull programs. The first could calculate when you will win by culture and the second calculate when you will win by domination. Thanks to these programs i could stay under the domination limit. <br />
1170 AD: Took all the romans, aztec and Iroqois cities in a single turn.(exept for a few cities in tundra areas)<br />
I decided to abandon alot of tundra, jungle, mountain cities to be able to keep the cities on grassland and still stay under the domination limit.<br />
Im now around 1600 AD and i am currently researching computers(7 turns). I earn just below 800 gold per turn and all my cities have hospitals.(half of them transit system) 90 % of them are placed on grassland :)<br />
Every tile under my control have been irrigated(last was irrigated around 1300) <br />
I have had a very big problem with pollution because of my many big cities but the transit system should reduce that alot. I am finish with expanding(35 tiles from domination :eek: )<br />
To prevent my empire to expand too tiles i cant use i had abandoned all temples in my outer cities that way i still have good control eventhough im only 35 tiles from the limit.<br />
My culturewin are calculated to 2050 and i think i will make my spaceshipwin to be in 2050 asswell as i will take the last remaining cities(3 english, 3 aztec, and 3 iroqois) in 2050 and trigger the domination victory and conquer victory.... still need the diplomacy victory :(<br />
Well looking forward to see my score :)<br />
Last i have to say to matrix that it was a very fun map to play. :)<br />
Not much of competition but then i have learned to milk a game instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurricane</div><div class="date">Aug 07, 2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a nice start with a settler from the first hut. This gave me a fast early expansion and made it possible for me to build the Pyramids early in Paris. I didn´t bother with the GL, since everybody was very slow in progressing. I was in the tech lead almost at all times, even though I sometimes had my science at only 10%.<br />
<br />
After having expanded around the lake, I attacked the weak Atztecs with a number of Horsemen and Swordsmen. It was an easy match, and they were gone about 100 AD.<br />
<br />
I switched to Republic and settled the Atzec lands. I upgraded my Horsemen to Knights and attacked the Iroquois. They still had only Spearmen and I quickly conquered them except for one city hidden behind Rome.<br />
<br />
Again I waited a while waiting for Democracy. As soon as I discovered it, I had a revolution and at the same time attacked Rome. They were an easy match, too, and gone by 820 AD (together with that last Iroquois city).<br />
<br />
It is now 820 AD and I have 1360 points. I have still had NO leaders, so my FP is still some 60 turns away. :mad: I don´t remember when I last had this difficult getting leaders. I really tried against Rome, delaying the war for at least 3 rounds just waiting for my elite Knights to get to attack, but with no luck.<br />
<br />
I will probably take out the Germans next. They are a bit bigger, but behind in tech. My main concern is war weariness (since I´ll be democratic), so I probably won´t attack them until I get the more mobile Cavalries. <br />
<br />
This is the map before the war against Rome. The year is 660 AD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beam</div><div class="date">Aug 07, 2002, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just finished by a carefully planned domination in 2050 and it was a fun game to play (apart from the milking in the end). Thanks Matrix!<br />
<br />
Started with a moderate dense citybuild (2 tiles, sometimes one) and got a settler out of a hut quite early! Soon made contact with Aztecs, Russians, Americains etc and through exchange of communications got in touch with the rest as well. When I got my first worldmap it was clear that 7 of 8 were on the same continent!<br />
<br />
After discovery of Horseback Riding I built a pile of Horsemen to take the Aztecs out. Why? They were standing in my way on their very central location. Next were the Russians, they were standing in my way as well. My Horsemen were already upgraded to Knights and they did a wonderful job because a) the Ruskies were soon gone and b) got my first Leader! Build the FP in Strasbourg, located SE of the former Aztec capital.<br />
<br />
With the Ruskies gone I had to decide who was next. The Romans were pretty weak, as were the Iroquies at that point. The Americains were the most advanced, the English highest in score. The Germans were somewhere in the middle but I wanted to beat them before they got their Panzers. Also, I had not yet developed MI to upgrade the army to Cavalry and was concerned for a though battle of Knights vs. Pikemen / Musketmen.<br />
<br />
The resources cut the deal. The English had nothing at hand to build a strong army, so they were first. Used the handy luring technique by capturing their first city and let them come. After a few turns it got quiet in my frontgarden and took the rest turn by turn. Razed just one city iirc, but kept London with Sistine and the Great Lighthouse. Didn't finish them off, just let them live on their island.<br />
<br />
At that time Cavalries became available and America apparently had no Saltpeter although they were still the most advanced. Easy choice, and a few turns later they were history, including Washington with Sun Tzu! Only razed 2 cities of them.<br />
<br />
Now it was time for Germany, next to my backdoor. These guys for some reason had not come to the idea of building anything moving more than 1 tile / turn. Nice job for the Cavalry, specially with piles of Longbowmen out in the open. Since I wanted to get Germany intact only one city was razed. The Germans had build to cities on tiny islands, good for them, it made them survice.<br />
<br />
After checking mapstat I found that a domination victory was not far away, yet I had decided to milk the game to the end. Never do that, yet in gotm it is score that counts. I had to do something about the Iroquies but to avoid early domination most of their cities had to be razed. Apart from 2: Salamance with another Juicy Wonder and Sevastopol which they had captured from me as German allies. The Iroquies were finished off apart from a city on the same island as the English.<br />
<br />
The Romans were left intact for the time being since they were my protection against the barbarians.<br />
<br />
The main threat for the domination limit now was the cultural expansion. I had not been build more than a library in over 90% of cities so cultural victory was not at hand. In that part of the game, with most action over, I even abandoned cities to stay clear of the domination limit!<br />
<br />
In the meantime London and Berlin had flipped a number of times with some other cities flipping as well. Both cities (and Salamanca) had two cavalries stationed permanently outside for the occasion and it was more a nuisance than a problem.<br />
<br />
While still dancing with the Dom. limit (and F5 and Mapstat) it became apparent around 18xx that the Romans could make it to a Spaceship lauch before 2050. So a plan was made to reduce them enough early. Developed 50 Armors against their 100+ Infantry and reduced them to their coastline in order to keep the barbarians out.<br />
<br />
After making peace the long wait began. All workers at Shift-A and every 10 turns or so a mass investment in new improvements and this for over 150 turns! Making sure that the domination limit was about 20 tiles away I prepared to build three cities in the last 2 decades and go for domination in 2050.<br />
<br />
The standard facilities in each city were barracks / granary / hydroplant (free from wonders), libraries in earlier cities, marketplace, aquadact, hospital, harbor if possible, bank, sometimes a temple. So no factories, cathedrals, mass-transits, collosea etc.<br />
<br />
The fighting part was very entertaining, the milking will have to wait for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beard Rinker</div><div class="date">Aug 07, 2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've read many posts of very early conquests and wondered how they do it so quickly.  I have never achieved a conquest victory.  In my games, by the time conquest is an option, I'm in the late industrial or modern age and a conquest would involve horrendously long turns so I opt for space ship or domination.<br />
<br />
I tend to be a builder so an early conquest goes against the grain of my style of play.<br />
<br />
From the start, my focus was building military for that first war.  I researched The Wheel first with the goal of producing as many chariots as possible then upgrading to Knights for my first war.  It didn't quite work as planned as one of my warriors accidentally discovered horseback riding from a hut.<br />
<br />
I also made a run at some early wonders with the goal of triggering an early golden age.  With the French this requires an industrious and a commercial wonder.  I got a commercial wonder but missed the industrious wonder.  I used the stored up shields from the industrious wonder to build the Great Library.  Not what I wanted but not bad for an also ran prize.  I did achieve a fairly early golden age with the discovery of Gunpowder.  I built a mustketman right away and used it in battle.<br />
<br />
Once I discovered Chivalry, I upgraded my chariots and horsemen to knights and began my glorious campaign.  I started with the Aztecs then worked my way counter-clockwise throughout the continent.  I was in a state of warfare almost continuously from this point on until I reached the domination limit around 1300.  <br />
<br />
I had switched to Republic pretty much as soon as available and stayed in it throughout.  War weariness was never got above around 25%.  Usually by the time war weariness appeared, I was just finishing my current enemy off or I had pushed the front lines back far enough, sued for peace and attacked a different civ.<br />
<br />
Ironically, researching technology was much easier than other games when my goal was an early spaceship victory.  In the late middle ages I was researching a technology every four turns with the slider at 30% or less.  By around 1300 it was clear I could easily research a tech every 4 turns for the remainder of the game.  An early spaceship victory was not in the cards this game however.  Only the Americans and English were left and they were way behind in technology.  I would get little help from them even if I gave them every technology.  At this point, the earliest possible date for a spaceship launch is 1735.<br />
<br />
After reading a few posts from this months spoiler, it's clear my conquest game still has allot of room for improvement.  One post of note is pagh80 causing both the Aztecs and Russians to respawn by 2000 BC.  Impressive.  :goodjob:<br />
<br />
At this point in my game (1295), I could achieve a domination victory in a turn or two and the earliest I could get a conquest is probably around 10 turns.  I am several techs ahead and the best defensive unit my cavalry will face are musketmen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The result of this was a One City Challenge (OCC) game that I won by 20k culture in Paris. I figured the best way to achieve no score would be to do a OCC, thus having almost no population or territory. In any case, I finished in 1902AD, with a grand total of 581 points (I'll have a report of this game up in a day or two).

An early decision was made to do as much research as possible instead of buying it. I got to make some good trades for techs i didn't have. It was interesting to watch as each civ got thier GA and pulled ahead in techs.<br />
<br />
Turned republic in 470 BC<br />
War w/ Aztecs 760 AD... English destroyed them 940 AD<br />
Still no saltpeter... bummer<br />
War w/ America 940 AD for saltpeter city<br />
GA 1000 AD after killing pikeman with musketeer<br />
Moved palace southwest of Tenochtitlan 1300 AD<br />
4 cities flip to me shortly thereafter<br />
Made peace w/ America for Atlanta (turned out to be a useless IW city as well)<br />
<br />
At this point, i decided to run the game out for a 2050 culture win. It would be my first try at milking a game. I realize that a milked game needs to start that way, but i thought i would see what i could learn from it.<br />
<br />
Germany declares war after failed attempt to plant a spy - 1465 AD<br />
Captured Bach, Sistine, Pyramids<br />
Germans destroyed by Romans ~ 1580<br />
Iroquois declare war - 1605<br />
UN built 1655<br />
England declares war 1760<br />
Russians and Romans declare war 1788<br />
Started keeping poor notes<br />
Anyway... Romans destroyed 1800... Russians shortly thereafter... Americans somewhere along the line.<br />
<br />
Prepared a tundra city for England that would never get past 2 population and surrounded it w/ modern armor. It was a toss up between her and Cathy. I decided i didn't want to look at Cathy the rest of the game. Gave it to Liz and declared war on her. Reduced her to this one city and made peace.<br />
<br />
I built all tha SS parts except the party lounge. Built SDI in 1842 and just concentrated on making my people happy. 19 future techs researched with no libraries/universities/research labs.<br />
<br />
I forested and railroaded the rest of the world. Then in 2020 i got bored and pillaged all the RR's. In 2039, i gave Liz the techs she needed to go modern so i could have a massive barbarian uprising.<br />
<br />
Finished 14 tiles short of domination. Culture win in 2050 w/ 5941 points. I thought about going for domination/conquest/culture just to see which it would have given me. Anyone know which has priority?<br />
<br />
I knew i wouldn't be a true competitor for high score, but i wanted to see if i could learn anything usefull first hand. In retrospect, if playing a milked game, the early game should have been played much different than i did it. For example, i built libraries instead of temple as a first cultural improvement. I also waited too long to get all 8 luxuries. Gems were never up for trade and i should have just taken them from the Americans when i had the chance in the first place.<br />
<br />
All and all, an interesting game (until the last part).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">falsfire</div><div class="date">Aug 08, 2002, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it's all over for me. Accidentally got a domination victory in 1680. I had been in a MPP with the Romans, just to ensure they wouldn't fight on Liz's side in the mighty France vs. England war. There were all of two turns left in the MPP when the war vs. England ended. Then Rome declared war on the Iroquois. Frickin dumba** Romans!!!<br />
<br />
I forgot about how close I was to domination limit (22 tiles needed), and took a few Iroquois cities on turn two of the war and forgot to gift them to the Romans.<br />
<br />
Ended my turn and immediately said a four-letter word. However, in the Iroquois counter-attack against one of my modern armour units, I received my first leader of the game (yeah, that's right. I got my first leader on the last turn of the game, in 1680; after fighting countless wars for control of the continent, always mopping up wounded units with elites, all the usual). To add insult to injury, the Iroquois threw everything they had at that small stack of modern armour, and killed them all, including the newborn leader, before I even knew his name.<br />
<br />
Next turn comes round, and just as I feared, as soon as all the domestic advisor nag screens go away, &quot;you have achieved a domination victory.&quot; Darn, so much for milking. Probably was too late to start milking anyways, what with the Romans &amp; Iroquois still on my continent with about 8 cities each...<br />
<br />
Oh well, on the plus side, from that war I finally got control of two tiles of land in the heart of my empire where a Roman city had sat for about 1500 years, so horribly surrounded by my culture that they only had one tile of cultural boundaries adjacent to their city. I was ready to declare war on the Romans many times just because that one darn city wouldn't flip to me so I could raze it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beam</div><div class="date">Aug 08, 2002, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Accidental domination victory is the thing to manage indeed. Mapstat combined with the Cultural Advisor is the only way to manage it although it can become labor intensive. When very close to the limit two checks per turn are required, one on the Autosave and one on an End Of Turn save to verify the result of Abandon City actions.<br />
<br />
Even razing or gifting enemy bordercities should be monitored if that gives extra tiles because of the new cultural balance.<br />
<br />
The cultural advisor helps to identify cities that are about to expand and take action if neccesary, like selling cultural improvements.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deleatur</div><div class="date">Aug 08, 2002, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First GOTM and my results certainly aren't going to wow any crowds.  I started the game by finding the Aztec and nearly lost it there.  For whatever reason I decided to try and rush kill'em (I got a few warriors from the Goodie Huts.)  The last Aztec in Technoosidksa (however it is spelled) had  one hit left and I had nothing left to throw at him.  Peace was pretty cheap to buy since he had nothing left but the barbarains ripped me to shreds afterwards.<br />
After quite sometime I rebuilt but sadly the Russians managed to plant a city on the inland sea.  I ignored it at the time since it was smack dab in the middle of a desert but imagine my surprise when saltpeeter showed up right next door to it.  Thus began the first Franco-Russian War.  A couple of Russian cities later and I took some tech from them for peace.  Then I built up a force and marched through Catherine's lands.  I got the first of my three Leaders and rushed the Forbidden Palace into Moscow.  Then my nightmares began.  I signed an MPP with Germany.  My reasoning at the time was that Germany looked damn tough (they had beat the stuffing out of the Americans in an early war) but soon I  was at war with America, England and the Iroquois.  This war took hundreds of years and netted me Atlanta (crappy city) and some Aztec city that the Iroquois had taken from Monty.  I decided on peace because it seemed like I was on the same unit tech as everybody else so Cavalry weren't going to be able to take Rifleman defended cities easily.  The damn German MPP kept dragging me into a war and now they sucked (American and English had kicked them around.)  I ended up at war with the Aztec of all people.  I finally got a chance to take Technoudijfkl but I wasn't paying attention and it culture flipped taking a small army of mine with it.  STUPID STUPID STUPID.<br />
Anyway I am now tech racing the English for the Tank.  My game is coming up on 1800 AD and I am just now reaching the top of the points and tech ladder.  My Civ gaming skills have a long way to go but I am learning quite a bit from this site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once again, I find myself in massive WW within a couple of turns of starting a war.<br />
<br />
This time I attacked the Iroquois, in 1772. By 1776, despite my taking 6 or 7 cities by then, I had WW in many cities, including Orleans! It had had 12 happy people in it before that.<br />
<br />
What frustrates the hell out of me is that there is no FEEDBACK. If a spearman kills my tank, well, I know the odds, the combat model is openly described, and if I have bad luck so be it. I know not to attack them in mountains behind rivers, and if I do anyway and my tank dies, it's my own stupid fault.<br />
<br />
But with war weariness, I have no idea what I am doing wrong. I get attacked, I suffer WW. I attack someone I get WW. I fully expect to suffer WW while at peace now. (It would make about as much sense):crazyeye:<br />
<br />
Back on-topic and off-rant...<br />
I was forced to trade flight to England for communism and go into anarchy. Since I'm going to end up a commie, I might just go for all-out war now. I'll have computers in a few turns (when I get out of anarchy) - let the death and destruction rain down.<br />
<br />
I seem to be the only one with tanks right now. So the iroquois aren't going to last long. They are down to 5 cities now, and the last one was defended by pikemen!:eek: Maybe my citizens are weary of picking pikeman parts out of my tank tracks?:):crazyeye:</div></div><hr />

In my game the Americans are very aggressive.  I've already had two wars with them.  I reduced the Aztecs to rubble using my mighty army of arrogant Musketeers.  Great rendition of the snotty French laugh.  I got the GA with my first Musketeer victory and used the period to build a huge army of Musketeers and Knights.  They really work well together as an army.  I'm currently second behind the Americans who took out the Russians early.  I'm going to &quot;spend&quot; my army hurting the Americans as much as I can before I chill out and wait for tanks.  Great game so far.  Thanks Matrix.<br />
<br />
PS I like the new right-click &quot;Wake All&quot; button. <br />
<br />
Update:<br />
<br />
So I hurt the Americans enough so that they would leave me alone for awhile.  I researched and built factories and coal plants in all my cities.  I stayed one tech ahead of everyone and sold it immediately to everyone.  I was headed straight to Motorized Transportation.  I used a strategy that had worked in another game.  I timed the completion of the Theory of Evolution for when I was two techs away from tanks.  TOE gave me the techs and a solid tech lead.  I changed all my cities to tank production, turned off my research,  pumped up the luxury rate and went to war.  I brutalized the AI who had stopped researching and never got tanks.  It had Flight so I encountered many bombers as I screamed across the continent.  It was fun watching the bombers destroy the rail network in the battle zone only to watch as my workers completely rebuild it every turn.  Had to be demoralizing.<br />
<br />
So I have over 200 tanks now.  I left a few enemy cities uncaptured so I guess I'm suppose to milk this thing now.  I think I would rather spend my time reloading from before the war and kicking ass all over again.  What fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was constantly ravaged by barbarians for 20 or 30 turns in the beginning! This was truly devastating. At one point, I was attacked by over 40 horsemen at one time! I was constantly way behind in tech, and was unable to get any great wonders beyond the ancient age, also the world was generally peaceful (so tech moved fast, no stragglers). Most of the time, if I got over 20 gold, someone would demand it. It took careful planning just to be able to establish embassies! Finally towards the end, war caused the Germans, Aztecs, and Romans to be extinguished.<br />

I have survived, and my points are an impressive 133, but I have no chance to reach 20K culture before 2050, I am at 12K in 2004 with 37 points per turn in my city. On a bright spot an Aztec city flipped to me, so I know the sad feeling of refusing her overtures. :love:</div></div><hr />

When I switch governments it will probably take about 8 turns of anarchy (I'm not sure but I know it will be longer than I want). I still need to discovery democracy but I have a plan to essentially save two turns of anarchy, by over researching democracy for 2 turns and then starting my switch of governments I will still be able to discover democracy in 4 turns total, even though while in anarchy my research will be next to zilch. Now I will still be in anarchy for a long time but at least two of those turns will still count toward my research goal of 1 tech every 4 turns, until at least Ecology.<br />

<br />
Placing the Palace and the forbidden palace in the right location is a major factor on your production capabilities.  In the current GOTM I did not get a leader early in the game so I built my forbidden palace near my capital in Paris.  This helped out in reducing my corruption, but it was not the best location for my needs.  I ended up getting a leader later on, but I used the first two for wonders I wanted (Sun Tzu and Copernicus Observatory).  Finally in about 1250 I got another leader and built a new Palace in Tlateloco (located on what was the Aztec/Russia border).  The immediate difference in corruption was amazing. <br />
<br />
Before the Palace move my total shield production/shield waste was 190/423.  After the move it was 275/346.  (These values are 1 turn apart).  My commerce /corruption before move was 559/1109; after the Palace move it was 732/909.  This is an increase in production of 30% decrease of waste by 18% increase in commerce of 24% and corruption decrease of 18%.  I got those gains simply from changing the location of my Palace.  The other neat thing that it allows me to do is to build up a new area quicker.  Paris and the surrounding cities are all fairly well developed by this time in the game so I dont need the production as much in that area.  The new area my Palace is in needs all of the main city improvements (libraries, marketplaces, etc.)  This allows me to get those without having to buy them now.  I cant wait to see what happens when I switch to Democracy now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For instance if I set my research rate to 30% and that allows me to research democracy in 4 turns, I will bump the rate up to 60%. This will allow me to produce enough beakers to research the item in 2 turns. I still have to wait 4 turns altogether to actually get the tech item but I can be in anarchy for the last 2 turns.<br />
<br />
CB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Aug 09, 2002, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CB, <br />
<br />
OK that makes sense.  Do you happen to have numbers to go along with how many beakers are required for certain techs?  or can you tell me where I can find that out.   I used to have that info for civ 2 but I have not been able to figure it out for civ 3 yet.  <br />
<br />
One of the things I still want to know is do extra beakers carry over to the next tech, with the 4 turn minimum still in place?  If so then you are not really gaining by taking the extra money when there is only one turn left.<br />
<br />
For example you have been researching Democracy at 90% and it takes a total of 4 turns to get it.  When you are at 1 turn to go you adjust the slider down to 10% and still get the tech in 1 turn plus the extra cash. Do the extra beakers that you would have generated go to the next tech, so that if you had left it at 90% you would have made it easier to get the next tech, say steam power in 5 turns vs the 6 for adjusting the slider.  <br />
<br />
I am curious about this and if you don't know the answer I will experiment with this to see what I can find out.  I want to generate a spreadsheet on the techs and try to nail down some numbers for the game in this area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't answer your question about the number of beakers required off the top of my head but I know some people have researched that info. So you will probably save some time doing a search on the subject.<br />
<br />
As far as I know the excess beakers do not carry over to the next tech, so adjusting your rate of research around is recommended to save commerce.</div></div><hr />

I believe some research indicates that the cost for a tech is a function of many variables, including # of civs, the number you know, the number who know the tech, etc. (It was in a thread a few weeks ago I think)<br />

That being the case, I can't see an easy spreadsheet method to summarise it:(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ribannah</div><div class="date">Aug 10, 2002, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do better though by adjusting the science rate as soon as you can without having it cause a delay. Not only does this give you earlier access to your 'bonus', but also if you wait you will not profit if some other civ discovers the advance and the  beaker requirement drops (and you can trade for it, too).<br />
<br />
Example: if you can make the discovery in 4 years with science percentages of 100%, 100%, 100%, 20%, you can do better by setting it at 4x80% (you do have the info that that's enough!) and still better with 20% in the FIRST year followed by 3x100%.<br />
<br />
Suppose other civs make the discovery after turn #3 and the requirement drops from 320% to say 220%. Then by doing what you do, you lose the equivalent of 80% worth of beakers (+1 appointed scientist in year 4). Even it out and you still lose 20%, but if you start low you can get by with just the lone scientist in turn 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MadScot</div><div class="date">Aug 10, 2002, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed something very odd in my game, and did a little extra digging (without doing anything banned, I just studied the map basically).<br />
<br />
In the first screenshot, you can see part of Russia (including a French city they captured in a recent war:mad: ) I've circled the iron and coal, and marked the boundaries of the Russian cities.<br />
<br />
Why have they not tried to start a city on the red dot. All their cities are metropolises (metropolii?:)) so they are using every tile they can by now anyway. So the settler would cost them 2 specialists only. And there is a bunch of grassland, plus a river, plus the IRONWORKS could be built. I'm sure a human would have a settler there in seconds!<br />
<br />
After I spotted that, I hunted for the other coal and irons. I don't have any pairs close enough, but both the English and Americans do (in the American case, there is iron under Houston). In neither case has the AI either built or relocated a city to enable the ironworks. Boston is an older city, but the English could certainly have built a decent ironworks site before committing too much to their existing cities.<br />
<br />
And that made me wonder - has anyone ever seen the AI disband and relocate a city, as humans do?<br />
<br />
edit: can only include one picture - you'll have to trust me that the others were as described. (Would have needed disbanding rather than just a new city)</div></div><hr />

It's little details like that that just show how much more could be added with little expense to improve the AI. I just love seeing examples like that, planting cities in (sweet) spots like that would be a must at deity level (any level actually but deity magnifies the clarity of the issue.).<br />

Pathetic isn't it. But I couldn't summon up the courage to go for an all out war after the last war weariness disaster. All the other civs had started on the space race route, and if I'd got stalled and stuck in anarchy they would have beat me to it. Of course, I could have nuked their capitals to disrupt the launches (that does work, i assume?) but that would have turned it into a massive slufest and I wanted to finish.<br />
<br />
Entertainingly, while trying to wipe out the Iroquois I was also attacked by the Russians. While stuck in anarchy my people decided to increase the size of my palace :crazyeye:<br />
Another interesting observation - a couple of turns before the end I captured Konigsberg from The Americans via CF. What is interesting is that they clearly knew it might happen (would happen?). I spent years chasing American &quot;peace keepers&quot; out of my territory - at the peak I had something like 20 infantry and 10 workers surrounded in my territory by a bunch of Modern Armour. After the flip I took mercy and chased them home - only for them to try it again. The attached screenshot shows the second &quot;US Peacekeepr Storage Centre&quot; - there is a bunch of workers only in the second tile. I guess their ex-Roman city was about to flip?<br />
<br />
I probably should have done a lot better - it all went well up to the 1700s then it kind of stalled. Maybe wimping out of the world war was a mistake.</div></div><hr />

As far as the GOTM goes I have finished up the easy part of the game and I am now at the domination point.  I am dancing around my culture expansion and trying to abandon cities as I can.  America is the only AI civ I have not gone to war with yet.  They are almost completly intact and are helping me out by researching old tech lines to completion for me. (communism/espionage).<br />
<br />
I am not sure if/when I will take them out.  They have some nice land that I would like to move some mountanous cities over to.  ;) But they are also acting as a balance on some of my culture. It is about 1550 or 1600 and that is a lot of milking time.  This part of the game is more challenging than I thought.  Last month I lost due to an accidental domination.  The mapstat utility is extremly helpful mainly for the city export ability.  With that I am using Excel to help me prioritize which cities need help in growth.</div></div><hr />

Yep, both the Germans and Russians made demands, and in each case when I refused, they just declared war. I managed to keep them off my back though by getting the Aztecs, Romans or Iroquois to declare war on them. Funny how that works out. In some cases the civ that I ally with ends up getting some land, whereas in others (ie Rome), they lost every city but their capital (well practically every city). Still submitted to the English when they made demands, but they paid for that in the end. hehehehe....</div></div><hr />

My first GOTM victory! The best part is I didn't think I would win. I started off slow as I cowtowed to every major power (Germans and Americans were the 2 empires) I kept building up my culture and was unfortunate to miss every major Wonder I went after by no less than 6 turns. Got Smith's trading post and spent the middle ages catching up on tech. No coal! AAAGH, the game hates me. Finally told the Germans to shove it, WAR. Luckily the Americans were winning big so I proceeded to watch every other civ try to get them. Played it smart and stayed out. Filled in the gaps of conquered cities with my settlers. Got coal, no OIL! AAAGH. Built up defenses as the Aztecs, Russians, and English fell. Germans and Iroquis finally declare peace with me. Made beeline for spaceship, only chance. Got oil. 6 turns before I get last tech I need America launches all out blitz. My citizens galantly give up lives and territory to protect my capital. Rampant unrest, don't know if I can make it. America though sows own defeat by helping me create Napoleon. Yea, turn after laser Napoleon completes last part. BLASTOFF.</div></div><hr />

Very early (pre 1000BC) I noticed that my income was suddenly very low and looking at the existing trades I saw that the germans were &quot;stealing&quot; 52 gold pr round for some luxury i got from them. I am 100% sure that I hadn't agreed to pay that amount of money in the negociations, so I had to declare war to end that. Some time later the same happened again, but this time I paid the Americans 250 gold/turn, still for a single luxury deal. This was more money than I got from 100% gold 0 % science, but since the Americans were much larger than me and I wanted to keep them as friends I didn't dare to end that deal by declaring war. So, for 20 turns I got no money and no science as I tried to minimize the penalty for not having enough gold. Major drawback in the early stage of the game...<br />
<br />
I tried later to offer more gold pr round than I had, but they wouldn't accept it, so how I got the first deals just have to be due to a bug, or?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Aug 13, 2002, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the research during anarchy worked well. I ended up in anarchy only 4 turns which was a surprise to me. After the second turn of anarchy I ended up with democracy, I did not switch governments when asked cause I was already in anarchy waiting to change governments. I then made a scientist specialist, this then let me start the research turns for the next tech. Once two turns passed and I was in democracy I just bumped my research rate up to 60% and finished the tech in 2 more turns.<br />
<br />
My game is at 1580AD now, I'm researching synthetic fibers and in 20 turns or so I will have my last two wonders completed Cure for Cancer and Longevity. All my cities with hospitals have mass transit unless they are stuck at size 13 which means there is no benefit to adding the Mass Transit. This of course raises the question as to why I would have any cities with a size of 13? Bad planning or foresight I guess. This was the earliest I ever got to this position for milking, I am currently just switching cities over to produce wealth as they finish the next item that they are currently building. I have plenty of workers sitting ready to clean any pollution and I just need to trim some of my cultural improvement so I don't trigger a premature cultural win. My score per turn is already starting to decline because all my cities are to the maximum population that they can sustain.<br />
<br />
I have just investigated the last German city. They cannot grow any further, from size 2 and they are just building caravels that they then hurl against my privateer blockade. This keeps them from producing any other improvements to the city, if that would help them.<br />
<br />
I will never even research nationalism, so I never had to draft a single citizen for war or disband them for shields.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Aug 13, 2002, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I didn't start off with the plan being total disorder, but after the first two civs respawned away from my attacks and basically teleported contacts to all the other civs  I switched to the &quot;keep everybody at war with everybody else strategy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Killed Aztecs in 2750BC with one archer, but they teleported.<br />
<br />
I got horsemen in 1600BC with the founding of tours and switched to almost exclusively building horsemen and settlers everywhere.<br />
<br />
Killed Russia in 1400BC and got Napoleon to build the FP in Moscow (yes, deliberately used the first leader for the FP.) Cathy contacted Picard and got beamed off to exile in Abe's tundra.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/minimap_1150.jpg<br />
<br />
Took until about 1150BC to make sure that all the other civs were at war with each other. This diplomacy image only shows the alliances that directly include France but a number of the civs are at war with each other independently and for no apparent reason other than their angst is boiling over. I think they would be attacking themselves if they could get away with it. I just keep poking them with pointy sticks every 4 ot 5 turns.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/diplomacy.jpg <br />
<br />
Now all I am doing is picking off their troops in the open and gathering cities that get weakened. They attack first and always lose. I attack second or kill the survivors and always win.<br />
<br />
Barb farming is giving me about 25 to 50 extra gold per turn. Most horsemen start as regulars but by the time they get to the fronts almost all are at least vets from their barb training experiences.<br />
<br />
By 450BC this is getting really ugly. Have been constantly at war with someone and almost all the other civs are constantly at war with each other. No Great Wonders have been built anywhere. Most of the civs are angry, aggressive, and stunted. Every turn has multiple popups of X makes peace with Y, Z declares war on Q, &quot;The treacherous whozits have a secret blood pact with the whatsits.&quot;. I am sort of amazed at how one dimensional the game can get once you reduce all the enemies to meth freaks and beserkers while eliminateing all possibility of diplomacy and trade.<br />
<br />
The game is starting to crash randomly now because I think its hormones are overheating. I am not sure the program is robust enough to handle cases when you have irrationally (on purpose) created conditions where everyone is furious with everyone else including you. There must be some point in the anger calculations where the system strats dividing by zero or reaching toward infinite fury because this is wierd, frustrating, and sort of interesting at the same time. I can' say for sure but I think I have overloaded the diplomacy and anger circuitry. ;) My machine is big fast and bulletproof so this is the first time I have experienced crashing problems with the game. I wonder if all the previously reported crashing problems came from similar warmongering play styles. (hmmm, very interesting.)<br />
<br />
Also discovered that you can teleport workers around the map in mass groups. Just kill off enough of the enemy towns to get right next to their capital and time it so you can jump 6 or 8 workers back into your capital city. Its OK if this movement uses all the workers' move points for the turn. Then make peace with your enemy and take everything they have tech, map and money wise. Give them all your workers in the peace treaty and this will teleport the workers from your capital to theirs. Then stab them in the back and capture the enemy capital and you get all your workers back plus the workers get to move again.<br />
<br />
This game play is so out of character with my normal style it feels like smashing crickets of the sidewalk with a hammer. Not sure if the anger overload is going to allow this to be a complete game but I'll see. If I do finish this one it will be over when knights roll around in about 20 or30 more turns.</div></div><hr />

What would have happened had you chosen to switch governments while already in anarchy? Would it have made any difference? <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Here is the history of my OCC game<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
3950 BC Founded Paris on the hill even though it cost a few turns to get the food supply going. This in fear of barb hordes; it turned out to be a great spot for production!<br />
3750 BC Warrior built, goes south. Paris starts to prebuild the Pyramids<br />
3600 BC Furs connected<br />
3450 BC Paris expands and a Settler emerges from the nearby village to immediately join the grand city :cool: <br />
2150 BC Our Warrior meets a neigbour: the Aztecs. Villages on the way have given another Settler (too late to make a big difference, but still nice) and two conscript Warriors as well as Mysticism. The Aztecs already have contacts with four other tribes<br />
so we turn our Warrior to barb hunting <br />
2110 BC The Oracle is completed, the first of 14 great wonders. We discover Writing (40 turns) and start dealing<br />
1990 BC America sells us our first slave worker, the first of an army ...<br />
1950 BC Paris builds a Temple, and we gain contact with Rome<br />
1910 BC We have a Spearman, just in time to ward off the first gang of barbarians<br />
1575 BC Germany completes the diplo screen. We are solidly in last place which will stay so until the day of our victory ....<br />
1325 BC The nearby Horses are our first strategic resource<br />
1225 BC The Great Library is ready, won't give us much tech but the culture starts building up fast now. From here on it's good barb hunting (keeping active also to hopefully prevent the hordes to appear)<br />
1150 BC Library (cut down the last forests)<br />
1125 BC 3 Workers (1 our original one) join Paris<br />
690 BC Paris, already size 12, builds The Pyramids - without ever intending to fill the foodbox<br />
570 BC Colosseum<br />
490 BC Here be the Middle Ages!<br />
390 BC France discovers The Republic and merrily changes to a new government in two turns<br />
330 BC The Great Wall is completed, there was nothing else to build<br />
130 BC Silks and Incense colonies established<br />
90 BC The Hanging Gardens, unhappiness is in the past now (100% science)<br />
30 BC Cathedral<br />
10 AD Marketplace<br />
190 AD Horses Colony established, turns out nobody needs any ...<br />
230 AD Wines Colony established, we create embassies and start including ROP's in our deals to keep them polite :D<br />
270 AD Iron colony established, we get to keep this one for a long time ...<br />
370 AD Dyes Colony established<br />
410 AD Sistine Chapel<br />
420 AD We lose the Incense Colony<br />
430 University<br />
490 AD Losing the Dyes (that was fast), from here on our army of warriors is making connections where the AI forgot so we can trade for all the resources we need<br />
520 The world trembles: England declares war on America!<br />
590 Copernicus' Observatory. Science was slowing down, this was just in time ...<br />
630 AD We lose the extra Horses, no prob<br />
730 Krasnoyarsk desperately wishes to join our empire, we refuse. Riga, Detroit and Brandenburg (several times) will also try but to no avail <br />
830 AD JS Bach's Cathedral<br />
860 AD Gems Colony in the far south :)<br />
870 AD Germany declares war on England. The Germans appear to be master warriors in this game. They take a few cities fast and then quickly make peace, only to do the same to another rival after rebuilding their army. Eventually this would cost them though, lagging in tech as nobody is eager to trade with them. Good programming here, Firaxis! :goodjob:<br />
900 AD Paris builds a Bank<br />
920 AD Aztecs take away our Silks<br />
950 AD Germany makes peace with England, America follows five turns later<br />
1100 AD Wines gobbled up by the Aztecs<br />
1110 AD Germany starts on Rome<br />
1120 AD There go the gems (Iroquois expand)<br />
1140 AD The Smith's Trading Company starts France's Golden Age!<br />
1150 AD Barracks constructed. With nothing else on the menu we start producing Pikemen and Knights. We don't want to look like  easy prey either ...<br />
1270 Germany grants Rome peace<br />
1300 AD The turn after the Golden Age ends: Shakespeare's Theatre. In Paris - who'd have thought ...<br />
1320 AD France enters the Industrial Ages<br />
1380 AD Newton's University - speeding ahead again<br />
1410 AD Germany takes over our Iron<br />
1420 AD Germany declares war on Russia. This is the big one, Russia puts up a great fight. Hordes of Knights and Cavalry will pass through and by Paris' lands in two directions. Eventually Russia gets crippled, but Germany's economy will suffer bigtime.<br />
Paris builds some Riflemen and a Cannon ...<br />
1490 AD Hospital, 8 selected Slave Workers join Paris<br />
1495 AD Coal Colony established, one of the last free spots in the world!<br />
1520 AD Factory<br />
1535 AD Coal Plant. We make 100+ shields. Pollution can only pop up in one square a turn / city, right? <br />
1575 AD Universal Suffrage<br />
1595 AD Intelligence Agency (Why not)<br />
1615 AD Scientific Method discovered, for the first and only time science is set at zero. Not that we really need the money<br />
1640 AD Theory of Evolution gives us Atomic Theory and Electronics, for which America is willing to pay Refining, $335pt, Oil and some petty cash. Meanwhile, a fresh source of Iron pops up in France, already connected<br />
1675 AD The Hoover Dam is putting an end to constant clean-ups. Germany and Russia finally come to an understanding<br />
1685 AD Police Station (makes no difference, as it appears - waste and corruption stay exactly one each). Oh well, we can also build lotsa Infantry ... 12 more of them until the end of the game<br />
1740 AD Radio discovered. The very first news program proclaims that France had reached a culture of exactly 12,000. Paris has 29 points less ...  <br />

No majority vote in my 1520 UN election.  GRRRR...<br />
<br />
About 30 turns before I realized I wasn't going to get a Golden Age.  So, wanting to get involved in a ware without declaring one, I sign a few MPPs  (I know now: total bonehead move).  Anyway, WWI breaks out and I end up breaking two MPPs because so and so attacked so and so.  Well, that ruined my previously spotless rep.  At one time I had three Civs gracious toward me.  Oh well.

Hi Ribannah,<br />
<br />
I had already selected to switch governments and had been in anarchy for 2 turns. When I discovered Democracy, I was given the choice to switch goverments but I declined because I was only 2 turns from ending anarchy. When anarchy ended I was then able to choose democracy. If I would have selected to switch govenemts while already in anarchy it would have just started another full cycle of anarchy.<br />
<br />
Nice job on your OOC. I think I will try one for fun. I'm about done with this GOTM anyway.<br />

<br />
Probably the wierdest game I have ever played. The last 5 turns were spent chasing another blasted respawn. Grrrr!<br />
<br />
I am digging into the game a bit because the &quot;Keep Everybody Fighting all the Time&quot; tactic plus the &quot;Buy Their Workers Everytime it is Possible&quot; strategy just seems to absolutely incapacitate the AI's. I saw two enemy knights in the entire game and that was only because I made a stupid map reading error.<br />
<br />
I spent about 30 turns between about 500BC and 10AD where the game was very unstable and would either spend about 5 or 10 minutes in some sort of thinking stupor or might crash black to the desktop. For most of this time all 7 opponents were alive and they were furious with each other. Almost every turn had one or two diplomacy pop ups or agreement transfers. I had to reload the game from the autosave after the black crashes and then not attack any of the enemy cities for the turn in order to keep it from crashing. It was as if teh game was saying &quot;I can't take any more mindless violence, I think I'll just barf. &quot; This just slowed me down. (I am in discussion with the Max Payne folks for a Civ3 spin off based on my experiences in this game even as we speak.)<br />
<br />
I also killed every explorer that I met in the early game or in two  cases I blocked the only routes of escape and let barbs or other enemies kill them. Left lots of huts just for me.<br />
<br />
A built a warrior and then an archer, before switching to settlers, workers, temples, and then horsemen, horsemen, horsemen and more horsemen. I built temples only until got literature and then switche to libraries when the distance to the city was 12 or less. Frontier cities stuck to building the temple and I lloked for cites that could benefit from forestry. A city with a temple and a marketplace plus eight luxuries needs nothing else.<br />
<br />
My game ending culture score was something like 7400 pts and this was still two to three times that of the AIs. They will not build cultural improvements when they are at war and as a result, their territory virtually will not knit together.<br />
<br />
I then went through a period where no one would talk with me at all, even though I was careful not to break any agreements. Very wierd. Some of the AI's stayed at war with someone almost constantly.<br />
<br />
In the end, they built almost no wonders and even fewer improvements in their cities.<br />
<br />
I attacked the AIs in between their wars with each other while their units were staggering back and forth in the open. Its wierd that when A is fighting B, you can let B's army attack A while you attack and kill A''s offensive army and take B's cities. They will not always make peace with each other right away and in the meantime you have virtually disemboweled them both.<br />
<br />
My original core area cities were virtually undefended for the entire game.<br />
<br />
I had to rush a few galleys near the end and used some rushed cannons to blast and enemy galley from shore, but other than those wierd events I built no navy and no artillery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kemal</div><div class="date">Aug 17, 2002, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Contrary to cracker I was (trying to be) playing a peaceful-builder style type of game. The early phases of the game left me with mixed feelings because on the positive side the Aztecs were playing very poor and gave me the chance to settle all around our inland sea and even as far as right next to Tenochtitlan. However, on the downside the barbarians were a real pain to me in this game. The goody huts were not very favourable and I lost 2 settlers :(, 1 worker and some spearmen to the barbarians early on, somewhat inhibiting my early expansion. Having 6 turns of anarchy to turn to Republic and another 7 for Democracy also wasn't good.<br />
<br />
Because I didn't have to spend much resources on my military i took a decent economical and technological lead over the AI only to find out after discovering steam power that there wasn't any coal in my territory. A scan of the map revealed a lump just outside my borders near the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan.<br />
Considering that world peace is great but having a lump of coal even better it was quickly decided that the Aztecs were going down. Due to my technological superiority (cavalry vs spearman/pikeman) and the fact that the Aztecs only had about 7 cities it was a very short war, but during that war soem very unpleasant things occured: Since the Aztecs had always been polite with me and I couldn't see any method of them declaring war on me I was the agressor in this war. This immediately switched the other AI's opinion of me to annoyed and I guess it was because of this the stone-age-we-have-no-money-Aztecs managed to get an Alliance with the Russians against me just before I finished them, and to make matters worse a large stack of English knights suddenly appeared in my border indicating an English attack was also imminent. Although they were fighting with knight/musketmen at that time there was no way I could finish them before they got to cavalry/riflemen so a large war broke out.<br />
<br />
So much for my peaceful game. I eventually dispatched both the Russians and the English using tanks but not after all the other civ's had also declared war on me. Could (and maybe should) have tought them all a lesson but I got tired of the war even faster than my own citizens so I finished with a spaceship.<br />
<br />
Not a very high score in the end but probably good enough for another top 30 notation.</div></div><hr />

Could hav had the game wrapped up in late 1400's, but it was the 3rd of the month and didn't want to be without a GOTM.  was able to milk for about 400 years, but my culture was getting out of control.  On my last turn before cultural victory I went and nuked some german cities and grabbed the ones I could reach for Domination victory in 1870.  Guess I should've watched my cultural points more closely but I assumed milking would have been alot easier.  Score wasn't too bad but it could have been alot better.  see ya'll next month</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smoking mirror</div><div class="date">Aug 17, 2002, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh well, I lost; As usual it was due to a Diplomatic victory by my arch enemies.<br />
I had been saving a Great leader that I had got in my last war for a rush build of the United nations, I had just built the Hoover dam and was getting ready to crush the Americans (I had just eliminated the Russians and I had Four elite tanks sitting outside the Roman capital, about to kill them too). I managed to get computers a little while after the american, but they were starting to get ahead of me in techs (I know most people seem to stay on 4turn techs through the whole game, but I was having trouble getting anything in less than 6-8 turns, too many tanks, not enough market places I guess, I cant wait for the PTW addition of the stock exchange- I can bulid it in my super cities and won't have to worry about building Marketplacess in Supercorrupt cities at the edge of my empire, most of them only pay for them selves in anything toher than Democracy, and ven in capitalism mode they only bring in a few extra coins). Any way I decided that I needed the Seti program and I could get another GL in my fight against the Americans (I had got four Great leaders, since I got tanks and the heroic epic, they seemed to be very common now, so the one sitting around in my capital doing notheing waiting for the right tech to build the UN seemed to be a waste of more potential leaders) so I rushed Seti and improved my science program, and was just about to wipe out the romans, when the Americans built the United Nations- &quot;don't panic&quot; I thought, the Germans love me and the English are fairly neutral, if I can just move my tank, I can wipe the Romans from the earth and then Capture the UN from Americans, but sadly the stupid romans voted for the Americans as did the English (The germans however stayed true to their eternal friends, the french, and voted for me!).<br />
<br />
So despite the fact that I owned more than 50% of the whole world and I had five tank Armies and the pentagon and my Navy was unchalenged on the waves, as were my jetfighters in the air- the Americans managed to sway world opinion (the English and the size one city of roman pigfarmers on &quot;Death island&quot;) And &quot;defeat me&quot;. ( I think diplomatic victory is fairly weak, its nice that you can win with Diplomacy, but no one ever uses it, they just build the UN first and refuse to vote. I usualy turn it off in my games; I mean, how exactly was &quot;World opinion&quot; going to cause my downfall, would they institute a global trade embargo against me? Or perhaps Lincon could have made every one Declare war aginst me? All I can say to that is, &quot;Bring it on!&quot; I defeated them before, I can do it again- Personaly I prefered the old CivII UN, great wall was better back then as well- Also I miss the Iffel tower, Diplomacy is already a key part of the game, every eventuality of the &quot;diplomatic victory&quot; is already there; Trade embargos, MMPs, military alliances and even the ability to turn away peace envoys, now that would be a good function of the UN, to enable you to force aceptance of your Peace envoys, it would still be very diplomaticly expensive to rig &quot;Zero turn wars&quot;, (lots of Goldperturn and Resources/techs) but it would be nice to have the option ).</div></div><hr />

I hope you will grab a couple of save files from your game that are early in the industrial era if possible.<br />
<br />
I think if we look at your save games after the closing submission date, we should be able to find a number of key things that you could do to improve your research rate and avoid the close losses.<br />
<br />
On Regent level, there should be absolutely no wonders that you may want to build that you cannot almost always build if you use wise bootstrapping techniques.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smoking mirror</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2002, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think my main problem was the poor location of my Palace/Forbiden palace- both close together at the north end of my empire, on oposite sides of the big lake- I should have used one of my GLs to rush build a new palace down south, but I was too caught up in trying to save one for the UN, and I had built most of the wonders of the industrial age, it was just a matter of time before the Americans or English caught up and built a wonder, just through slow building.<br />
<br />
All in all missing the UN was a stupid mistake, I should have avoided with proper use of my Great leader- but having a GL sat around waiting for dozens of turns, just makes me so upset; Specaily as I was Running a Warmongering strategy that had been churning out GLs at a tremendous rate!<br />

This is the last save game I had, A little while before I lost I think, I'm not sure If I had the Great leader at this point, Iv'e got a slow computer, so I tend to avoid auto saves and just save when Iv'e gone for a long time without- if the game crashes or the Electricity goes (we have a Key meter- if you don't top it up occasionaly you can find yourself suddenly in the dark), any way here it is;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kemal</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2002, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I have already completed and submitted this game I have taken a look at your game. What I immediately noticed is that your cities are very small. Though having specialist isn't very usefull except for score it is very important that your cities' population is large enough to make all the surrounding squares productive, especially in your core-cities which have little waste/corruption. Furthermore I noticed that most of your cities didn't have a factory. Usually when I reach Industrialization I make certain that my larger cities around my capitols get factories ASAP. (most are prebuilding the factories via colloseums or banks and I rushbuy in cities that still need other important improvements like a university or bank). In your case, having factories is even more important since you also possess the Hoover Dam which increases factory-output by 50&amp;, making having one in your city even more lucrative). After these cities complete their factory they'll build a hospital and then other improvements that may still be needed (bank, university, or cathedrals). <br />
By doing this I usually take a great lead over the AI since I am greatly outproducing them both industriously and economical.<br />
<br />
Also, a granary helps out growing cities above size 6 greatly.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that this is the best way to manage/build your empire as many other strategies are also used by other gotm-players and I'm certainly not the highest scoring one, so maybe cracker or other players can help you in different (better) ways.<br />
<br />
Anyways, hope this helps you a little to improve your skills for future gotm's.</div></div><hr />

3100BC Space sure is limited on standard with 8 civs. We meet Aztecs and get 2 techs for alphabet. :)<br />
3050BC Up to now, I had never had a settler from a goody hut. Took cracker's advice and set the settler production to Granary before popping hut to east. Get settler! [dance] Meet Aztecs. Wanted to go for militaristic play in this game for a different style. Aztecs have Bronze Working although capital is defended by jaguar warrior.<br />
Warrior gambit may be risky.<br />
2950BC I think all my luck in goody huts concentrate in this game.<br />
pottery, settler, mysticism, gold, warrior, barbs, map, barbs, barbs, warrior, barbs, horseback riding, barbs, maths, barbs, warrior, writing, warrior<br />
2670BC We see Aztecs' first settler and send a warrior towards it. The settler runs back to the capital! :lol:<br />
2630BC Russians only have a single city at size one at 2630BC?!<br />
2390BC &quot;You have disturbed an angry Goth warrior.&quot; ;)<br />
2030BC Aztecs are still at 1 city :rolleyes:. We have no iron nearby! Decide to go for horsemen rush. Will wait for someone to research horseback riding and then trade for it using tech lead. Set science to 10% to save up for horsemen upgrades.<br />
1950BC erm, we get horseback riding from a hut.<br />
1650BC I see Aztec Regular jarguar with settler come next to our elite warrior. <br />
&quot;What you cannot defend does not belong to you.&quot; We attack!<br />
1525BC We get writing and comms with English thro Americans. I have discovered everyone. Only the English are equal to our size. They must have got a settler from a goody hut too. 3 turns later, everyone gets contact with one another and we lose any advantage here.<br />
Buy alliance with Russia against Aztecs. It's a bargain, spending only 40 gold. That will keep the jarguars off us,<br />
slow down Russian growth, prevent dominos against us and pin Tenochitlan down for us to colonize incense. <br />
1450BC Get free alliance with Rome against Aztecs (using ROP) and with Germany against Aztecs for Mysticism.<br />
We then get peace treaty with Aztecs for a worker :satan:. Reputation drops a notch, but oh well...<br />
ouch, our 3 ex-allies became furious. :(<br />
1025BC Breaking the treaty definitely was a bad move. Not only will they not ally with us in future unless already at war, but we also can't sell ROPs for cash.<br />
Got WM relatively early in the month this GOTM due to pangea.:)<br />
950BC darn, our orchestrated wars are dying down. Time to stir up more! We get polytheism after 40 turns of 10% science and other civs have caught up with our science lead from huts, so we pump science up to 100% again until our war machine gets going since Aztecs (who we will attack) are behind in tech.<br />
An iron pops up right under Rheims! We decide to attack Aztecs even though that would leave us incredibly weak at home with 7 spears in 14 cities (AI unlikely to move troops into my territory until they can no longer expand and also our country is so large that we can afford to lose a couple of cities to surprise attacks.) <br />
They have dyes &amp; ivory. Renegotiate peace with Americans for 80 gold! <br />
775BC I realise Germans are pinning Aztecs down near Ivory, so we will throw everything at their capital!<br />
490BC Our forces bear down on Tenochitlan. First wave was unsucessful. Regrouping for 2nd wave.<br />
350BC I leave a settler undefended and a Roman warrior attacks it and disbands the workers :rolleyes:.<br />
We still can't ally with anyone! <br />
330BC Barb uprising with 16 horses next to my settler! :cry: I figure my settler's dead, so I use it to lure the barbs towards Tlatelolco which has the ivory. I think the stack split into 3 to the 3 nearest equidistant cities, so minimal damage to us, but also to Aztecs.<br />
290BC The war with Aztecs is going nowhere. I sign peace for one of his workers. Figure I'll declare again in 20 turns since production of horses is going thro the roof with expansion reaching its limit (settler production switched to military).<br />
90BC Switch to monarchy &amp; get peace with Romans. Still can't ally! It has been 1500 years!<br />
<br />
hope I can finish properly in time this month to submit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to acknowledge first that it is very good of you to post a save game for comments. I hope some of these comments will be of value to you.<br />
<br />
Your contribution to the new graphics is so powerful that I would like to help you in any way possible to get control of the game in a way that lets you play it and enjoy it to the fullest extent. Anything that you need, please do not hesitate to ask.<br />
<br />
I would take a different direction from Kemals comment about city size because in the big picture, having large cities does not equate to being more in control of the game. If anything applies here, your focus on larger spaced out cities is probably hurting you throughout the game.<br />
<br />
I first look at you city build density and think that is one of the biggest problems you may want to address. You should look at cities in stair step increments of size with 13 squares being the big number. For most of the game, most of your cities will be size 12 or less. Even if you are shooting for a space race or UN victory, size 12 is still where you are stuck through all of the first two ages and most of the third age. If you took a screen shot of your home area with the grid turned on and then looked at the city display screens in the game you could mark all the squares that are working and producing something by using your paintshop type program and just putting a big green dot in the square. The tiles that are nearer to your capitals usually have little corruption impact so you can look at every land and water square that does not have a green dot and see that these are wasted spaces that are not contributing to your economy. If you looked at my map and compared it to your map, I have 3 or 4 more cities in the each core area than you do. My core areas with 8 cities can beat up your core areas with 4 or 5 cities.<br />
<br />
I think you flagged this as being a problem as well, but the positioning of the FP in Tours is double whammy bad for you because it is too close to your palace in Paris plus it is too close to the inland sea that basically just takes a big bite out of any possible benefits. Your ideal locations for the palace and FP will have an inner ring of 4 or 5 cities around the palace cities and then an outer ring of 6 to 8 more cities. When you snuggle up to a coastal area or overlap too much with the radius of the other palace this really sets you back.<br />
<br />
I also look around and see that a number of your corrupt cities have temples and libraries that you seemed to have built only 10 to 15 years (3 turns apart) this means you had to have rushed them in and this cost you money that could have been used more wisely. Tlatelolco 1360/1385, Minsk 1370/1380, Pompeii 1705/1520, Tlacopan 1275/1550, Atzcapotzalco 1535/1525, Kiev 700/860. The libraries in all these cities are producing little or no benefit to you because they are too corrupt and too far from you core areas. A number of these cities are costing you more in maintenance costs than they are producing in income or shields. This would lead me to ask you to look closely at the reasons you build certain improvements in your towns and cities and then to look closely to see if those benefits are actually there. The sequence in which you build things is important but in many cases the radius from either the palace of the FP will tell you not to build many of the choices you are making.<br />
<br />
On the military side, I think you may have the wrong choices for this map. You have 4 armies plus some battleships and aircraft carriers. Out of the 90+ units in your military you have almost 40 of these units in things that cannot be used to seize and hold territory. In the railroad era on Pangea, you can throw down an assault railroad and reach almost any city in your enemy's territory all in one turn. Your 4 armies are all tank armies and they contain 16 of your 22 tanks and this severly handicaps your ability to defend or fight wars.<br />
<br />
I watched the replay of your game and a number of things jumped out at me:<br />
<br />
1)	It took you until 2350 to found your second city and your capital expanded due to culture in 1990BC. This indicated to me that you built a temple in the early cycle instead of a granary or more settlers and other units. A temple in your capital is rarely a good idea because the palace gives you all the starting culture you need and settlers and units are a much higher priority. (I confirmed that you built the temple in 2710BC and this was the wrong strategy choice since it was before you built your first settler.)<br />
2)	It looked like you built the Colossus in 260AD and this would have put you half way to your golden age.<br />
3)	You went to war with the Russians about 400AD but it seemed the Americans allied with Russians and instantly starting giving you a hard time. By 550 AD you are at war with the Aztecs. The other civs are starting to beat you to the big wonders because your core area is so sparsely settled (around Paris you have two great big unsettled gaps where productive cities needed to be.)<br />
4)	You got Leonardos in 720AD but were tangled up in an unproductive tug of war with the Aztecs over the city of Tlaxcala that change hands 5 different times in just a few turns. This city was located right by that mountain on the western choke neck so I knew the location well. The same city changed hand 5 more times between you, the Aztecs, and the Germans.<br />
5)	You started to break out a little bit in a war against the Aztecs starting in 1200AD but still there were some seesaw city swapping battles until you wiped them out in 1340. Bet you were winning this war with knights.<br />
6)	You went to war with the Iroquois in 1585 and seemed to be allied with the Germans, English and Romans against Hiawatha which was a good move, but 3 out of the 4 cities you captured were lost back to the Iroquois and then taken by your allies instead. Germany and Rome came out as the big winners in that war.<br />
7)	In 1675 you went to war with Rome with Germany as your helper. 1730 was an ugly year when England and America seemed to join in against you and took 4 or 5 cities from you that you then captured back.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
I cannot tell exactly what the combat and seesaw city causes may be by just looking at the replay but something in your military strategy or tactics seems to make this too much of a negative load on your success. When you get this figured out, things will be a lot more fun.<br />
<br />
Your replay does not show you as being in control of the game even though you were ahead in culture early and your score was in first place after the Aztec war. You were in danger of being destroyed by the Americans and English anytime they really decided to take you on.<br />
<br />
Next time you play, try to save several strategic save games from earlier in your play. A game at between 1500 and 1000BC will reveal how well your starting strategy is matching with the civ traits and the terrain.  A save game When you enter the industrial age (just before Steam Power) is very revealing. A save game right when you enter your golden age adn then one 20 turns later (when the GA ends) can be used to see if you got the best bang out of your GA to match with your gameplay objectives.<br />
<br />
Use a text editor file to write down the tech research sequence that you use because often you will find ways to get more bang for your buck here. Your notes will be one of the only tools we can use to help you in this area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hergrom</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Early game was expand like crazy.  Settled two cities to form blockade by iron on other side of the inland sea.  Settled all areas in between and down to incense on my side of the sea.  All AI's were demanding things of me, even on Regent.  Anyone close to me got what they asked for, civs far away were rebuffed.  Finally Germany declared war.  Got Aztecs, Romans &amp; Iroquois on my side.  After a few turns, Russia sneak attacked.  I ransacked Russia with some help from America.  Meanwhile, Gemany was beating up on my 3 allies, believe it or not.<br />
<br />
Put my FP in Moscow with a GL.  Russia eliminated.  Changed focus to Germany.  After a few German cities fell (former Aztec cities), Aztecs sneak attack me (what did I ever do to these guys?).  So, I eliminated Aztecs.  Germany continues to beat up on Romans &amp; Iroquois.  Again, I change focus to Germany.  With the aid of Musketeers and a timely Golden Age, I finally eliminate them and continue the charge with the victums being Romans &amp; Iroqouis, my former allies.  Still  using knights and Musketeers, I conquer all but England and America.  I pause for the advent of Cavalry, and England sneak attacks me (GETTING KINDA SICK OF THIS).  <br />
<br />
With the aid of America, I shave a few cities from England and sign peace.  When I actually get Cavalry,  attack America, and England in succession.  Both civs are relegated to a single city each on the tundra island SE of the continent.  It is now like 1400 or 1500 AD.  Time to milk.<br />
<br />
Got about 5 or 6 great leaders, the first of which made an army, second was FP.  The rest were assorted medieval wonders.  Decided to try for a high Diplomatic score victory, but never could butter up Libby enough to do so (gave her almost every tech and over 30,000 gold to no avail).  Settled for a space victory in 2050.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I captured/built a stream of cities (pony express) south through Germany, East through Italy, and then North by England and ended up one move away from Washington, DC where I eventually parked my 14 armies (modern armourx4/ea).<br />
<br />
This was my first game where I bumped into the 1 army per 4 city limit!!!<br />
<br />
One of my most unsatisfying moves in the game was signing a MPP with America.  Kept me at war much more than I wanted.  I hate MPPs and will remember this.<br />
<br />
Realized in the eary 1800s we were playing for fastest, so built the spaceship before washington finished the second piece.  Too bad, as I was really looking forward to walking all over her with those 14 armies!!!<br />
<br />
Lost only 1 city to CF - Nottingham to England who had built a wonder there.  The americans then came and immediately razed it.<br />
<br />
Before the Americans could completly destroy Rome, I gave them the Island west of Germany.<br />
<br />
Spent the last 20 turns giving away luxuries, resources, and cash, but everyone hated me for MPPing with the war mongering, civilization destroying Americans.  (OK, so I may have razed a few cities, too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thefrenchzulu</div><div class="date">Aug 20, 2002, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first GOTM and like many other player I had a battle deciding on a winning strategy.   Considering the options and immediately eliminating culture and diplomacy, cause they are so easy, I decided on domination/conquest.  The space race option might come into play, but it is surely not my favourite winning method.<br />
<br />
Looking at the game set-up, I had two possibilities.  Either go for high score or early victory.  I decided to go for the early victory, cause I could always switch to milking if needed.  After reading some interesting postings surrounding milking, and considering that I've started the game on the 19 August, I started off with a very aggressive strategy.<br />
<br />
Early expansion and a strong military should do it.<br />
<br />
My first five cities were all built in closely.  I researched pottery in 12 turns and then went for the bronze working and the wheel.  I received Ceremonial Burial from the first goody hut.  Great, as if I was going to build temples.  I did built temples in my second and third city for culture growth.  I rushed them with deforestation and started with barracks.  <br />
<br />
After the wheel I went for horseback riding and iron working. My sixth city was place such that horse came into my territory and then the horsemen started rolling from one city and spearmen from another.  In Paris I went for spearmen and settlers. Careful not to over expand and fall behind in military.  After Iron working, I switch my science to zero.  No more research till after the GL.<br />
<br />
I found the Aztecs first and scouted their territory with a horseman, while more horses and spearmen moved closer.  Started road toward their capital cause that always helps.  They also had a luxury I craved. <br />
<br />
I took their capital in an easy attack.  No losses!  <br />
<br />
They nearly immediately went for peace and donated their territory map and some communication.  <br />
<br />
To keep the other Civilization in tacked, I arranged some wars up in the East.  I meant declaring war on the Iroquois.   They had no cities I wanted immediately, but it would soften up the Romans and Russians.  Not long and everybody was at war.  Great.<br />
<br />
One of my horsemen raiding barbarian camps in the North West killed an elite Iroquois warrior wandering around and creates my first leader.  600BC! <br />
<br />
I immediately re-declared war and took two more cities.   Got my second leader 400BC and created a one horse army.  Went for immediate attack on a warrior and was victorious.  Good, will build the Heroic Epic.  <br />
<br />
Peace again with the Aztechs, this time for their entire tech, world map and most of their science.  Great.  Rushed the Pyramids to increase expansion and cut costs on granaries.<br />
<br />
I took the last Aztec city 300BC and they are dead.  No re-spawning.  What a bonus!!!<br />
<br />
When I established embassies with all the Civilizations, I saw that the Germans have nearly completed the Great Library.  I just love them for doing that. Though I would have loved building it myself, I might cause culture problems in the late game.  I would also rather just take it from them.  Too much knowledge can't be good for them.<br />
<br />
I took on the Germans and with charging horsemen, got my third leader after taking Leipzig!  The HE was not even finished yet.  Rushed my Forbidden Palace in Cologne to decrease corruption.  Received The Republic from the GL and switched immediately.<br />
<br />
<br />
Got my fourth leader in 200AD!  Rushed the Art of War.  Great, those barrack will go far in my war effort.<br />
<br />
It's currently 340AD. <br />
<br />
I'm dominating as far as military goes.  I'll have knights soon and then it should really go fast.  I have a few thousand gold in stock and am on par with tech.  With 30 horsemen a military victory seems just too easy, especially now that I'm moving Pike men in for denial of resource! (Why I researched iron working early)  With no iron, the AI is dead!<br />
<br />
I have to make the choice now whether to go for early victory or score and I have absolutely no idea what to do.  I might go for the milking strategy just to see what its like!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smoking mirror</div><div class="date">Aug 20, 2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback Cracker- I have to admit I'm no military genius, and when it comes to city management I'm usualy just throwing up shanty towns while I try to focus on my military shortcommings (though this ignores the fact that My military deficiency comes mainly from my bad infrastructure).<br />
The reason for all the temples/libraries is purely for the purposes of Culture banking. I hate getting culture flipped, it realy disrupts my plans (the reason I lost so many of the Iroquis cities is cos I was tring to use my elite undersized army to defeat a bigger less advanced military force- I had no trouble actualy defeating the iroquis, but then I didn't have enough troops to garrison, so I lost some cities to culture flips, and then my allies stole them from me). The seesawing action you noticed in my wars was down to my usual military strategy (carried over from civ II) of using a small army to defeat a much larger force through letting them overextend themselves in to an area of no defensive value and then breaking the back of thier offensive army and using my (now well experienced) armies to march on their badly defended cities. Usualy it works well, but in this game there were few roads (cos the aztecs left their whole empire completely undeveloped) and I was on a similar technological level to my enemies (I hadn't wanted to be in that war, I cant remember if it was me or the russians who started that war, but the russians escalated it to include the Aztecs, Germans and Americans) and outnumbered. All my usual strategy allowed me to do was stay in control while slowly building my roads to the aztecs. Usualy I would try to get some allies in such a war, but the only bargining point I had was my stocks of resources, which i couldn't trade, because of the terrible infrastructure in the centre of the land mass.<br />
The reason for building a Temple in my capital at the begining was because I was trying to pre build for a granary, but the tech didn't come in in time; So rather than waste the shields I had built up (or cheat by reloading) I decided to go ahead with the temple for long term culture production (double culture every 1000 years means building before 1AD is a good bonus).<br />
<br />
As we both pointed out the site of my Forbiden palage was my biggest failure. I usualy view the FB as an overall decrease in coruption, and thus an increase in production (and trade) so I hate to wait for a GL for the opertunity to build it, I usualy try to get it built during my golden age and due to my slow progress against all the other civs in &quot;the war to end all wars&quot; the only place big enough to build the improvement was the city on the otherside of the lake. I was having no luck getting greatleaders (Knight Vs Knight combat in the open can result in very unpredictable combats- I.E. 50/50 chance of sucess) so I decided (in the GOTM with a game where you can't reload, every choice is loaded with ramifications) to build the FP as soon as I could.<br />
<br />
As a final point, I guess I usualy site cities with bonus resourecs in mind, I try to place my cities to try to grab the most resources possible, as far as I'm concerned a mountain or grassland square without resources is not worth incuding in my empire- and I don't usualy bother building granaries, eventualy I usualy manage to capture the pyramids anyway and the speedgrowth bonus is practicaly worthless from the point they get to size 12, to the time you can build hospitals. Usualy I build factories and hospitals in all my core cities, but in my save game, a military emergency had postponed my modenization policy untill I had got everything under control.</div></div><hr />

Fixed the Napoléon. Had some of them right and most of them wrong. I was having trouble typing the accents with my American keyboard. :crazyeye: <br />
<br />
Though Jeanne is more popular, Joan is her name in the game. In any case, the rule I used was Joan not Jeanne, Napoleon not Napoléon, except when in Joan's words. <br />

Added Vive la République here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thefrenchzulu</div><div class="date">Aug 21, 2002, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If finally decided to try the milking strategy.  <br />
<br />
It changes the whole approach to the game, especially your research.  Hospitals and mass transit suddenly comes into play.  My normal approach to emperor and deity is to go for really close-in highly productive size 12 cities.  Now I'm looking for many size 24+ cities.  A completely new approach to the game for me.<br />
<br />
I have finished the game in real terms in 700AD.  I killed the Russians and crippled the English and Americans.  I find is really strange that I had absolutely no re-spawns in the game.  Every time I killed, they were dead.  No complaints though.  A quick score calculation at this stage showed a 4050 time score bonus.  Whoopee.  I didn't calculate what my total score could have been, but probably not much more than 7000.  It would be interesting to see the results after intensive milking.<br />
<br />
I started my milking approach in 340AD!  Though I still had to kill the Romans, Iroquois and Russians at this stage, I rushed settlers to fill all unoccupied areas with growth value.  I also stopped military production and rushed aqueducts and market places.  Also some temples just for initial culture growth.<br />
<br />
It's 1000AD now and I'm flirting with the domination line.  100+ tiles to go.  Problem is, America and England hates me and don't want to give that one luxury I need.  Tough on England, I will have to take theirs.  This will really cut it close, but that's life.<br />
<br />
There is 325 turns to go out of the 540; I'm not even halve way!  I think I'm going to raise America and England and leave some island cities for them!   That should solve the luxury problems and might result in some more leaders.  Need them for some wonder rushes.<br />
<br />
I'm on about 10 000 culture points, so all temples and early libraries will have to go.<br />
<br />
Though I'm turning technology in 4 turns, it seems as if all research will have to come from me.  I had to research education, that with the Great Library.  What a waist.  <br />
<br />
I still need to decide on a final winning strategy.  I will probably end up with a space ship or a push for domination when needed.</div></div><hr />

I am now at the point that to keep my score down I will have to start abandoning cities and play out till 2050 with a tundra'd AI city:eek: .<br />
<br />
Well I finally got some time to finish and in the 20 century was presented with the fact that Paris was going to trigger a cultural victory:) .<br />
<br />
The only way to continue to lower my score was to abandon this great city:eek: . <br />
<br />
The pride of France and the envy of the world contained:<br />
The Hanging Gardens<br />
The Great Library<br />
The Great Wall<br />
Sistine Chapel<br />
Shakespear's Theater<br />
JS Bach's Cathedral<br />
Universal Suffrage<br />
Hoover Dam<br />
Theory of Evolution<br />
The United Nations<br />
The Manhatten Project<br />
Heroic Epic<br />
Military Academy<br />
The Pentagon<br />
Intelligence Agency<br />
<br />
To raze this city would have been an injustice so I let it take it's rightful place in my history. With a score also at 2*** Col and I will have to wait to see who came lower.</div></div><hr />

A domination victory in 1080 with 1962 would give you 5610 points. <br />
 <br />
1962 + (2050 - 1080) * 3 (Regent)<br />
 <br />
My guess is you might be able to milk it up to around 9000 if your willing to play for another 1000 years.</div></div><hr />

I looked at your pic's and for a second thought they were mine...<br />
<br />
SirPle has posted a score prediction program under utilities.  I have only used it once, but it seem accurate.  There are some limitations to it as you can imagine, but it is gives milling some sense.<br />
<br />
If been milking since 340 AD, currently in 1390AD.  For the first time my score really is growthing faster than my early win bonus.  <br />
<br />
This is my first milking attempt ever and have much to thank SirPleb with his maximising your score thread!<br />
<br />
I also had no respawns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am looking at your posts and pics and still cannot motivate myself at playing at SUCH A LOW LEVEL.<br />
<br />
It is by far to easy. I have played until 560 AD and at that time I had beaten the Aztecs and Iroquis but then the computer crashed. I then forgot to load the autosave and save it so the next day I could only see the autosaves of my cousin's game. Tough luck. My latest save was 130 AD and at that time I was only finishing the Aztecs. Since I already knew the map I could theoretically play again even if I knew were the saltpeter was. (anyway the computer knew too.<br />
<br />
BUT I COULDN'T. It's too easy. At 130AD the game was already won. I consider that playing along would be similar to milking the game. TOO TEDIOUS and TOO BORING.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I was too harsh and actually I really appreciate reading what you people did.</div></div><hr />

In 340AD, I've killed or crippled every one.  I agree it is quite a change from playing emperor/deity, but you must remember that there are some other good players playing as well.  So, the challenge is not the AI, they sucked, but the other players and trying to outscore them.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would have loved a more difficult games, but scoring is interesting.  It changes your whole approach to the game.  Suddenly hospistals if high on your list of research.</div></div><hr />

You are right and as I was just browsing the changes in the GOTM therad I think a new score system coul reward early finishes by high scores. I hate milking. My computer too....:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">q33555</div><div class="date">Aug 22, 2002, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well a couple of firsts - my first attempt at GOTM and my first post to the bulletin board.  Its amazing what you can achieve with a couple of days off work :D <br />
<br />
I achieved a domination victory with what I consider to be a good score.  I usually play on Regent level so this was a good start on GOTM.  I have played at Monarch before and the best I have done is lose a fairly close space race, most of the time I get my behind whupped :spank: .  Quite interestingly this turned out to be a bit of a warfest.  I am normally quite a peaceful player and like to go for spaceship, cultural or UN victory.  However with 8 civs on one continent I decided that just wasn't viable.  After getting a settler with my first goody hut I was in the lead in points and power and pretty much stayed that way all through to the end.  <br />
<br />
Anyway here are my thoughts on a couple of the themes in this thread.<br />
<br />
Goody Huts There were so many they added a huge amount of luck to the early game play.  In my main game I got fairly lucky in that I got a settler with the first hut and a couple of techs in the other and only had a couple of surprised barbs attacking me.  However when played through again as a one city challenge, virtually every hut contained barbs or if not just gave me a map :(<br />
<br />
Great Leaders I seem to have been much more lucky than most here, although I was in a state of vitually continuous war throughout the game :ar15: .  I got my first GL early doors and following some of the advice on this site created an army so I could go down the heroic epic route.  I have to say I'm no fan of armies so this is not something I would normally do (although the new 1.29f blitz capability of armies has put them up in my regards).  I didn't get any more GLs for a quite a long time, but in my final push to wipe out the Germans, Iriquois and Russians (and so achieve my global domination) I spawned 5 more GLs!! :) .  With them quite a lot of WoWs were completed in record time.<br />
<br />
As an aside, other than being a good ego trip, is the ability to rename your elite GL units for anything?  Do these units have any more or less chance of squeezing out another GL than regular elite units? :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
After seeing Ribannah post about his OCC game I thought I would have a go myself.  Well I won a cultural victory in 1974 (only 200 years or so after Ribannah) but I think it was more luck than judgement!  At the end I was surrounded by the US and the Russians who had Mech Inf and Tanks, while my best defenders were a few Musketeers I had squeezed out during a 20 turn phase when on of the Civs took pity on me and traded me Saltpeter.  So hats off to Ribbanah :goodjob: I'm not sure how you did it, once my Gt Library had been rendered obsolete I fell behind in tech so quickly - at the end of the game I was researching Nationalism while everyone else was building spaceships :blush: .  Luckily I had built enough WoWs in the very early stages that my culture score accumulated quickly enough to get me to the 20,000 mark.  Anyway, it could have made a good entry for the low score challenge (apologies if OCCs are not allowed in that, I haven't read through all the threads here yet!), I had a score of 400 odd - I can't see how it is possible to win the game with a lower score than that!</div></div><hr />

What I meant is that I have virtually won the game by 130 AD and I'm not interested in going along more. I'm not into the challange of getting the highest score or a medal. <br />

If it wasn't GOTM, I would have quit early. I got a settler from a hut in 3750 BC, then the Great Leader Napoleon in 2710 BC used for the Forbidden Palace in 1325 BC.  It was fun racing to settle the western provinces, and there was a little culture war in the west against the albeit weak Aztecs. But the wars were so easy, this is the only thing I could find to say about them.<br />

I d/l the new patch and the AI is very strange.  I have been doing great, thanks to the low difficulty and great starting location.  I grabbed four lux's early on and went to war with the Aztecs to secure two more, the ivory hill and that one dye near their capitol.  Ever since then everybody has been annoyed at me.  I really don't understand it.  Especially since everyone went to war with the Aztecs when they started to lose!<br />
<br />
And, all of a sudden, Russians demand some BS, I tell them to shove it, war!  English do the same, war!  Then Germany does the same, war!  I'm in the mid-middle ages with my knights crushing Catherine, who seems content to send Swordsmen, Archers, Spearmen, and Horsemen my way!  Oh no!  The war caught me off guard, but fortunately I was beginning to build my forces to invade anyway so I was not totally unprepared.  It has, though, been very annoying and I'm just gonna keep pumping out knights until I get military tradition.  Thankfully, I'm a little ahead in tech.<br />

It just hasn't made any sense!  The AI is always mad and trades are very wacky.  It seems like anything other than 5GP and a World Map is an INSULTING deal for a tech!  Wow, A WORLD MAP!?!??!?!?

Zachriel, You had a much luck with GL. I got out 3 civs and have none Leaders. This fact doing slower my expansion because I havn't FP. <br />
<br />
Pardon my luck. ;) <br />
<br />
I agree my early Great Leader was a lucky break, though it almost ended my game right there. After the shock wore off, and remembering that it was a Regent level game, I almost quit!<br />
<br />
http://www.zachriel.com/gotm10/bc2710-Napoleon.jpg <br />
<br />
However, luck is relative. What are the chances of a Great Leader on the first Elite combat of a game? Well, 1/16 for a non-militaristic Civ, of course. Having played six GOTM's what are the chances for at least one Great Leader on the first Elite combat of the game in any of the six games? 1/3. <br />
<br />
(In any case, I'm sure you'll trump my score due to your much earlier conquest victory. :goodjob: )<br />

I named it 'Gengis Khan' and it was as follows: no early attack, no change of government (stay in despotism), no bargaining with other civs, rush with knights (I didn't specify whether I would allow myself to upgrade those knights to cavalry; finally I did upgrade, to avoid boredom in the endgame).<br />
I did not get anything really interesting from huts and grew quietly until I got Chivalry, took Tenochtitlan in 320AD with my first 4 knights available, and then waited more than 5 centuries and many battles  (probably more than 50) won by elite knights until I got a GL.<br />
My big mistake was that I did NOT build a FP until then, and the productive capacity of my civ wasn't high enough to do much better than recover from losses (number of knights fighting oscillating between 15 and 20 until I used Napoléon (hello Zachriel :) ) to build my FP around 900AD.<br />
After that, it went fine, but it was much too late for a good game.  <br />
Domination in 1315AD (the slowest rush I ever played, I suppose :( ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just for the curious. Being careful not to count defeats or retreats, but only victories; and counting 48 elite victories, here are the results:<br />
<br />
http://www.zachriel.com/binomial.gif <br />
<br />
There is a 1/22 chance of getting no Great Leader.<br />
There is a 1/5 chance of getting at most one Great Leader.<br />
Then again, there is a better than even chance of getting at least 3 Great Leaders. <br />
<br />
The expected value is 48/16=3 Great Leaders.</div></div><hr />

Reading the posts, I failed to get fastest cultural.  It was due to two critical mistakes.<br />
1) I should have moved Paris one more to get ocean access - allowing me to build the colossus, lighthouse, etc.<br />
2) I got my first army, but attacking without it being full strength.  The army died, and I lost building the heroic epic sooner which would let me won quite a few turns earlier.<br />
20000 culture in 1888.  100000 would have hit just 3 or 4 turns later :crazyeye:<br />
<br />
Look over the reports, I see that I was one of many to get nailed by the barbs.<br />
I also had a very similiar layout on wrapping around the lakes.<br />

<br />
My game stayed peacefull until ~1210 AD.  Germany declared war.  My empire at the start of the war.<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/LAK-1091.jpg <br />
<br />
<br />
The war lasted until 1420 AD.  The Aztec got a couple of cities, including them recapturing a flipped city that I lost.  The war began with Knights, and saw Cavalry at the end of the war.  At this point, Germany was banned to 1 city on an island circled in red.<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/LAK-1101.jpg <br />
<br />
<br />
The game stayed in war mode, as the Iroquios declared war toward the end of the Germany war.  The Iroquios were attacking via a RoP with Rome.  War was declared on Rome ~1555 AD to let me get at the Iroquios faster.  Rome collasped under my cavalry incredible fast.  1600 AD saw the end of Rome.<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/LAK-1111.jpg <br />
<br />
<br />
War weariness was really taking a toll.  I decided to make peace with the Iroquios in 1680 after I captured the Gem source to add another luxury.  However, at this point they were a non-power, and had just 4 cities left.<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/LAK-1121.jpg <br />
<br />
War broke out again in 1715 AD.  I declared war on the Aztecs.  This was one of the shortest wars I ever fought.  All of the Aztec cities fell in just a couple of turns.<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/LAK-1131.jpg <br />
<br />
I got Russia to declare war on me in 1750 AD.  I had a MPP setup with England.  War with America begin a couple of turns latter.  America concentrated on England an took England pretty much out of the game for me.  I never had to declare war on England.  I realized I had a chance for 100000 pt culture win around this time (I missed by just 2 turns!), so I made the decision to stop tech research, and concentrate on buying culture buildings.  Russia was elimated in 1778 AD.  Looking at the map, you can see how much England has already shrunk in size.  I did NOT want to win by domination, so I began a 100% scorched earth policy.  You can see the big no mans land between France and America.<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/LAK-1141.jpg <br />
<br />
I decided to take the Iroqoius off the continent ~1788 AD.  America had some huge cities, but SoD of artillery with Cavalry was taking out all of the American cities despite him having infantry.  The wars ending 1812 with the continent free of all <br />
<br />
civs but my own.  The created the most anti-climatic ending I have had in a long time, and the rest of the turns flew by.  My final position looked like this.  I never saw tanks this game, as my money was rushing culture buildings with token scientist research.  I have never won by 100000 culture, and had to try.  The game did end with me having the top 5 cities.  Final <br />
score was 3,376 - Joan d'Arc the Magnificent.<br />

At this stage I did a quick score calculation and found that 6000 score is good, but that you could get more through milking.  So damn sad, but I milked a few thousand more points winning in 2050AD...<br />
<br />
I also built settlers and spearmen to create more cities while conquering.  Early territory helps for score.<br />
<br />
To serg:<br />
<br />
What's wrong with a horsemen army?  I had one!<br />
<br />
I had about 8-9 leader during the game.<br />
<br />
I didn't use my last one till building a spaceship in 2050AD.<br />
I nearly regretted that horsemen army, cause I built the heroic epic and nearly won by culture.  In 2005 I had 95000 and had to sell all my culture producing improvements!<br />
<br />
Interesting thing is that I sat on the domination line for most of the game, around 20 tiles off.  I only had culture producing improvements in 15 of my cities.  That mean no libiraries!  I still managed 11 Future techs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serg</div><div class="date">Aug 25, 2002, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Zur!<br />
As many other players I had settler from western hut and founded the second city nearly. :) Got Pottery from second hut and Ceremonial Burial from third. I sent 5 warriors (3 from Paris and 2 from Orleans) in different directions for exploring and huts then start building settler in Orleans and granary then settler in Paris. Founded Lions  and start settler in 2550BC on west from Orleans and start granary in Orleans and so on. Only border's cities have the warriors internal cities immediately were connected by the roads with luxuries to prevent disorder. And build settlers, settlers, settlers...<br />
In 1500BC I met all the civs and knew 3/4 of the main continent. <br />
Some huts gave me additional warriors hence my exploring was very fast. And NO war.<br />
In 1000BC I had 14 cities. 4 center cities have granaries for fast growth and start building barracks. External cities continue building settlers. After barracks I started building the horsemans.  First couple attacked Aztecs and wipe it out. Aztecs respawn to the jungle on south-east edge of continent between Iroquois, Russia and England. I reached them and killed.<br />
One half of my cities build horsemans, other half - settlers. Only one temple in Orleans.<br />
The next target was Russia. I got a ROP with Russia and took its main cities in one turn. I kept one Russian's city Yakutsk becouse this city was placed at respawning area of the map to prevent other civs from respawn.<br />
In the end of ancient times I stop my science and take moneys only.;) <br />
Next step was attacking America and Iroquois simultaneously. At that moment I had ~40 horsemans and could to permit oneself two-way war. Further Rome and England. Only at that moment I got my first GL and rush FP under internal sea where there are many own cities. But it didn't signify already. When I have war with Rome Germany declared war on me and fasting own end.:king:</div></div><hr />

I didn't build the horseman's army because I got my second GL too soon. My army hadn't enough time to reach Germany from England.<br />
If I might have the early GL I think my game was ended under 300AD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell you guys were lucky with those goody huts!  I got ceremonial burial from the first and then babarians from the rest!  I didn't realy care that much, cause I used them for early horseman training.  I used my first GL for the pyramids for quick expansion.  <br />
<br />
I then built spearman, settlers from two cities, veteran horsmen from the rest!  I had about 40 as well.   I took the aztechs and germans with them.<br />
<br />
I caputured the german great library and then turned on the romans.  I upgrade non-elite horses to knight and took the Iroqious and Russians in a few turns.<br />
<br />
I then realised that I was on domination limit.  I upgraded non-elite knights and destroyed america and chase england from the continent.<br />
<br />
I abondoned all american cities and rebuilt them in the most favourable locations!  Had 1 city at size 42 most of the game.  I played between 10-20 tiles from dominatio after that.  I have never abondoned cities before, but in this game with limitied terrtory I had to.  No cities in tundra, mountains or jungle.  Not until I cleared it.<br />
<br />
I did a score calculation and found I could get 7000 points with an early domination win!  Though I  recon that is a good score and meant average to good play, I got more from milking.  I'm praying that they will change the scoring in Civ3, cause that milking took more turns than killing or breaking the AI!  I have never milked before, but it just takes too much time.  Had some interesting  research though.  If I should ever milk again, I would have done it completely different with planned city placements!<br />
<br />
If you milk, you don't want any cities with more than 20 citisens!  I didn't lnow that and it costed me about 1500 point I guess.  Happy citisens gives double the score!<br />
<br />
In my next gotm I also want an early setter...</div></div><hr />

Yes, the early settler is very useful. You've conquested the world by other way then I did  but took the excellent result.<br />
I never milk my GOTM because havn't enough time for that. Achieving the early win also gives much fun.<br />
Damn time! I played all GOTMs and was leader (compare with AI) in all of them but ended only 4 because I hadn't time to play. So much work.</div></div><hr />

Waiting for knights was a challenge I gave to myself. I don't think it is a winning strategy.<br />
Anyway, you conquered REALLY early!<br />
Did you change government or stayed in despotism?<br />

Very interesting chart, indeed (with some odd remembrances from Laplace-Gauss and the like, some 40 years ago :crazyeye: )</div></div><hr />

I discovered Monarchy in 690BC and immediately change the government (5 turns). It makes my cities more productive and force its growth. Well, the units supply stands harder but decision of this problem is very simple: more cities, own and alien.;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jove</div><div class="date">Aug 28, 2002, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arrrr, finally had time to submit a game. Looks like other folks are going to blow past me on score. I went for Domination from the start, and thought it would be easier if I allied with the Aztecs vs. everyone else. Looking back, I should've invested more in science to reach Military Tradition sooner, once I finally did get that the game was completely in the bag. I liked the map, it got a little boring at the end, but I was pleasantly surprised that a Regent game could be so fun. Nice pick, Matrix!<br />
btw- I got a settler from the first hut. Built Orleans, dedicated it to the Pyramids. Helped a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pilferman</div><div class="date">Aug 28, 2002, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, for my first GOTM since #1, I didn't do too bad.  I won by domination sometime in the 1800's (I forgot exactly).  While I despise milking games, had I known about Mapstat at the start of this game I would have scored much higher.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
My strategy for this game was the same as it is for my normal games;  fast (peacefull) expansion, improve cities, wait for someone to attack, wreak havoc on aggressor, use left over military for world conquest.  Perhaps I should change my strategy a bit for the next GOTM to see just how high I can score.<br />
<br />
LKendter--Your map looks virtually identical to mine; even with the Germans being the first victim, and even the dates.  You won slightly earlier and with a very slight lead in points.  Congrats, I guess.</div></div><hr />

i beat the aztecs and the russians only to have both of them regenerate.  A wierd thing just happened in my game.  There was a barbarian uprising near one of my cities, but the next turn there appeared to be uprising's in 4 seperate places, each with a stack of 15 barb horseman.  It will be safe to say i will lose all my gold next turn.  That will set me back a bit, but it is still early (270 BC).  I wonder if this happened to anyone else?  Hopefully i can get enough settlers to build cities in the old aztec/russian territory and split the continent in half, which i think would be very advantageous. <br />
<br />
I am very late posting in this, but that is what drove me out of my first attempted GOTM.  I have only played a few games of Civ3 (they take too long &lt;grin&gt;) and I got wiped up in my first attempt.  15 hoursemen showed up in a northern city and wiped me out.<br />
<br />
I restarted (not to submit, but to try) and I managed to hold my own, but I am not aggressive enough and am the smallest of 5 remaining, with a reputation for giving in.  I did beat back the Russains, but whenever the Germans decide to beat on me I will probably be toast so I doubt I will continue.<br />
<br />
I also got barbarians from both goody huts, and all the civs were at war with me.  Not very fun, especially when I have really limited time to do this.  :(<br />
<br />
We need a GOTM series for amatuers.  :)<br />
<br />
The replay went better, and I am not in a bad situation in technology, I just don't think it is worth the time to play out and see if I can manage a win.<br />
<br />
GOTM11 seems a bit too hard for me to tackle, so I will live with possibly trying other games.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andrews</div><div class="date">Sep 01, 2002, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got sucked back in a finished the game.  Since it didn't matter, I restarted at two points:  Once when I got a war with Germany I could avoid before I was really ready, and then when I accidently started a war when I &quot;took&quot; the wrong worker.  (With no warning.)<br />
<br />
I got a spaceship victory in 1999.  Germany had successfully beat up all but the Americans, and was attacking them then.  He probably was almost in a domination victory.  He also was a bit ahead in culture.  I never could place a spy with him.<br />

Started relatively early (around the 20th ;)) and had enough time but as always just finished an hour ago. Close to the deadline. :yeah: :eek:<br />
<br />
A milked game, but very fun until 1800AD nonetheless. But when I tried for a diplo victory, keeping 2 civs alive and 1, the smaller one, unharmed, the stupid, aggressive AI destroyed those plans. :mad:<br />
<br />
I was in good relations with the Iroquese, MPP, RoP and lot´s of trade. But his appreciation went down, despite my constant gifting and trading. After one of the many wars with England, the suddenly decided to abuse the RoP and take one of my cities. They were fully surrounded with a defensive armor line and they attacked with cavalry. Not a singly chance for them. But they tried anyway and when later they surpassed the English, so I had to side with them to win the vote, the same happened with Lizzy.<br />
Traitors, all of them! :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, hope stood till the end, the last vote was perfectly timed to be in 2050AD, but the spaceship also stood ready to be launched.<br />
<br />
But it was yet a long way to go. With the aggressive and senseless behavior of both AI, the turns only got longer and longer. In the end I destroyed most of their terrain improvements, so they couldn´t really build anything, but then they attacked with Longbowman! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
In the end the SS launch movie made up for most of that annoying behavior, unfortunately there is no highest SS award.<br />

Iroquois have disconnected iron and horses at the edge of their country. If we hit them quick and play resource denial, they will slowly crumble after we get chivalry. Their high culture with Oracle also make them a good target since I am uneasy about colonizing land close to them. They shall be our next victim. :D<br />
170AD Redeclare on Aztecs (with 1 city left). They only have an elite spear left.<br />
190AD Aztecs have been vanquished. The RNG quirk causes the first 2 vet horsemen to lose while the 3rd attack using a reg wins :confused: . The idea now is to use pikes and horses to disrupt the Iroquois' improvements as much as possible before building up a substantial offensive force.<br />
260AD We discover Chivalry. Science set to 0 again as we prepare to invade Iroquois who are almost on par with us in tech. Salamanca now has Oracle &amp; Pyramids, which makes it extra yummy. :D<br />
We have also begun to give small per turn tokens to other civs to prevent attacks due to their unreasonable annoyance at us for being the greatest civ on Earth. :love:<br />
300AD Iroquois refuse tribute. War is declared. A city now belongs to us!<br />
390AD We reach Grand River's iron source and pillage it. We get peace knowing that Iroquois can only build mounted warriors (knights are being sent to pillage horse) while we upgrade to knights. They have almost spent all their forces on the defence while we have 20-30 offensive units.<br />
450AD The Iroquois have once again insolently refused to give us what we deserve. War is afoot again! This time, 4 knights are standing by in the East to pillage his horse while 10 swordsmen bear down from the West upon Grand River, defended only by a pike and spear. The road to their iron has not been rebuilt yet, so we are not expecting pikes or swordsmen reinforcements.<br />
Everyone is jealous (annoyed) of us for being the largest civ, even though I am giving 2 gold/turn all round :(.<br />
490AD Our 10 swordsmen were decimated down to 3 in a series of unlucky attacks on Grand River.<br />
520AD We hit a production barrier at aqueducts and should have sent a few more workers to work on core cities.<br />
Grand River stands (for the moment) with an elite pike :mad:. We reluctantly give them peace for Theology.<br />
570AD Sevastopol comes to us :D<br />
590AD We assemble a grand army of 13 knights outside Salamanca (defended by 2 spears). The Iroquois are in deep sh*t.<br />
600AD An ELITE knight attacks the last spear in Salamanca. &lt;incredulous voice&gt; The knight retreats without causing a single point of damage! &lt;/incredulous voice&gt; 1.1% chance. Has anyone actually checked that the combat rolls are not biased??! At this point in time, I want to strangle Sid Meier. (just joking) <br />
690AD Salamanca deposes and we lose 4 knights. We are prepared for this contingency and retake it immediately but lose 1 more elite knight.<br />
770AD Unbelievable...the Iroquois attacked our knight with a longbow and after the knight retreated and the longbow got stranded in the open, the Iroquois disbanded it!<br />
780AD Napoleon appears!! We overtake the Iroquois in culture and are in the lead!<br />
900AD Oh well, time out. Our score is almost double the next civ. Still a measly 1000 compared to some of the other GOTM players I'm sure... Learnt a bit about waging continuous wars in this game ;)</div></div><hr />

I got a few moments worth capturing, too, but I didn´t, due to time constraints. :eek:<br />
<br />
The best things were the Iroquese using parachuters! But just landing in their OWN territory, on railroad. And of course their attacks with Longbowmen against my Mech. Inf and Modern Armor, because I had destroyed all their roads. :lol:<br />
<br />
But that´s nothing compared to inexplainable aggressiveness and unfairness of the AI. Sneak attacks were the ONLY way to start a war, abusing RoPs and MPPs.<br />
And of course they were furious a few turns later, when I had demolished all of their puny attack forces in my territory and had not set one foot on their soil! :rolleyes:<br />
