A little over a year earlier(late 1774) she suppressed the Pugachev Rebellion(serfs wanted more freedom, didn't get it). At the same time her first Russo-Turkish war ended, giving Russia the Crimea. Her second Russo-Turkish War was in 1787-1792, giving Russia other Black Sea areas. <br />
between 1767 and 1795(i think) Poland was split up bewteen Russia(1767), Prussia(1792), and Austria(1795) Catherine took parts of Ukraine, Belorussia, Finland, and Lithuania between 1770-1780. Luckily for you, I just did a project on Catherine 2 weeks ago and I still known this stuff. They started colonizing Alaska around this time, too.<br />
<br />
Spain &quot;borrowed&quot; Louisiana, French leased it to them to avoid losing it in the French-Indian War against Britain.<br />

There were still colonies all over the world, but the wars they faught cost a lot of money, and the great profits they got in the 17th century, were dropping fastly. In 1789 there was the French revolution, in 1795 a Dutch revolution, backed up by the French. You may want to add that, I think your scenario will cover a few years. <br />
<br />
Did you know that the American Independence Declaration was based on the letter the Dutch nobles sent to Margaretha of Parma (Filip II's sister) to claim their indepenency?<br />

This information came my way from my friend Jesus Munoz Fernandez, who you may know is a fine scenario designer, who translated the following for me from a very boring book he had on the subject. You will have to look up the exact dates, but it shouldn't be to hard. Spain was ruled by Charles the III in 1776. 1779 Spain Declares war on britain. Spainish officer Matis de Galvez takes Ft. San Fernando de Omoa in Honduras1780 English Admiral Rodney defeats Juan de Langara's Spanish fleet at the seige of Gibraltar. Bonet attempts to take Pensacola from Britain and fails. Ft. Carlotta at Mobile surrenders to Bernardo de Galvez (brother of Matis, and commander of Spain's forces in the New World). Second Spanish attempt at Pensacola fails as the fleet is sunk in a hurricane.1781 Spain takes Ft. St. Joseph on lake Michigan. Bernardo de Galvez takes Pensacola from the British. Bernardo de Galvez sends troops to South America to put down revolts.1782 Britain surrenders Menorca to the Duke of Crillon Most fighting ends.1783The war ends. It will take some doing to see what Portugal was up to at the time. Remember also, that Cathrine of Russia and Frederick of Prussia were quite old at this time. I hope this helps in some way.<br />

<br />
What about Dutch settlements in America. Were there any famous settlements at that time that did a lot of trade or cooperation with American Colonists? Also, where were the other Dutch colonies in the world? <br />
<br />
I am going to include the letter. I think it is important to have a reality check for Americans and where the ideas come from. <br />
<br />
AoA, <br />
<br />
Your events for the Spanish will be an excellent addition to the scenario...I do need the info on the Portuguese, especially their naval situation...I know they were some of the greatest navigators in the world for the period.<br />
<br />
To everyone, unfortunately I only have room for 7 civs: American, British, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian. I will include the actions of other countries in the pop-up text for major events. I am building the world population that is not represented by the civs as the Barbarians (I'll change their name to Natives or Local Population) and I am giving the cities local city names.<br />
<br />
AoA,<br />
<br />
When did the Portuguese colonize Brazil? Also, someone had colonies in N.Africa...who?<br />
<br />

<br />
Second, I need some famous war Generals or leaders that I can use...so far, I am using Cornwallis, Washington, Lord Howe, Napoleon, John Paul Jones, Benedict Arnold...<br />
<br />
I need Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, and Dutch figures in history 1776-1830. <br />
<br />
I think I am going to make this scenario mission based, rather than using traditional Civ II scoring or objectives...nothing else seems feesible at this point. Also, it would make sense to write-in different objectives for each nation, so that game play could be varied and you would have the chance to play from different national perspectives.<br />
<br />
If eveything works out...every nation gets to interact with America at some point...and then you get to decide if you can change history or not!<br />
<br />
That's the idea...hehe...<br />
<br />
willemvanoranje, I'm relying on you to inform me about great Dutch countrymen of that time, AoA thanks for Josef I, but who was his daughter? Was Portugal a Monarchy throughout?(I tried that website but there is a lot of it in Portuguese it seemed for the parts I wanted to know..haha).<br />

Her husband was named Pedro III, who ruled as her consort. Maria had shown signs of religious mania and became totally insane after 1788. Her son acted as ruler for her, and became King John VI on her death in 1816. I don't know your map's areas, but the Portugese had colonies in the Azores, in Guinea in the new world, as well as their African colonies on the Gold coast and Luanda. Since I now know your time frame, I can help a little with the Portuguese navy, as of 1795: 11 Ships of the line, none of larger then 74 guns. 10 Frigates, and numerious smaller ships. Most of this fleet fled with the Royal family to Brazil in 1807 to escape the French. During the American Revolutionary War, the British maintained a squadron at Lisbon, but I know of no times when Portugese ships engaged in any action. <br />

<br />
Kevin, if you can get the names of Trading posts in America that would be helpful, because then I could load them with merchants too...(Basically, if you play the Dutch, you will be playing economically...I will try to build the Dutch wealth so that you can buy cities as opposed to military take over-it could be a fun strategy). <br />
<br />
AoA, thanks for the names...this should be very helpful...Now, let me get this straight...The bulk of the Portuguese navy ended up in Brazil at the turn of the century...that means that my idea to give the Portuguese a large navy headed to Brazil is going to work out after all. I can load those ships with merchants too. I can also put a few Portuguese cities along the west African coast now...very good.<br />
<br />
To everyone, I still need more info on the Russian, Spanish, Dutch famous generals or leaders that I can use as units...actually, I have tentative unit choices but they need names.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to work this scenario so that you get a special leader or general to help you win your war...this way...you can have a real powerful unit at the front, and it's more historical feeling that way.<br />

I mean, will it be the whole world, or just the Americas with Europe and Africa? Will it include India, where Britain, France, Portugal, and Holland all had interests during the 1770s? What time frame do you want the leaders from? BTW, Dutch influence ended in the 17th century in New York, when Peter Sytvasant surrendered New Amsterdam to Britain, more then 100 years before the American Revolution, and it was renamed New York. If you want leaders for France and Russia, as well as Britain and Spain, from what time period? The Napoleonic period begins in 1789, only a few years after 1776. If you can tell me exactly what you want, I'm sure I can find what your looking for.<br />

The leader, name him Emel'ian Pugachev, and his little followers something like revolters or rebels(they can actually be used everywhere as &quot;barbarians&quot;. I only know one Russian guy you could use as a leader, and thats Grigory Orlov. He helped Catherine overthrow Peter and he was head of the Russian Imperial Guard. One more thing, do you think you could start it in 1774, just so you can add the Pugachev Rebellion? It would be pretty cool, because he actually took over some Russian cities(in the southern Ural Mts.) .This would add more challenge for the Russian side(and if it spreads beyond Russia, who knows?)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Apr 10, 2001, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry AoA, I just realized I forgot to tell everyone the premise for this scenario...my mistake...uhem...here it goes...<br />
<br />
The name of the scenario is:<br />
 &quot;Birth of America&quot;<br />
<br />
The setting is the entire world. A world map is used and yes, AoA, India will be present. It is meant to be a mission based scenario so objectives and traditional civ scoring will not be used. Time period is 1776 to 1850. You will have less than 75 years to do something. Each civ will have a different goal to complete depending upon which one you choose. If you choose America, obviously to become independent. If you choose Great Britain, keep the colonies and expand the British Empire...and so on. If you are Dutch on the other hand, you may have the objective to control a continent by economics (hence, buying all the cities)...<br />
<br />
I've played four revolutionary war scenarios (downloaded others but couldn't get into them) and my biggest complaint has been that these scenarios are too biased as to the stability of the colonies in America. In fact, it is a miracle and poor war management that lost the war for the British. Quite frankly, they just didn't take the colonies seriously enough about the war to waste good money on it...they were costly to maintain and didn't really serve viably after the first 100 years had passed. <br />
<br />
So, to make a long story short...there were many other factors that are far more interesting during the Birth of America that have not been explored to their fullest. At any rate, any other European power with the motivation could have seized the U.S. after it's war with Britain. I want to create that atmosphere with historical events up until 1850. 1790-1820 is the point I expect to make the U.S. up for grabs if you are playing any other civ and you have been paying attention to the scenario pop ups.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, anyway...that is what I want to do...<br />
<br />
You can consider this scenario: American Revolution: World Theater- I suppose.<br />
<br />
And, I might add that I expect to make everyone expansionist in attitude to reflect the imperialism of the time period.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squirrel2004</div><div class="date">Apr 10, 2001, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, what your saying, is that you can buy cities? i.e. - Americans buying New Orleans, St. Louis, and other 'Louisianna Purchase' cities? The Russians objective(actually really just Catherine's) - Modernize and Westerize Russia. Start them out with barely any improvements built and not as many techs as other nations and you have to raise literacy%, lower disease%, advance to the level of other nations, build libraries, universities, cathedrals, umm...something like a hospital, etc. That is what Catherine the Great started to really do during her reign (1762-1796). Her son took over after her death and he continued to do that until I think the 1820s or around when Napolean was closing in on Russia.<br />

Well, the Dutch had New Amsterdam a while, but the English traded it and called it New York. Dutch colonies? I'm not sure I know all of them; there were a lot of small trade posts. I'll try to look it up. <br />
<br />
I am sure of SURINAM in northern South-America, capital city Paramaribo. On Curaçao, there was the city Willemstad, and we might had control over Aruba, Bonaire, St. Estasius, St. Martin and Saba as well, but the last three are very small islands; Saba has 2000 inhabitants.<br />
<br />
The Dutch had a great part of the Brazilian coast as well. But'I'll try to give you more details later.<br />

<br />
Ceylon (Sri Lanka) was entirely Dutch<br />
<br />
The Dutch built an island next to Japan for trade; the Dutch were the only ones who were allowed to trade with Japan for a long time.<br />
<br />
Indonesia was entirely Dutch<br />
<br />
There were trade posts in Middle-East, India, China. I'll try to look them up for you.<br />
<br />
Colonies in Africa.<br />
<br />
New Amsterdam was already in English hands in the 17th century, so...<br />
<br />
There are plenty of Dutch sea-war heroes in that time. I'll send information about the most important to you.<br />
<br />
In 1839, Belgium declared itself independent from the Dutch after a few days of war. The Dutch king kept sending troops but he never succeeded to reconquer Belgium.<br />

Any other info for any of these civs is still helpful too...I don't want to leave important events out that I can use to make the scenario better...<br />
<br />
Also, I think it's important for the balance of play...I suspect that playing the Russians and Portuguese will be the hardest...but then again playing the Americans will take a completely different strategy as well...<br />

<br />
I also have to tell you that in 1780 (until 1784), the English declared war on the Dutch. The Dutch lost the war and their fleet was almost entirely destroyed. <br />
<br />
In 1795, there was a revolution in Holland. Patriots started to take over land from 'Stadhouder' (cityholder) Willem V. These patriots got help from the French, and Holland was ruled by the French until after Napoleon (1815). Because of this, the English declared war on the Dutch again (they were at war with the French). In 1797, the Dutch fleet lost a seabattle against the English near the Dutch coast. In 1799, the English, backed up by Russian forces, invaded the Netherlands, but they invaders lost. In the same war ALL colonies were taken by the English, except for Java. In 1801, a peace treaty was signed, and the 'Batavian Republic' got its colonies back. <br />
In 1806, Holland got a new king; Louis-Napoleon, a cousin of Napoleon Bonaparte. He once said 'Ik ben konijn van Holland', which means 'I am rabbit of Holland'. He wanted to say: 'Ik ben koning van Holland', which means 'I am king of Holland.' (maybe a nice event text?)<br />
<br />
In 1815, Napoleon lost the battle at Waterloo. Belgium, Holland and Luxemburg became one country; the kingdom of Holland. The king was Willem I (stadhouder Willem VI). The Dutch economy was growing again, and there was wealth and work. Road and Canal projects were started and completed everywhere, and even a few railway tracks were build (first one between Haarlem and Amsterdam in 1839)<br />
The Belgians weren't very happy. There were not enough Belgian people in the government, and the king had no intention of changing that. The Belgian Independence War began in 1830 (not 1839, sorry) in Brussels. Leopold I proclaimed king of Belgium. In 1839, the Dutch government recognized the Belgian independency.  In 1840, Willem II became  the new king of Holland. During his reign, the industrialization really began. But politically, Willem II was stupid and weak. He gave up almost all his rights and privileges, and the General-States (something like the American congress) had almost all the power, but they had to listen to the voters as well. <br />
<br />
In 1849, Willem III became king of Holland. <br />
But I think I read that your scenario only goes until 1850, so....<br />
<br />
Conclusion: the Netherlands were politically highly unstable in that time period.<br />

Not that it was a very succesfull invasion or anything but since St. Petersburg (which ofcourse was the Russian Capital) was just next to the swedish border...<br />
The sultan of the Ottomans declared war at the same time.<br />
The swedish king was really not allowed to start any wars (after the fall of Sweden as a great power in 1718 the absolutism of the king was abolished) so what the swedish king Gustav the III did was to dress up some swedish soldiers in &quot;cosack&quot; cloths that he had the royal dressmakers in Stockholm make and then these discuised soldiers attacked a swedish outpost.<br />
Thus the king didn't declare war becouse he concluded that the Russians had &quot;sneak attacked&quot; him (in civ terms).</div></div><hr />

Some info:<br />
The Spanish empire in America, in XVIII century get its biggest size, it expanded from North California, Lousiana (it was ceded by French as compensation for the lost of Florida in the Seven years war and it was give one more time to France in 1802) to South Argentina. Too we have colonies in Asia (Philippines, in Pacific Ocean (Guam, Marianas,Carolinas...), North Africa and in 1778 Portugal ceded the islands of Fernando Poo and Annobon in the Guinean gulf and Portugal get the Colony of Sacramento and the islnad of Santa Catalina in South America.<br />

Hi Chris!!!! yes I think that it is a nice site http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif, this forum about Scenario creation is very, very interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WELCOME K! Any info on Spain is appreciated. Also, Portugal if possible. I'm glad to see that everyone is getting into this because I think it will be an important scenario. This time period was very unstable for the USA and there were a lot imperial powers looking for a good place to land. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the Commander AoA...this will help tremendously. I may have to do this scenario as MGE, or I may have to go to multi-events, because the events are getting long.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

P.S. I noticed a &quot;Valdes&quot; in that command list...hmmm...I wonder...<br />

Sweden and Turkey will make agression on Russia, so then it will be very difficult to play as Russia.</div></div><hr />

Another *important* British leader was General John Burgoyne who was defeated at Saratoga, NY in 1777 and which led to the French Alliance with the colonies in 1778. Spain allied with France in 1779, and in 1780 Russia led the formation of the League of Armed Neutrality. This of course meant that Britain was diplomatically isolated for the first time in the 18th century and was eventually fighting everyone.</div></div><hr />
