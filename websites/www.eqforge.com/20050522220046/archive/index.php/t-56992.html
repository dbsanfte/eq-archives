Odds are I wont be at this TC,since Ill be trying to un-pasty white nerd myself poolside. If I'm there, I failed and Ihave a laptop with me.<br />
No real instructions here other then to find the missing people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the unlikely event we finish researching Currency or trade for it this chat, set the research target to Theology.  There has not been enough time for a poll on this, but the overwhelming sentiment in the discussion thread appears to be a beeline for Democracy.  If it has to be changed to Republic (the only other choice getting support) that can be done any time before the number of beakers needed for Republic have been gathered, without penalty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we continue with the Turn chat my instructions are thus...<br />
<br />
I STRONGLY suggest (since this part is more Domestic) pop-rushing (maybe a worker) or starving Memphis to get it down to 1 pop ASAP.<br />
<br />
Keep 3 Legions in Memphis and no more until it's down to size 1, then pile in all the Legions in the area (including those between Memphis and Lake Asphinxia), trying to get 17 units in there.<br />
<br />
Other then that nothing of greater note, just generally start shifting from Legions to Horsemen production (to get Knights).</div></div><hr />

I agree, if we are to try to keep Memphis the population has to go down quickly.  If a worker can be built quickly without pop-rushing, that would be a better course.  Personally I wouldn't put more than 1 legion inside until the pop goes down, but will leave that to the people actually on the chat to decide.<br />
<br />
We need libraries in order to pursue the fast tech track to spaceship.  If we're not going to Chivalry then building horsemen would be a lower priority.  Again, might have to let the chat attendees decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 27, 2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the chat has been cancelled due to lack of interest.  Please go to the first post for the game save.  It hasn't changed.<br />
<br />
We have two important issues open:<br />
<br />
A possible switch to Monarchy(poll has been opened for at least a day and is only 3-3).<br />
<br />
What to do about Memphis?  No poll posted, plenty of options for this predicament.<br />
<br />
Also, This has been the last chat of Term 2 .  I am hoping that we will take the time to adequately discuss the issues at hand so that the new administration has a clear idea which way to progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This comes of too many people knowing the formula for PI.  Once burned, always careful...   :(<br />
<br />
I would support a law that makes a distinction between acting against the clear will of the people, vs. acting where there is no clear direction.  The 2nd is not a failure of the DP, if anything it is a failure of other leaders to act quickly enough to get advice and consent from the people.  The law should also explicitly state that actions must be purposeful to make an individual liable.  No DP should ever be in fear of taking some small amount of initiative, nor should they live in constant fear of a finger twitch hitting the wrong key or letting up on the mouse in the wrong place!</div></div><hr />
