<br />
If we're in it for the long haul then we should waste no time in autorazing the cities in our way.<br />
<br />
If we're looking for a few cities and then peace we should decide which cities are worth avoiding/keeping, and which ones we'd like to burn and resettle.<br />
<br />
Personally, I never like to leave enemies after war this early in the game, if I have the opportunity to take them out with out puting our civ to far behind.</div></div><hr />

Since the Legonares are like a Dual Swordsmen and Spearmen. They can be used to occupy the city during the time of war.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After assessing our military standing, we may not be in bad shape.  We have a Barracks in Aureus and 360g to burn so we should be able to upgrade some of our troops near the frontlines immediately.  <br />
<br />
I recommend backpedaling the two warriors that are guarding our workers just north of Aureus once we get one of our fast-approaching Legions to protect them. I would also like to see the Warrior just south of that group stop in for upgrade as well.<br />
<br />
My only concern for our safety is the city of Aureus itself.  As you can see from CivGeneral's map, there is an Egyptian Warrior just east of the city that is poised to attack next turn.  We are only defending Aureus with a Warrior, but the city enjoys the defense bonus of a hill.<br />
<br />
If our Warrior successfully defends the city next turn, we are fine.  If not, we have to scramble with a major Plan B as that city would most likely be auto-razed.  My hope is that the Egyptian Warrior will attack our Warrior NE of Aureus.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I would consider doing differently is sending our troops on the road past Aureus en route to Byblos.  I believe we have enough units in the area to consider attacking both cities simultaneously.<br />
<br />
@Eklektikos - I would consider implementing your plan for the Size 1 cities that lie north of the hills, but unfortunately I think that El Amarna and Byblos will have to go.  I don't want our troops to encounter any distractions on the way to the Egyptian heartland.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can do that for you right now, Fier, as I was the one who said it.  ;)  Egypt is actually still building the Pyramids in Heliopolis.  I have no idea how far along Egypt is compared to Greece(the only other Civ working on it as of 570 BC; 5 civs working on it now), but the terrain of Heliopolis seems to give Egypt the inside track on this Wonder.<br />
<br />
Thanks for mentioning that, Fier.  It is a very important aspect of our military campaign that should not be overlooked.</div></div><hr />

Thanks DZ :).<br />
<br />
I was thinking about attacking both cities at the same time, though I would see the resistment from other people saying &quot;I dont want to see our army split into two&quot;. But with the pyrimids being built, We can create some sourt of Blockade to trap Heliopolis untill they have built there wonder, then we can strike Heliopolis and the Pyrimid.</div></div><hr />

I would suggest sending one or two units ahead of our invading army in order to disconect and possibly defend (legions do have 3 defense) the house resource to prevent more war chariots.</div></div><hr />

However, I would like to see that horse resource disconnected in some way.  I think we should go as close to the kill as possible, as Egypt is our nearest neighbor.  Because they are so close, they need to be nuetered or destroyed so that our growth won't be inhibited.  I think this is agood, solid plan. :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

We currently have 5 Legionnaries and have 4 Warriors near the town of Aureus, which has a Barracks.  General Falcon has plans to upgrade these within the next two turns.  There a few other Warriors that can be upgraded soon and sent to the front lines.<br />
<br />
I am going to try to convince General Falcon and CivGeneral to split up our men momentarily to allow for a simultaneous strike on El Armana and Byblos, with our troops converging at Byblos to continue the campaign at full power.  This will be the quickest way for us to reach the hills just south of the Egyptian mainland, and will give us a great defensive opportunity before the true campaign begins.<br />
<br />
Sending some troops thru the road near Aureus will also be the quickest way to assess just exactly what Egypt will be throwing our way, and what we should do next..</div></div><hr />
