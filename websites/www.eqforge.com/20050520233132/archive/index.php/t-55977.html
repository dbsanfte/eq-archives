<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 15, 2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to help Fanatica place cities in a logical order, we need to discuss, as a nation, where to place the Forbidden Palace. Or if we're even going to build the Forbidden Palce.<br />
<br />
There are three possible areas that would be feasible now, or in the near future. 1. If we place it Southeast of the proposed city site of Crecent Mountain, we can benefit cities on both sides of that large bay. 2. A possible plaement on the land mass to the East. Just East of the Dyes that are 5 tiles South of Regia Doughnutia, in the hills and grasslands. 3. The other area would be Memphis, or just Southwest of it, if Memphis razes. We would have to take Cleo out of the picture with this placement.<br />
<br />
To me these seem to be the best areas to consider. Monty is moving in from the East, and there's not much land over there so option #2 may not be worth the chance. Option #3 would be great, but would commit us to clearing the area of Egyptians (not a bad idea ;) ) and stabilizing the area. If we expand Westward quickly, Option #1 appears to be the easiest and fastest choice.<br />
<br />
What are your suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vander</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd prefer option 1.  Safety first and all that.  If we try to settle to the east, there is a larger risk of enemy attacks against our newly created (conquered) cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a hard call. Option 1 allows us to settle our western lands and this might be urgent as there might be several non-discovered civs closing who could be running out of land. But I don't think it is the best place for a FP. It's on a part of our Empire which will not grow in land-size. If we ever need to move our Palace to a far away location we'd be stuck with a hardly useful FP. <br />
<br />
But if we don't do it there we might loose our backgarden to other Civs. <br />
<br />
If we choose the site near Regia Doughnutia it has the same problems as site 1, but to a lesser extend. <br />
<br />
Memphis is nicely placed for it, but could be too dangerous in wartime. It would allow to shift our Palace to a different continent, if we ever need to do that. <br />
<br />
In the end, since we are aiming for a Space Victory I would choose option 1, but it is a very hard call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If all ends up perfectly, the our empire will stretch from the far west(all of the land) all the way to where our Warrior was dropped off by the Aztecs.  Our northern border could run through Lake Asphinxia, as that would be easiest to defend.  We could of course have a few cities beyond that point, but I really don't believe they will be as useful if we are to take advantage of our elongated land mass.   This is why I am so opposed to this war going on much further.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I am thinking that Gorina and Regia Doughnutia(or a site slightly SE) would probably be the best spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard to tell, as I'm not familiar at all with the geography.  But I do think we should plan on building a Forbidden Palace.<br />
<br />
Isn't Gorina near our capital?  Why build our FP there?  Are we moving our capital or am I just confused?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strider</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Option 1 sounds like the best....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There hasn't been much discussion on this subject and I'd like to get the ball rolling again. <br />
<br />
Option #1 seems to have drawn the most favor in this thread. Is that what we should be planning for? Are we able to get a Settler over to the West end of our nation? Do we have time to build the Forbidden Palace?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If we focus we can send settlers to the western part of Esquiline province. The workers around Skunkworks could continue building roads to the west which aids our settlers. Cities near the West could put a settler at the beginning of their buildqueues to generate settlers fast. It seems the sea could keep persian and chinese settlers away or at least delay them for a while. The Babylonian cities are nearly all small. That could be very good news, or very very bad news. <br />
<br />
Another option is to send some fast moving horsemen to block off attempts to settle, or even attack them (in very desperate cases). <br />
<br />
With our Canal in place we have a good lock on our backyard, but I prefer our backyard as well. <br />
<br />
I generally think we can get the western part of Esquiling province still, but we need to work hard on that. And if we do have some savages camping in our backyard cultural pressure could flip them to us, but not very soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I'd like to see the FP somewhere near the smoldering remains of Egypt, perhaps north of it.  Ideally, we'll conquer all of our continent one day, and that would be the best place to ensure that the continent will have a contingent of workable cities. <br />
<br />
As I see it, it won't be until the age of tanks that we'll be going after the other continents.  The benefits of a far western FP would be realized far too late in the Modern Age.  An eastern FP as a base for our operations to overtake the rest of our continent would be best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which brings up the question:  do we really need to take over the rest of the continent?  I think we have a solid city base right now, and should build the FP within the borders we currently have.  I stand by my previous assessment from two weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should say yes, we do need to conquer this continent.  I can seriously say that any type of victory would be difficult if we were to confine ourselves to a small plot of our land mass.  We need the valuable resources for ourselves, not from an AI's trade route.  It would be suicidal not to one day control the glourious continent we call home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oct X: I think our land and our number of cities are sufficient to win. If we claim the west of Esquiline and all of the peninsula near Regia Doughtnut (perhaps up to the lake) we'll have more than we need. And number of cities is not that important. How else can people win by 5CC or other limit city-strategies. <br />
<br />
First claim what is ours, go peacefully and trading to Democracy and then continue with the ToE-Hoover jump and we'll be fine. We have all the land we need now. <br />
<br />
And: I like the FP to be just west of the Canal-cities. With that area and the Capitoline area as the 2 major power-houses we are well under way to victory. <br />
<br />
But, but, but.... if we do not get the whole western part of Esquiline then I'm not sure the FP should be located there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Octavian, in one thread you're calling for peaceful resolution under a Republic, and then in the next thread you're calling for conquest of our continent by total war. Which is it? What do you really want? We need to stop this constant moving in two directions all the time. Prioritize your needs and then come back.</div></div><hr />

Though I will be content with option 2, as it does have its benefeits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going for more of a war-time republic, thank you.  :p<br />
<br />
Seriously, it is possible to fight a good war with a Republic's low war weariness.  That is the approach I advocate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless we are planning on taking cities from across the sea, I really don't think that Option 1 is the best way to go here.  Of our three major chunks of land, the farthest west one is the smallest.  An FP there will not be used to its full effect.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, an FP near Regia Doughnutia would greatly reduce corruption on our secord-largest patch of land(maybe the largest) and would allow any cities we take from Egypt or the Aztecs in the distant future to benefit as well.  To facilitate this, we can consider moving the Palace to Gorina.<br />
<br />
psssst......Octavian, no war for awhile.  Let's maximize what we have.</div></div><hr />

The next game play session is two days away.  We need a poll on where to build the Forbidden Palace.<br />
<br />
Here are the sires proposed so far:<br />
<br />
Bootia<br />
Gorina<br />
Klixus-Major<br />
Memphis<br />
near the smoldering remians of Egypt<br />
New Jedina<br />
Regia Doughnutia<br />
Southeast of the proposed city site of Crecent Mountain<br />
south of Bootia<br />
west of Esquiline Canal cities<br />
<br />
Note that some sites do not have a city yet!  I'm not sure where Crecent Mountain was supposed to be...<br />
<br />
Should we add any other sites or cities to the list?  I'd like to get a poll up soon.  Do we need an abstain option?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The site SE of Crescent Mountain would be Noldodan's City.</div></div><hr />

We do not have to hang on to out dated and useless traditions.  One tradition we should hang onto is the one where we recognized the right of any citizen to post polls.  It doesn't matter who posts it as long as it's posted.  :)  If neither Cyc nor CG posts the poll soon I'll be glad to do it.
