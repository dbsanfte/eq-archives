to calm down our people, i would like all nations in our world to accept fanatican rule. this would mean that the nations could keep their sovereign status, but have to accept that all newly conquered lands will be automatically assigned to fanatica.<br />
<br />
the price fanatica will be willing to pay for this will be peace. nothing more. will you accept?</div></div><hr />

i believe so.<br />
reports of our secret service showed that the people of little italy did indeed mainly drive the counter-revolution to depose the italshuret dictatorship. they will be under close survey though and if any evidence for a close link to the revolution will be detected they will take the consequences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sergei: I said, I declined!! Do you need any thing more!<br />
<br />
Vladmirus: Sorry sir, I will tell the Despotess<br />
<br />
Vladmirus talks to Bellona about the declanation. Soon Bellona left in a hurry. Vladmurus's Nightmare has came true. Soon Vladmirus starts to plot his own sucide. In the Evening, when everyone was sleeping. Vladmirus has slit his neck with a very sharp stone dagar. Vladmirus died from lack of Blood in his system. Vladmirus's corpse lyes lifeless in the Prince's Chamber</div></div><hr />

<br />
Caeser Jade: Jade Commandos, we have recived word to remove the torn from Fanatica's side. Sergi is still alive, but the where abouts of Vladmirus is still unknown.<br />
<br />
Mara Jade III: What are we going to do with Sergi when we do meat up with him<br />
<br />
Caeser Jade: Pulls out an Stone Dagar Kill him with this<br />
<br />
Mara Jade III: How did you get that?<br />
<br />
Caeser Jade: It was a Gift from a freind who is happen to be related to us now. Enough with Family affairs, its time to take Sergi down.<br />
<br />
Mara Jade III: Right, and Ill fight beside you, A Cusion must protect another Cusion. Since I noticed Bellona was looking at you, in a romantic way.<br />
<br />
Caeser Jade: Yeah, I have noticed. <br />
<br />
Soon Caeser Jade, His cusion Mara Jade III, and the Jade commandos follow along<br />
<br />
Caeser Jade: Mara, you and 10 Warriors are to take down 5 Armed Villagers, The reason that there are 5 is that some of them have defected back to Fanatica's side, and Ill take care of Sergi.<br />
<br />
Mara Jade: Right</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">May 23, 2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Jade commandos aproach to Little Italy's Borders. Caeser and Mara Jade III carefully snuck past the primative farm lands to avoid being detected by any rebel.They aproach to a FOrtress, a poorly built one on the count we are just researching on Masonary<br />
<br />
Mara Jade III: Who ever built this must have doen a sloopy job<br />
<br />
Soon 2 Armed Pesant noticed Mara Jade III and starts to run up to her with his pitch fork rased. Caeser Jade in the nick of time noticed them from the corner of his eye<br />
<br />
Caeser: Mara! Duck!!<br />
<br />
Mara ducked and triped one of the Armed Villagers. The pitch fork was lost in the overgrowth.<br />
<br />
Zelious Rebel Villager: You will die in the hands of Little Italy!!<br />
<br />
The Rebel Villager rases his fists and fights Mara. Mara returns the hit with a Kick, knocking the villager out. Caeser pulled an old tree root and trips the other villager making him fall onto a large rock. Soon they Enter Sergi's Fortress. Mara Noticed the dead corps of Vladmirus in the other room. She heads into the room and picks up the Stone dagar<br />
<br />
Mara Jade III: Would you think Sergi did this?<br />
<br />
Caeser Jade: Looks more like Suicide, Sergi would not kill his own kin and family.<br />
<br />
Soon Sergi walks into the Hall outside Vladmirus's room. Caeser flags Mara to get ready. Mara then picks up Vladmirus's Dagar<br />
<br />
Sergi: Ahh, I have been Expecting you two, Too bad you would not see the hight of my empire.<br />
<br />
Caeser Jade: Stop Talking! Caeser said in a angry tone<br />
<br />
Sergi: Ahh yes, you could have been one of us. But you had to be a loyalist.<br />
<br />
Caeser Jade: For the last time, Stop Talking! Caeser said angerly through his teeth. Quit talking or Ill strike you down!<br />
<br />
Mara Jade III reaches for her dagar and the one she picked up from Vladmirus's room<br />
<br />
Sergi: Ahh a challenge Sergi pulls outa Bronze Sword. Caeser takes the bronze sword that is on Sergi's display mount. Mara Jade III possitions herself to throw the dagars. Caeser rases his eyebrow at Mara, signaling her to throw the dagars. Mara tosses a dagar, it then strikes Sergi's Leg<br />
<br />
Sergi: Gah!!, My leg!<br />
<br />
Sergi beguins to limp to Caeser Jade. Mara then throws another dagar to his arm. The dagar strikes Sergi's Right Hand, Sergi's Fighting hand that he used for sword play, then he droped his sword on the floor<br />
<br />
Sergi: Gah, My hand! I have a confession to make<br />
<br />
Caeser: And that is?<br />
<br />
Sergi: I have never mastered the art of Swordsmenship. I have only aquired Street Fighting skills<br />
<br />
Sergi struggles to get his sword. Caeser Jade walks up to the sword and kicks it away from him. Enranged, Sergi tries to punch Caeser with his only good hand, Mara Jade III noticed this and kicked him. Sergi tries to fight back but he spins around and faces Caeser. Caeser then thrusts the Sword into Sergi's heart<br />
<br />
Sergi: Ugh!! You will... ...never... ...here the last of... *Gasp*<br />
<br />
Sergi is dead on the floor. Caeser Jade soon takes down the hidious Little Italy Flag. The Villagers of Little Italy noticed the flag coming down<br />
<br />
Villager#1: Heh, well, looks like Little Italy is no more, its bets that I should be heading hoe<br />
<br />
Villager#2: Same here, I am getting the feeling that Sergi is just a nutcase<br />
