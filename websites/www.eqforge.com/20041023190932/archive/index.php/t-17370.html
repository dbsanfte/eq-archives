Hopefully this can take off too although I know War scenarios tend to be more popular. Who want's to play......<br />
<br />
Star Wars Insurrection version 1.2R<br />
<br />
This scenario takes place before 'A New Hope' and does not follow the traditional triology storyline. Insurrection takes place before Luke Skywalker emerges and the Deathstar battlestation is left uncompleted. There is no Battle of Yavin or Battle of Endor. The rest of the storyline will reveal itself once you play your first turn. You may play as the New Republic(most challenging), the Galactic Empire or the Second Imperium(relaxing game). Your objective is of course to wipe out the other two major factions. The remaining races can be played except for the pathetic Pacifists. <br />

<br />
The map is not small but a lot of it is empty space. As for the units, you only start off with a few and the remainder appear gradually with many become obsolete along the way. You can only build a third of the units as a particular tribe anyway. Perhaps you might reconsider?</div></div><hr />

Since I never played such kind of things, could you just describe briefly, how to play? What must I do then? (btw, I have ToT) <br />
<br />
First off you need to patch your TOT so it becomes Civ2 MGE. You can find out how by going here.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2cedric.shtml<br />
<br />
Then you need to download the scenario which is located here (16th from the top I think).<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2scensci.shtml<br />
<br />
Then try to play the scenario as a single player first to confrim everything is ok. When you have done all that, the rest of what you need to kow is in the FAQ or you can ask more specific questions in this thread again.<br />
<br />
News of your success is eagerly awaited.</div></div><hr />

Rebel Alliance - pap1723 <br />

<br />
p.s. it is not mentioned in the FAQ (yet) but if you trigger event messages which are important, it is you duty to mention it in the thread as the other players will not know about the event automatically.<br />

<br />
Everything is taken from the star wars novels - which are considered canon unlike in the star trek world. I suppose you could describe the Second Imperium as a military coup. Not being a star wars fan, I have never read any of them myself but there are plenty of websites which have all the info required extracted properly - see these websites.<br />

Unless one of you can get to it first, the GE will soon unlock its secrets (I can't remember what is is anymore but something good I beleive) . BTW, if you get any event announcement, you should repeat it for the other players.<br />
<br />
and in case anyone was wondering who Xizor is, this is what the SW encyclopedia has to say.<br />
<br />
the Falleen crimelord who taught Durga the Hutt, at one time he employed Ket Maliss as a bounty hunter. Xizor was the son of a local Falleen king, and grew up to power and riches. Some years before the Battle of Hoth, Darth Vader killed much of Xizor's family on Falleen, when a military bacterium got loose and started killing the Falleen. Rather than risk an outbreak, Vader had his starships raze an entire city and its environs, including nearly two hundred thousand Falleen. Xizor lost his parents, a brother and two sisters, and three uncles in the destruction. He held a grudge against Vader ever since, and used his Black Sun contacts to wipe out the Imperial records of the deaths. This assured Xizor that no one but he knew of Vader's hand in the deaths. This deletion was incomplete, for one of Vader's information specialists discovered it just before the Battle of Endor. Xizor built an opulent palace on Coruscant as a base from which he could command Black Sun. Xizor was not an exercise fanatic, but he kept his body in perfect condition through the use of implanted stim units. His natural Falleen ability to exude attractive pheromones allowed him to attract whichever females he wished, and he had many mistresses. When he tired of one, he paid her off and moved onto the next. He rarely left his Coruscant palace, and used its proximity to the Imperial Palace to eventually became a favored associated of Emperor Palpatine. When he did leave the planet, it was in the presence of a muted but deadly security detail. During much of his plotting with the Emperor, Xizor worked through the middleman Kud'ar Mub'at, using the assembler's services to help mask his own. It was Xizor, with the permission of Palpatine, who worked with Mub'at to bring about the destruction of the Bounty Hunters Guild. Xizor hoped to create a supply of freelance assassins who could work for the Empire. This plan failed when the Guild simply split into two warring factions. However, Xizor continued to scheme. Xizor's legal and criminal operations made him the third most-powerful being in the galaxy, behind Palpatine and Vader, but Xizor was not ready to remain there. At one time, he tried to wrest control of Kuat Drive Yards from Kuat of Kuat, but was unable to do so. He knew he could never hold Palpatine's seat, so he strove to usurp Vader's position. He was obliging to every Imperial demand, and made his legitimate shipping operations available to Palpatine. Xizor gained favor quickly, and was present on Coruscant when Palpatine first contacted Darth Vader about apprehending Luke Skywalker. Xizor realized that Vader and the Emperor wanted Luke alive, and so he set in motion a plan to kill Luke before Vader could bring him before the Emperor. This would discredit Vader in the Emperor's eyes, and move Xizor into position as the second most powerful being in the galaxy. His plan nearly succeeded, until he tried to use Leia Organa as bait to lure Luke to Coruscant. Luke and Lando Calrissian succeeded in rescuing Leia, but were intercepted by Xizor's fleet as they tried to jump into hyperspace. A firefight ensued, and caught the attention of Vader's fleet. Vader had realized Xizor's plans, and took the opportunity to eliminate Xizor. Vader's ships began firing on Xizor's ship, providing an escape route for Luke and Leia.

Yes I think you should remove the existing map as well. Although we all know the map, a new single-player might be able to discern the location of the 'you know what' planet before the 'you know who' events and it might spoil the game for them. Maybe we can post mini screenshots instead.</div></div><hr />

Recon Pro-bot- move out 4, come back.  <br />

That way I see Victory IIs in range of my ships while my ships are still safe and my Recon pro-bot is back safe also out of range.  <br />

I didn't actually find the Victory II I destroyed with my recon bot, I found the one above it and moved my CC7700 under where I found the second one.  (So now I doubt my CC7700 will be able to get away because it probably only has 1 or 2 moves now because of its damaged state.</div></div><hr />

- Orron III and Gaurick captured.  It was believed this would spell the end of the CSA, but it appears that the Rebels gifted them technology which allowed them to flee and set up bases on nearby planets (partisans in hills), so it will be a long while before the cities are secured, not to mention that they might be retaken by the CSA before then.</div></div><hr />

I think the frigate has an attack factor that is 1 more than the defense factor of a VII. So it is possible for a frigate to kill a VII and remained unharmed(13 vs 12), but only likely if the frigate is a veteran (19 vs 12). I have checked this on the KobaBOS simulator.<br />

Opps, I meant turbo lasers too.<br />

I was meaning to send a cargo pod to another planet and when I colonized another planet near it, the demand for that good went to that puny planet. This sucks :cry: I had no idea the goods demand and supply would change as new 'cities' are added.</div></div><hr />

There is no skywalker unit or anything but the Alliance will no longer be isolated from their best techs and they will eventually get new wonders like the search for Spock ah I mean Yoda and Field Retrofiting. New units too like Jedi.<br />

I don't want to irritate the Pacifists and get wiped out by the YZV Worldships later. I think the falcon is a random one time event.- hopefully it didn't get destoyed the turn it was created without you knowing, you know by the pirates of something. Check your casualties just to be sure.<br />
<br />
As for our 'unholy alliance'. There'll be no formal alliance as far as the game is concerned - we'll just agree not to attack each other and the CSA since we control all the units - not until Zaarin has learnt his lesson about betraying the emperor (actually he has as many planets as both of us combined so I don't think he'll be learning his lesson anytime soon.)</div></div><hr />

With the CSA almost finished off, the Imperium will finally move into complete consolidation.  Test exercises have brought admiral Zaarin to the realization of an almost impregnable defensive system.  With the exception of backward and isolated rebel outposts, no offensive action against the two other major powers will begin until the Imperium is but one grand fortress.</div></div><hr />

The Pacifists get them on a certain turn, not random I believe.  Once they get them you are going to be very worried as they are as powerful as Deathstars but higher defense and movement!  And they can make as many as they want, not just one.<br />

Darius is right about the minor powers being as good as dead - and of course you can't play the pacifists  (or can he?, like AFTER the transformation take place, he can play the baddies and kill us all.

The opportunity to be rewarded for their ingenuity has made the most ambitious of our scientists greatly increase their progress to finish their current projects.  The complete engineering of our new Imperator Class ships has been fine-tuned by such ambitious scientists, and they are currently under construction.

Meanwhile, the completion of the massive convention hall has allowed Coruscant to devote it's great productive power to mass-produce Turbo-Lasers permanently until every city has three.  <br />

For reasons that were completely my fault, this week I was grounded from everything under the sun. Obviously this included my internet access, and I didn't even get a chance to tell anyone. Furthermore it included my car, so I couldn't even get to a library computer unless I was prepared for an hour-long bike trek. Even if I would have done that, we went out of town to our cabin (actually I was forced to come with), and I of course couldn't tell anyone. Anyhow, after a week of sucking up I got my stuff back, so here I am.<br />
