A spearman defending each city would make our cities impervious to their attacks unless there is a huge uprising.  However, warriors can be upgraded to legionaries....<br />

Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think spearmen are a necessity given how we are performing against the barbs. However, that frees up some warriors to fight barbs, explore, and escort settlers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, the only problems have been from badie huts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siegmund</div><div class="date">May 11, 2003, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am willing to wait for spearmen until we have neighbors and/or barracks.<br />
<br />
If the only threat to our cities is the lone barbarian, a single fortified warrior should already stand &gt;90% odds defending. Facing 3 at once after popping a hut it's not surprising to be hurt - we really only had one piece of bad luck, the loss at Noshuret.<br />
<br />
But I would certainly like to see a barracks going up in Noshuret fairly soon - the granary is a priority only in the settler factory which presumably will be Gorina. I guess that's really for another thread though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 11, 2003, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The barb level was random, right?  We could end up facing a barbarian horde very soon, or there could be just that one for awhile.  I suggest we plan for the worst...remember, we do have a small penalty when fighting barbs because of the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">May 11, 2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there are more urgent things to work on then &quot;the chance we are on a high barb level&quot;. The faster we conquer our land the fewer places are there for the barbs. And what better way to learn wether we have many barbs then by a warrior exploring in the field. Even if our warrior dies by multiple barbs then they are still far enough away for us to prepare. No need to worry now. No spearmen needed just yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't civ 2 - the barbs won't wipe us out.  The best way to deal with them is to expand our bordes via new cities.  I think a granary in our capital should take priority over spearman right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eklektikos</div><div class="date">May 11, 2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say stick to warriors. The more we have available to upgrade to Legionaries when the time comes the better. They're also more cost effective - giving us both a defender and second unit with which we can explore or eradicate barbs at the source for the same cost as one single spearman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bacon King</div><div class="date">May 11, 2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say we should stick to warriors. Losing 3 warriors to babarians was just unlucky, and we should be fine until we can upgrade to Leigionaries.</div></div><hr />

what's the ETA for Iron works? <br />
<br />
About 2 tech eras. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright...I propose the following build queues:<br />
<br />
Noshuret:<br />
<br />
Spearman, settler, granary, barracks<br />
<br />
Gorina:<br />
<br />
warrior, warrior, warrior, settler, warrior</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't make any spears right now. Make two warriors instead. Same investment in time and shields but they equal 2 legions later on.<br />
<br />
The only barbs that we've seen were popped from goodie huts. There are NO barb huts at all.</div></div><hr />

Problem is, we will be running on a deficit if we produce that many units, and we only have 10 gold in the treasury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's with Science almost maxed out at 80% to 100%. That will need to come down regarless so we have upgrade funds available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amirsan</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tru, we can always put science a few notches down in this point of the game. Wouldn't hurt us badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say build a little more warrors so we can save them to upgrade them to legonares :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alamo</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Send out regular warriors to get vet promotions, then bring them home and put more regs out.<br />
<br />
There's plenty of space for a barb farm - that will help the cash situation, too.<br />
<br />
How much is the legion upgrade?<br />
<br />
Also, if we happen to get horsemen then a few of those would be good, too.</div></div><hr />
