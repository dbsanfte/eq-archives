I looked at Egypt, what it has to offer for peace. It's in the screenshot. Do we want this ? <br />
<br />
It gives us peace, a secure northern border with El-amarna, world map and money. And it buys us time to produce many settlers to claim the lands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it seems many of us have been looking for a reason to get out of this war, this may be the way to go.  I too would like us to continue expanding our western borders, and quickly.  Ending this war would allow us to change most of our build queues from military to domestic pursuits overnight.  And the peace will be enough to allow us to better position our frontline troops without risk of incident.<br />
<br />
As we will have achieved the minimum objectives I had hoped to achieve in this campaign(Byblos destroyed and El Amarna ours), I would have no problem with granting temporary peace to Cleo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is only the first post in many this turn. We have contacted the Russians before anyone else on our continent has. They will very soon though, perhaps in 1 turn. <br />
<br />
We have a golden opportunity to get tech parity, a complete world map, all money and peace and a good northern border and a peaceful GA. Without the Russian contact I would be against peace now we have Egypt struggling. But the thought of tech parity, money and a peaceful GA tips my balance. <br />
<br />
There is another thing. The Russians and their continent-sharers could easily claim our Western lands. Since Egypt is no longer a threat, if it ever was, I think our prorities shifted to claim the land. We can't do that sufficiently in wartime. We've reached our Egyptian objectives (except conquering the Pyramids). Also we never capture El-Amarna, it's size 1 so it would be autorazed. <br />
<br />
I think this is a good deal in the current situation. <br />
<br />
With the Russian galley a goldmine has been thrown in our hands. This is just a part of it. Let's take it. It will change our civilization and our future to what we need. We have 2 isthmusses (pardon my spelling) to fill before someone else does.</div></div><hr />

We have a chance for parity? A free city, a WM, some gold, a contact to barter around and peace. With the posibility to continue expanding...<br />
Im still yet to see the save (Mac), but I've got to say this looks interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds good to me.  We should sign peace with Egypt under those terms.  El-Amarna will be a good prize for us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Rik Meleet, I have to disagree with you here. Although these options do sounds nice, I see several facets of the deal that are not to appealing. <br />
<br />
First, Egypt is offering us peace because this is a key point in the game. We are a thriving nation in our Golden Age at war with the number one nation in the world. We are in last place. Of course they want peace. If they manage a peace deal with us now, it will optimize there future plans at this point.<br />
<br />
El-Amarna is placed in the wrong position, as stated by others in previous threads. It should be attacked and razed immediately. We should definitely take control of Elephantine to secure the Lake in its entirety. Although Egypt has no Wonders, their Culture rating is double ours. This is a major threat. We should also take out Memphis, Thebes, and Heliopolis.<br />
<br />
Our Legionaries are the bad boy on the block at this time. This situation will not last for long. We should use them to our advantage and push Egypt back to the brink while we can. We can sue for peace later when they are much more docile.<br />
<br />
If we accept peace now, it will look like we entered this war merely to start our Golden Age, when if fact, most of you wanted to delay it. Now that we are in it, let's use it to our best advantage and kick some butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see El-armana raized ASAP, and a peace deal signed.  Our golden age would be better used building improvements and expanding our culturual borders rather than building legions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. This was should continue, because with each passing turn, our legionaires edge toward extinction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@ Cyc.<br />
<br />
 As Zarn's father would say: &quot;I find your lack of faith disturbing&quot;. <br />
<br />
We can get El-Amarna, let it build a settler such that it is abandoned and settle the new city on the star in the picture. Our Legionairs can form a Maginot Line on the red dots in my picture. There are 11 dots and we have 11 legionairs. <br />
<br />
I think it's way more useful using the GA to build up ASAP. As Octavian X says they'll be obsolete soon, so why build more? <br />
<br />
Your point on Elephantine is valid though. I first feared it would be lost to a flip, since it's only 7 tiles from their capital, has been there for as long as we know (1550 BC) and has culturally expanded borders by 570 BC. (culture size at least 10 by then). Has had 16 turns since then so it's culture is nearing 50.  <br />
<br />
But Chieftess flip calculator indicates the chance is small as it has no tiles under enemy control and it is small, size 1 so will be Autorazed. Nice :cringe: :nono: . <br />
<br />
My main point is; this will prolong the war by at least 4 turns if all goes well, more realistic by 5 or 6 or even 7. We've already had 4 or 5 turns of GA and I think it is a waste to use this time period for war and building soon-to-be obsolete non-upgradable units. I prefer our GA in peace. Who knows; 1 civ might know Republic and if it is tradable we could have half our GA in Republic. <br />
<br />
Egypt isn't going anywhere. It'll be there after 20 or 30 turns. I don't want all civs dogpiling on us because Egypt signed MA's with them. If we don't make peace, get dogpiled and could have had half of a GA republic instead, we'll be kicking ourselves. On the other hand, if we do make peace, get bad luck in techs and spend our GA in Despotism, we'd still not be behind in tech, land or money and could fill our backyard, we'd still not kicking ourselves. <br />
<br />
Who wants to kick him/her self ?</div></div><hr />

A peacetime-Maginot line in which our Legions are used. The star is the new location og El-Amarna after it's site was left by building a settler at size 2.</div></div><hr />

It is still a port city, so what is the big deal?  If we want to manufacture a port city where one doesn't exist, we should reconsider moving Nur Gisnod one tile.  And we did that one. ;)</div></div><hr />
