I don't think that the extra 24 hours would be necessary, and nominations in the real demogame sometimes take only 72 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fier Canadien</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, bootstoots. Edited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I approve of this constitution.  It looks very workable, and it looks like a very good document.  I think that we should start polling to pass this in a few days, whether we have 15 members or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bacon King</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems good to me.</div></div><hr />
