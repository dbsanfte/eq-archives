'Hello, wanderer.'<BR>You say, 'what are you doing in this forest?'<BR>Telin Darkforest says 'Mighty this place must have been, once. Now scarred by hatred and suffering. I have been sent here seeking answers to problems not yet understood.<BR>You say, 'what answers?'<BR>Telin Darkforest considers you for a few moments before speaking. 'A great evil walks across the land. The hand of some demon we don't yet know is twisting and polluting forests.'<BR>You say, 'what evil?'<BR>Telin Darkforest says 'If I knew that, I wouldnt be here looking for answers. I would be elsewhere, looking for solutions. For now, I suspect much but know little.<BR>You say, 'what do you suspect?'<BR>Telin Darkforest looks at you and sighs. 'The lands are changing. Beasts, large and small, have turned upon those who watched over them. Druids and rangers, worshippers of both Karana and Tunare, have reported a feeling of hatred throughout their once peaceful lands.'<BR>You say, 'perhaps it is Innoruuk?'<BR>Telin Darkforest raises his eyebrow slightly and a subtle look of surprise creeps across his face. 'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be. Perhaps I knew and didn't want to consider the possibility. It must be this though, and some action will have to be taken.'<BR>You say, 'what action should I take?'<BR>Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps you can help those who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver it only into the hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, I cannot say. She is a friend of mine and a wanderer. She has been seen from one end of the lands to the other. Seek her out, and quickly.'<P><I>Telin Darkforest gives you a "Worn Note" to take to Faelin Bloodbriar.</I><P><B>Worn Note</B><BR>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<BR>WT: 0.1<BR>Class: ALL<BR>Race: ALL<P><HR><P><B>Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark, Faydary</B><P><I>Faelin Bloodbriar spawns at + 1500, + 500 in Greater Faydark.

So far no trigger has been found to guarantee that she will spawn.</I><P>Give Telin’s note to Faelin<BR>Faelin Bloodbriar reads the note carefully and growls to herself. 'Bad news, eh? Take this ring. There is one elf, dark elf even, who we must go to in order to gather insight into Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he goes by most commonly. Kithicor seems to be his favorite haunt and most likely you will find him there. Don't ask how I know him. Just take the ring as my sign to him and he will speak to you. We don't need to speak again, so dont seek me out, just goto Telin. I must leave to investigate these events.'<P><I>Faelin Bloodbriar gives you "Faelins Ring" to take to take to Giz X'Tin.</I><P><B>Faelins Ring</B><BR>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<BR>WT: 0.1<BR>Class: ALL<BR>Race: ALL<P><HR><P><B>Giz X`Tin in Kithicor Forest, Antonica</B><P><I>Giz X'Tin is a wandering spawn that has been mostly seen towards the north end of the zone.</I><P>Give Faelin’s ring to Giz<BR>Giz X`Tin flips you a coin after he recognizes the ring. 'It seems we have a mutual 'acquaintance.' The coin repays an old debt. You don't have to worry about what that is. Luckily, Lord Innoruuk has informed me of your coming and your desires. Fortunately, I have all the answers you require right here at the end of my friend's blade. I think I'll be paying my old 'friend' a visit.'<BR>Teir`Dal Reaver says 'Lord Innoruuk, I have failed you. Forgive me and spare me from service to your undead minions in the world!<P><I>No apparent reason to kill the reaver here.. he drops nothing and you already have the coin for the next part.

'Faelin sent you to Giz? Surprising. This coin speaks to the outcome of your talk. He would hardly give this bit of metal to a stranger, but that's a story for a different time. So, you say Giz did confirm Innoruuk's involvement, and something about undead minions? Here, take this coin back. Find Arch Druid Althele in the Karanas and show her that. Tell her what we have discussed. She will look kindly on an ally in this matter.'<P><I>Telin Darkforest gives you a "Worn Dark Metal Coin" to take to Althele.</I><P><B>Worn Dark Metal Coin</B><BR>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<BR>WT: 0.1<BR>Class: ALL<BR>Race: ALL<P><HR><P><B>Althele in East Karana, Antonica</B><P>You say, 'hail Althele'<BR>Althele says 'Hello, friend.

The story of this coin speaks much to me as do the words you have given me. Telin sent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring are ill indeed. Here, take this amulet and find Sionae. She is nearby.

He is my hands, as Fang is my eyes.<BR>Fang barks in response to Althele's words.<BR>You say, 'why do you need him as your hands and fang as your eyes?'<BR>Althele says 'Yes. I cannot see any longer, my sight long since lost in the march of years. By the blessings of Tunare and Karana, though, I still make myself useful.<P>Give amulet to Sionae<BR>Sionae says 'I see that the time has come.

Innoruuk once again schemes and we have failed in our duties to protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice for your help. Heed our call and send us your wisdom.<BR>Althele snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go, find the spawn of hatred before they reach this point and destroy them!'<P><I>Dark Elf Corruptor and several Dark Reavers spawn, level supposed to be 50ish. Only the Corruptor is said to have to be killed. It is recommended that you root him, so he does not despawn on you. Additionally, it has been mentioned that he cannot be pulled, so you have to rush in and attack him.</I><P>Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come for you, fools.

The path you are guided upon will be difficult, if not impossible, but someone must finish it. Please, take this, read of it, follow its instructions.

Our task is to focus the blessings of the gods and cleanse the filth from the land. I'll need two things from ya.<BR>You say, 'what two things?'<BR>Ella Foodcrafter says 'Well, ya ask before ya act. That's a good sign. What I need isn't easy to find. First, I need a mixture. Plain sounding enough but it's a special one. Cleanses the mind and focuses the earth's energies into a forest walker's mind. I don't know how to make it. I don't even know what it's called.

Part of my research here is for the wizard guild in Felwithe. I’m sure they’d put a high price on this one, the enchanters guild being so interested in trading for magical paraphernalia and all. Of course if you helped me out on a chore I have, I’d be happy to give it to you. I need to deliver an artifact to the guild and I’d much rather stay here exploring.

</FONT><HR>I honestly do not believe that the Ranger and Druid quests are tied together/shared/splitoff in any way shape or form.<P>Verant stated, albeit very carefully, that the druid quest is broken, and that ours works completely.  Yes, our NPCs have been both druid and ranger, so this quest may well be one or the other, but I do not believe both.  <P>No other quest has been tied together, so I doubt it's a possibility the druid and ranger quests are tied together.  However, they habe stated we may be overlooking something, or aren't seeing things correctly (i forget the actual working used in the posts) so we either: a) have been doing a druid's quest all along, b) still have some information releasing questions to ask NPCs already spoken with, or c) once again are readin too much into the wrong words of the NPCs (for example the tangent of taking the *knowledge* to Ella)<P>Also, I do not believe that the quest weapons will be god-specific, as was suggested earlier.  No other one was, and making them god-specific would be a bit too restricting.  I think the idea that the rangers actually get two functioning particle weapons is more plausible.  Per haps one is based on each ranger god, but not restricted to that god's followers.<P>With regards to Foloal (sp?) and her final words, I don't think she is telling you you have to choose one or the other.  So far, every NPC has left us with a carefully worded puzzle.  My thought is  that maybe we have to do one weapon at a time.<P>Also, I wanted to note that the quest can be started prior to level 50.  CUrrently, I am at the point where all I need do is rally a force to fight Venril Sathir, and I am only level 47.<P>------------------<BR>--Kiriani Greywynd<BR>Ranger of Kelethin<P>"I left my heart on Bristlebane"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=62&topic=003217.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=Ranger:+Quests+and+Special+Items&TopicSubject=Ranger+Epic+Quest+[FA]+-+recompiled+starting+Oct+15,+2000">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#B0B08A">

</FONT><HR>Giving this a bump till it is updated, as well as posing some questions for the point we are at right now.<P>FIrst, I want to say that I am currently to the point where I must fight VS for the stone.  However, since I no longer belong to an uber-guild (for my own reasons) the liklihood of my getting past this is slim for at least the next few months, if not longer.  I am level 47, and so far have not received an iota of experience for this....has that been the case normally?<P>Okay, on with our potential questions.<P>--Ella says "There are many ways you can go from here" and to "seek out ones (in the plural) suh as yourself".  Now, it may be possible there are others at that point there are others who will respond, not only Foloal.  It's worth a try.  THere's an ungodly amount of named npcs of the ranger/druid type throughout Norrath who normally don't speak, or have never been known to.  It's not unlikely that older NPCs now are part of this quest, since this has been done before with other quests (such as the Orc Impaler).  I think it's worth the time to see if NPCs other than Foloal respond to the same comment, or perhaps other key phrases derived from our parting words with Ella.  Naturally, though, we have read to much into the wrong words before, but this is worth investigation to be sure.<P>--Foloal says "Walk your path.  Blade or Lightning Caller, BUrning Sword or Mother's Walk".  This could be interpretted in many ways.  My opinion is this is where you would begin to look for two different weapons, as I believe the dual wield or sword and bow theories.  Has anyone attempted to give the stone to Ella?  It may well be worth the risk.  The healing she mentions will be the healing of Norrath, so I don't think it directly ties in to healing of any one or specific person(s).<BR>Has anyone tried saying anything to the NPCs before handing in the stone?  Might give some clue as the what way we are going before taking the plunge.  I think perhaps talking to Ella with something along the lines of "Nature's Balance is complete" she may respond with a bit more information, clueing us in a little better as to what we are doing.  We could try to do the same with Telin before dumping the stone onto either of them.<P>--Sharpening and Balancing: this one I think will lead us to the Hole, but not before we have found the hands down best or oldest living smith and find out some information.  My first stop would be Kaladim, possibly followed by the elves.  There has to be an NPC somewhere that can clue us in as to what the next step is inthat department.  Perhaps one of the Everhots will send us to get him supplies to do what we need with the sword.<P>I'm sure by the end of the day I'll have even more questions, but that is all for now.<P>Oh yeah....<BR>BUMP<P><P>------------------<BR>--Kiriani Greywynd<BR>Ranger of Kelethin<BR>Fyrelake Elves<BR>Saryrn<P>"Druids are just rangers who couldn't stop injuring themselves in melee practice"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=62&topic=003217.cgi&ReplyNum=000013&forum=Ranger:+Quests+and+Special+Items&TopicSubject=Ranger+Epic+Quest+[FA]+-+recompiled+starting+Oct+15,+2000">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#B0B08A">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm... it seems that some of the wording could still mean a split quest.  Maybe, maybe not.  I just wanted to mention a few things I noticed after sifting through these posts (just out of curiousity).<P>One, so far no druids have turned in the completed stone, so it is still unknown if the "blade or lightning caller" refers to religeon or class.<P>Second, Sean and Aidon (the only two that I saw that turned in the completed stone) are both followers of Tunare.<P>Just my 2cp... it probably means nothing.<P>------------------<BR>- Azyl, Retired Ranger<p>[This message has been edited by Azyl (edited 10-17-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=62&topic=003217.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=Ranger:+Quests+and+Special+Items&TopicSubject=Ranger+Epic+Quest+[FA]+-+recompiled+starting+Oct+15,+2000">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCC99">

</FONT><HR>Well I posted some things about Kinlo but I think my post got buried...<P>Anyways I would just like you to include the emote Kinlo does in your main post.  If you read through the whole quest it just doesn't make sense to just say out of nowhere "what ancient?" and "what mud?".<P>We receive the ancient clay from kinlo so some of the text is correctly placed in chronological order- the mud part.<P>Kinlo says after standing around him for a little bit "Mud,rock,crystal,metal, arrrrrr".  Similar to how Niera hums a tune, and we then ask her about the tune to get her to speak, Kinlo talks to himself about mud and other minerals, and we then ask him about the mud to get him to speak.<P>Here's a screenshot: <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/cekendahl/mud.jpg" TARGET=_blank>http://www.geocities.com/cekendahl/mud.jpg</A>  (this text should not be disregarded and should be included just like you included Niera whistling a tune in the walkthrough)<P>So in my opinion, the correct chronological order would be to visit Kaladim, hear Kinlo talk to himself about mud and other stuff, ask him about the mud, and thus get the small quest for the enchanted clay.  <P>Saying "what ancient?" makes absolutely no sense.  He doesn't mention ancient and we're not asked to look for anything ancient at this point (we have already found the bowl).<P>Ok now fast forward a bit to the part where we hand in Telin the stone and we receive the ancient sword.  He asks us to get it sharpened.  So now we DO have a reason to spam NPC's with "what ancient smiths?" "can you sharpen an ancient longsword?" etc.  And Kinlo will respond with the tale about the ancient smiths.  It now makes sense to say "what ancient?" as before it did not.<P>Ok sorry for rambling.  But what I'm trying to say is imo the correct order for the quest walkthrough is.<P>Kinlo talks about mud.<BR>We ask about mud.<BR>Get the enchanted clay quest.<BR>Finish bowl.<BR>Get stone from Ella.<BR>Turn in stone and VS stone to Foloal.<BR>Turn in new stone to Telin and receive ancient longsword.<BR>Ask kinlo about ancient smiths.<BR>Get sent to Odus.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Caylen Tor<BR><A HREF="http://sa.eqhaven.com" TARGET=_blank>Soul Assassins</A><BR>Lanys T'Vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=62&topic=003217.cgi&ReplyNum=000022&forum=Ranger:+Quests+and+Special+Items&TopicSubject=Ranger+Epic+Quest+[FA]+-+recompiled+starting+Oct+15,+2000">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCC99">

</FONT><HR>Another note about VS stone rareity.  VS has yet to live more than about 1 hour on our server since well before the Epic Quest Patch.  So add the number off weeks since that patch, add 1-2 extra that we killed because of patches, and we've had a total of 1 stone drop.  Add to this we have 4 rangers, and about 8 druids doing this quest. Aka, this sucks  <IMG SRC="http://eqforge.com/forums/frown.gif">  We have 4+ cleric, 1 chanter, 1-2 rouges and i think 1 shamen already with there FA's.  The 4 clerics all got there's in the same week.  Some other guilds have quite a few more FA's than us on other servers to.

</FONT><HR>Just a little something i noticed while reading through here....<P>Telin says...<P>The sword you hold in your hands is one of the oldest blades known, even to the eldest. To strike at the darkest heart of evil requires a weapon beyond THIS, or even ones you may carry at your side. The first task, the first preperation you must make is the smithing of THAT blade. Its edge sharpened, its balance made perfect. When you have finished, bring me THIS sword again.<P>Here is what I think....<P>We have 2 swords being talked about here. The sword he gives us (THIS) and the weapon beyond this that is needed to strike at the darkest heart of evil (THAT).<P>Our first task is the smithing of THAT blade. We can speculate on the mention of sharpening and balancing, maybe he's just saying we have to smith it (Possibly the new smithed weapons?) or maybe its purchased (Well Ballanced Longsword?).<P>Once we have smithed THAT blade, we have to give him back THIS blade (I am guessing with THAT blade also). Maybe he then magically combines the Ancient power of the ancient blade with the quality of the smithed blade.<P>This idea also supports the theory that we have diety specific weapons as some of the new smithed weapons are also diety specific.<P>Anyway, just me 2cp.....
