<br />
This link will always be to the lastest released version: <br />
<br />
PowerBar 3.6 beta (http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads5/PowerBar36beta.zip) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: Current problems being reported with this beta version:<br />
1) Error message stating 'Multiplayer mode detected' &amp; PowerBar shuts down.  DO NOT USE a custom leader name with the standard game or scenario - let your tribe use the default leader name. (Customer leader names appear at the same location in memory as multiplayer names, therefore cannot be used until I find a different method to prevent PB's use in MP).<br />
See this post for workaround:Using custom leader names with PowerBar post (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=904470#post904470) <br />
2) Some users STILL reporting error 6 or error 9 (overflow and subscript errors) - I am currently trying to locate the source of these bugs.  <br />
Version 3.5 beta seems to have fixed this problem for most users - no current reports :)<br />
See readme.txt included in zip file for full description and version history.<br />
<br />
Synopsis:  PowerBar is a memory trainer for players and mod makers of Civ III - Players can complete or supress Gold, Research, Production and Population Growth for ANY civilization or city.  PowerBar can also reveal the entire world map or Clear Jungle or Pollution for any civilization, build roads for any city or pave their entire territory and upgrade all roads to railroads.  Players can select a group of units via filter controls and then heal, promote to elite or teleport those units to anywhere on the map.  A 'SuperUnit' function turns units invincible and with infinite range and attacks.</div></div><hr />

I have just uploaded the latest PowerBar version (see the link in the first post).  The new version is PTW 1.21f compatible and I have tested the version as much as possible &amp; have not seen either overflow or subscript errors...but it is a beta! :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I have also restructured the timing on the auto functions so they are not constantly running memory edits, but watching for turn changes and then making the  updates just once.  That makes the superunit function much more efficient.<br />
<br />
Please report any old/new problems on this thread and I'll address them as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
As always, any feedback is appreciated!</div></div><hr />

  I have just downloaded the PB ver3.2.1 beta and I still get a &quot;run time error 9  Subscript  out of range&quot;, when I try to load a previous saved game on Civ III.     <br />
  I also tried to load a previous saved game on PTW, received the following error--&quot;Incorrect memory offset for Bldg_Data_Pointer.  Unable to load game data.  Check patch compatibility.&quot;  <br />
  I have used the PB on Civ III so I know your work, it must be timing and headspace of the operator.  What am I doing wrong?</div></div><hr />

I've been known for a brain cramp myself... but the error message is new, so I did get the right copy out :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Walkingwarrent - try closing down all other programs &amp; have just powerbar and civ III running.  That error message means it's not finding the data in memory where it's expecting it to be.  (I'll ask the obvious too - you did update PTW to the 1.21f patch?)  <br />
<br />
As far as the older game still getting the error 9 subscript - can you email me a copy of that game (to spiderzord@msn.com)?  I'd like to see what's generating the subscript error still.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note:  If you are having trouble getting PowerBar to run, shut down any extra programs running PRIOR to running Civ III... <br />
<br />
The nature of memory trainers - they only work if the memory values are being found at the 'expected or typical' locations.  Every extra program running in memory can possibly shift the locations that Civ III normally 'chooses' when it loads into memory.  Someone mentioned on the previous thread that running windows with a different language (other than english) was interfering with PB, but when they switched to english it seemed to run fine.<br />
<br />
Kurse - I'm running XP now, so thats not an issue.  Try the above suggestions and email me if it still isn't working...<br />
<br />
GIDustin - sorry, I'm not following you.  You begin a game, load PB and use it to reveal map - if it looks OK, THEN you shut down PB (using the X close box upper right)?  PB never completes shutting down?  Please email me the details - thanks!</div></div><hr />

I play a few other &quot;Stg. games&quot;; but none have as many involved forum members. No other game programer company reacts as well &amp; faverably to their customers. Like so many others of us; &quot;I'm a CIV-AHALIC&quot; and proud of it. <br />
<br />
The members of the Civ forums &amp; the Civ porgrams have much to be proud of themself. Few others treat their people so well!! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SpiderZord</div><div class="date">Mar 18, 2003, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First - Thanks Kurse and GIDustin - both having trouble w/ PB but take the time to help others...  :goodjob: <br />
<br />
Kurse &amp; Ben E Gas - I'm not sure why it's not clearing the MP hurdle, but I have a debug program I wrote a while ago that does a memory dump to a text file.  If either of you can volunteer for some troubleshooting, I'll email you the program and you can send me back the text file of the memory dump.  Please email me (use the link on any of my posts) to work out the details - thanks! <br />
<br />
retroflow - Hope your session went well! :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Strider - Did GIDustin's suggestion work?<br />
<br />
GIDustin - If you're playing on large maps, PB does take a while to clean up all the objects it has to store (10,000+ tiles for huge maps). <br />
<br />
Lemming &amp; golddigger - good to hear you both are still around ;)  It's nice to know PB is working for somebody!<br />
<br />
caesar67 - you problem was occuring frequently enough that I put an entry in the FAQ (way down at the bottom of the readme.txt).  Let me know if that doesn't help.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm going back to my PB improvements list once this wave clears...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ben E Gas</div><div class="date">Mar 18, 2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be glad to help.  But I'm not sure what that means 'memory dump to a text file'.  I know very little about programming.  I'll send you my email address in a few minutes. <br />
<br />
Atleast the new powerbar does work with civ3 1.29, so I don't have to stop playing.  But I look forward to be able to use the new features and civs of PTW.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestions for powerbar's next version(ofcourse, I'd rather you work out the bugs from this version first):  <br />
-Have a button that will build railroads in one city at a time rather than the tribe's entire territory.  Or just being able to upgrade one tile at a time would be nice.<br />
-Also,  maybe it's already on the new version, but it'd be nice to be able to just create a unit at will on any tile, similar to the civ2 cheat menu.  Atleast I think I remember being able to do that in civ2.<br />

<br />
jjkrogs - I think I can get PowerBar to help.  Somewhere in the units definition is the flag for movement restrictions.  If I can find that memory offset, I'll be able to add a function that can overwrite the scenario definition in memory to allow your aircraft carriers to sail the ocean blue again.  <br />
<br />
Actually, PowerBar was written to help modders test for these kind of problems (and play balancing or just plain giving yourself an edge  :D ).  PowerBar can accelerate research in a game to one every turn - speeding through the tech tree and being able to test those units without spending the time to complete a game at normal speed.

My personal experience is that the current version detects MP and shuts down on a single player, single computer game. I would like a fix so I can upgrade to the newest patch of PTW and still use the PB to speed up and modify my personal games, not to use it to obtain a shallow victory against someone else.

Sorry jjkrogs - would you mind joing the debug team?  The more memory dumps I can get access to with the problem, the better I can understand what's going on.  If you don't mind, email me and I'll send you the directions.  Thanks! :cry:</div></div><hr />

:splat: <br />
<br />
Everyone experiencing the 'multiplayer mode detected' and powerbar shutting down - you are using a custom leadername correct?<br />
<br />
PowerBar intercepts MP use by finding the MP username --- which is at the same memory location as (you guessed it) a custom leadername.  <br />
<br />
I tested this scenario and found I could duplicate the problem by being King SpiderZord (MP detected &amp; shutdown).  <br />
<br />
The (hopefully) temporary fix is to do without a custom leader name - click in the box to customize you tribe and blank out the leadername - it will reset it to the normal standard name for that tribe.  PowerBar should load normally.  <br />
<br />
Until I find another alternative, this is the working solution...:o <br />
<br />
Let me know if that works for you. ;)</div></div><hr />

Just a thought for a future addition to the PB when the more important stuff is out of the way; an auto-pollution clearer. Once you get past a certain point, pollution runs rampant and I get tired of clearing it because I'm lazy.  :) <br />

Yes - the class is global for all civ units (the units reference their type --&gt; the type defines their class). <br />

Note: Current problems being reported with this beta version:<br />
1) Error message stating 'Multiplayer mode detected' &amp; PowerBar shuts down.  DO NOT USE a custom leader name with the standard game or scenario - let your tribe use the default leader name. (Customer leader names appear at the same location in memory as multiplayer names, therefore cannot be used until I find a different method to prevent PB's use in MP).<br />
2) Some users reporting error 6 or error 9 (overflow and subscript errors) - I am currently trying to locate the source of these bugs.  <br />
<br />
I have added the above text to the first post to keep everyone updated on PowerBar's beta status. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

However with the latest version (3.2.5) if I click the hide button the window disappears, and I cannot re-open it by placing the cursor near the top of the screeen. This was not a problem with 3.2.1. The program is still running and affecting the game, but it can not be reopened to change settings etc...<br />
<br />
Additionally I was thinking it would be nice to have the program be available in a window that I could alt+tab too instead of just having it be on top of the Civ3 PTW window, I'm not sure how hard this would be to add but I could see it being invoked via a command line argument.<br />

Thanks Aethon - a mistake on my part causing the PB to vanish.  I have uploaded the new version 3.2.6 that fixes the problem.  If I can do the alt-tab I will...<br />
<br />
The new version also contains domination stats under the info screen (I'm not a domination expert, but I  think a domination victory requires control of 66% of total landmass and 66% of civilian population).  I just list the percentages of those by tribe so you can tell how close you are - this was a request from ?someone? a while ago. <br />

--Maybe you can already do this, but it would be nice to have a button that creates a unit without having to build it in your cities.<br />
(sorry if I suggested that one before)<br />
--It would be nice also to have an 'undo button'.  For example, if I hit the 'reveal map' button by accident, I have to reload my last save point to get back to it.<br />
<br />
question:<br />
will powerbar still work if I rename some of my units?  In another post, someone told me I could rename my individual units, which I will try to do later.<br />

-How about a button that 'upgrades' a certain type of unit, similar to the one that makes all units elite.   I wouldn't want the button to upgrade all units at once because I like to have some old tall ships left in my harbor by the end of the game.</div></div><hr />

The teleport feature successfully changes the location of the units, but they do not reappear without activating them from the military advisor screen.  Bring up the military advisor screen and click on the by unit option.  As you hover the mouse of the individual units in the report, the crosshairs on the map will show you where the unit is located.  If it is one of the teleported units, right click on the unit and select 'activate'.  This will give you access to the unit again.  Unfortunately, all teleported units have to be activated that way to be visible again, if you teleport a large army, it gets old after a while.  The new SU function (SuperUnit) toggled on plus the ability to alter unit class (land, sea, air) gives a way to move units an unlimited distance to any point on the globe.  Some day, I'll document all of this. ;) <br />
<br />
All others with suggestions... I'm adding suggestions as they are posted to my list.  If I can do them, I will.  Thanks for the feedback :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nexushyper</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After you teleport you can also go to the spot where you teleported to. It should show a 'lighted' spot but no unit, if not scroll it off screen, then scroll back over that spot. If it is on land you should be able to right click and activate teh unit. It will not show up in that spot(sometimes does though), but if you tell it to move one square in any direction it will move across the map to get there from where you teleported it from.<br />
<br />
Also, if teleport first thing that turn, then it will activate it that spot on it's own when it cycles to it. I figure these out when I didn't want to sit and go through 200+ rifleman to find one!<br />
<br />
Spider, suggestion. In the INFO section you have it so it can sort by different things. Is it possible to sort by say tribe, then unit, then loc... or something like that... kind of like what MS Excel does. Or even just display only the units of one tribe and sort that list by your current options. DOes this make sense? I'm a VB 6.0 programmer myself, and would be glad to explain this in better detail via e-mail or private message if you wish.<br />

Your second suggestion is currently in there - if the 'Owner' box is checked on the units frame and you check the 'apply filter' button down in the unit details section at the bottom of the info list, it will filter the units list to just those of the owner listed in the pulldown. So you can check Owner AND Type box first, and then apply filter - leaving the sort function available for a third column. (Does that make sense?) <br />
<br />
For simplicity, I used a standard list control for that info instead of the more advanced activeX controls available, so the sorting is done manually (I actually had to pull an old engineering text to remember shell sorts - I think I'd get a brain cramp making a two pass sort!)  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the teleport info! :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

Sometimes after a teleport the game thinks I've moved another civ's units.  Saving and reloading solved this problem for me.<br />
<br />
A new small bug that I might be alone in experiencing - The hide button hides the powerbarbar so darn well, I can't find it to bring it back. :scan:   I know it's there somewhere, because if I open another powerbar, my system resources goes down to 30% or so.<br />

     I believe Spider said that he fixed that in the last version, someone on this page pointed the same thing out.<br />
<br />
Try going back to the first page of this thread and downloading it again, (Which should be version 3.2.6 I believe) and it will work!<br />

     Thanks, I didn't realive that those filters did that... guess I didn't look hard enough. Anyways thanks for the explanation. On the subject of teleport, is it possible to 'refresh' the memory so it realizes where the unit now is. It seems to me, and this is just a guess, that when you teleport the unit that some where else in memory is a reference to the image of that unit on the map. (If that makes sense?) Perhaps the map itself has a placemarker for all units and that when you teleport a unit it gets them out of sync? (Or maybe I'm very far off and have no clue what I'm talking about)</div></div><hr />

Teleport was by far the most complicated function to create.  Not only the actual unit coordinates, but their previous turn coordinates (for directional facing) and the unit index at the map tile location are updated... but I'm still missing something.  I spent a quite a bit of time looking for what was missing, but I had to move on for sanity reasons.  I may revisit that code at some point... :scan:  :confused:  :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the good news Loranga!  I must of put 50 lines of debug code looking for that problem, v3.5 moved one line of code down two lines... the smallest change can change the course of PowerBar history... ;)</div></div><hr />

Are you positive that your turn advanced? (Look at the date to be sure). When I've used the command, it has appeared to advance a turn, but the date hasn't incremented, thus the turn has actually not ended.</div></div><hr />

4. What is the function of the default button that reads: Auto on &quot;D&quot;?<br />
5. What does the &quot;group&quot; box do?<br />
6.What is the function of the &quot;neutral&quot; button?<br />
... <br />
<br />
1. No - only the game end year (I tried but there's too many places year related in memory tracking things like score history etc.)<br />
2. No - other than identify the autoboxes...<br />
3. Let's you create a name that can be associated with a set of different units.  I was using it to group an army for teleport.  It can also be used with the filter in the info box.<br />
4. 'Auto on' refers to the checkbox to the left which toggles on all of the autocomplete/autosuppress functions.  The yellow D button to the right will apply the current cities selected auto functions as the default for new cities. (For example, check the autocomplete production box &amp; the autofill foodbox for your first city and turn on the 'auto on' functions.  Press the yellow 'D' button and you will get a message 'Use the currently selected cities auto options as the default for new cities' (or something like that).  Every new city or captured city will adopt those auto settings automatically.<br />
5. Shows the list of Group names you have created with #3.<br />
6. This button let's you label individual tribes as Neutral, Friend or Enemy.  Those labels are then used to bulk apply changes to auto settings.  For example, Shift-click on the 'neutral' button and it will change to 'enemy' (this has selected ALL civs as enemy - single click with no shift to set your tribe back to friend or neutral). Now select one of the enemy tribes from the pulldown and holding control key when you click on any auto setting (i.e. autosuppress research or city production) will apply those settings to ALL tribes labeled 'enemy'.<br />

Kurse - Hold Shift key when you check the box ;)<br />
Other shortcut keys: <br />
Ctr-click = all 'enemy' civs &amp; cities (toggled with neutral/enemy/friend label)<br />
Alt-click = all 'friend' civs &amp; cities...<br />

Baron - If I can find a replacement MP detection method, I will fix this problem. I think you can change the Civ leader name with the scenario editor &amp; run your game as a scenario - just as long as you are not changing the leader name from within the startup screens.  Has anyone tried that method? I'll check it when I can.<br />

Baron - there is a workaround by using the scenario editor:<br />
[list=1]<br />
 Open scenario editor<br />
 Under 'Scenario' Menu - select Custom Rules<br />
 Under 'Rules' Menu - select Edit rules...<br />
 Click on the 'Civilizations' tab and select the Civ you want to play with from the pulldown.<br />
 Change the title and name under the Leader box<br />
 Rename &amp; Save your 'scenario' to the scenario subfolder<br />
 Play game using the 'Load Scenario' option and select the scenario you created.<br />
 PowerBar will work because the Leader name is the 'default' from the rules... ;) <br />

The latest version of PowerBar (3.5 beta) is compatible with 1.14 patch.  The first splash screen has a checkbox for which PTW version you are using.  Just click next to PTW 1.14f before pressing the continue button.  It should be compatible with any mods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway i noticed that powerbar v3.5b seems to crash and lock up my com whenever i try to use it to complete producing something WHILE in the city screen. <br />
<br />
One time it even corrupted my civ3 files. I think that was when i tried to use either a)the satalite map function or b)the clear pulltion function (i forget); also in the city screen.  After i restarted my com and reloaded from the autosave, the whole map was filled with black tiles seemingly randomly placed throughout the map. The problem seemed to lie with corrupted files as i loaded other games previous to my last save, other concurrent games, and even started new games but the black tiles were still there no matter what. In the end i had to uninstall and reinstaill the game and apply the game patch again.<br />
<br />
System info if you need it.<br />
Game version : Civ3 v1.29f<br />
OS : Windows XP<br />
Ram : 256mb<br />
<br />
Btw i was running winamp in the background. But i don't think that had anything to do with the crash.<br />
<br />
If this is some sort of bug, i hope you can figure out the problem and fix it so that other users don't have to suffer the same fate as me. Other than the &quot;city screen&quot; bug i find the powerbar quite useful. thanx for the great proggy!</div></div><hr />

I'm actually using it on PtW v1.21, which may or may not make a difference, but I've only  clicked any PB buttons while on the main map screen, and I've never had a problem.  My guess is that not meant to be used while on other screens anyhow...SpiderZord, could you confirm that?  Oh, and SpiderZord (and CrusaderJoe, of course), this is an awesome utility, and i really appreciate all the work you've put into it.  Keep up the good work!  Oh, btw, i have a question of my own...When I first start the program, load a save, and load the data into PB, do I need to manually go to each city (via the dropdown selection window) and check the automatic finish production box, or is there a faster way to do it?

<br />
BenWilbur - What version of Civ are you playing?  An incorrect version may trigger the MP error also (something I'm working on).  Currently, PowerBar only works with:<br />
1) regular Civ III  with patch 1.29f<br />
2) Play the World with patches 1.14f or 1.21f (Select the one you have with checkboxes on first splash screen of PowerBar)<br />
<br />
If that's not it, you must have a custom leader name still hanging around.  You can also kill the custom leader name in the ini file (CustomLeaderName=) - just leave the entry blank after the = sign.</div></div><hr />

If you don't have the file on your system - I thinks it's still on crusaderjoe's website (http://www.crusaderjoe.com).  Try downloading it from there and then follow the above instructions.</div></div><hr />

No matter what game/mod I was starting, I tried to run PowerBar right from the beginning when Settler and Worker were standing all alone in the wide world.  <br />
<br />
I waited until a city had been built and then tried it and viola!!  From then on I tried it in every other situation after the first city has been built/first turn over and the MP message has not been a problem.<br />
<br />
Sorry for any confusion on my part.  The PB is excellent!!!:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The powerbar is excellent, but i have few bugs, mainly overload or something like that... :rocket: <br />
<br />
In fact, i write because i think a good option you should add is upgrade button. It's simple, when i have spearman and i just developer gun powder, a click on the upgrade button will change all my spearman or hoplite or numidian (etc...) to musketman or musketeer. Or upgrade swordman to medieval infantry. Or... You know what i mean. <br />
Well in CIV2, i remember a great wonders do that. But cause now the wonders just make upgrade cheapers, i think you should implement this feature. <br />
<br />
Maybe it's already implement, but i may miss the button. Please write to me if it's already exist... :blush:</div></div><hr />

I NEED THIS to work on scenarios.  Why did you make it unusable for Multiplayer, anyway.  The cheaters will find a way anyway.  Please post or send to me at my tcwonder3 PM a download of the LAST VERSION before 3.5 that worked completely in PTW 1.21.  I know it did, because it was for me up until just a couple of weeks ago when you started changing things!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Your customleadername=0 (or blank) does NOT bypass if anyone uses a host name through PTW.  It will crash the game on start-up and you have to correct it.  This is a very important tool for PTW scenario work.  Irreplacable to me and lack of it's proper operation has been disasterous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A quick bug report if you dont know about this one yet:  Powerbar crashes with &quot;index out of range&quot; when trying to use the highway feature, creating roads in every square for the civ.<br />
<br />
The crash only seems to happen when you have a city at the very top or very bottom of a map, with some of its cultural borders going off the playable map.  Upon abandoning these cities, the highway feature works and Powerbar does not crash.<br />
<br />
Not a big bug, but if youre looking for all kinds of testing scenarios, maybe you hadnt come across this yet. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the great utility!</div></div><hr />

I can't get it to.  However, if it does, just disable the name-checking feature and have your country-check go to number of players in the scenario data of the bix file for the 'country-title data to print.  Then disable the kick to &quot;bump out&quot;.  I know I oversimplified, but I think you get my jist.  As of your 3.2.6, there was no problem with this.  I had a copy of the original zip file, but you can't get it here in the downloads section (defunct) now.<br />
    I have also found that if you created a scenario on a map created by earlier editor version, but converted with the new one (i.e. open and re-save) that seems to cause the &quot;multiplayer mode&quot; kick out, too!</div></div><hr />

The close button 'X' does not work properly. When clicked, instead of closing out PB, it stills loads it up, however when you start a game it will not load. I am guessing this is due to an incomplete 'unload' sub in the opening form. Then not loading correctly is due to needed info from the first form when you click 'continue' in order for the rest to work correctly.<br />

<br />
my advice to this quote is to make sure nothing about your leader has been changed.  especially the leader's name.  Use the default settings for the civ name and leader name.  and you should be ok.  It detects multiplayer mode when playing in GOTM games, and PBEM games, as it should.</div></div><hr />

if you play a scenario with higher tech-costs as normal the Powerbar doesn't complete the tech in 1 turn<br />

can you upload this file too? <br />
<br />
I should have been more specific - the new tech toggle feature is found in the &quot;Info&quot; screen (click the 'info' button on the powerbar) and then the &quot;Tech Info&quot; tab along the top.  The techs will be listed there, with the action buttons below the list.  <br />
<br />
I had placed a debugging form in powerbar a while back to trouble shoot memory issues with users - and I placed it to open when the &quot;E=mc&quot; button was clicked - I think I'll update that to open the info on the tech screen.  That error is an activeX control used on the debugging form that has no other purpose.<br />
<br />
@Airboss - sorry the MP is still causing trouble... My new method is better, but working the issues for different OS's is taking time.  I'll get something out as soon as I can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jeannie</div><div class="date">Oct 26, 2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again for your wonderful utility!<br />
<br />
I'm using Powerbar 3.6 with PTW v1.27 and I've had some error 9 problems recently, but I doubt there's anything you can do about them.<br />
<br />
Once, when the red Intruder button flashed on, I clicked on it and got the Subscript Out of Range error.  But when I re-started Powerbar and re-loaded, the problem went away.  So, of course, there's no way to replicate the problem.<br />
<br />
Also, I have the problem intermittently if I've created a scenario with a huge map and often if I've created a large numberb of cities for myself with the editor.    The map sizes are at least 270x270.  I'll get the Error 9 if I try to auto-build roads in all my territory (button H).  The first time this happened, I had a scenario where I started out with 400 cities and had no problem, but when I went back to the editor and added some more cities, the H button game the the Subscript out of  Range.  Eventually, when I had manually created a lot of roads/railroads by playing the game, the H button worked.<br />
<br />
Other times I've  gotten the Error 9 with a huge map with fewer than 150 initial cities, and even manually building roads/railroads on every available tile did not make the problem go away.<br />
<br />
BUT I suspect that this is some sort of problem created by the Editor, because in these cases, when I use any of the Automate buttons in PTW, there are tiles where the automated worker just stops working and I have to re-issue the automate command (sometimes more than once).  Saving the game and restarting PTW, restarting Powerbar or reloading the data in Powerbar doesn't correct the Error 9 or the Firaxis problem of automated workers &quot;going on strike&quot;.<br />
<br />
I certainly don't expect you to be able to fix Powerbar to overcome a problem where the Editor has created bad data!  But I thought you and the other readers of this thread might like to know, in case any of the people still having Error 9 problems are having these same (presumably non-fixable) problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've figured out a way to get the error 9 problem with the H key consistently.  If a tile in the 'top' or 'bottom' row that is connected by land tiles to a city whose cultural size would bring that tile within the borders of the city, the H key gets the 'subscript out of range' error.  So maybe you CAN figure out a way to program around this condition.<br />
<br />
(I assume this problem would occur in this situation regardless of whether the map is custom-made with the editor or generated by the ordinary game play, and that map-size doesn't matter.)</div></div><hr />

The 3.6 version of Powerbar will work, since the Gold Edition is just the original version with all of the patches applied.  You can download it from the first post of this message thread.<br />
<br />
Are you playing a new game, or are you starting a scenario?  Some of the scenarios have a lot of pre-built cities, so they WILL take a long time to load.  If you're trying to Load a new game, then your computer is simply slow.<br />
<br />
Try ending any other applications that are running, and, if necessary, change the priority on Powerbar with the Taskmanager.</div></div><hr />

A new game with 7 civs should LOAD in a minute or so - less time than it takes for the game to go from the game options menu to the time it lets you make your first move.  I've never had any luck using 'real time' priority - I just set Powerbar to the 'above normal' priority and usually set my game (Civ3 or PTW) to High priority.<br />
<br />
Are you sure you're not running a lot of tasks that you don't need?  With my old machine, the Task Manager usually showed about 30 tasks running (including Powerbar and the game) after I'd shut down the things that were obvious to me that I didn't need - I never bothered to research all the other ones.</div></div><hr />

Actually tried leaving Power Bar on for about three hours but that didn't work either. I've followed the instructions in terms of when to actually hit the load button and that's done only after the game has been loaded. But still no change. Hope to hear from you guys soon.

Hmmm--I just re-downloaded the 3.6 version of Powerbar - it says it's for Civ3 v 1.29 (the equivalent of the 'gold edition') or PTW version 1.21 or 1.29 - but I don't see a checkbox for the Civ3 v 1.29f!  I know it was there in the 3.5 Powerbar, and since I mostly have played PTW for the last year, I never noticed the Civ3 option wasn't there.   Sorry I can't help - this one's got to be solved by SpiderZord.<br />
<br />
Unless there's a way to download the 3.5 version of Powerbar????</div></div><hr />
