<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked around a bit to the list of Great Wonders. Our competitors for the Great Library are Texcoco, size 1, Philadelphia, size 1 and Sparta, size 2. These are no threat; they have just started building and are small. Compared to Gorina, size 5 in 2 turns, they are nothing. Especially when we mine the Gorina grasslands and allow growth to forfill her destiny as a production powerhouse and Metropolis. <br />
<br />
But: several cities have been building the Pyramids for a long time and might be complete soon. Heliopolis, size 4, Athens, size 6, Washington, size 5 and Tlaxcala, size 5. <br />
Athens was already building the Pyramids in 1250 BC. <br />
I noticed something strange in the Aztec Empire; in 1025 BC Tenochtitlan was building the Pyramids and Tlaxcala the Oracle and now Tlaxcala is building the Pyramids and Tenochtitlan no wonders :confused: so the AI switched locations ...<br />
The cities of Heliopolis and Washington were on The Oracle, but when the Babylonians completed it in 670 BC they switched to Pyramids. Heliopolis was already building in 1025 BC and Washington in 900 BC. <br />
<br />
So I fear the Pyramids will be finished soon. All 3 civs are Philosophy and Mapmaking up on us, but not Polytheism or construction, so there is just 1 alternative Wonder we can't build which they can; the Great Lighthouse. Although both Washington and Tlaxcala are coastal; Athens is not and Heliopolis is not. Washington and Tlaxcala will go for Great Lighthouse, Athens will loose it's shields or remove Sparta from Great Library and work on it itself, but: Heliopolis will cascade to Great Library!, unless that city will finish the Pyramids first! <br />
<br />
In all: We will NOT get the Great Library unless we get a Leader fast and have enough time to get him to Gorina. <br />
<br />
Therefore I suggest to provincial Governor Eyrie to stop building the Great Library in Gorina and switch to barracks (I'm not in favor of a library yet; it's war) to create Veteran Legionairs or upgrade warriors so we will fend of Egypt, gain their lands and have a shot at a Leader who will help us further.<br />
<br />
It's sad and diappointing but we will NOT get the Great Library. If we get a leader soon he might already be too late.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Rik Meleet is correct in his projections. I did the Math too. That is why I recommended a Barracks and Legions in the Govt. sub-forum. We should start eye-balling The Hanging Gardens as a future project, but right now help out with the war effort and another garrison unit for Gorina. Maybe we could slip a Library into the queue also :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rik, this is an excellent assessment of our situation regarding the Great Library.  Unfortunately, I don't think that the cascade issue was made strongly enough earlier in the discussions and therefore the people voted 7-6 in favor of the Great Library.<br />
<br />
Also, since we seem to be running short on upgrade cash, it would be nice to have another productive city pumping out Legions and helping to save our gold.<br />
<br />
Although I don't like to repoll issues, I do believe that the situation in Gorina merits further discussion.  And I would like to go on record by saying that I believe we are making a huge mistake by pursuing the Great Library at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@all- I may have been the one who brought it up in the chat, but I voted Nay on it. Im just being the beuarocrat here.<br />
I too did the Math. DZ- do you have an SS from when the Athens Embasy was established? If you do, that may shed some light. I have a gut feeling that the Pyramids will be done in the next 10 turns. The others will cascade, and we WILL loose the GL. Perhaps we could put Gorina on a Baracks, as Mr. Meleet sugested. <br />
(Yeesh.. SaaM against building the GL. What is this cyberworld comming to? :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend taking another course altogether.  Is there another wonder in the near future we should aim for, like the Hanging Gardens?<br />
<br />
You have to admit, the AI is not to most predictible thing in the world.  When you think it can't make a stupider move, it does.  Therefore, I recommend that Gorina continue to build the Great Library.<br />
<br />
Why?  The AI might not cascade over from the pyramids to the Library.  Or, if the predicted cascade does occur, we can switch Gorina to a palace prebuild in anticipation of the Hanging Gardens, or whatever wonder we're aiming for.<br />
<br />
Just a thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I do SaaM and here it is.  This screenshot was made in 430 BC, so we are 6 turns later.  Therefore, Athens will complete the Pyramids in 9 turns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have strong critisism on the Build the Great Library Poll (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=55210). <br />
<br />
The first is that the time between the start of the poll;  Jun 05, 2003 05:44 PM till  Jun 06, 2003 10:38 PM was, to be polite, short. Especially in view of the impact on this and the &quot;firmness&quot; of a conclusion drawn from a poll. I hope this thread shows that at least a lot of research of the situation had to take place in order to form a founded opinion. The timeframe was too short for this, at least to my liking.<br />
<br />
The second is that the Discussion thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=55134) referred to in the poll has 0 references to the word &quot;library&quot;and 1 to the word &quot;great&quot; and that word is in Ocatvian X's profile; quote: &quot;Location: Spamming to Greatness in Missouri&quot;. Needless to say I feel the poll is illegal because of this.  <br />
<br />
I do not want to invite anyone to suggest other wonders to be build in this discussion; I feel the discussion should head to the question: &quot;Was the poll legal&quot; and after that: &quot;Do we continue building the Great Library in Gorina, despite what we know now?&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, Rik.....<br />
<br />
You are right.   In the first post of the poll, d8575 linked to the Literature Trades discussion instead of the Great Library discussion.  I think we may have found our loophole........   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The poll wasn't unnecessairily illegal - Ever since we dropped our complex system of laws and standards, nothing is truly illegal in the sense of the word.<br />
<br />
Also, I reference my above opinion as a reason why to continue building the Great Library.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So why dont we just repoll? Repolling is completely legal this game ;-)<br />
IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then the Poll should be: Should we stop the building of the Great Library in Gorina? <br />
<br />
Options:<br />
No, continue and hope that the cascade will not go to the Great Library<br />
No, we'll get a Great Leader soon enough<br />
Yes, but switch to another wonder prebuild by a palace<br />
Yes, switch off wonders for now<br />
Abstain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one is stopping you, Rik.  Just post the poll already.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a normal citizen; Am I allowed to post a poll? Isn't this the prerogative of an official?<br />
