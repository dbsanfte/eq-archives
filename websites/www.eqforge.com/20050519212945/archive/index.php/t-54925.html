Vendetta: &quot;My Despot! I must STRONGLY protest against some action which came to my ears!&quot;<br />
Despot: &quot;So which one should that be?&quot;<br />
Vendetta: &quot;I heard you tried to put pressure on the commander of the helenatican corps. I must insist here that the helenatican forces are only lent to the fanatican army for this conflict ANS A INDEPENDANT CORPS! this means that you must not interfere with the decissions of the commander which i chose. he will take his decissions freely, or our troops will withdraw from the conflict.&quot;<br />
Despot: &quot;It was my brother! Only a private!...&quot;<br />
Vendetta: &quot;This does not matter! Our glorious army was not built on good relations, but on work and prooving of skills in battle. If you want a honorous position for your brother, you could send out a division of your own troops under his command, but not interfere with HELENATICAN forces decissions! We will NOT tolerate this.&quot;<br />
Vendetta does not listen further to the despot but walks out of the room in deep anger</div></div><hr />

Mara Jade IV storms into the Despot's throne room<br />

Despot Augustius Veern Jade: What is it now, they want to put my brother...<br />
<br />
General Mara Jade IV: Listen, I was not happy when I had to grab the Commander.<br />
<br />
Despot Augustius Veern Jade: Now listen here<br />
<br />
General Mara Jade IV: No! you listen. Just because your brother is a private does not mean you should lash out because he is your only brother and the rest of your brothers have died. What would Caeser Jade have to say about this action?<br />
<br />
Soon the Despot beguins to shead a tear for the fist time in his life. He soon starts to think of His dead brothers and his recently departed Father-in Law<br />
<br />
Despot Augustius Veern Jade: *sob* I have digrased my Father-in Law's name. How could I, I only wanted the best for my Brother.<br />

Royal Military Advisor: Vendetta has also threaten to withdraw from the conflict if you do not conduct a formal appology, leaving only the Jade Commandos to defend us.<br />

Despot Augustius Veern Jade: Please send in Vendetta. I wish to give her an appology and allow my Brother to be a private in the Corps as long as he can get a chance of a promotion.<br />

Vendetta: &quot;Oh! This comes as a surprise... i hoped we could find an arrangement here... Well, i must admit that i obviously also was a bit overheated due to the conflict... as such, i clearly will state to my commander that he will have an eye on your brother and let him get a preffered raise in rank as soon as he sees fit...&quot;<br />
Despot: &quot;Yes, i think this is the right way... and hopefully we can continue our good cooperation to protect our homes&quot;<br />
Vendetta: &quot;Sureley... i think this again prooved that we can manage to work together even in hard times... and be assured that your brother, as i got to know him, will surely manage to proove he is as good as any other member of your family, and thus will have a military career in the HMC which will still be talked about in hundreds of years.&quot;<br />
Despot: &quot;I will hope so... Vendetta, would you like to join me for dinner?&quot;<br />

the requested area conflicts with the disaamuel claiming area :-)<br />
as neo is my husband, i am not authorized to do deals for disaamuel but am interested in his welbeing. i would propose a compromise along the following lines:<br />
<br />
yellow line: claiming border for disaamuel territory at the moment<br />

light blue line: a possible compromise, giving the disaamuels 5 tiles + a city for giving up claiming over 20 other tiles.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A 19-year-old man enters the palace.  He wears baggy black trousers and a tight black shirt, over which are a black cape and hood.  At his hip dangles a leather scabbard, inside which is his only posession: a plain steel sword, razon sharp, with its blued steel tinged red with the blood of his enemies.  He is young, but has a look in his eyes that speek of pain and suffering.  In those same eyes also reside the harsh stare of extreme motivation and the icy gaze of a youngster who has killed more than his share of his fellow man.<br />
<br />
As he enters, the royal guards attempt to stop him.<br />
<br />
Guard: An' who er you then?<br />
<br />
GM:  That is of no consequence.  I am here to see your master.  You will take me to him.<br />
<br />
Guard:  Well yer awful full of yerself, aren't ye?  You'd best be goin' home son, the Good King disn't see the likes of you without an appointment,.<br />
<br />
GM:  Perhaps you misunderstood me.  You will take me to him.<br />
<br />
The look in the youth's cold, blue eyes could have stopped an axeblow.  The guards are visibly shaken by his resolve.<br />
<br />
Guard:  Right then, if you'll please come with me, sir.... Now, if you'll kindly remove any weapons you may be carryin'...<br />
<br />
With one fluid motion the newcomer draws his sword and places it against the guard's throat.  The sing of the blade throw the air can be heard from the next room.<br />
<br />
GM:  Is that what you had in mind?<br />
<br />
Guard:  Erm... quite.  You can put that away.  Come along now.<br />
<br />
The two guards and the young man enter the throne room of Despot Augustus Jade.<br />
<br />
GM: Hello, m'lord.  I hope this is not a bad time.  I have come to speak with you about important land matters.  Do you mind if I sit down?  Thank you.  Sire, I am here today to ask you for a grant of land.  As you well know, we have been fighting a war against the Egyptians mongrels for quite some time now.  Now, having a centralized army is all well and fine, but sometimes local defense calls for a local military.  My liege, I ask of you a small parcel of land with which I may raise an army to serve you.  It need not be anything great, just a few tiles which can feed and arm a small militia that will fight for you.  I am no noble, nor am I a great general like your forebears were, but I have done my share of fighting on the borderlands against Egyptians, Barbarians, and Fanaticans alike.  I can lead an army in your service as well as any man in this kingdom.  Sire, I beg you to grant me this land, that I may forever serve the Crown of Fanatica.<br />
<br />
CG:  Tell me, lad, what is your name?<br />
<br />
GM:  I was born Julius Vesuvius, m'lord.  But some call me Grandmaster.</div></div><hr />

CivGeneral walks to Grandmaster, Mara Jade looks at Grandmaster.<br />
<br />
CivGeneral: I cant beleve it, after all this time<br />
<br />
CivGeneral sheads a tear and hugs Grandmaster. Mara Jade looks at the two<br />

Mara Jade: Ahem, are you forgiting someone?<br />

CivGeneral: Oh, my apologies. This is Mara Jade. Commander of the Jade Commandos and...<br />

Augustius stands up raising a glass<br />

Augustius: ...and the wife to CivGeneral.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster looks at Augustius with a puzzled look<br />
<br />
Augustius: Any freind of CivGeneral is a Freind to me. Allas I am growing old, Mara Jade is the closest heir I have. Luckly there is a small proviance in the Jade Provance that has a Prince.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster: Well, CG, I must congradulate you on the marrage.<br />
<br />
Augustius: Yes, CivGeneral will be the new Despot. Now lets get back to the present. Umm, one moment. ROYAL LAND MANAGER!!!<br />
<br />
The Royal Land manager rushes into the throne room<br />
<br />
TRLM: Yes Sir?<br />
<br />
Augustius: Please check for any Records of anyone claiming land under the name &quot;Julius Vesuvius&quot;<br />
<br />
TRLM: Yes Sir, Right away.<br />
<br />
Augustius: Grandmaster, would you like to join CivGeneral, Mara, and Me to Lunch to discuss your proposal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GM:  Indeed I would, sire.  I had to travel many a day to get here, and I fear I have not eaten much more than jounreycakes for the last 3 weeks, and little better than black bread for the last few years before that.  But those circumstances do not make for good lunch conversation.  Let us talk of less.... dark..... things while we eat.  About my proposal.  I am sure you have noticed the infighting that has been going on of late amongst the various houses of this Nation.  I too saw it.  That infighting is exactly what I've spent the last few years of my life battling.  It is threatening to tear us apart, sire, and with the war in Egypt, we cannot afford that.  I feel that with a small land grant with which to raise an army, I could both serve you against Egypt and help to stabilize the internal house politics.  In my travels I happened a queer book, a manuscript in a strange, harsh-looking tongue... much like that of the Gothic barbarians, in fact.  I had one try to translate it, and indeed the language was close.  It told a tale of an ancient land, long ago before the founding of Noshuret, in which a mighty Prince ruled a fiefdom in service to his Lord.  He grew that fiefdom into a superpower rivaled only by the mother country, and in becoming so powerful made internal power plays and civil wars impossible, because nobody could stand against his might.  I think that creating a land like that, of course in the hands of a man 100% loyal to you, sir, could end all this petty squabbling which is troubling us.  That is why I have asked you for this land.<br />
<br />
Augustus:  Interesting, young warrior.  I will consider your proposal.  I will now retire to my chambers for a while.  It would seem you and CivGeneral here have some catching up to do, though I know not how you could possibly be acquainted.  Dine well, young ones.<br />
<br />
GM:  And you, sire.<br />
<br />
And so the conversation slips to more recreational talk, CivGeneral and Grandmaster telling the tales of their pasts, catching up on old times.</div></div><hr />

SaaM: Now, Despot CivGeneral, our landclaims are still safe, correct? We still control our area of Penguinadua? We agree with the Grandmasters idea of a unified land, but we just wish to make sure that our land is safe.<br />
Liza: Yes. Also, we just need to ask. Dose anyone else feel they could now live forever under a series of odd reincarnations?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, since you're the Powers that Be, is it alright for me to have made that mention of a manuscript detailing DG2 Vanir?  It could be taken in the context of Romans discovering the ancient epics of the Sumers or somebody who came before and then disappeared.  Its alright I'm assuming?</div></div><hr />

GM- Look at everything the Sumerians wrote. They'er gone, but we still (are forced) to read The Epic of Gilgamesh. Just make the panzers &quot;Magical Rolling War Machines&quot;, the Infantry &quot;Men With Sticks of Deadly Fire&quot;, the artiliry &quot;Spirits of Boom&quot; (or something..) and if you mention any names, make them &quot;Old King&quot;.</div></div><hr />
