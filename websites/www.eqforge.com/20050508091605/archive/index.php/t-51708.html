<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  I think I could perform best as a Judiciary member.  I like to interpret game rules and enforce them.<br />
2.  I am running for two positions, Chief Justice and Public Defender.  I don't think I have much of a chance at Chief Justice, but if I were to win both, I would obviously go for Chief Justice.<br />
3.  I was the most recent Public Defender, in Term 8, and I believe I did a good job.  I also was the Culture Deputy.<br />
4.  I support turn-chats as is, because I believe that they allow citizens to have input in the game actions as they happen, and they also allow newbie players to learn very quickly about the demogame.  I am neutral in opinion about offline preturns.<br />
5.  I am familiar with all of our Demogame II laws, as well as the new Constitution.  We do not have other Demogame III laws or standards yet, though it should be noted that I have written a set of laws for the new demogame.<br />
6.  I will be an active member of the Judiciary, and I will represent the people and the laws to the very best of my ability.<br />
7.  I would like to see the Judiciary gain the ability to review polls, and I will present a new CoL and CoS to the Judiciary for Judicial Review, if appropriate.<br />
8.  The Judiciary does not have a right or responsibility to create new laws out of existing legislation.  It does have the right to interpret the laws, but may not create new ones.<br />
9.  The Judiciary should serve as the main interpreters of the law and should conduct fairly all PI's that may be issued.  They should also serve to make sure that the laws are being enforced and that illegal activity is kept to a minimum.<br />
10.  The Judiciary should be proactive in finding trouble areas.  It is much better to find trouble before it starts than after it happens, if possible.  The Judiciary should be reactive when new problems are brought to it's attention.<br />
11.  No<br />
And now for a speech:<br />
I certainly think that I am the best candidate for Chief Justice and Public Defender.  I will carry out the functions of my office to the best of my ability, if elected.  I am one of the newer demogame members, and I think this works to my advantage, as I am eager to serve a second term in the Judiciary and I will enthuastically perform the functions of the Judiciary.  I jumped right in to the Public Defender spot last term, only two hours after registering as a citizen, and I believe I did my job well.  Therefore, I appeal to all citizens to elect me for another term in the Judiciary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vander</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. I am running for Public Defender because I can argue and keep to the rules when one of our great citizens is accused of a crime.<br />
2. Just this position for me.  I would rather not try for the other two.  (More than three candidates isn't my cup of tea)<br />
3. Besides real- life expierience in judgery (word?),  I have been the Chief Justice in the MSDG.  <br />
4. Having the TCs offline would limit the ability of our citizens to join in.  I am against moving them offline.  I say, keep them as is.<br />
5. I am familiar with the laws of our people.  I have studied them for DG II, MSDG, and DG III.  These laws are there for a reason and should only be broken through change in the system (Legisature).  The laws are there to protect those who I would defend as public defender.<br />
6. I am a pre- law major in school; I know what's up.<br />
7. I plan on making sure that the laws are followed for the first term.  It is best that we get off to a good start an I am the man to do that for Public Defender.<br />
8. It is not so much that the Judiciary creates laws as so much is that it leaves precidents from the laws for future courts to follow.  The supreme court was never given the right to strike down legislative laws as unconstitutional.  That practice was established after our nation was founded and has been running of accepted precident ever since.<br />
9. The Judicary is the entity that maintains the peace in reguards to the laws.  They settle disputes when it is necessary; not only for legal matters, but should also help settle inter- citizen matters when asked.  The judiciary needs to be the arbiter of justice and decision.<br />
10. The judiciary needs to be both reactive and active with disputes.  It can not be exclusivly either becuase the Judiciary needs to handle problems given to it and problems that it sees as possibly troublesome in the future.<br />
11. No.  I will be traveling from college to home in a few weeks, but that takes eight hours.  I wouldn't be out long.<br />
<br />
It is a moot point that I say that I think I am the best candidate for Public Defender. It doesn't do me any good to say I am not the best.  However, I do have reason behind my decision. Firstly, I wouldn't have tried for this position had I not felt up to the job.  I can and will do all possible in being the best Public Defender.  Secondly, as I said before, I have been a judge before (judging Tae Kwon Do tournements) and thus I have expirence being an unbiased representative.  The Public Defender needs to be unbiased in defence of his client.  It is counter- productive for the PD to use ANY means possible to get his client off.  He needs to recognize when he the evidence it clear and tell his client what is his best option.  And yet, the PD still needs to follow through with his client's wishes and I swear that I will follow through with whatever I am charged to do to the fullest of my abilities.  Lastly, I have been the Chief Justice before and I would like to try the Public Defender position.  Vote Vander!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
I think the judiciary department can play a positive role in the demogame by helping to strike the proper balance between rules on the one hand and demogame play on the other hand.  I feel my best opportunities to contribute to the demogame are by serving in the Judicial Department.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
I've served on the judiciary in DG2.  I've been involved in the discussions of our evolving constitution since DG1.  Over the last two demogames I've held positions in almost every department ranging from chat rep through governor to president.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
I favor optional turn chats at the discretion of the president.  I also favor the concept of offline preturns.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
I am familiar with our current constitution.  As for laws, I don't think we've made any yet.  I see nothing wrong with challenging poor laws by breaking them if normal means to correct the poor laws fail.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
Citizens should vote for me instead of my opponents because of the vision I have for the judiciary (see next question).<br />
<br />
7. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
Since we have decided to start DG3 with only our constitution I think it is important that the judiciary take an active role in the formation of our set of laws.  The first term will set the tone for all future laws and the judiciary can be instrumental in maintaining an appropriate focus for our laws.  I see the need for two different types of demogame laws.  The first type pertains to the division of authority among the various offices of our government.  The second  type pertain to codifying the wishes of our citizens regarding how our country shuld be run.  Examples of the former would be a law spelling out which government figure is responsible for planning our wonder building program or a law specifying the number of cities per province.  Examples of the latter would be a law detailing the garrison levels required for our cities or a law stating that a specific wonder should be built in a specific city.  I do not mean to imply here that all actions would need the force of law behind them.  I do though think that by passing some laws of the latter kind we can better maintain our focus as a country on our chosen goals.<br />
<br />
8. Do you feel it is the Judiciary's responsibility, or right, to create new laws out of existing legislation?<br />
<br />
The Judiciary cannot (according to our constitution) creat new laws.  The Judiciary can render existing laws unconstitutional and by thus striking them down can prompt the citizens to make newer (and hopefully better) laws.<br />
<br />
9. What do you feel the role of the Judiciary should be in the Demo Game?<br />
<br />
The Judiciary should strive to keep any new laws in line with the constitution.  The Judiciary should also ensure that any accusations of wrong doing are handled fairly and to the benefit of all parties involved and the demogame as a whole.<br />
<br />
10. Should the Judiciary be reactive (handling problems as they come up) or proactive (actively seeking problem areas to fix before they become a problem)?<br />
<br />
The Judiciary must, of course, be reactive when problems are brought to it's attention.  This does not mean the Judicary cannot also be proactive if the members of the Judiciary see problems on the horizon.  In being proactive the Judiciary must remember that it cannot create new laws.<br />
<br />
11. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
I am running because I feel I can bring the benefits of experience to the judiciary and also can help reorganize and make the Judicairy better if needed.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
You can tell these questions are outdated because there is no restriction on the amount of positions that I can run for. I am running for three, Domestic, FA, and Chief Justice. I would probably take Domestic if I won all three (like that's likely ;)).<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
Lets see now... I have been Chief Justice for one term, Public Defender for one term and, and Judge Advocate for three terms. Now that's what I call experience!<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
 Turn-chats are essential to this game. Without them, this would barely be a democracy. however, offline pre-turns are acceptable.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
 How could I not be after serving five Judiciary terms? If we are going to change them, I am good at grasping new concepts. Also, only in extreme circumstances is it not OK to follow the laws.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I am very experienced at this and I'm a hard worker. That sums it up nice and tidy. ;)<br />
<br />
7. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
I also believe that the Judiciary needs to take an active role in the formation of laws. The Judiciary should also be the voice of reason when discussing new laws as their experience can help. My personal goal is to help set up a short, single code to discuss how the game is run. The divisions of power can be included in the Constituion (like that of the USA).<br />
<br />
8. Do you feel it is the Judiciary's responsibility, or right, to create new laws out of existing legislation?<br />
<br />
This one is a little obvious since the Constitution says we can't create new laws. However, the Judiciary should be ready to strike down any unconstitutional laws if they see them.<br />
<br />
9. What do you feel the role of the Judiciary should be in the Demo Game?<br />
10. Should the Judiciary be reactive (handling problems as they come up) or proactive (actively seeking problem areas to fix before they become a problem)?<br />
<br />
The Judiciary should be both. It can be reactive in the sense that if someone brings something up, they should be able to deal with it, but they can also be proactive (if they have the time) and therefore can reduce the time they spend dealing with complaints. The whole goal is to be quick and throuogh.<br />
<br />
11. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
Only two, short camping trips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Apr 27, 2003, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
I am running for both Trade Leader and Public Defender. I wasn’t going to stand at first since this is my first Demogame and I wanted to get a feel for the mechanics of it. However I then realised that the more I get involved the more I’ll get out of it. I would prefer to be Trade Leader because I have a better understanding of how to make that department successful.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
Since this is my first Demogame, I can’t call on a long list of glories. However I am a keen player of CivIII and have played it constantly since it was first released. (Yes I know, Get a life!!) I have no experience in the judiciary but I do know that the judiciary should play no part in the making of our laws.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
Until I actually experience this first hand I am not qualified to comment on the established procedure for conducting the game. However I will enthusiastically campaign for change if it is deemed necessary and look for new ways to improve the experience for all.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
I am familiar with our constitution and understand that all our other laws under review. The laws of our nation must be followed always. If any of our laws are contrary to the interests of our nation then the people in their wisdom will change them.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I will do my utmost to serve the people and help make the laws work.<br />
<br />
7. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
My only goal will be to ensure that the laws are interpreted in the interests of the people and that any Public Investigations are carried out fairly and promptly. I also intend to ensure that the laws are clear to reduce the need for litigation and squabbles<br />
<br />
8. Do you feel it is the Judiciary's responsibility, or right, to create new laws out of existing legislation?<br />
<br />
No and never. The Judiciary’s only responsibility is to see that the laws are applied. Only the citizen body and its elected representatives have the right to legislate. <br />
<br />
9. What do you feel the role of the Judiciary should be in the Demo Game?<br />
<br />
As I understand it our new system of laws is yet to be ratified. However I believe that the laws should be kept to a minimum required to keep the game running smoothly. I do not believe that the game should be burdened with laws. Cooperation between players not regulation is the to success. If elected as a member of the Judiciary then I will ensure that law making is left to the legislative. Our role is only to interpret the laws for the good of the people and to adjudicate on disputes.<br />
<br />
<br />
10. Should the Judiciary be reactive (handling problems as they come up) or proactive (actively seeking problem areas to fix before they become a problem)?<br />
<br />
I believe that the Judiciary should address problems as they arise. It is exists only to adjudicate not to legislate. It is up to the people to fix the laws.<br />
<br />
11. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
No<br />
<br />
<br />
Please feel free to message me with if you have any questions about my candidacy, and ideas that you might have to take this department and our nation forward.<br />
Thankyou.</div></div><hr />
