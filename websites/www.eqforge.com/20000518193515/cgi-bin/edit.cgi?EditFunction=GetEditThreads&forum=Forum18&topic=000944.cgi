<br>Hi, First off we know the layout of Paws from our newbie days and we tried new Paws after the revamp and found it a pain to do.  Respawn time was too fast and you have 4 to 6 Gnolls a room. Trains, Charmed PCs, Gnolls with what seems to be bottomless mana... so an enchanter is a required.  That said...<BR>is there any info on who and where the mob that drops this spear can be found?  From what I can find he's a named gnoll, cleric, upper 30s to L40ish and has friends around him.  I would like to try getting a group together and try to get this for my Shaman but don't want to ask friends to help with so little info.<BR>Thanks for any help you can provide.<BR>Remus<BR>Karana

<br>If you are referring to the Ebon War Spear, it is actually dropped by a named Aviak in the OOT. All the Aviaks there were green to me at 33. I can't remember the name of this Aviak, but he is a two hour spawn. I never saw him myself and got bored waiting. From what I hear he is perhaps level 34.<P>I don't know the coordinates of the island other than id you take the boat out of freeport, and jump off after the siren isle. Go east or west till the second coordinate is 4600 then go straight North. Personally, I jumped off at the wood elf isle, levitated and ran the whole way. I hate the boat with a passion.<P>If there is another spear to which you are referring, never mind.<P>------------------<BR>

<br>I've been trying to figure this one out for some time now...every night for the past two weeks I go through Paw and kill all of the named gnolls (4 total + the Ishva Mal).<P>The Ishva is rarely up, but the others seem to spawn on a 3hr cycle (though sometimes it doesnt work right).<P>Each of these gnolls drops an item VERY rarely.  In fact I've only gotten one drop of each in two weeks (actually two drops on one).<P>Here's what I know:<P>The Named Gnoll in the old Captain/Shaman area drops a 1HS sword -- 10/38 +5dex, Effect: Strong Poison.  It's No Drop.<P>The Named Gnoll near the old Ghanex spot drops the Gnoll Hide Tome -- +10int, +5wis, -10str and some poison resist and hp.  Nice item.<P>The Named Gnoll just around the corner from the old Ghanex spot drops a Shield -- 12ac, 5dex and some poison resist.  It has a unique graphic - brown with a eagle looking emblem.<P>The Named Gnoll down where the commanders and shaman used to spawn drops another 1HS sword - can't remember stats, but nothing too special - again No Drop.<P>I can only assume that one of these gnolls has a secondary drop - the shaman spear.  Time will tell.<P>Drayas/Savan<BR>Mithaniel Marr<P><P>------------------<BR>

<br>You should consider camping the Ebon War Spear in OOT.  Sure it has 1 less wis, but it has +4 str instead of +4 int, it also has +5 magic resist.  It comes from a aviak in OOT called Soarin Brightfeather.  When I went there I just had my pet kill everything on the island.  His max hit was 77 dmg so I'm assumeing hes around lvl 30.  I'm lvl 50 so it was no prob killing him.  I got a nice spear for my range slot now.<P>------------------<BR>Sulon McMoor<BR>Barbarian Shaman<BR>Fennin Ro<P><BR>

<br>I have the Darksea Harpoon and the Ebon war spear, but darn it I want all the spears.  A good int spear (like this) will also help people raise their piercing faster.  These people are trying to find it and I say good deal. I will endevor to help, but I am only level 37 at the current moment.<P>------------------<BR>Bearkin Icebear<BR>Shaman Journeyman<BR>Tallon Zek

<br>I have been looking for this spear also. The int boost is very nice.<BR>As for PAW I know FOR SURE of at least 5 named spawns not 4, and possibly a 6th. They have added a few specially named ones into new spots compared to the old paw. None of them have the same name as the spear though. I have found and killed one that is a cleric 4 times and he has either dropped nothing, a FS dagger, or a faded Writ....he is a very tough solo because of his complete heals he has a tendency to get off. BTW is it typical for mobs that normally can't wield a weapon type to have that weapon anyways?<P>Is Ghanex the original badass of the dungeon? The necro that spawned down the water hole?<BR>If so his spot was a very rare spawn compared to the others. Also Kurpukk still spawns as he did before. Ruby eye quest, so his spawn has not been replaced.<P>Anyone bother clearing the judges and executioners in there? I can solo pull most things in most areas at level 50, but occasionally a small train results and I have to gate out. I usually go without the pet because he attracts unneeded attention. All the named are still blue at 50.<P>------------------<BR>

<br>Last night our two teams went into paw.  Our primary goal was to get the scroll of summon corpse (unfortunately a weenie who watched us clear out the guards charmed the named mob when we pulled him).<P>We cleared the judge / executioner area.  Including the named mob past them.  Judges and executioner didn't drop any new items (we killed the executioner 3 or 4 times).  We only got the named gnoll there once and he didn't drop any items.<P>We did get 2 of the ruby pendants.  We also killed the named gnoll who drops the shield and the book but didn't get either.<P>We didn't find anyone who dropped the spear and are still looking...<P>------------------<BR>

<br> From all accounts that I've read, the named cleric gnoll (one that drops the shield) drops this spear.<P> If so, its a rare drop in the most extreme sense of the phrase.  I've killed him about 15 times now.  Gotten about 6 shields and no spear.  All the named gnolls do drop something, its just that its about a %10 chance (shield does appear to be a bit more common).<P>------------------<BR>

<br>Yes the spear drops of the mob that drops the shield.  I got mine today after killing said mob 3 times.  Now off to get a barb fishing spear =)<P>------------------<BR>

<br> I'm curious about something.  Anyone who has ever gotten the spear from the named gnoll, I have heard that if he does spawn with the spear, you can see him holding it.  I'm wondering if there is any truth to this.<P>------------------<BR>

<br>Yes, you can see him holding the spear. Looks like a normal FS spear though, no special graphic.
