<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Field Marshal Klesh</div><div class="date">Apr 13, 2001, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I am a transplant here from over at Apolyton.  This is actually my fist post at CivFanatics. Glad to be here.  I want to let you guys know about the scenario that I am making revolving around the greatest single battle in history: Stalingrad.<br />
<br />
The working model is devided into 5 phases:<br />
<br />
I. 'Outskirts'<br />
II. 'City In Flames'<br />
III. 'Counter-attack<br />
IV. 'Breakthrough'<br />
V. 'Liquidation'<br />
<br />
The game is designed for play as the Germans only.  This is a battle scenario, so all of the usual tech development and empire building will not be involved.  You will need to capture Objectives within the City itself before the Soviets lauch Operation Uranus and encircle the 6th Army. If they lauch their offensive (with 2 large pincer movements), you will be left to hold as much territory (objectives)as possible before time runs out (or you get...well, liquidated).<br />
<br />
One of the more interesting aspects is that the majority of the fighting will take place within the city. By 'city' I mean that much of the terrain has been changed to transform a normal Civ2 map into a 'zoomed in' map of the city of Stalingrad, complete with destinctive city sections/ blocks etc.<br />
<br />
The scenario is far from complete, but ideas are flowing and the energy is highhttp://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smokin.gif, so I look forward to getting it done.<br />
<br />
I'd also like any help you guys can offer when I need it (as I am sure I will).  Any nice maps or unit info would be appriciated. I have alot already, but knowledge is key here. Thanks alot, hope you guys will enjoy it. More to come shortly...<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
FMK<br />
<br />
PS: Wow, there are alot more options to spice up one's threads at this place huh? Nice &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />

It really sounds like you've got a creative scenario happeing from the picture you just painted...I have an interest in doing unique and progressive things with Civ II. <br />
<br />
Also, there are a couple of authors in here that know a thing or two about battles and history of the era you speak. I am sure they will be able to add to this thread quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Tell me, what version of CivII do you plan this scenario for? How many turns?<br />

<br />
   How many turns?<br />
Undecided as of yet.<br />
<br />
Alcibiaties of Athenae: What is your name over at ACS? I think I recognize the sig, though. May I email you for discussion?<br />
<br />
Et al: Its nowhere near playtest yet. Still making mini-builds to test out unit battles on specific terrains and attack/defense stats etc, but the kobayashi spreadsheet should help with that... only if I can figure out how to use it! (I'm really a musician, so all this computer stuff takes me awhile, but I eventually get it)<br />
<br />
   A WWII scenario? How original.<br />
<br />
Gee, thanks for the positive vibe, man! &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/rolleyes.gif&quot; border=0&gt;  Actually if you bothered to read the first post you should find that the idea of an urban battle has yet to be done for WWII. I am aware of scenarios such as &quot;Gangster&quot; and others that take a 'zoomed-in' city approach, but not any in the WWII theme. If it doesn't intrest you, then why post in here? BTW, don't let the door hit your arse on the way out, home-skillet.<br />
<br />
Here's a question.<br />
Does anyone have any skills:<br />
<br />
1) Making graphics for the 4-tile terrain2.gif? I have a need for some artwork, though it actually wouldn't be hard to do if you have any experience with it.<br />
<br />
2) Making or editing .BAT programs? I know of a few guys at Apolyton, and even a friend that doesn't know about Civ but is a pc whiz, they could help me, but I could also use all the help I can get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, thats all for now. I'm glad to see such activity on these boards. It is refreshing.<br />

This sounds like a particularly interesting approach to take to the perdition of Paulus'pernicious and pusillanimous Panzers, and one looks forward to perusing the end result, as one is thinking along similar lines for a Belfast scen.<br />
It will be quite intriguing to see how a tactical examination of 'house-to-house' battle manifests itself in a civ millieu.<br />
Will there be adjustments for the weather (General Winter), and increasing lack of supply, and even perhaps an inability to conduct tactical retreats due to the directives of the cantakerous house painter in the Wolfshanze. One waits in the trembling anticipation of a man expecting the arrival of a large red goat, only to find there are two..<br />
<br />
But anyway, am so very much looking forward to the next update old chap, and to hearing the dulcet tones of Georgi Zhukov serenading us with &quot;Kalinka&quot; amid the shattered ruins..<br />

Whilst I was looking at design tips in order to progress, I decided to look at something I thought was sorta a 'finishing touch'...the sounds. Well, to my utter surprise and dismay I find that the sounds for units are very much tied into their unit slot!!!! That is so dumb, it makes no sense to have that hard-coded into the game!?!  So now I have to go back and totally rearrange the units, but first I have to figure which ones are gonna use the same sounds etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am thinking of making many new, never-before-heard sound samples from movies. My buddies have all kinds of good equipment for that.  I am aware of the requirements (8bit, mono whatever) for the sounds. This is just a big pain in the arse, because nowe I have to stop building, and sit down to conceptualize again. The sounds were so far from my mind that it is really not something I was prepared to deal with just yet... Oh well, take it as it comes. Okay, back into the fray...</div></div><hr />

I do have one question to you kobayashi. Can you put other 'missles', that is 'destroyed after attacking' units into the 'Extra1-8' slots and have them play their respective 'Extra 1-8' sound rather than 'missle.wav'? Same question for a land unit in the 'Extra 1-8' slots that can 'attack planes'. Will that revert to 'Swordfgt' instead of its defined 'Extra' sound?<br />

BTW, I learned allthat technical jargon right ther from reading your paper kobayashi! Thanks a million!<br />

<br />
All wav file you assign to the extra unit slots will overide any default sounds. But you will only have one sound per slot (you know, like planes are supposed to have four sounds)</div></div><hr />

I have found a great WWII site<br />

which has an extensive map section and a huge forum with over a dozen major threads on stalingrad alone. (too late form my ZWK).<br />
This is an absolute must for every WW2 scenario designer.<br />

Here's a hint. The map of Stalingrad Street fighting is approximately the scale of my scenario.  Sadly, this will mean scalled down versions of the approaches to the City, the Operation Uranus encirclement, and the Hoth Breakthrough attempt. But, hey its about the streetfighting right?<br />

I'm gonna need some help fellas!<br />
I was just doing a little building to Stalingrad, and I saved it as 'Current.scn'. I closed down Civ, started it up again, loaded the scenario.....BAM...illegal operation and Civ shuts down to the desktop! I loaded the older versions of the scenario and even they won't work. I loaded up other scenarios and they work fine, so something is wrong on my end for sure. Any ideas? I hope all is not lost...http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 27, 2001, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely its the tech tree - it doesn't have a continuous line from nil to future tech for all the tribes. Since this is stored in the rules.txt, older versions you have will also crash upon loading. The best way to fix this is to manually reverse the last few changes you did to the tech tree via editing the rules.txt.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, then the next most likely reason is that certain parts of the rules.txt, game.txt or labels.txt were erased accidently. Incrementally replace each file with the default ones (after changing the name of the ones you made) and narrow down the source of the problem.<br />
<br />
(additional info: I know you said that earlier versions also crashed but if they didn't crash, then the most likely reason is that the events.txt was edited manually and exceeded the maximum size)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not really a gift. I did work a lot on it but there was a trick to doing ZWK in four weeks. It's actually the same format as ST:BAQ (Federation=Allies, Romulans=Axis, Russians = Klingons) and a simlar tech tree with three subsidiary branches for each tribe (M26= Sovereign, D'deridex= King Tiger, IS-2 = Neg'var). You get the idea. If not for the basic scenario format that already existed, it would be next to impossible to do a decent scenario with new units in such a short time.<br />

The names for the difficulty leves, is this in the rules.txt only? I have changed that, and the game displays the default titles (cheiftan, prince etc) Here is what I have typed in the rules.txt:<br />
<br />
@DIFFICULTY<br />

Hauptmann<br />
Oberst<br />
Generaloberst<br />
Feldmarschall<br />

There are the required spaces before the first and after the last lines of text. I guess I need to change it elsewhere? I looked in the Labels.txt for the default names...in order to change them, but they weren't there either. A quick point in the right direction, if you please. <br />

Okay guys, here's another question.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if tech obsolescence affects event-generation. I'll explain further by example:<br />
<br />
<br />
Tech A- Given to the Germans at the start. In the events, if Germans have tech A then create units... let's say 20 miles outside the city.<br />
<br />
I want the Germans to continue to recieve units every turn via having this tech, untill they earn another tech by capturing something. This new tech would be Tech B, and it would make tech A obsolete. Could I then make an event to move the unit generation spots to.. say 10 miles outside the city? I would of course want the units to no longer be generated at the 20 mile point.<br />
<br />
Basically I want to be able to move the generation points closer to the city as the player succeedes in certain missions etc. I don't know if the events that create units from Tech A would stop once Tech B is given.<br />
<br />
Could this be taken care of by adding another 'if' to the code? Somehow possibly asking for the presence of Tech B before the generation of Tech A units?<br />
<br />
I haven't had any experience with this language...or any computer language for that matter, so excuse the base qualities of the proposition. <br />
<br />
So would all that stuff up there work?<br />
Any ideas as to how I can get that 'closer to the city' effct from my unit creation? Thanks.<br />
<br />

There is of course the multiple events files trick, but I'm not brave enough to tackle that one. I know you can't have multiple triggers, which really miffs me, (I'd love to be able to say &quot;If this *and* that&quot;) So the only thing I can imagine is to have seperate actions that interfere with the previous one.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this would work, but in your example, when goal B is achieved, perhaps you could have the terrain changed at drop spot A making the first unit not go there, or maybe have a single, invisible, 0 movement unit dropped there. I have my doubts about the former, and the latter would only work until the invisible unit was killed...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have an idea. It involves the city walls and how the city changes when you build some. OK, here goes: OK, what you could do is give the placed cities (the ones you built) city walls, and then make city walls a non-buildable improvement. After that you'd make the walled cities look like buildings and the un-walled ones(the ones the player builds) look like camps. Good idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Field Marshal Klesh</div><div class="date">May 06, 2001, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, those aregood ideas, but I am way past that stage of the game. The player will not have any settler-type units, so building cities will be out. I have several different city types being used currently. City walls are there for defensive purposes mostly, and since they can be destroyed after a battle, they aren't reliable as cornerstones to the cities appearance.<br />
<br />
I posted a picture of the map on one of the other pages in this thread. From that extreme zoom it is tough to tell whats what. The city itself rides along the west bank of the Volga river for the majority of the map. Only a few spots to the north and south are not part of the city. The city aslo stretches to a good width inland from the river. Beyond the limits of the city are the fortified defenses...barbed wire, forts etc. And beyond that there is open land, with trees and farms etc. The player will have to fight his way through the countryside, then past the defenses, and into the city itself. There will of course be plenty of city fighting, my man.<br />

That will be the meat of the scenario. It'll be almost mission oriented; you kill this or that, you recieve this or that. I am still trying to decide the best ways to make what I want to go down actually happen. I have lots of techs left to play with, so I have many possibilities.<br />

<br />
Its been awhile since I've posted about my progress. Slowly but surely I have been tinkering on this thing, and it is really starting to take shape nicely. The AI has had no problems with some of the more odd things I am having it do. <br />
<br />
I still have this annoying dither effect going on... small bits of ocean and also the white cursor get stuck on certain graphics. Once the screen shifts it goes back to normal, so its no big deal. Hopefully you guys can spot the problem during playtesting. <br />
<br />
She is almost ready to be tested, at least the opening stages that is. I still have a few things to decide about and then implement. I am not sure just how I want to cover reinforcements. Should they be based on merit or turn #? By merit, I mean that you kill this or that unit, and then are given some reinforcements depending on what you killed. But beyond that, I still have to figure a way to keep the reinforcements semi close to the front. I don't wanna give you an infantryman and make you move him across the whole map in order to get in the fray. <br />
<br />
So we aren't too far away from the opening stages of testing, though I won't ask for people just yet. But jsut know that it is comming... <br />

Now for another question...Is there a way in events.txt to put a message within the border... like a title-type one? <br />

JUSTONCE <br />
@ENDIF <br />

I want the 'From the desk of OKW' to be inside the popup windows border, and also to be in that different greyish text. You know, just run any old game of Civ and you'll see what I'm talking about...<br />
<br />
I know that the reason the text gets there in the first place is because it is a part of the game.txt. The message is an &quot;@Message&quot; type one in the game.txt and that the text after the '@' is what is displayed. <br />
<br />
Is there possibly something to add within the event.txt's code to get the same effect? <br />

Could this be taken care of by adding another 'if' to the code? Somehow possibly asking for the presence of Tech B before the generation of Tech A units?<br />
<br />
FMK<br />
<br />
<br />
What you have described here is the tech trigger - there is no way to stop the the repeating events once they are triggered because there are is no 'OR' or 'AND' implimentation in the limited macro language.<br />
<br />
Now that I've told you it can't be done, let me give you a way around this particular problem. What you can do is to change the spot where the reinforcements appear to a pond (ocean) when Tech B is discovered. The units will still try to appear each turn but can't. If you have no sea in your map, all the better - you can make the 'denied' area look like whatever you want.<br />
<br />
I have used this technique several times in ST-BAQ(Borg ion storm generator) and ST-DM (dominion and cardasian shipyards) without a hitch.</div></div><hr />

This gives the effect of when you capture city A, the 0-move unit that is blocking the square that your units should be generated in is disbanded. Now instead of receiving your replacements at the rear of the battlefield, the reinforcements will now have the effect of moving along with the player's successes. There is in fact 3 separate 'paths' that the event-generated units can take. &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />

<br />
So it has been awhile since my last update. Manythings have changed...all for the better hopefully. Currently, I am in the initial phases of playtesting the opening stages of the game. Since the scenario will have multiple outcomes, and paths through the game, I need to have different events for each path. I have done this in my head and all I am doing now is letting a few kids play what I have to get a feel for the span of turns needed. Once I get a feel for how the player generally progresses through the opening rounds, I can move on and set turn #'s for events that occour later in the game.<br />
<br />
I have also begun putting together the winter files. This is of course new terrain, units and rules files.<br />
<br />
Things are comming along great, and I never though'd I'd be able to take this thing this far along. It is really looking and sounding good. As soon as I can get a feel for the timespan, it is a matter of writing up the last of the events, plugging in some winter stuff, and getting my friend to write a batch program for me. I will then ask for a few playtesters to help me with the overall scen playtest once I am up to there. If things keep going as they are now, that just might not be too far away!<br />
<br />
I will also be putting together a 'preview' for CF if I can find the time, and in there you might see some things that you'll like ;D<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Anyways, FMK is in the middle of writing some of the last events files.  The play testers are done with it as far as I can tell, or they've been playing the game since before civ3 was released.

Originally I had railroad in the city itself... with regular roads in the outskirts. That makes it far too easy to zip around inside the city. So I wanted to remove the railroads and replace them with roads within the city. For the outskirts I wanted to use rivers as unpillagable terrain that will still act like roads. Thus, pillaging by the AI will be a greater problem for the player inside the city because there is only one layer of road to be destroyed before it starts to slow you down. This was going to be done by using Mapedit and MapCopy and other fancy things.<br />
<br />
Alas, I forgot to realize that rivers connect neither horizontally nor vertically. This would force me to have very ugly zig-zag roads only on the diagonal, which won't be cool at all. Back to the drawing board I went...<br />

Are you talking about the Anthony Beevor book Stalingrad? I assume there are plenty of books with that title or simmilar. I have that one as well and read about them in there too. <br />
<br />
What I have done is to place a limmited ammount of these critters at the start of the scen. As the player moves his units across the open terrain before he enters the city, the dogs will attack. After they are all killed or used, their unit slot will change. <br />
This is to reflect their not-too successful deployment that gogog mentioned. The sound I made for this unit is bloody excellent. It was quite a odd thing to have to make as well. Now, I am just waiting on the artist that I comandeered to finish his work. I have a lion in his place for the time being.<br />

Yeah, I've been attacked by them quite a few times. IMO, they should be left how they are - they concentrate on the tanks and are well balanced (I was able to destroy about 2/3 before they reached the tanks). <br />
The only problem I have with them is the lack of a shield. Due to this they blend in with the background, and I've kamakazied several returning bombers into the dogs :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
My uncle fought during the war (a Greek Russian) and remarked that some dogs were used to destoy german tanks from the 62 Russian army anti tank sections defending the cental front at stalingrad.<br />
<br />
Because the german standard blitz tactic was to attack with aircraft support first , tanks second  and then followed by Infantry(who could not offer support to shoot them), the dogs did a lot of damage. <br />
<br />
They were especially usefull in built up areas where their small size and speed made interception allmost imposible. At night they were deady and very effective in locating camped tanks and detroying them.<br />

The dogs were trained to run underneath tanks and they were not used if russian tanks were in very close proximetry.</div></div><hr />

I tried to create a &quot;bridge&quot; terrain, and i tried messing around with the coasts, and i tried using roads for the bridge. NOTHING works.<br />
i know from maps of stalingrad that there is less of a problem because there  are fewer bridges, and also you can ignore the river pretty much as the germans barely got there, and its enormous. But Paris needs the Seine and its bridges (which weren't blown up in any war i know of). So what can i do? does anyone know how to get around the problem (try editing a terrain - it only has &quot;jurisdiction&quot; over the diamond and the two upper triangles)?<br />
Please help - Im very desperate - and i dont wanna blow up half the bridges in paris, and nor do i wanna swivel paris around to avoid the problem.:confused:</div></div><hr />
