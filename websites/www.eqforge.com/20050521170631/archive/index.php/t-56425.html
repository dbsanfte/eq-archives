This group is completely made up of Jedis (it is a little different from the Star Wars Jedi Council, because it includes padawans). There are two types of members, masters and padawans. One must first join as a padawan. A padawan must have a master teacher. A master can only have one padawan at a time. Padawans can become masters, if 1/2 of the current masters* and agree to it and I approve of it. <br />
<br />
*This does not include me.<br />
<br />
We are currently hoping for more members. The first to join will become masters at once since we are in urgent need of ones..<br />
<br />
Roles of The Jedi Council <br />
1) Masters of the Jedi Council give advice to those who seek it. <br />
2) The Jedi Council (including apprentices) also has responsibility [for protecting important people.<br />
3) The Council also urges the nation to go for religous advances and improvements.<br />

<br />
Anthony: I will join, but I also bring skills of self-defence, that could be handy for the young apprentices who have not yet mastered the force. It is called Romanate (Long O and E. short A.) With these skills, a young jedi can defend himself in close-quarters. Their skill is measured and showed by the belt they wear. The belts go in order:<br />
<br />
White (Beginner) [6 stripes to advance]<br />
Yellow (Novice) [6 stripes to advance]<br />
Green (Intermediate) [6 tripes to advance]<br />
Brown (Advanced) [6 stripes to advance]<br />
Black (Expert) [10 stripes to advance]<br />
Red &amp; White (Master) [10 stripes to advance]<br />
Blood Red (Grand Master) [Final Belt {Very hard to achieve}]<br />
<br />
To gain a new belt, you must master your Kata and Fighting. Each time you do, you get a stripe. You need 6 stripes to get to each belt. When you get to black, you need 10. I myself am a Grand Master. I offer this to you, and you can decline it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarn</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Council Vote: #01 is ratified. Thanks for responding. :)<br />
<br />
The Jedi Council is responsible of exposing foreign informats within Fanatica and allied nations.<br />
<br />
Let's catch some bad guys. ;)<br />
<br />
Council Vote: #02<br />
<br />
If this vote is passed,<br />
<br />
A) a padawan must answer questions presented by the Lord Master, Secondary Lord Master, or the Head Trainer AND their personal master and succeed in answering them correctly to have a vote on their promotion to master.<br />
<br />
B) Masters and padawans are encouraged to inform the Council on leaving (even if for a short time), so the Council knows who is still active.<br />
<br />
This vote came to the Council, so they the Council can know if a padawan is really willing to take on the responsibilities of a master. Some become a master and left the Council without notice in the last demogame. It would also make the votes actual trials, which what was the origional intention.<br />
<br />
Possible counter argueement: This makes the Council less fun, since these rules would make it harder for the padawans to become masters. So people may not want to join the Council.<br />
<br />
All masters please vote yes, no, or abstain. This vote will last 48 hours as indicated in the rules.<br />
<br />
Council Vote: #03 (Don't vote, yet)<br />
<br />
If this vote is passed, votes on Council votes are given to the Lord Master via pm or email.<br />
<br />
This vote came to the Council, so the number of posts doesn't sky rocket on Council votes.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm trying to think of a way where I don't have to post Council votes, so this thread is more rpg then vote after vote. If someone can present a way to do it, please hold a vote. :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question regarding on section &quot;b&quot;, would that include Real Life cercimstances? I just want to know if RL factors would be included in it :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarn</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we can't force people to post. That's why I said encouraged. If one ends up in a hospital, then they can't respond. Those situations are understandable. It is a loop hole, though. We may have to place someone as inactive after a certain amount of time. Looks like another Council Vote.<br />
<br />
We also need to store Council votes somewhere. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
BTW, discussing your views on votes is enouraged. I am just trying to eliminate posts like 'Vote: Yes.' That's all.</div></div><hr />
