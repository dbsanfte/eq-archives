This is to be the world's first ever international organization.  It will consist of DePaolo Land, Neronia, and Plainia.<br />
Here is the charter: <br />
<br />
1.  We accept each other's right to exist.<br />
2.  An attack against one nation in the organization is considered an attack against all.<br />
3.  The nations in this organization will settle all disputes peacefully if at all possible.<br />
4.  All agreements that in any way involves all three nations or a deal with a foreign power require the agreement of every one of the three nations.  A deal between two nations requires the consent of both nations.  Minor procedural matters may be agreed to by majority vote of the despots.<br />
5.  A real life rule:  A nation will be considered to have agreed to an agreement if they have posted no response in 48 RL hours unless the player controlling the nation has stated their absence in an OOC post in the RPG forum.<br />
6.  This charter comes into effect when ratified by all three nations.<br />
<br />
I, Julius Peesea, hereby ratify the charter.  I encourage my fellow despots Antony and Janus to do the same.<br />
<br />
OOC:  Here is a map of the nations.  DePaolo Land is in black, Neronia is in red, Plainia is in blue.  (The city tile is controlled by Antony, the mountain tile to the NW is controlled by Janus.  This is according to the Land Manager)<br />

BTW: Me and Civanator need to fix that land split :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">May 24, 2003, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a suggestion her for the land split. It may not seem fair at first since I have two more tiles then Civanator, but that is just to make the resources even. Actually Civ wil get more then me.<br />
<br />
After converting the gold, the resources are like this:<br />
<br />
Antony: 9\10<br />
Nero: 9\9<br />
Julius: 1\1<br />
<br />
(you are free to redo my number but Im bery shure that they are correct)<br />
<br />
I think this is a fair proposal and I hope that all parts will accsept this.<br />
<br />
@Civaantor: I would want to keep the city neutral, but this would mean me having even more terretory to make it equal...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 24, 2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cornelia:  I have a more fair counterproposal:  I will proclaim ownership of the plains square to the SE of Plainia when the borders enlarge.  I will do this to be able to support another unit and to avoid being completely enveloped.  The mountain square  to the NW of Nar Shaddaa would go to DePaolo land upon full expansion.  The land would be as follows:<br />
DePaolo:  7/11/12 (9 from the tile rule)<br />
Neronia: 7/8/15+1 per population point (11 from the tile rule)<br />
Plainia: 2/2/2<br />
Also, the city tile should be neutral until we have fully expanded.  I think that this deal will be more beneficial to all three nations.  Will all parties accept my counterproposal? <br />
Also, Antony, please ratify our charter.<br />
OOC:  Land wouldn't be ours until it is within our borders, right?  Also, Julius died, which is why Cornelia is Despotess of Plainia, and Janus is crippled.  Is he going to remain the Despot of Neronia?<br />
Here is a map of the counterproposal:<br />

For me its the same wich of the ideas that are beeing acsepted. As I stated earlier, I have accsepted the charter. Thats right, we cannoy use the tiles untill it expands..<br />
<br />
OOC: Janus was dead before he became crippeled. A error from ct. (actually from CG but anyway..) Janus were never the despot of Neronia as he died before the revoultion. Alexander Nero was the Despot untill he died in the disease. Now Alexanders nephew, Corevius Nero is Despot.  I've told you this already booty :P</div></div><hr />

Antony: I agree to the charter. As for land ownership, I will let Plainia take the tile SE. But here is my change:<br />
-I control the city, and give Neronia the tile NW. The city will still be the capitol of our nations, but under my jurisdiction.<br />

If you agree, than I agree.</div></div><hr />

Because the income is going to waist, why not use it as a loan. But we must use it resonably. Because my father has 4, maybe 5 units, he needs 1-2 more upkeep for his troops. But, you cannot use this to raise a troop, only to help upkeep it. Like Plainia needs help to upkeep its archer unit. It can use 1 food and shield to upkeep. Wouldn't this be a good idea?</div></div><hr />

We should accept the first proposal map, by Janus when he was still alive, with two changes:<br />
1. Plainia receives the tile to the SE.<br />
2. The city tile will be neutral and all gains will go to no one.<br />
<br />
This is the same as my earlier proposal, except that the mountain tile to the NW of the city goes to Neronia.  The income will be:<br />
DePaolo: 7/9/11<br />
Neronia:  5/8/14<br />
Plainia:  2/2/2<br />
This looks to me like the best possible compromise for both parties, as Neronia has 2 fewer food and 1 fewer shield but 3 greater gold than DePaolo.  Is this acceptable to all parties?<br />

Here is a map of it:<br />

Once a nation gets up to 10 tiles, its tile income doubles!  Though Neronia won't mind, DePaolo land would have only about half of the gold of Neronia.  Therefore, I ask that the mountain square that would border Plainia be given to Plainia upon expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">May 26, 2003, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Antony: Actually, How about DePaolo takes the mountain NW of Nar Shaddaa, or the coast 2 tiles NW of Nar Shaddaa. This would make 8 tiles for DePaolo, 8 for Neronia, and 2 for Plainia. But, I am in favor of Plainia's proposal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 26, 2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted my proposal because if DePaolo were to gain more land, it would outstrip Neronia in resources by quite a bit.

<br />
OOC: Civ: you cant &quot;borrow&quot; food from nar shadaa. Its COMPLETLY neutral. I actually think that the ONSS should own the city tile and that there should be a speical agreement about that. It will raise a unit (or two) only for the protection off the city.<br />
If we do this there has to be certain rules about that unit(s).<br />
<br />
1. They are not to leave nar shadaa, ever.<br />
2. They become completely neutral, and under the conflict managers rule, if there is war between that states of Nar Shadaa.<br />
3. It will be supported only by the resources of the city tile.</div></div><hr />

OOC:  The city tile is making 2.1.3 right now, and it will always make at least 2.1.2.  We should convert two gold to one shield and build a spearman, if it is allowed for an organization rather than an individual to own property and units.</div></div><hr />

bellona lifespania:<br />
our informants recently reported troop moovements to your borders. i would like to make sure you dont cross the borderline, or otherwise that will have to be seen as a hostile action against fanatica. we would definitely not like to see our good relations being disturbed by a uncautious moove of anyone.</div></div><hr />

There are orders to wait at the border for a diplomat from Fanatica. Those would be a Warrior unit. Do not take this as a Hostile Act. Any other troops are possibly rebels, if not they are wandering scouts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bellona:<br />
Antonio, this is what we expected. We just wanted to ensure there is no misinterpretation of the situation. So you have rebels in you country? You surely should do something about this then. We hope our diplomat arrives savely though, as we thought the lands would be save...<br />
<br />
Ah, and of course if you need help to quell the resistance in Nar Shaddaa then helenatica will surely be glad to support you with troops stationed in the city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Antonio:<br />
Bellona, Thank you for your support. We seem to have the situation under control at the moment. We are sending units to protect the diplomat because that would be a prime target for rebels to start turmoil between countries. Just in case the Organization cannot control the situation for a reason, I personaly would like to have a spearman unit waiting just outside the border, where they can use the road to quickly get to the city. This will have to be discussed with the other members of the Organization, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bellona:<br />
As my husband will soon have the troops to protect noshuret himself, helenatica obviously has some spears to be prepared.<br />
I would nevertheless prefer not to moove the units until you call for support. It always seems like a breach of trust if troops are outside other nation's borderlines.<br />
Helenatica also has a major attack force ready for a fast moovement up to the ONS... if needed.</div></div><hr />

I dont think well go outside our borders. But it would be nice if you sendt some extra security with the dimplomat to be on the safeside... When he gets to the border mine and civanatars units will take it from there and escort him directly to the city.<br />

To the memebers of the ONSS:<br />

I have a proposal for making the work between our nations far easier.. I think that the all the nations of ONSS should sign a rop between eachother.. This would make things like the escorting of diplomats and stuff easier..</div></div><hr />

Dearest Corevius, this would have been done if we would have been notified of the rebellious activity in your territory earlier. Now it will be too late to send support as we wont be able to catch up with the diplomats escort any more... he is well outside fanatican borders at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some dark figures sneak up to the cattle... suddenly strange noises are heard through the night...<br />
<br />
Figure1: &quot;HUTHUT! COMEON! HUTHUTHUT!&quot;<br />
<br />
The cattle are surprised and suddenly start running. Due to the sounds the resulting stampede is directed to the workshops of the tile.<br />
<br />
As the cattle ran past, most of the workshops were destroyed. <br />
<br />
People: &quot;Someone must have caused this stampede... we heard voices...&quot;<br />
Guards: &quot;So in which direction did they go?&quot;<br />
People: &quot;Dont you stupid nuts hear the noise? Follow them! Quick!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so the guards start hunting the attackers down...<br />
<br />
But things come differently than you might expect.........<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, the cattle turns back and the stampede runs through the attackers.... with most of them dying.<br />
<br />
At this moment, the guards manage to catch up with the attackers...<br />
<br />
Guards: &quot;STOP! Give up... you are outnumbered! You dont have a chance!&quot;<br />
Attackers: &quot;We never will give up!&quot;<br />
<br />
The attackers draw their weapons and a heavy fight arises...<br />
Most of the attackers fall, and some get caught...<br />
<br />
Secundus Becchino is caught by the guards...<br />
<br />
<br />
OOC:<br />
this event was initiated for the FreeDom Cell. It was officially ruled by the land manager and the rpg manager.<br />
The tile SW of Nar Shadda gets -1 shield due to this event.<br />
The main attacker, Secundus Becchino, was caught during the event but not yet killed. Note here: He wont betray his brothers :-) <br />
So now i give over this event to the rulers of the ONS.</div></div><hr />

Warrior:  We have methods designed to extract information from anybody, by torture!  We will set things afire on you, scald you with boiling water, dunk you underwater until you almost drown, whip you, whatever it takes to cause you to tell us:  Who are your companions?<br />
Secondus:  You will never make me talk.<br />
 Three strong warriors tie Secondus to a tree and start to torture him.<br />
OOC:  Oct, it is up to you to decide whether we extract any information as to his companions or other information about the Nar Shaddaa Freedom Cell and whether the torture kills Secondus.  CT has granted permission to kill, if that's how you rule.<br />

Ancient methods of torture (there was a show on the History Channel about the history of torture) was done by tying someone up to a tree and doing things like putting burning straw in their openings (ears, mouth, nose, etc. - including under fingernails and toenails). There were other methods too - water torture comes to mind, and whipping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Aldadan Taurnaina has been given permission, by Antony DePaolo, to go out of the palace and have the adventure that he has wanted for years.  Now he needs an idea.  One dark, restless midnight, a messenger rushed into Aldadan's rooms...<br />
<br />
Messenger:  Sir!  Secundus, the rebel, has escaped!<br />
<br />
Ald:  What?!  How?!<br />
<br />
Messenger:  Someone snuck into the dungeons to get him, then tricked a guard and killed him!<br />
<br />
Ald:  Which way did they go?<br />
<br />
Messenger:  Well, northeast sir, but-  (shouting now)  WAIT!  Antony already sent out...  (quiets down, then sighs)  Fool man, rushing off like that to find Secundus...<br />
<br />
Aldadan is out of the palace, sprinting at full speed toward the city, with only his clothing, a bit of money, and his trusty staff.  There is little trail of the escapees, but Aldadan, now relying on his woodcraft from boyhood, tracks them to the city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">May 28, 2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Antonio is notified that Secundus has escaped, and he is not too happy...<br />

Antonio: HOW COULD YOU LET SOMEONE PAST TO THE DUNGEON!!!??? WHAT KIND OF GUARDS DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!!?? YOU ARE NOT GUARDS ANYMORE IN THIS PALACE!!! I CAN FIND MORE PEOPLE TO REPLACE YOU, WE ALREADY HAVE GUARDS WAITING TO PATROL!!!<br />
<br />
A little while later...<br />
<br />
Messenger: Sir, Aldadan has run after the Secundus!<br />
<br />
Antonio: Leav him be. He was to do what he wanted, just have a couple guards trail behind him, I don't want my father's friend to be killed. Actually, send Hiberius, Julius, and Gaiaus to trail him. I'm sure he will be fine anyway.<br />
<br />
After the messenger leaves, Antonio slips on a light plate of iron armor, and a special iron sword. These were from some bis of iron found in the mountain side. He gets a bow, too, and some food. He runs off after Ald, Antonio isn't going to let Ald have all the fun. He leaves bella at home, pregnant with Anthony II.</div></div><hr />

 Julia and Brutus get married only a few days after the proposal. <br />
Julia:  Now that I am married, I must follow through on a plan.  We will attack Neronia and gain land from them.  Brutus, you will command our forces.<br />
Brutus:  I would be glad to.  It's time to fight!  The spearman unit will stay here protecting you, the warriors and swordsmen will attack.<br />
 The next day, the army sets out.  They are moving from the first plains tile of Plainia to the tile to the NE where the Neronian army, consisting of 2 swordsmen (though SJ never upgraded his units, we will assume he did because he was absent when the upgrades could be made).  They join up with the DePaolo army, consisting of three legions, who marched from the disputed mountain tile.  A total of three legions, one swordsman, and one warrior faces two swordsmen on the plains of Neronia. <br />
Brutus:  Charge!<br />
Antonio:  Attack now!<br />
OOC:  Oct, it's up for you to decide the battle.  Civanator and I had been discussing this by PM, so he's agreed to do this too.  If it is not allowed for the Neronian army to be swordsmen, please consider them to be warriors instead.</div></div><hr />

Early on, Julia's regiment of warriors retreats due to heavy losses at the hands of Corceivus' troops.  However, once Julia and Antony's swordsmen and legionaries were fully engaged, the last defenders of Neronia fell.  Most either surrendered or were killed.<br />
Of the generals, Corceivus was one of those found amongst the dead.  Brutus Garnicus suffered from a minor cut from the enemies' sword, but is expected to fully recover.  Antonio remained unharmed.<br />
<br />
Summary:  The surrendering men from Neronia may become one new sword unit.  It is up to the captors on who can control the unit.<br />
Julia's warriors will fight at half-strength until they recover (next TC)<br />
DePaolo Land and Plainia now have control of the former Neroia: They may divy it up as they please.</div></div><hr />

We now are 2 states, and have yet to decide what to do with the 1 swordsman unit.
