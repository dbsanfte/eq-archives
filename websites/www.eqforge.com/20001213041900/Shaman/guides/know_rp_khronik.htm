      The gods had many reasons for putting the races of Norrath upon this soil,
      each to his or her own design. The Barbarians were born from the gods of
      Love and Valor, and these ideals are our calling.
      <p>Right off, I noticed that Barbarians had a brotherhood few other races
      shared. There are fewer of us, and the barren, twisting Northlands makes
      one aware of just how much we depend upon each other for survival. The
      world is harsh, and the gods are not always kind to us, so we must of
      necessity be kind to one another.</p>
      <p>That I shower my gifts upon my own kind goes without saying. Whenever a
      Barbarian in need is near, I answer the call without desiring
      compensation. Often on my trips back to Halas, I will spend time in the
      newbie areas watching over the young Barbarians. I heal and buff as
      needed, not partaking in the battle unless dire need presents (aiding is
      one thing, coddling is another). I will even toss around some pieces of
      patchwork armor to promising young warriors and Shaman, when the desire to
      practice my tailoring presents itself.</p>
      <p><b><font size="3" color="#333366">Races</font></b><br>
      However, the real test of a Shaman is the width of his love for fellow
      beings. Once the raw days of youth have past and one makes that crucial
      journey through BlackBurrow into the outside world, things must change. We
      are Shaman. We understand the world as no other. We exist in both the
      Physical and Mystical realms and tie them both together in harmony. That
      the other inhabitants of Norrath do not share this wisdom is a tragedy,
      and is the goal of the Shaman to be the light that guides the unlearned.</p>
      <p>I do not discriminate by race. The flesh is a shell. A human does no
      crime being born a human. That he has learned erroneous ways of looking at
      the world is his curse, but not his fault. In my kindness I will guide
      him, and should he not see the value of the path I show him, I mourn his
      loss and bid him good bye.</p>
      <p>Elves understand Nature, but their arrogance must be cured if the world
      is to survive. Halflings are friendly creatures, and brothers of the
      forest. Their Druids are among the closest allies a Shaman has (although
      their tendencies to deify nature, rather than harness it as a steed, gets
      to be a tad foolish). I cannot help but like Dwarves. They are sturdy and
      forthright, and they drink Ale like a newborn drinks milk. (Besides, I
      find the sight of a Dwarf running under the power of SoW hysterical).</p>
      <p>Half Elves suffer the stigma of any half breed, and I will not add to
      their pain by discriminating against them. In any case, their existing
      between cultures makes them ready travelers and explorers, which I admire.</p>
      <p>Erudites irk me a bit. They are aloof and effeminate. They withdrew to
      their island as if they were to good for the rest of us, then proceeded to
      wage a bloody mage war that threatened the very planet. As individuals,
      they can be quite pleasant, but as a group, they are dangerous.</p>
      <p>I have met few Gnomes, so I have no opinion at this time. I find their
      living underground to be creepy, though.</p>
      <p>The dark races are indeed tragic. Their twisted heritage makes all but
      a precious few my enemy. But truth be told, I would not have a world
      without them. Peace is a wonderful goal for old men, but the young need
      adversity to grow strong. Evil exists to fire us to action, lest we grow
      soft in a comfortable bed. To the followers of Innoruk I say, &quot;Bring
      it on.&quot;</p>
      <p>Ogre and Troll Shaman are perhaps the most troublesome creatures to me.
      By species, they are my foes, but by trade, they are my brothers. I will
      deal with a dark Shaman apprehensively, but with professional courtesy. It
      is odd to make trade with a being who you know some day you may meet in
      combat to the death, but it is one of the many paradoxes of life a Shaman
      must struggle to comprehend.</p>
      <p><b><font size="3" color="#333366">Classes</font></b><br>
      While a man's birthplace makes little matter to me, his profession greatly
      affects my perceptions. A man's life path is his own to choose, not some
      twist of fate.</p>
      <p>Warriors are generic to me. I can respect any man who will grapple with
      the creatures of the world with only 3 feet of steel in his hands. But the
      warrior varies from the noble fighter to the loathsome mercenary. To me,
      your cause determines your worth.</p>
      <p>Magi of all stripes earn my respect. As a Shaman I know the mental
      disciplines of wielding mana, and only an egotistical fool would not
      recognize their superiority in the field. Sadly, their power comes at the
      expense of harmony with Nature (and with that, the loss of the wisdom and
      inner peace it gives). Notable exceptions to this are these: Enchanters,
      to me, are mostly just tricksters. Parlor magicians more suited for gypsy
      camps than combat. I've met a few that have used their abilities for
      exploration, and these I tip my helm to, but as a rule, they are just
      charlatans. Necromancers are dark beings who make my skin crawl. As a
      Shaman, I have channeled dark mana to sicken and infect, and I feel dirty
      whenever I do. I've also just never gotten used to the idea of speaking
      with someone with one of the undead on a leash. (And if there ever comes a
      day I again run across Tovax Vmar, let him beware my vengeance!)</p>
      <p>Bards and Druids are my brothers. They exist to aid all good people and
      have a certain harmony with the Universe. Plus, they can hold their own in
      battle. Good people all around.</p>
      <p>Clerics and Paladins are typically good, forthright people, who I will
      welcome so long as they are not over-zealous about their god. I worship
      the gods of Love and Valor, but I recognize that they are not the only
      force in the heavens. Intolerance is a bane to harmony.</p>
      <p>ShadowKnights are foul to me (the concept of Harm Touch is anathema to
      everything I hold dear).</p>
      <p>Rogues are typically filthy creatures. I've met a few who are more
      scout than thief, but I always guard my bags in their presence. Besides,
      as a holy warrior, the notion of stabbing a creature in the back appalls
      me.</p>
      <p>Rangers fall somewhere between Warriors and Druids. Wood Elf Rangers
      tend to be severely arrogant.</p>
      <p>Monks I like, a lot. They are fierce fighters and have impressive self
      discipline. Their unwillingness to use weaponry seems silly to me, but I
      wear a bear on my head, so who am I to judge.</p>
      <p><font color="#333366" size="3"><b><br>
      Overall Goals and Attitudes</b></font><br>
      The goal of a Shaman is to protect his children and to become a Man Of
      Knowledge. How you interpret that is your call. As I said earlier, I count
      all races my children (though Barbarians are the favored child). Beyond
      that, I seek to explore Norrath as much as I am capable. SoW makes that
      dream more of a reality, and Bind Affinity will solidify my ability to
      wander freely. I may join or start a guild related to helping travelers
      through dangerous lands. At level 25, I intend to dive full bore into
      Alchemy.</p>
      <p>Often, our spells will be greatly desired in a rough area. SoW and Bind
      Affinity are always requested, and water is a dire commodity in the Desert
      of Ro. I will never flat ask for compensation for such gifts, but I will
      accept donations. As a Barbarian, I don't expect a free ride from anyone,
      and any attempt to repay the favor, however small, raises you in my
      esteem. People who demand SoW and other gifts earn my scorn. I am a
      protector, not a servant. Show respect and you shall get respect in
      return. Begging merely demeans you, and newbie characters that blindly ask
      for handouts get flatly ignored. Twinks seriously annoy me, both as a
      player and as a Barbarian. Handouts are for the weak. Earn your keep.</p>
