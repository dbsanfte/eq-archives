<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2003, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have written up a new CoL for Fanatica.  It is only about a third of the length of the old one (in DG2) and should help to clarify constitutional problems that have arisen.  It also incorporates much of the DG2 Code of Standards.  Please post suggestions and general discussion on it.  Discussion will be open for at least 48-72 hours, and it will be subjected to Judicial Review.<br />
<br />
@Peri - I decided not to use a sponsor...the CoL is too large for a PM and it would be obvious who proposed it in the first place.<br />
<br />
Here is the proposal: <br />
A. Departmental Deputies<br />
	1. Each Executive department and each governor will have a <br />
deputy.  This deputy will take over temporarily for a leader during <br />
a leave of absence and will gain control of the office if the leader<br />
permanently vacates the office.<br />
		a. The deputy of the President is the Vice President.<br />
	2. The deputy for a position will be the candidate that placed<br />
second in the most recent elections for that position.  In the event <br />
that there is no second place candidate, the Department Leader may <br />
call a special election for that position.<br />
	3. If a deputy is absent, the candidate who placed third in <br />
the most recent elections will temporarily take over as deputy and may<br />
become the new permanent deputy if a deputy permanently vacates the <br />
office.<br />
	4. All department leaders and governors reserve the right to <br />
create unofficial offices (such as Mayors, History officers, Chat <br />
Representatives, etc) and appoint citizens to these offices.<br />
B. Judicial Matters<br />
	1. Judicial Review<br />
		a. Any citizen may call judicial review <br />
whenever a question of rule interpretation arises.<br />
		b. The Judge Advocate may also call review to dismiss<br />
Public Investigation charges.<br />
		c. Judicial Review is binding if 2 of 3 Judiciary members<br />
agree with the review, except in dismissal of Public Investigations, <br />
which require unanimous consent among the Judiciary.<br />
	2. Public Investigations<br />
		a. A Public Investigation may be requested by post in<br />
the Judicial thread and/or a PM to the Judge Advocate. An accuser may<br />
wish to remain anonymous, and the JA must honor this if the accuser <br />
indicates this in the accusation PM.<br />
		b. The accuser must post which amendments or laws were<br />
broken by this person.<br />
		c. The Judge Advocate must notify the Public Defender <br />
of the charges so that a defense can be formulated.<br />
		d. If the Judge Advocate does not believe that the <br />
charge has merit, he/she may move to dismiss the charges.  If the<br />
 charges are found, either by the JA or by review, to have merit, <br />
the Judge Advocate must start a PI discussion thread.<br />
		e. The discussion thread must be open for at least 48<br />
hours.  The Public Defender and the defendant have 24 hours to make the<br />
first two replies, which are reserved for them. If they fail to do so,<br />
anybody may post.  The defendant also has the chance to plead guilty,<br />
which will cause the trial poll phase of the PI to be skipped.<br />
		f. If the defendant did not plead guilty, the JA must<br />
post a trial poll after closing the discussion thread. This poll must<br />
be open for 48 hours and must have the options of Guilty, Innocent, and<br />
Abstain. If the defendant if found guilty, the JA posts a sentencing poll.<br />
		g. The sentencing poll will be up for 48 hours and will be <br />
		in multiple choice format. It will <br />
		contain the following options:<br />
			1. Eviction from the Demo game<br />
				a. For previous offenders only <br />
			2. Suspension from the Demo game <br />
			3. Impeachment <br />
				a. For officials only. <br />
			4. Final warning <br />
				a. For previous offenders only. <br />
			5. Warning <br />
			6. Abstain <br />
			7. If the offender has previously received a <br />
			Final Warning, the options of Warning and Final <br />
			Warning will not be offered on the sentencing poll. <br />
			8. If the offender has never received a Warning, <br />
			the option of Final Warning will not be offered <br />
			on the sentencing poll<br />
 			9. A Moderator will set the length of time for<br />
			suspensions after conferring with the JA.  Moderators<br />
			will also be responsible for enforcing evictions<br />
			and suspensions.<br />
C. Absenteeism <br />
	1. An official is considered absent if they have had no forum <br />
activity for 72 hours, if they have not responded to a required inquiry<br />
in 36 hours, or if they have posted absence in the official absence<br />
thread.<br />
	2. The President may expel an official from office if<br />
he/she has not responded to a required inquiry in 7 days, or if he/she<br />
has recorded no forum activity for 14 days for any reason.<br />
	3. An official is absent from a turnchat if they are not present in<br />
the demogame chat room while a turnchat is occurring<br />
D. Chain of Command<br />
	1. The chain of command will determine who is the designated player<br />
at a turnchat if the President is not available to play the game. It will<br />
also determine naming rights for cities.  In positions where the there are<br />
more than one person eligible to name a city or be designated player at a<br />
turnchat, the issue will be resolved by seniority as a citizen (who signed<br />
the citizen registry first).<br />
		a. No citizen will be eligible to name a second city until<br />
all citizens who wish to name a city have done so.<br />
	2. CoC<br />
		A. President <br />
		B. Vice President <br />
		C. Domestic Leader <br />
		D. Military Leader <br />
		E. Foreign Leader <br />
		F. Science Leader <br />
		G. Culture Leader<br />
		H. Trade Leader<br />
		I. Chief Justice <br />
		J. Judge Advocate<br />
		K. Public Defender <br />
		L. Governors<br />
		M. Domestic Deputy <br />
		N. Military Deputy <br />
		O. Foreign Deputy <br />
		P. Science Deputy <br />
		Q. Culture Deputy <br />
		R. Trade Deputy <br />
		S. Governor Deputies<br />
		T. Previously Elected Officials (in order of the CoC, <br />
		for city naming rights only)<br />
		U. Remaining Citizenry<br />
E. Code of Laws Amendments<br />
	1. Amendments to the Code of Laws must receive the vote of a <br />
plurality of the citizenry that choose to vote and the vote of a majority<br />
of the full Senate before they take effect.  <br />
	2. A Code of Laws amendment may also pass by receiving supermajority <br />
(two-thirds of all votes, excluding abstentions) support by the citizenry.  <br />
If this happens, the Senate poll is skipped and the amendment goes into <br />
effect immediately.<br />
	3. A CoL amendment citizen poll must be open for at least 48 <br />
hours for the amendment to take effect.<br />
	4. This Code of Laws will be in effect when it is approved by the<br />
same method prescribed for an amendment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I support section A though I've only looked at it quickly and may have minor suggestions down the road.<br />
<br />
I do not support section B.  The public investigation section needs much work in my opinion.  It does not even mention the CJ's role!<br />
<br />
I am definately against section C.  The president should not have the power to remove elected officials from office.  I also think the section is not needed.  If a leader is derelict in his duty then let the citizens impeach him to remove him from office.  As for absecnes, we have deputies in place and methods for dealing with times when both the leader and deputy disappears.<br />
<br />
Section D seems ok, as does section E.<br />
<br />
If I had to vote on accepting this whole package, I would vote no.  I think we would be better off building the CoL a little at a time.  I suggest starting with section E then section A while we debate and refine the otrher sections.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe. I knew as soon as I ran for a cabinet position someone would crank up the PI machine in our new &quot;less laws&quot; game. :) <br />
<br />
I agree that we should should be doing the CoL a little at a time. This way each section would be receiving the attention that it needs. No reason to rush through everything at once. There were parts throughout that large document that I though needed refining also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@donsig - About Section B, I was trying to make sure that it didn't already cover things addressed by the constitution, to avoid unnecessary legislation.  The constitution already says that the CJ is responsible for the mechanics of a trial.  If you would like to suggest something to clarify the CJ's role, I invite you to do so while it is still in the discussion phase.<br />
<br />
Regarding Section C, I will strike subsection C.2, relating to absence expulsion, from my proposal if that's okay with everybody else.<br />
<br />
@Cyc and donsig, regarding slow additions to the CoL- We tried doing this a month or two ago under Shaitan, and nothing was approved.  I think it is best done all at once, with a framework such as this, and suggestions can be taken while it is being discussed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still disagree bootstoots. We can't be throwing up a document such a CoL and then be slashing sections out of it left and right because you want to get it implemented in a hurry. This is not a game breaking issue. We should do as the President has suggested and work on it a piece at a time. The original intent of the existing Constitution was to limit the amount of laws in the game and only bring forth new legislation when a particular law was needed to iron out a deep wrinkle in the game. <br />
<br />
We have not had an absentee problem yet (with the exception of curu's), we've only had 1 PI attempt (by CT) that was immediately dismissed (which was probably a last ditch effort to raise some hell before she quit), and the COC has gone fine for two Terms with minor discussion.<br />
<br />
Deputies has been our major problem area. Let's shelve this proposal and work on the exact wording of the Deputy Section. Once we get that squared away and voted on, we can move on the the next Section that requires a CoL amendment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'll cave to that.  Let's set up section E for immediate ratification and work on the wording of section A.  Once section A is passed, we will start working on B, C, and D.  We can use the first post as a framework, and tweak it to our liking.  Sound good?<br />
<br />
BTW, Cyc, why do you seem to dislike Chieftess, and it seems, by association, her supporters (of which I have been labeled a part)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer your question about CT, boots, my relationship with CT goes back some 15 months, so you being a relative newbie would have to do a lot of reading to understand the bulk of it.<br />
<br />
In regards to Section E., that's one of the Sections I didn't agree with. You have put in words that say, and I quote:<br />
<br />
1. Amendments to the Code of Laws must receive the vote of a <br />
plurality of the citizenry that choose to vote and the vote of a majority of the full Senate before they take effect. <br />
________________________________________<br />
<br />
Basically, what this says is that if three people vote and two of them vote to approve the amendment, then it is passed on to the Senate for the rubber stamp there. I don't like this and feel there should be some kind of quorum.<br />
<br />
Also: <br />
2. A Code of Laws amendment may also pass by receiving supermajority (two-thirds of all votes, excluding abstentions) support by the citizenry.  If this happens, the Senate poll is skipped and the amendment goes into effect immediately.<br />
___________________________________<br />
<br />
Excluding abstentions is not recognizing a super-majority. A Super-majority is 2/3's of the people who vote. I feel this wording should be changed.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
4. This Code of Laws will be in effect when it is approved by the<br />
same method prescribed for an amendment.<br />
_______________________________________<br />
<br />
This should not be part of our CoL. It is just a statement that would accompany the proposal. It should not be a law.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I will make corrections:<br />
1. A quorum can be added that would be 1/3 of the highest vote total in the most recent full elections<br />
2. This can be changed to superplurality.<br />
4. I can take this out of Article E.  <br />
<br />
Does this satisfy you?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Clarified point 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So now we are back to the point of deciding what a good quorum is.  How do you define 'active citizenry' bootstoots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@donsig - Just did, in a post edit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, to use our most recent elections for your verbage for #1, we would need 8 people to vote yes. Total votes for the Presidential election was 42. Multiply that by .333 and you get 13.99 (or 14). So 14 votes would be quorum and 8 affirmative votes would pass the amendment to the Senate. Is this correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cyc, yes, that is correct, assuming nobody abstained.  Abstentions may lower the number of yes votes necessary slightly.  If this looks ok with you, I will codify the changes to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, boots - put some verbage in there stating that the .5 mark determines whether to round up or down, code it up, and let's see what anyone else thinks, including donsig. If there are no problems, it can be your proposed poll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the altered proposal: <br />
 E. Code of Laws Amendments<br />
	1. Amendments to the Code of Laws must receive the vote of a <br />
plurality of the citizenry that choose to vote and the vote of a majority<br />
of the full Senate before they take effect.  The quorum for a citizen poll is<br />
1/3 of the citizens who voted in the most active poll in the most recent full elections.<br />
		a. If the number of votes divided by 3 is a decimal, it is <br />
rounded up if the decimal is above .5 and down if it is .5 or smaller.<br />
	2. A Code of Laws amendment may also pass by receiving superplurality <br />
(double the votes for Yes than in any other option) support by the citizenry.  <br />
If this happens, the Senate poll is skipped and the amendment goes into <br />
effect immediately.<br />
	3. A CoL amendment citizen poll must be open for at least 48 <br />
hours for the amendment to take effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By rounding, I meant in case the number for the quorum didn't come out to be a whole number. Such as 13.56 or something like that. Then .5 and above would round up .4 and below would round down. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, that has been edited and the old E.1.a dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just only skimmed through to proposal, and it looks good.<br />
For the CoC, I would add something that would use the CoC for settling disputes amongst leaders (IE, if FA said one thing, and Trade said another,  FA would get precedence for being higher up).<br />
For PIs, there was a proposal I made in DG2 that was well liked, but never passed since it only came up near the end of the game.  See it here. (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=49470)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2003, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're only working on Section E. at the moment, Octavian. So I guess that Section looks good to you? I still like to get some more input from the citizens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gingerbread Man</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we scoured this pretty well. All the glaring holes and issues have been fixed. I know there is a bit of complaint about the poll that has just appeared, but I really dont think there is anything major to fix.<br />
<br />
As it stands, we have gone through a couple of drafts, dropped sections, added sections, rewritten/reworded sections, and I think that there isn't any more to discuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2003, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Input on section E?  The darn thing is already being polled...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am polling sections B and E.  The other sections may be added at a later date.  There was plenty of discussion, primarily between Cyc and me, on section E.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2003, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by donsig <br />
Input on section E?  The darn thing is already being polled... <br />
<br />
What? This this has been dead in the water for 6 days. I gave it my best shot to get people involved, but no one cares. If you people are happy letting boots put up what laws he wants for you to follow, then I guess I am too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eklektikos</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had assumed that the good parts of this proposal would be cannibalised for use in the ongoing discussions regarding the restructuring and expansion of our laws, rather than polled on in their midst. Very odd decision in my opinion, and not one in which I see much logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zorven</div><div class="date">Jul 18, 2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you need to define Amendment as any new, change, or deletion of a code. I think that will clear up some questions raised in other threads as to whether the senate needs to vote.</div></div><hr />
