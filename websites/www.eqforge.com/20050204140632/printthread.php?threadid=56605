		<div>I was playing with Japan on a random, huge map.  My closest neighbor was the Zulus, and as luck would have it we were the two most powerful nations in the world. After fighting them for about 3 centuries, and gaining the upper hand with my samurai armies we achieved peace (they had roughly 1/3rd of there cities left).  So I was the new superpower and was able to peacefully build until the 1950’s.  <br />
<br />
It was then, in the 50’s that I decided to attack the Russians on a tiny peninsula with two cities (Yakutsk and Grozny).  The Russians had been a diplomatic pain for many years and I was tired of it.  Plus, I wanted to finally get to use bombers, fighters, tanks, and artillery.  The limited war on the Yakutsk peninsula was easy.  The Russians were woefully lacking in technology and my allies, the Persians, even got in on the act.  It was then that this limited, simple war blew up.  The Indians (the new #2 civ) and the Egyptians declared an embargo on me.  The French joined the war effort with the Russians, and eventually they convinced the Zulu to declare war.  That worked well with me as the remaining Zulu cities were quickly mopped up.  Then the other continent got into the act and declared war against me.  The British (who were also strong) and the Iroquois decided to join the world war against the Persians and me.  <br />
<br />
Now I decided another ally might be useful so I got the Chinese to join the Japanese/Persian alliance.  Immediately the Egyptians declared war against us and began taking out Chinese cities.  The Persians quickly opted out (after some great battles defending against the Egyptians) and they immediately joined the attack on the Chinese.  By 1965 my war weariness was out of control and I had to abort my efforts against the Egyptians after gaining only two insignificant cities.  The Chinese were on their own and quickly fell to the Persian, Egyptian, Indian, Russian, French, British, and Iroquois.  I couldn’t really help them as the fighting had moved to the Eastern edge of the continent and was too far away for me to be of any use.<br />
<br />
The war concluded with the loss of two civilizations (Chinese and Zulu).  The Persians became a permanent friend of the Indians, so I lost my other ally as well.  The Egyptians started demanding more and more diplomatic “gifts” so by 1974 I had a vast army on their border and quickly captured every bit of territory they took from the Chinese (and then some).  I learned some valuable lessons.  First, a limited, quick war doesn’t always remain limited or quick.  Second, always watch the Indians (later I fought some huge wars with them).  Third, people in republics don’t hate war…they just hate long wars. It was a difficult war, but I have never had one that was quite as much fun as that one.</div>

		<div>The closest thing that I've had to a world war was the pacts that Greece, Carthage, Babylon, and Persia signed against me in my latest game. I had already conquered Persia and brought it to a single city, a pet civ, and declared war on it every once in a while for fun and money. Babylon was already half-defeated, with its productive cities destroyed. Greece had just begun war with me (see Greece, Thou Hast Done Me Great Wrong) and was quite upset with my apparent ease in taking their cities. Carthage was actually last on my list of civs to conquer, 4 behind Greece.<br />
     As I approached Athens, I saw that the Greeks and the Persians signed an embargo against me. On the same turn, the babylonians officially joined the Greeks. On the next turn, those stupid inferior Carthaginians demanded a tech and declared war on me. Then, they allied with the Greeks against me. The odd thing was, even though the Greeks and Persians had an embargo against me, the Greeks and Babylonians made one against their ally, Persia. I have no idea how they figured that one out.<br />
     Anyway, none of these civs lasted very long until I had reduced them to a single city and surrounded them. Persia was so mad that they declared war on me (they had no units anyway), and waited 10 whole turns before they would even talk to me again! That's my World War.</div>

		<div>:mad: I am America (little 25 ICBMs) and was in a war against Germany (33 ICBMs) :(  and they were on a small island and had 90 panzers and 25 modern armor. they made the mistake of grouping most of their units in one spot.  I might also add that they had the second biggest navy (10 Battleships, 20 subs, 40 AEGIS crusiers, 22 nuclear subs, 20-30 destroyers, and 40 Man-o-War [don't ask) but thats not that hard to do when hardly anyone else had a navy.  13 civs against it including me and 3 nations against us.  I nuked their army wiping it out almost completly, but I broke from normal rutuine and hadn't posted troop carriers off their coast (1 with Marines, 10 with Modern armor) that off course turned out to be a mistake because I thought I had the SDI defense, the next turn 20 cities were nuked destroying most of my army and navy (-30 destroyers out of 47 and 3 carriers out of 30, losing about 12 bombers and 20 fighters no joke thats really what I lost for navy army is a ?):mad: :mad: :mad:  I of course made peace with them because they had 25 tact nukes and I didn't want to find those bobing the few citys I had near by(on another conten.) and to re build my army and navy and air force. luckly they left my trans port ships alone and I have sent them to Germany.  War currently on going.  Of course France also launched nukes at Germany so their weak.</div>

		<div>WARNING -This Is Long. Nearly 6000 characters- WARNING<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, So I started out on the Dominatrix Map. (I like the isolation):rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I was America on the lower left continent. Clockwise on the other continents staring with the one north of me were the Arabs, then Ottomans, Babylons, Iroquois, Aztecs, Persians, and Zulus.<br />
<br />
Thanks to some AMAZING luck at the beginning of the game mine soon became the largest empire. (Most of the goody huts gave me settlers)<br />
<br />
My empire controlled my entire continent and the left half of the center jungle contintent. I also had one city on the Arab continent and three cities on the Zulu's. The other civies filled their continents and the right half of the jungle continent was a jumble of Ottoman, Zulu, and Persian cities.<br />
<br />
During the game I would only enter Mutual Protection with the Zulu (I dislike tangled webs of alliances, and they asked first. Paid me quite well too!!)<br />
<br />
By the time I reached the modern era my empire was well developed and, well, out of room. So I turned my eyes toward my northern neighbors, the Arabs who were presently mid-Industrial. I quickly built up a force of 8 modern armor (small army, I know but it was SUPPOSED to be a small, quick invasion, not a long, drawn-out conquest)<br />
<br />
I sent this tiny army to the doorstep (how cliché) of the Arab city nearest to my empire. This, of course, did not sit well with them, and they cautiously asked me to move them (they had a larger army, but were the dumbest civy there after the Persians, who were still *snicker* medieval)<br />
<br />
So I say, ok, I'll move them (big, whopping lie) and then demand all their gold, the city I was near, and a world map (on principle) They say no, so I say forget get it.<br />
<br />
The next turn I attack.  Their rifle men were no match for my modern armor, and the city fell with the first unit (which produced my first leader for my first army) I then contact the Ottomans (the Arabs other neighbors) and pay them to join a military alliance.<br />
The Zulus join in by virtue of our Mutual Protection.<br />
<br />
So it me (America), the Ottomans, and the Zulu vs the Arabs.  Then the Babylonians sign a military alliance against me with Arabia (oops) I wasn't too worried because the Babylonians had to travel through Ottoman territory to get to me, so my rear was covered.  Just to be safe though I got Persia to join in on our side, and the Aztecs were forced in because of the Mutual Protection with Persia.<br />
<br />
So after a few turns I had decimated half of Arabia when (CRAP) :eek: the Iroquois signed a military alliance with Babylon against me.  The Iroquois had just entered the modern era and had the largest army. I could not afford to keep up my war with Arabia and fight the Iroquois at the same time.  So I made peace with the Arabs. I got all their gold, three of their cities and their world map (on principle)<br />
<br />
I then shifted my armies (I had 4 now, all filled with modern armor) to the Iroquois Front (the only time I was glad for the absurdity of the railroads free-movement cost) The previous turn a massive Iroquois army had entered and captured a Zulu city on the jungle continent, and could now threaten Zulu, Ottoman, Persian, and more importantly MY cities. So I sent my first army to &quot;liberate&quot; the captured Zulu city (which had few defenders) and the other three armies to destroy as many Iroquois units on the jungle continent as I could. The next turn the Aztecs and the stupid, stupid Persians managed to beat back the Iroquois AND capture two of their cities.<br />
<br />
Thats when everything got out of control. The Ottomans (who had backed out of the war as early as they could) signed a Military Alliance with the Iroquois. So now it was me, the Zulu, the Aztec, and the Persians against the Ottomans, the Babylonians, and the Iroquois. The Arabs were sitting quietly licking their wounds.<br />
<br />
I had my new Invasion force of 6 armies (all modern armor) ready to begin an campaign into the Ottoman continent on my next turn. The Babylonians and Iroquois were both boxed in by the Aztecs who had emerged as a superpower during this long war.<br />
<br />
Then the annoying happened. The Zulu (who still had one city on the jungle continent) bombed Ottomans (who had at some point signed a Mutual Protection with Arabia) So now I am forced to resume my war with Arabia.<br />
<br />
    -side note- even though I still call it the jungle continent, workers had long ago removed all jungles :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
It was then I realized the gargantuan mistake I had made.  I had forgot to put any units in the three cities the Arabs had relinquished to me. I had only one chance.  My armies had to shift and kill the king unit (yes, regicide was on, don't ask stupid questions) for Arabia.<br />
<br />
At this point I noticed that Zulu units were withdrawing. A quick check of the diplomacy screen confirmed it. After dragging me into war with Arabia, Zululand had made peace with everyone and canceled our Mutual Protection. They stabbed me in the back and left me in a lurch.<br />
<br />
My &quot;loyal&quot; puppets :aargh: <br />
<br />
Despite this heinous treachery, I was able to kill Abu (the Arab king unit) and eliminate the Arabs before I lost my three foolishly unprotected cities.<br />
<br />
Now since the start of this war so long ago I had constantly been building modern armor and had quite an impressive occupation army. I was able to force a peace from the Ottomans, Babylonians, and the Iroquois.<br />
<br />
And thus ended my involvement in the war. My part had lasted nearly 300 turns, and the war itself would not end until the destruction of the Iroquois by the Ottomans, Persians, Babylonians, and Zulu 50 turns later (Hiawatha was killed by the evil Zulu)<br />
<br />
When the dust finally settled I had contol over all of my continent, the jungle continent (the final Zulu city converted) and the Arab continent. I also owned the right half of the Iroquios continent, and had gained control of a third of the Zulu continent thru multiple cutural conversions.<br />
<br />
Now about those treacherous Zulu... :evil:</div>

		<div>I once had a world war that lsated about 300 years. It all started with the damn Russians sneak attacking me. I quickly got my neighbors and friends, France and the Celts, (I was Greece) into alliances. <br />
<br />
We were stomping the Reds with no problem, but teh French and Celts both brought in more allies with Military Alliance and MPP's. Anyway, the Russkies were toast, but before their last city was finished, some dumbass declared war on France, bringing in some of my allies against my other allies, as i struggled to remain neutral.<br />
<br />
Anyway, pretty soon Civs on the other end of the world started declaring war on France, then Germany declared War on Rome. And England declared war on Carthage, and China and Spain declared war on everyone. And the Celts (Who were my friends) declared war on me. And the thing is, just DIDN'T stop.<br />
<br />
Some Civs would make peace, but would IMMEDIATELY declare war on some other Civ. It was madness! &quot;Germany and Rome have made peace.&quot; &quot;The Romans declared war on the Carthaginians!&quot; &quot;The English declared war on the Romans!&quot; &quot;Spain declared war on the Carthaginians!&quot; &quot;Germany declared war on France!&quot;<br />
<br />
 I eventuall got out of all my agreements i had signed, and let the battles rage all around me. Like, 4 Civs were wiped out in the course of the whole thing, and eventually i built the U.N. and my only other candidate was Spain, who had attacked just about everyone, and i won in a landslide :D</div>

		<div>once i had the craziest thing happen..... It was industrios and i just got the scientific theory thingy and built the hoover dam. Note: i am the Carthaginians<br />
Well, I found a small unsettled island and started ploppin cities wherever they fit. In the middle of my colonizatoin, the stupid Greeks had to try and horn in on my island. I got a world map from them, decided they were utterly pathetic and declared war. I swiftly landed a large force of cannons and infantry, crushed his colony on my island and mounted a march on his home continent. Note: his continent had 4 HUGE puninsulas that was joined by 1 mountain tile wich he had bult a fortress on and fortified around 20 riflemen on that 1 tile(i didnt know that at the time). I pounded all the cities on 1 puninsula 2 dust. He struck back. THEN the EVIL government of Greece brought 4 civs that i didnt know existed against me! In response i recruited the 4 other civs(i forgot what they were) against them. All hell broke loose. My alliance landed MASSIVE armys in every place imaginable. I researched tanks and started pounding the greeks with all their great firepower while i went into a frenzed push for nukes. the rest of the civs in the Greek alliance decided i was a reincarnation of the devil and made sure i knew it. While i researched he last tech in the industries age my All Conquering Tanks were pushed back 2 my origianall continent. i started 2 pump out cruise missiles as soon as i could and started gettin 10 every 3 turns. By the time the G(r)eek Alliance got 2 my shores i had about 20 missiles waiting. The transports were cut 2 peices by my rr empowerd cruise missiles before they even got close.i slowly built up a force of nukes (complimented by cruise missiles) until i had 33.<br />

		<div>This is from the game I'm currently playing and I'm still in a war with Russia, well this is how it happened.<br />
<br />
I'm playing large map, islands, highest percent of water. I was second to only France, but they were a close ally, but close to the end point I decieded I had to win. So I decided more cities! I scouted the map and found the Germany had 2 cities, and were very low in the tech tree. I signed a few mutual protectin pacts, just in case and went in.<br />
<br />
Note: I have double you pleasure, and was using their mobile infantry units.<br />
<br />
Right before I initiate my 1 turn war on Germany, they pact with the Russians, I go through with it anyway. So I take out Germany then Russia attacks with a ship. It is now<br />
<br />
Japan, America(me), France, Persia vs. Russia. <br />
<br />
I move in to the closet Island, take out all three cities in one swipe, move to the next, take it, then the next. One turn before 2050, I get the UN building and barely beat out France.<br />
<br />
Then I began my movement to Russia's mainland. There I lose 4 mobile infantry (strongest unit next to last tank) to a lesser unit.<br />
<br />
So I decide to bypass the mainland, and take out the smaller islands, and let the alliance take out the mainland. It is a GREAT war.</div>

I'm Egypt, playing 5CC at second-easiest difficulty on a small map with four other civs: Rome, Germany and Greece on my continent, and Russia alone on a huge island to the west.<br />
<br />
I'm being meek and mild, keeping everyone else &quot;gracious&quot; with gifts of gold and techs but building up a strong army and keeping a slight tech lead, until the 1600s, when Caesar -- still &quot;gracious,&quot; mind you -- waltzes up to Elephantine with about 2 dozen infantry.<br />
<br />
I signed quick MPPs with everyone else and invited Julius to remove his unwashed hordes from my terrority soonest, which brought a war declaration. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So I hit him, hard, with arty. I captured and razed (remember, 5CC) three of his cities. Meanwhile, Germany and Greece settled into trench warfare with Rome (no gains, many casualties), and Russia kept pretty much to herself.<br />
<br />
When that gets old, I get Rome to sign a peace deal and cede me three tiny cities (which I raze), but stupid Otto attacks Greece, which drags me into war with Germany. So that's where I am now, and I've got my sights set on the oil resource next to Koenigsberg.</div>

I owned the two islansds near my home contient (which I had cleansed of the American and Iroqoius filth- playing Aztecs here) and was mobilizing for a war against Babylon, who was roughly a tech or two behind me the entire game. I just got in industrial and was producing cavalry.<br />

Nobody liked me because I razed any city they put on land I claimed (my contients and the islands), and we would &quot;war&quot; for about 5 turns, where I would demand peace for a small price on their part. And I always attacked before declaring war. I'm not exactly going for UN here. Anyhoo, the Germans, who are one tech ahead of me thanks to being scentific, demand...printing press? I politely decline, and he declares war on me. A galleon deposits a Knight and a unit of Cavalry, who sweep over my knights and spearmen defending two cities on my smaller isle very quickly. I had several galleons of cavalry en route to Babylonia (Persia had a few cities in their territory, which I was using as a beachead), so I retook my island quickly. I launched an invasion of Germany, razing one city and taking another. Peace was settled, and Frankfurt flipped back. I built my forces up, determining that Germany WOULD die. I was in a MPP with France and England, and  SOMETHING happened over there- a dispute over the ownership of Marseilles. I launched an invasion and cleared the land of the Germans. I had a MASSIVE cavalry force there, so I rushed pikemen in all of my German cities, moved them via French rails to England, and obliterated them with some minor French help. After this, I negotiated ROP with the Babylonians, moved a force of cavalry to each city, declared war, and took several cities in those firt turns. After Babylonia fell, France surrendered to the Dominating Aztec powers. :D</div>

		<div>I was playing a standard size world map, the kind that comes with the game.<br />
<br />
I was America, and I started out in North America. The Aztecs were in Northern South America / Central America, and the Iroquois were in South America. The Germans were where Russia is in real life. Rome was in Western Europe, Russia was in Africa and Australia, and France was in Asia.<br />
<br />
I had been at war with the Aztecs off and on for most of the game. I had more troops than them, and eventually I gained an advantage and wiped them out. The Iroquois had been my ally early in the game but as the game went on they began to ally themselves with the Aztecs so I wiped them out too.<br />
<br />
Anyway, so then I controlled all of North and South America. For some reason the Germans just didn't like me, and we were at war for possibly 300+ years. They would bomb me every turn, which was really annoying because it slowed down the game, and occasionally try to invade but I held them back. They would never sign a peace treaty, and war weariness in my cities was out of control so I couldn't build anything. I was a Democracy and Germany was a Communism.<br />
<br />
Their country was way too large to invade, and I didn't have enough soldiers and I was unable to build more due to war weariness. Eventually the Germans gave up and decided to make peace. Then they invaded Russia and took over Africa...<br />
<br />
Also the Russians, Romans, and French didn't like me and I was fighting them for most of the game too...<br />
<br />
Anyway, eventually I won the game by winning the Space Race.</div>
