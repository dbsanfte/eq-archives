<br />
The evil Aztecs built Chalco on our side of the bay. Then Montezuma had the nerve to demand that our glorious Legions leave his territory! Donsig's reply was WAR! <br />
<br />
Two Legions were lost but Chalco was destroyed. Another escorted band of Aztec settlers was captured. It did not take long for the war to expand. Our former enemy, Cleopatra, has allied with us against the Aztecs. Soon afer this alliance was cemented America declared war on us! Both Egypt and Greece have allied with us against the Americans. We lost two warriors in Greece. they fell at the hands of American swordsmen but not before killing off one of the enemy swordsmen first! We have destroyed an Aztec jaguar warrior while Egyptian forces have captured two escorted Aztec settlers.<br />
<br />
Our nation has grown with the addition of four new cities. Both of the proposed canal towns in Esquiline province have been founded. Another city was planted southeast of Regia Doughnutia and a fouth sprang up south of Memphis. We also have three more settlers ready for form cities!<br />
<br />
We have mastered the currency technology and have advanced into the middle ages! However, the wars have proved unpopular leading to the downfall of our government: we are in ANARCHY!<br />

There will be no instructions from Aventine until the matter of our imminent mutiny is cleared up, or until the citizenry votes for me to post instructions. <br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: The citizens have spoken!<br />
<br />
Aventine Build Queues:<br />
<br />
Aureus: Temple, Worker, Library<br />
Inadatto: Library, Settler, Harbor<br />
Regia Doughnutia: Temple, Granary, Settler<br />
Lake Asphinxia: Temple, Library, Barracks<br />
Elephantine: Temple, Library, Barracks<br />
Memphis: Temple, Library, Granary<br />
Desert Bay:  Spearman, Temple, Library<br />
Bootia:  Spearman, Temple, Library<br />
<br />
<br />
Aventine Improvements:<br />
<br />
1)  Finish current tasks.<br />
2)  Irrigate NE of LA (Lake Asphinxia), and also SW of Desert Bay.<br />
3)  Irrigate and mine around Memphis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Settlement:<br />
<br />
Two good potential sites in Aventine.  One is the forest to the north of the horses on the bay, and the other is the hill to the north of the dyes, or possibly the grassland to the west of the iron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curufinwe</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have joined the moratorium on turnchats. There will be no instructions from the department of Culture until the matter of the current crisis is resolved. I will, if a vote is held and shown that the citizenry wants otherwise, discontinue this. I'm a servant first and foremost. But currently the citizens need to speak on something, and that is why I choose this option right now.<br />
<br />
Further Edit:As a large number of the people have spoken, 12 at this time, I shall return to action. Should at a later time it swing in another direction, I shall follow suit. I'm merely following the Constitution, which says elected officials must follow the peoples will. As an elected official, I do therefore.</div></div><hr />

The four possibilities are shown in This post (post 5) (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=1083000#post1083000).<br />
<br />
When you tell me what you would like, I will post my instructions here (I will edit this post, as I know you DPs dont like spamming this place)<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Instructions for Capitalone Province<br />
Gorina: Colusseum, Palace Prebuild.<br />

<br />
Assorted suggestions<br />
In every set of instructions I post, [military] can be replaced by any military unit.<br />
May I suggest for our eastern cities that we have a tight build strategy. No city is to be more than four squares from another, preferably only three. I will tell the domestic department this also.<br />
<br />
Worker instructions:<br />
I know you don't want these for laborer instructions, tell me if a graphic would be easier on you, and the file server.<br />

<br />
There's not much.  When the anarchy ends next turn, and Inglomedor completes it's harbor, contact China.  They are the only nation that I can tell has harbors.  they have a good number of furs - discuss trading options in the turn chat.<br />
<br />
Also, the Trade Minister must regrettably to condemn those leaders who wish to 'boycott' this turn chat.  They are not helping the situation at the moment, only hurting it.  If the game is to procede normally, all leaders must continue to do the job that the people mandated them to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarn</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">-I will not authorize any declarations of war or any breaking of treaties, during this chat. Any alliances or broken treaties that the president wants, he must post a poll in the poll forum for at least 24 hours. If the citizen's agree, then and only then would I (or boots) authorize it.<br />
<br />
-I will not authorize any ROP's under the same conditions.<br />
<br />
So put it in the polls and let the people decide.:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">Jul 04, 2003, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must request delay of this turn until suitable discussion and polling has been performed to account for the new situation.<br />
<br />
If the DP insists on continuing in the absence of further citizen nput, according to this poll (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=57048) select Monarchy when our period of anarchy is over.<br />
<br />
After the new government is formed, please assess entertainer use vs. lux slider setting required to avoid disorder and report on the values needed.  STOP play at that point to allow a suitable discussion and polling period for budget matters, and to allow a short-term strategy to be determined.</div></div><hr />

I will try to post my turnchat instructions and will hopefully be able to join (if I can get another monitor) but if I'm not attending this is why  <br />

I will ask Civanator to fill in for me in case I'm not present or able to post buildqueues.<br />
<br />
Do you like this setup? (I will also edit this later for my instructions)<br />

This also goes to efforts to stop the t/c for issues that do not need extensive consideration.<br />
<br />
As posted in the Science thread, Mr. President, we are still technologically advanced. No other nation has attained the knowledge of Currency, but this situation may not last for long. As Science Minister, I must insist that we do not &quot;give away&quot; our Techs to the other nations. We have a slim lead and I do not see the point of giving knowledge to other nations for a pitance.<br />
<br />
Continue on the Tech Tree path to Education, as this was the will of the people.<br />
<br />
Once Gorina has completed its Colosseum, it is the prime candidate for pre-building or building the Sistene Chapel.</div></div><hr />
