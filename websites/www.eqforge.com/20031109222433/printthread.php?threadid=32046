<p><b> Screenshot of the Day #18: Desert Fish Phenomenon</b></p>

<p>In a previous SOTD, we showed a battleship stuck in the desert because global warming turned a coastal water tile to desert. Today's screenshot is kinda similar, except the unfortunate victim is a fish! <br />
<br />
<font color="brown">I wiped out all the opponents and used about 30 nukes on the last one, so the global warming went to crazy levels. Then everywhere started to turn to deserts and etc. Then, at an insignificant moment, I spotted something weird. A resource on grasslands that I have never seen before. Fish! Oh yeah the scientists had researched future tech 20 and they should have genetically modified fish to live on land, right? :P I think the water level went down so the shore fish decided to take a walk to the beach :P The screenshot is from a later phase, and the terrain turned to desert. Wow, desert fish! <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> </font><br />

We had pond fish, and now we have a desert fish phenomenon. What's next? <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""> Thanks Vuralr for the screenshot.<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>That global warming situation has gone seriously nasty! <img src="images/smilies/cringe.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
- Two rubber resources on desert on just that little island? That means it was originally grassland, and those rubber squares have each been hit twice by GW. What does the rest of the world look like... Dune?!? <img src="images/smilies/crazyeyes.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Somehow I've never tried all-out nuclear destruction... might be fun. Maybe I'll try that on a small world map, aiming for the complete destruction of everything; every city, every tile improvement, every square mile of fertile land... <img src="images/smilies/evil.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>you can get rubber on plains. Atleast thats what i saw in my game.<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Looks like the game is modified. Did you make it so coast can turn into desert? That could hypothetically make sense.<br />
<br />
I just got an idea, actually. Impossible to modify for Civ 3, though. Have it so a tundra turns into an ocean, then a sea into an ocean, a coast into a sea, and a coastal tile into coast. Of course, this is quite inaccurate, but perfected, it could be an interesting idea for the next Civ.<br />
<br />
And, of course, if pollution gets REALLY bad, you could have the reverse effect, except any coast would become desert no matter, unless there's originally a river there.<br />
<br />

<p>It is likely that all that pollution triggered some mutation <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

Seriously, this is NOT related to pollution, that is a result of the consumer-throw-away-mentality of the modern age. Some dude in Cologne just threw his aquarium out the window.<br />
