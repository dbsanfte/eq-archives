		<!-- message -->
		<div>This is my third attempt at writing a story.  Hopefully I'll finish it this time.  It is not based on a Civ III game.  I hope that is Okay with you guys <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smilie" class="inlineimg" />  Okay, here goes:<br />
<br />
China = green<br />
Korea = dark blue<br />
Japan = pink <br />
<br />
The early history of Asia is for a large part a mystery.  What little clues we have comes from oral traditions, which are not, however, backed by hard tangible evidence.  We can only briefly describe what we think happened, with the caveat that very much is still unknown and that what we do know is based on sources that are at best suspicious in its authenticity.  <br />
<br />
Myths tell us of a dragon who would emerge from the Yellow River once every two or three years and eat the people who live along the river.  In the process, families were destroyed and many people were killed.  Various attempts had been made by the people who lived along the Yellow River to slay the dragon; but they all failed ultimately.  The people lived in fears, yet they had no choice of moving outside the Yellow River basin for beyond lied the vast unknown as well as barren land that was unsuitable to the agricultural lifestyle that these people had developed.  Several generations went by and a man by the name of Yu was born.  He, according to legend, killed the dragon and was, as a result of his accomplishment, made the king.  <br />
<br />
Archaeologists and mythologists interpreted the dragon simply as flood that constantly threatened the livelihood of the people who lived along the Yellow River.  As for Yu, it wasn’t so much that he killed the dragon as that he took effective measures that successfully controlled the flood.  Such measures included the building of dams, irrigations, and other flood controlling infrastructures.  <br />
<br />
However, to build these infrastructures was formidable tasks given the state of technology in the dawn of civilization.  In order to mobilize the labor force and resources for such a project, some kind of central authority must have already been in place.  Writing systems as well as arithmetic must have also developed during this time as part of the effort to coordinate and organize resources and labor.  In fact, historians believed that Chinese civilization was one that emerged as a response to the flood.  Put another way, it was the challenge presented by the Yellow River’s deluge that pushed the early Chinese ancestors to eventually conquer the nature, and, through it, laid the foundation of an empire.  <br />
<br />
Fast forwarding several centuries, and we see a vastly different picture along the Yellow River.  By 3500 BC, cities emerged.  Trading thrived, and the use of currency was introduced to facilitate commerce.  A government based on monarchy was clearly in place.  It is from this time and onward that we have accurate and reliable written source of information regarding what happened in this region.<br />
<br />
In the summer of 3542 BC, Emperor Yao sat at his palace contemplating over what to do with the six primitive tribes that located their homes to the West of the then Shang dynasty China.  The six primitive tribes were ferocious warriors who frequently raided the western most frontier of the Shang kingdom.  Emperor Yao’s predecessors had dealt traditionally dealt with such a threat by paying tributes to each tribe.  However, unfortunately for Emperor Yao, such option was not viable in this particular year.  News of possible bad harvest meant small tax revenues.  This would have been fine for Emperor Yao if he did not have to pay tributes to the six western tribes; but he had to.  <br />
<br />
Emperor Yao, a competent and benevolent king whose rule began when he was fifteen, inherited a kingdom that was build on a healthy foundation of political stability, much to his father’s credit.  In the thirteen years since he had taken over, Emperor Yao build on this foundation, promoted trading, and embarked on major construction projects to enhance intercity commerce.  As a result, his kingdom prospered.  Unintentionally, this prosperity only invited increasing raids from those barbarians.  <br />
<br />
Among the six barbarian tribes, the two most powerful ones were the Nujen, and Xiongnu.  They occupied a region to the west of Shang China that was most fertile to farming.  It was this that gave these two tribes the economic strength to dominate all four others, namely the Yamato, Choson, Xixia, and Chidan.  <br />
<br />
Emperor Yao sat in his palace the entire afternoon until dinner time.  And by the time that servants had brought dinner to him, he had an idea.  <br />
<br />
The next day, Emperor Yao sent for his most trusted advisor, Yong Ming, to come for a secret consultation.  Later, in the same day, Yong Ming embarked on a journey westward for Xiongnu’s territory.  Going with him were six carts of silk scrolls, ten carts of wines, fifteen carts of rice, a hundred cows and cattle, and thirty prisoners who were on death rolls.  <br />
<br />
Yong Ming arrived at Xiongnu’s territory three days later and met with the chief of the Xiongnu tribe, Yuei Dei Guang.  And the following conversation took place.  <br />
<br />
Yong:  On behalf of my emperor, I bring these presents to you, as well as a request for help.  As you know, Shang dynasty has for the last two hundred years been paying tributes annually to your majesty and the Nuden.  Yet, I fear that this will not be possible for this year, because of an impending drought that will spell bad harvest.  But more importantly, the house of Shang is in trouble.  Emperor Yao is greatly ill, and his four children are watching anxiously for his death in order to inherit the throne.  Although by tradition, the oldest son is suppose to inherit the throne, all other three have commanded the loyalty of a substantial portion of the Shang army.  Emperor Yao fears that his death will translate into civil war that would pit his four sons against each other.  It is for this reason that Emperor Yao has sent for me to see you.  <br />
<br />
Yuei:  I see.  And how may I be of an assistance?  <br />
<br />
Yong:  Emperor Yao wants his first son, Xia Jie, to inherit the throne for he is the undoubtedly the right choice. He is benevolent and intelligent.  Ever since the young age of five, he was brought to every single meeting between his father and the imperial advisors to be apprise of the events in the country.  He has studied history and is well versed in the political administration.  On numerous occasions, he was given important tasks which he executed with great competence.   It is therefore he who must be the next emperor.  <br />
But there is a problem.  He has no command of any army like his three other younger brothers.  This is because Xia Jie was so involved in aiding his father with the administration of the country that he had little time to devote to forming his own factions.  This would put him in a very dangerous situation once Emperor Yao dies.  It is therefore our humble wish that you intervene in this matter by sending your army to Shang and declare support for Xia Jie once Emperor Yao dies.  Everyone under the heaven knows that Xiongnu’s army is the most powerful.  Your army’s presence in Shang alone will be a sufficient deterrent which would prevent Xia Jei’s three brothers from act of treachery.  <br />
<br />
Yuei:  I am honored to be held in such high esteem.  Let me confer with my advisors and I shall give you a reply tomorrow.  <br />
<br />
That night, Yuei Dei Guang met with his two brothers, Yuei Dei Liang, and Yuei Dei Chong to discuss the matter brought up by Yong Ming.  <br />
<br />
Liang:  I have asked the slaves that Yong had brought along with him.  They have all confirmed that Emperor Yao is indeed dying.  This is a god send opportunity for us to conquer Shang.  In the past, when our armies invaded Shang, we were only successful at raiding, but were never able to conquer the kingdom because of its strong fortification and army.  Now, we are given an opportunity to march our army into Shang without any resistance, we must agree to Yong’s request.  Once our army is inside the Shang territory, we will easily be able to conquer the kingdom.  <br />
<br />
Chong:  Something is telling me that this is a trick.  Emperor Yao is not a stupid man.  He knew better than to let our army go inside of his kingdom.  <br />
<br />
Guang:  I agree with Chong.  Yet, I also have to admit that this is a rare opportunity.  I do not wish to let it go so easily.  This is my plan.  One of you will go back to Shang tomorrow with Yong.  You will bring the army that you command with you.  There in Shang, you will examine and verify the authenticity of all that was said by Yong today.  Your being inside Shang with your army can also be an advantage to us when we initiate our invasion of Shang.  In another word, you will collect information about Shang’s military and help clear the way for our invasion.  Which one of you is willing to go?<br />
<br />
Chong volunteered, and all was settled.  The next day, Guang went back to Shang with Yong Ming according to the plan.  When Emperor Yao met Chong, he rejoiced at Xiongnu’s willingness to help and offered to pay tributes to Xiongnu has Shang had always done for the past two hundred years regardless of the drought.  This was done with the understanding that once the tributes were paid to Xiongnu, nothing would be left to pay to Nujen.  Chong was much pleased by this.  He was also convinced that Emperor Yao was dying soon, judging by the feebleness that was so clearly evident in Emperor Yao’s voice, posture, and actions.  Yet, little did Chong and his two brothers back in Xiongnu territory know that all this was a trap.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Nujen, Chief Bai Mu Da was clearly upset.  He was upset because he had just received news that Shang will not be bringing tributes to him this year.  Moreover, Shang chose to instead bring tributes to only Xiongnu.  But what angered him the most was the fact that Emperor Yao of Shang asked Xiongnu, but not Nujen, for help in what was going to be a political upheaval in the Shang kingdom.  All these seriously threatened Nujen’s status as the dominant tribe among the six.  In addition, Chief Bai knew that Xiongnu would use this opportunity to gain control of Shang, effectively making Xiongnu even more powerful than Nujen.  This would tip the balance of power in Xiongnu’s favor, and eventually destroy Nujen’s future.  The thought of this possibility scared Chief Bai, and he decided to act fast. <br />
<br />
In the late summer of 3542 BC, things seemed to be settled.  Emperor Yao had completely handed over the task of national administration to his first son Xia Jie, although Emperor Yao was still the official ruler in name.  While, Xiongnu was making preparation for invasion of Shang as soon as Emperor Yao dies. <br />
<br />
In mid September, when fall approached, news reached to Xiongnu that Emperor Yao had passed away, and that Shang is on the verge of political turmoil as Xia Jie’s three brothers fought for control of the throne.  Upon hearing this, Yuei Dei Guang readied his army, and marched for Shang, leaving Yuei Dei Liang to guard the Xiongu territory.  <br />
<br />
Half way to Shang, however, Yuei Dei Guang’s army was ambushed the Nujen’s army.  Chief Bai of Nujen had been keeping up with development in Shang, and knew of the invasion that Yuei was undertaking.  In order to prevent Yuei from successfully conquering Shang, Chief Bai launched his own surprise invasion on Xiongnu.  The army Chief Bai led attacked Yuei Dei Guang’s army, while Chief Bai’s brother attacked Xiongnu territory directly herself.  <br />
<br />
Although Xiongnu and Nujen were equal in military strength, Xiongnu’s army was divided into three.  One third of it was already in Shang.  The other third was back in Xiongnu territory.  The remaining third was the one led by Yuei Dei Guang himself.  In contrast, Nujen’s army was split into only two, one attacking Yuei Dei Guang, while the other attacked Xiongnu homeland.  This gave Nujen a numerical advantage, which was amplified because Nujen ambushed Yuei’s army.  Nujen quickly destroyed Yuei Dei Guang’s and Yuei Dei Liang’s army, leaving Yuei Dei Chong’s army back in Shang completely helpless to do anything.  <br />
<br />
When news of Nujen’s successful invasion of Xiongnu reached Shang, Chong asked that Shang help Xiongnu.  In particular, Chong threatened Xia Jie to withdraw his army from Shang altogether leaving Xia Jie to perish in the struggle against his brother for Shang’s throne.  However, Chong soon realized that he had felt completely into a trap when Emperor Yao, who was supposed to have passed away, emerged and sat down on the imperial throne.  The struggle among Emperor Yao’s four sons was all along just a lie as well as his own death.  This meant that the four sons’ army would not disunite to fight each other, but would instead band together to destroy Chong’s army, which did happen.  <br />
<br />
At the same time, Nujen’s successful conquest of Xiongnu did not go without loss.  Xiongnu was defeated, but they put up a brave fight, causing Nujen substantial losses.  Nujen tried to compensate for this loss by ordering the four other smaller tribes, the Choson, Yamato, Xixia, and Chidan, to pay tributes.  This aroused much discontent among the four smaller tribes.  Emperor Yao, loosing no time, formed secret alliance with the four smaller tribes.  In October of 3542 BC, a combined army of Choson, Yamato, Xixia, Chidan, and Shang marched into Nujen, who was still recovering from the war with Xiongnu.  Too weak to fight, Nujen quickly felt.  <br />
<br />
The former Xiongnu and Nujen territories were partitioned among the four tribes.  However, the four tribes quickly became discontent with the partitioning, and fought amongst themselves.  Emperor Yao of Shang took advantage of this and grabbed some more territories.  Meanwhile during the struggle among the four tribes, Xixia, and Chidan followed the fate of Xiongnu and Nujen, leaving Yamato and Choson to inherit the vast tract of land west of Shang kingdom.<br />
<br />
By 3541 BC, a new political order of Far East Asia had emerged.  Shang dynasty China had successfully emerged to become the undisputed master, no longer paying tributes to any foreign powers.  Yamato and Choson would increasingly abandon their barbaric and nomadic way of life and follow the way of Shang dynasty China.  A century of peace would follow in which Yamato and Choson would increasingly borrow from China, adopting her culture, institutions and technologies.  The kingdom of Yamato would later become Japan, and Choson become Korea.  These two would later become strong and challenge the might of Shang dynasty China.  The history of East Asia from this point on will be the story of struggle between these three nations for control of continental unification.  But for now, we turn westward to another part of the world.  There, something equally exciting was happening.</div>

		<div>There is a legend among the Greeks that in a time very long ago, when words were still not invented, a king ruled his Grecian subjects with an unprecedented cruelty in a city called Thyparathus.  We no longer know of this king’s name, only that the people referred to him as the “devil’s king”, which is how we will also refer to him from now on.  <br />
<br />
Legend has it that the devil’s king’s oppressive rule became so burdensome that two major migrations out of Thyparathus led to establishment of two major colonies, one to Thyparathus’ distant north, the other to her distant south.  Geographical barriers and pure distance alone gave these two cities the good fortune of protection from the devil’s king.  <br />
<br />
But in those two new cities were emerged their own devil’s kings, whose equally oppressive rule would propel their own waves of migration that would lead to establishment of yet new cities.  And in those new cities, devil’s kings emerged again only to lead to the same process, which would repeat over and over again until Greece is what she is today; she’s a completely divided nation comprise of many small city states, each with a king.  <br />
<br />
For many generations, the subject of most of the city states have lived in oppressive rule, and their liberation must wait until when another new city was founded, to which they could migrate, with the understanding that the kind of freedom from tyranny found in that new city could only last for several decades, if they are lucky enough.  Such is the sad political history of Greece up until the founding of Athens.  <br />
<br />
Athen was founded in 3577 BC, by a name called Plygorethesis.  He was a scholar at Sparta, the then undisputed master of all Greece.  Sparta, as Plygorethesis rightly observed, built her strength on constant warfare.  Her superior military, due to life long trainings that were required of any male children whenever they turned five, led her to numerous victory, until her name alone was enough to scare the rival into voluntary submission before a fight.  So strong and persistent was Sparta’s reputation as great warriors that when Spartan military has declined in her actually quality, many still submitted to Sparta as vessels.  <br />
<br />
Inside of Sparta, the glory of Spartan’s military victory gave way to an onerously dark world where civilians lived a life that reduced them to sub-human status.  Spartan culture was based on war, and so military class dominated the top of the social ladder.  Yet, the military class abused their social status.  They imposed heavy taxations on the Spartan subjects.  Laws were passed by the Spartan government, controlled by Spartan military class, that daughters were subject to “performing her sexual duties” to any man of military whenever he wishes for it to be done.  Farmers’ livelihood was constantly threatened as Spartan military frequently held huge hunting and other sport events, many of which involved many chariots making their way across farm fields, damaging the crops, and leading to reduced harvest.  Heavy taxation made things worse as farmers had only very little to live on after they paid the taxes.  Mass starvation after the taxation season was an annual occurrence, and corpse would litter the Spartan streets.  <br />
<br />
Plygorethesis founded Athen with an ideal.  He wanted to change Greece for Greece nation has been ruled by too many devil’s kings.  Being a philosopher, he had reasoned out a form of government that he thought was the best for the people.  It was called democracy.<br />
<br />
Democracy is a political system based on giving voice and power to the people, who would together decide on resolution of issues through a voting mechanism.  Other political institutions were also created that conformed to Plygorethesis’ ideal of democracy, such as respect for natural right of individual, and prevention of tyranny.  Plygorethesis’ Athen soon became the envy of all Grecian city-states.  Athen attracted an incredibly many waves of migrations.  Many of those who migrated to Athen were men of talents, who saw in Athen opportunities for them to unleash their own potential and to live a life away from tyranny.  And so very quickly, in less than a decade, Athen had grown into a major metropolis of a million and half.  <br />
<br />
Athen’s rapid and remarkable rise was an anomaly in Grecian history.  In all of her history, no one city-state had attracted such a huge number of migrants in so short a time.  And never before had a city-state had a happier atmosphere.  Wealth was so great in Athen that a typical Athenian was able to enjoy the kind of comfort that was the exclusive domain of aristocrats in other city-states.  Science, arts, literatures flourished because many of the migrants who moved here were themselves talented and learned men.  <br />
<br />
Yet, it was this rapid rise of Athen that also made her dangerous to many of her rival city-states.  In particular, Sparta, who had enjoyed the status as the absolute master of all Greeks for almost a century and half now, was determined to destroy Athen, and plunder her wealth.</div>

		<div>In the early spring of 3559 BC, Athenian king, Marcus, met with Atticus diplomat, who brought news of the Atticusian king’s wish to marry his daughter to King Marcus.  The proposal was at best suspicious and at worst a trick, although it was not immediately known to King Marcus the exact nature of such a trick.  It was nevertheless a ploy because Atticus had traditionally paid tributes to Sparta.  A marriage proposal of this kind would, when executed, effectively make Atticus and Athen ally.  This shift in allegiance is unfathomable in absence of any compelling reason of which King Marcus knows none.  <br />
<br />
However, the only way to find out what Atticusian’s designs is, King Marcus must pretend to fall for the trap, which he did.  King Marcus married the Atticusian princess, Jocasta, and for the next several month of their marriage put up a show of good will and love for his newly wedded wife, a task that was not formidable given his wife’s heavenly beauty. <br />
<br />
On a late summer night, after having entertained the Atticusian diplomat who accompanied Princess Jocasta to her wedding ceremony, King Marcus pretended to be drunk.  Princess Jocasta had to help King Marcus to his bed.  Convinced that King Marcus was deep asleep, Princess Jocasta went to the Atticusian diplomat’s guest room, not knowing that she was being followed.  <br />
<br />
In the room, Princess Jocasta described what she has seen of Athen in the several month she has been here.  Of particular importance is Athen’s military status, major fortifications, weaponry, and other vital military information all of which Princess Jocasta revealed in great details.  Finished with the conversion, Princess Jocasta went back to her chamber to rest with her husband.  <br />
<br />
While resting in her chamber next to her husband, she could not sleep.  She was thinking what else she should do to secure more information about Athen’s military in order to clear way for an impending invasion by the joint army from Sparta and Atticus.  Suddenly, her husband, still quite drunk, muttered something.  Unable to understand the mumbling, Princess Jocasta did manage to make out two words that were of interest to her.  The two words were “invade” and “Atticus”.  <br />
<br />
Shocked, Princess Jocasta wished for her husband to say more.  Her wish was granted as her husband began to speak in great detail of his plan to invade Atticus.  Princess Jocasta learned that Marcus had planned all along to invade Atticus when their marriage began.  Specifically, Marcus had planned to concentrate the entire Athenian military on first striking a small farming town a few miles to the north of the Atticusian capital.  This farming town was strategic to Atticusian’s food supply.  Deprived of it, Atticusian military would completely collapse.  Princess Jocasta also learned of two other city-states near both Sparta and Atticus who had signed secret alliance with Athen.  When the Athenian invasion begins, these two city-states would also enter the war on the side of Athen.  Equipped with these information, Princess Jocasta rushed quietly to the diplomat’s room again to communicate her newly learned knowledge.  The next day, the diplomat departed for Atticus.  <br />
<br />
In the early fall of 3559 BC, the Athenian army marched for Atticus.  The Atticusian army was stationed at the very farming town that supplied the city-state’s bulk of food supply.  There, the Atticusian army readied themselves.  Formations were arranged, military installations were built, and ambush was prepared.  The Atticusians were waiting there, hoping to surprise the Athenian army.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Spartan army were divided into two.  One set out South, the other to the north.  Both went to conquer and punish the very city-states with whom a secret alliance has been signed with Athen.  <br />
<br />
Upon almost reaching the farming town, the Athenian army suddenly changed course, quickly marched for Atticusian capital.  Upon reaching the capital, Athenian army took it down with relatively ease because the bulk of the Atticusian army was stationed several miles away in the farming town.  The sudden change of event took the Atticusian army by surprise.  <br />
<br />
However, the Athenian army left the Atticusian capital as quickly as they have conquered it.  The Athenian army was clearly marching for Sparta, whose army was still fighting the two other city-states that allied with Athen.  Seeing this, the Atticusian army quickly re-deployed their entire army back to the Atticusian capital.  As soon as the Atticusian army reached their capital to liberate it, the Athenian army suddenly split into two.  One continued to head toward Sparta, while the other changed course and raced for the Atticusian farming town.  <br />
<br />
Upon reaching the Atticusian farming town, which was now completely undefended, the Athenian army destroyed the town, and all its farm field, and burned all the food supply.  Meanwhile the Athenian army that marched for Sparta quickly brought down the Spartan capital city for Spartan army was engaged in wars abroad.  The Spartan king was captured, made prisoner of war, and was sent back to Athen.<br />
<br />
The first war that Athen carried out since its founding ended in a costless victory for Athen.  Atticus suffered a famine in that same year due to lack of food supply, which was destroyed by the Athenian army.  And as for the Spartan, their capital city was ransacked.  When news of this reached the Spartan army fighting abroad, the entire army was so demoralized that they were quickly defeated.  Later, it was learned that Athen had never made any alliance with any city-states in Spartan’s sphere of influence.  The sly and cunning Athenian king, Marcus, made up everything he said that night while pretending to be drunk.  <br />
<br />
With Spartan’s sudden loss of power, the entire region within Spartan’s sphere of influence turned into chaos.  City-states began to fight with one another for control of mastery, while Athen watched as these city-states weaken themselves through this infighting.  The next year, King Marcus proposed the formation of an alliance between Athen and nine other nearby city-states under Marcus’ leadership.  And as things settled down in the former Spartan sphere of influence and war subsided five years after the formation of the Athenian led alliance, members of the former Spartan vessel system watched with alarm at the growing might of Athen, and decided to come together to form an alliance of their own to counter Athen. <br />
<br />
By 3555 BC, Greek’s new political landscape is in place.  Although city-states system was still in place, Athen would increasingly centralize power.  To the north of the future Athenian empire lied a Confederation which comprise all the territories that were formerly within Sparta’s sphere of influence.  For the next one decade, the two would face each other, engaged in a cold war that won’t turn hot in another sixty years.  At the same time, to the even more distant north, the growing empire of Persia sat quietly watching.</div>

		<div>Persian expansion:<br />
<br />
By 3577 BC, Persia had mastered the kingdoms and tribes that sat in the Middle East.  Three hundred years ago, King Xerxes I united all Persian tribes under his rule, and created the first united Persian kingdom.  Ever since, his successors had built on his legacy and expanded Persia, swallowing various other tribes and kingdoms until the Egyptian-Persian war of 3592 BC, in which an Egyptian victory checked further Persian expansion down into Europe.  <br />
<br />
However, this defeat proved to be only a temporary set back for the Persians, who immediately changed plans, and attacked India.  At the time of the invasion, India was being torn apart by internal civil war as princes fought their siblings for control of the India’s Gulpta empire.  (I made the name because I am not well versed in Indian history.  For that matter, I am not well versed in any countries’ history except that of China’s.  I hope the name isn’t offensive to anyone.  If it is, I apologize in advance.)  As a result, Persia easily conquered a divided India.  Using the resources obtained from India, Persian quickly rebuild her wealth and the army lost during the war against Egypt, and by 3577 BC crushed the Egyptian resistance, destroying the Egyptian empire forever after she had stood for one thousand years.  <br />
<br />
Below, we trace the story of Persian expansion under Xerxes VIII’s, and, more specifically, his successful annexation of India and Egypt.</div>

		<div>The Egyptian Persian War:<br />
<br />
King Xerxes VIII of Persia stood on top of the Goshan mountain (a random name I made up) overlook the long stretch of pasture that domesticated his army’s horses.  Beyond the pasture is the Serian Lake (another name I made up) that divides Persia and Egypt.   Xerxes watched and thought.  <br />
<br />
By the time of King Xerxes’ rule, the Egyptian empire had stood for a thousand year.  Although the rise of Persia three centuries ago had overshadowed the once mighty Egyptian empire, Persia still must conquer Egypt and India in order to achieve the status as the undisputed master of all Middle East.   <br />
<br />
The problem isn’t so much that a Persian invasion of Egypt would be difficult for it was not.  Persian army was the most powerful in Middle East in terms of size and quality.  What made Xerxes hesitated from carrying out an outright attack on Egypt was the consideration that it might perhaps be even better to first bring down India’s Gulpta empire, which was on the verge of civil war as the Indian princes fought their sibling for control of the empire’s throne.   However, an attack on India would no doubt alert the Egyptians into military preparation.  Persian army may be powerful, but Egyptian army was not weak either.  Xerxes’ confidence on being able to conquer Egypt rested on the element of surprise, one which would be lost if Persia invades India, thereby galvanizing Egyptians into actions.   <br />
<br />
Xerxes walked along a dirt path leading to a nearby town, where he and his advisors had been dwelling for the last few days.  By the time Xerxes had reached the town, he had made up his mind.  Five days later, the first regiment of Persian army would arrive to meet with Xerxes.   Three days after that, the rest of the Persian army stationed throughout the empire would also join force.  The first Persian-Egyptian war would soon begin.  <br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
Queen Cleopatra was deep asleep when she was awakened forcefully by her servant.  Annoyed, Cleopatra asked indignantly the reason that she was awakened.  Responding to Cleopatra's inquiry, her servant said wth great panic that news had several hours ago reached Thebes, the Egyptian capital, that a huge Persian army of no less than sixty thousand had crossed the Serian Lake just a day ago, and will march to Thebes in four days.   <br />
<br />
As if not grasping the event that is now happening which her servant had communicated to her, Cleopatra simply stared, her jaw slightly dropping open.  But Cleopatra quickly recollected her thought, and dispatched the servant to call on all her imperial advisors to the palace for meeting.   <br />
<br />
The meeting however was not fruitful, it being better characterized by shouting matches in which advisors blamed each other for the disaster that has befallen.  The truth is the advisors themselves did not know what to do because an invasion was something that they, nor anyone in Egypt for that matter, had ever experienced.   Although the Egyptian hegemony had ended three hundred years ago with the rise of Persia, Egypt had up until now been spared from the Persian invasion because the Persians was preoccupied on elsewhere.  And so for three hundred years, Egypt had enjoyed peace.   Yet this peace made the quality of Egyptian military weak, a negative that admittedly was balanced out by the positve of the wealth and rich that the peace brought about.  However, no greater wealth and riches could save Egypt from the giagantic Persian army now.   <br />
<br />
Cleopatra dismissed her imperial advisors, who were giving her a headache rather than a head relief.  She sat down on a chair.  Her mind was blank.  She tried to think of something to do to save Egypt from the catastrophe, yet nothing came to her mind.   <br />
<br />
At this momment, Asire walked in.  He was also in the meeting that ended only minutes ago.  Cleopatra looked at him, and asked him of the reason for his return.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How much do you wish to save Egypt?&quot;, Asire asked.  <br />
&quot;If my death must be the price for Egypt's freedom from Persia, then so be it&quot;<br />
&quot;Death shall not be, for I have a plan that would obviate such need&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot;  Cleopatra asked, her eyes betraying her skepticism as she examined the young and relatively inexperienced advisor standing before her.  <br />
<br />
After Asire had communicated to Cleopatra of his idea, Cleopatra's skepticism turned to careful optimism.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It is a good plan, but it is nevertheless a risky one, which would destroy my kingdom if not executed perfectly&quot;<br />
&quot;That you would not need to worry, if you will let me be in charge&quot;<br />
&quot;And I will, and you shall be handsomely rewarded if you save Egypt.  Realize however that if you fail, your death shall not be because of my punishment, but because of that of the Persian's&quot;<br />
<br />
Asire nodded, the look of confidence on his face retreated a little, signalizing his realization at the severity of the great crisis that would ensue if he should make any mistake.</div>

		<div>Cleopatra made it known to everyone the next day that she was heading east towards Ramesis, a city on the eastern most tip of Egypt.  Going along with her were the core of Egypt's army.  There at Ramesis, Cleopatra would reorganize and build a provisional capital, and amass the strength to liberate Egypt from the Persian tyranny.   Cleopatra's speech was delivered with such power that it aroused the emotion of all her audience.  As she leaves, her subject shouted &quot;long live Queen Cleopatra&quot;, and wished her fast return.  <br />
<br />
News of her speech and her leaving quickly spread throughout Egypt, and reached Xerxes.  He sat inside his tent, and thought.  Then he made up his mind.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Men!&quot;, Xerxes said to his generals, &quot;we are heading straight for Ramesis now!&quot;  <br />
<br />
His generals listened in confusion, and Lydus asked &quot;What of the cities that sit in between here and Ramesis?  The Egyptian army is in disarray.  We should conquer and consolidate our rule in these cities before we head for Ramesis while it is still easy to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your right about Egyptian army being in disarray.  In fact, as we speak now, all of Egypt is in disarray.  And that disarray will only get worse if we can capture Cleopatra and destroy the army that is now heading toward Ramesis with her.  Do you not see what Cleopatra is doing?   With her speech and her leaving for Ramesis, she has ignited a hope for all Egyptians that doom has not come.  As long as that hope exists, we will face resistance everywhere we go.  But as soon as we capture Cleopatra and destroy her army, Egyptian will loose the hope.   They will offer no resistance, and our task at conquering each city will be made all the more simpler.&quot;<br />
<br />
Xerxes' generals listened and nodded and praised Xerxes' for his cunning military strategy.  They left immediately for Ramesis.  In fact, Xerxes was so desperate to get to Ramesis that his entire army traveled long distances daily, loosing rest and sleep.   Upon reaching Ramesis, Xerxes' army was completely exhausted.</div>

		<div>Yet to everyone's surprise, Xerxes saw no Egyptian army nor Cleopatra at Ramesis.  All they saw was an abandoned city.  On the door of the gate that led to the interior of the city was carved Persian writing, which said &quot;you have fallen for our trap&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Xerxes' mouth dropped open as he saw the writing.  At the same time, a Persian scout, completely injured exhausted, had rushed to Ramesis to deliver to Xerxes of what had happened.<br />
<br />
It turned out that Cleopatra never left Thebes.  She lied in order get Xerxes and his entire army to rush to Ramesis as soon as possible.  This would spare all the Egyptian city from Persian attack.  Meanwhile, as Xerxes marched towards Ramesis, the lightly guarded Persian warships that still docked along the Serian Lake was attacked by the Egyptian army, which now had complete control over the Persian ships.   <br />
<br />
Xerxes listened in shock as he realized what had happened.  If the Egyptians controlled the Persian ships, how will they ever be able to cross the Serian lake to get home?  The thought of this question scared Xerxes, and he quickly ordered the entire army to march westward back to Serian lake.   There, Xerxes' decided, they would fight to death if that is what must be done to get back control of the ship.  <br />
<br />
Yet, Xerxes and his army's return trip to Serian Lake was interrupted by numerous ambush planned earlier by Asire.  Worse yet, much of these ambush happened at night while the Persian army slept.  By the time the Persian reached the Serian lake, they were exhausted and completely demoralized.   <br />
<br />
The Persian army's will to fight was weakened further when they saw that the Egyptian had destroyed half of the Persian warships.  The remaining Persian warships were curiously unguraded by any Egyptian troops.  The Persian army camped along the bank that docked those Persian warships that were thought to have been occupied.   They dared not enter those ships for they fear traps.  <br />
<br />
The next morning, when scouts were sent aboard the ship, it was known that these ships were indeed empty, and in good health.  Grateful, Xerxes made preparation to embark, knowing that only half of his army could reach home, while the remaining half would have to stay behind.   <br />
<br />
At this very moment as the embark began, war drums and sound of horse chariots and screams emanated from all four directions.  The Egyptian army appeared suddenly out of nowhere surrounding the Persian army.  Yet, the Egyptians made only a half hearted effort at attacking the Persian army.   As for the Persian army, they had not the heart to fight for they were only concerned with getting back onto those ships, which they know would only carry half of the entire army back to Persia.  In the chaos that followed, Persian army was decimated slowly and slowly.   By the time the Persian warships left, only one third of the Persian army survived.</div>

		<div>Asire stood next to Cleopatra, his face shoned with pride.  His plan worked splendidly.  In fact, he was surprised by how successfully things went.  He created the illusion that Cleopatra's moving to Ramesis was a ray of hope that would inspire Egyptians to resistance against the Persians.   And the knowledge of this would lead Xerxes' to rush straight to Ramesis in an attempt to crush that ray of hope.  Yet, this was a trap, which gave the Egyptian an opportunity to take control of the Persian ships docked along the Serian lake.  And by destroying only half of the Persian ships, the Persian army would be too concerned with getting back onto those ships instead of fighting the Egyptians.   This psychological warfare was executed beautifully, and lead to the loss of two third of the Persian army.  What amazed Asire was not that his plan worked, for he knew that it would.  It was the amount of damage that was done to Persian army that amazed him.   <br />
<br />
Asire was made the commander of all Egyptian army, a title that he unfortunately could not keep for long because he soon died of a disease.  All of Egypt mourned for his death, yet they also quickly forgot about Asire.  Cleopatra, for her own part, was relieved that Asire had left the world for she feared his intelligence would lead him to betray her one day.   Yet little did Cleopatra know that it is exactly Asire's intelligence that she would need soon enough, because she had not heard the last of the Persian.</div>

		<div>Befallen upon all of Persia was a great sullenness that was particularly dreadful in the palace that resides Xerxes.  The king had been humiliated.  Never in all three centuries of Persian empire’s history had such a defeat met Persian army as the one that was inflicted in the recent disastrous campaign against Egypt.  However, the king had more to worry about than the loss of his pride.  <br />
<br />
The Persian empire was built on a system based on confederation.  In the past whenever a region was conquered, that region submitted to Persian rule.  Yet, it was not completely integrated into Persian empire as a province that would be ruled directly by Persia’s imperial court.  Rather, the region would retain considerable autonomy.  So great, in fact, was the autonomy that many kings of the defeated kingdoms were allowed to continue to govern as long as they willingly surrender, swear loyalty and pay tributes and taxes to Persia.  As long as Persia’s military was perceived as unquestionably the most powerful, the allegiance of the members of Persia’s confederate empire would be ensured.  <br />
<br />
However, Xerxes feared that continued allegiance would not be the case soon, now that Persia was defeated by Egypt.  The defeat would certain hurt the reputation of Persia’s military might.  More importantly however, Persia’s military had truly been weakened, two third of her army had been lost in Egypt.  Something has to be done, and be done fast before Persia’s confederate empire disintegrate as members turn against Persia.  But what should be done?  <br />
<br />
Xerxes walked around his room all day long, skipping lunch and dinner.  By the next dawn however, an idea had come to Xerxes’ mind.  Happiness and excitement quickly took over the gloom that had only several hours ago made Xerxes such a wretched man.  He quickly dispatched his servants to gather his advisors for a meeting in which Xerxes would explain his idea, one that would conquer India first and then quell the threat of Persian empire's disintegration.</div>

		<div>In the summer of 3591 BC, a Persian army of ten thousands marched eastward for India's Gulpta empire.  The reason for this military manuver was that India was on the verge of a civil war as three Indian princes fought each other for Gultpa's throne.  King Xerxes of Persia knew that to attack all of India now would risk uniting the three princes and all of India; but if he were to attack India in the name of supporting one of the three competing princes to the throne to create stability in India, then King Xerxes would have the moral high ground as well as further accelerating civil war in India.  <br />
 <br />
Like a prophet, events rolled out as King Xerxes had planned. More importantly, King Xerxes selected Vijaya as the heir to India's throne.  The choice was not random for Vijaya was the least competent of the three princes, making him easier to control by Persia.  <br />
 <br />
As soon as news of Persia's support for Vijaya reached India, the two other Indian princes fled the Gulpta capital with their consituents, and build a separate kingdom of their own in those region of Gulpta empire where the princes enjoyed the greatest support, effectively dividing Gulpta into three small states, with Vijaya's located right next to Persian boarder.  <br />
 <br />
Mayamur India, ruled by Mayamur, Vijaya's second brother, was sandwiched between Vijaya India and Rajhappura India, the latter being ruled by Rajhappura, Vijaya's third brother.  Therefore Mayamur India was from the start located at a unfavorable situation, and risk attack from both sides.<br />
 <br />
Moreover, Mayamur India is a region dominated by hills and mountains with very little arable land for farming.  In time such as this when it is isolated from the rest of the India, Mayamur India would have to become completely self sufficient in provision of food, a self sufficiency that is very susceptible to disruption given the small amount of available farm land.  <br />
 <br />
King Xerxes knows this and took advantage of these facts.  For the next three years, King Xerxes would station his army of ten thousand in the boarder shared by Vijiaya India and Mayamur India, leaving another ten thousand back in Persia.  Every year when it comes close to harvesting season, King Xerxes would order his army as well as that of Vijaya India's to mobilize for invasion of Mayamur India.  King Xerxes would also spread rumor that he would dispatch his other half of Persian army stationed backin in Persia to join the invasion.  Moreover, he would spread rumor that Rajhapurra is planning an attack at around the same time.  <br />
 <br />
The reason for doing all these is to achieve to purposes.  First, by mobilizing for invasion during harvesting season, and spreading rumor that those segment of Persian army stationed in Persia would join the invasion, it created an illusion that Mayamur is going to be fighting a huge combined invasion force from both Persia and Vijaya India.  This illusion would force Mayamur to mobilize all of his country's population for war, including those farmers.  As a result of this mobilization effort, farm work would be neglected, effectively decreasing the supply of food in a country that is already volunerable to food supply disruption.  Yet after the farm duties have been sufficiently neglected to ensure a bad harvest for the year for Mayamur India, King Xerxes would always suddenly withdraw his decision to attack.  In addition, when rumors reached Persia's confederate empire that the remaining ten thousand Persian army in Persia would join King Xerxes invasion of Mayamur India, King Xerxes' spies planted throughout Persia's member states would carefully observe these states' rulers' reactions.  It is from these observations that King Xerxes would accurately determine who in Persia is prone to act of treachery.  <br />
<br />
Second, by spreading rumor that Rajhappura India is also planning an attack at around the same time, it would divide Mayamur army into two, one defending the east, the other defending the west.  <br />
 <br />
King Xerxes plan was carried out to perfection, and led to a major famine in Mayamur India three years later.  Seizing this opportunity, King Xerxes quickly ordered Vijaya's army to invade Mayamur India with King Xerxes' army following closely behind.  Thus Mayamur India was quickly brought down, with however, some loss on the part of Vijaya's army, and very insignificant loss to King Xerxes' army because his army was simply following behind Vijaya's army, which meant Vijaya's army bore the brunt of the fighting. <br />
 <br />
At the same time Rajhappura India's army also carved out a sizeable territory for herself from Mayamur India, taking advantage of the latter's famine so that India is now divided into two states.  <br />
 <br />
At this very moment, when India was divided into two, King Xerxes decided that he would ready his army and march back to Persia.  Vijaya had always been uncomfortable with the presence of King Xerxes and his army in India, and rejoiced at the news of their leaving.  However, Vijaya, being an incompetent king that he is, didn't realize that King Xerxes' leaving would encourage an attack from Rajhappura India, which is exactly what happened.  <br />
 <br />
Meanwhile as soon as King Xerxes' army marched back to Persia, he surprised all of Persia by invading with lightening speed six of Persia's member states which had planned on rebelling against Persian rule for the past three years.  King Xerxes knew of their plan because of the spie network planned since three years ago when he first left for India.  The sudden invasion caught these six member states competely offguard, and their army was quickly defeated.  With this quick victory, Persia reasserted her power and prevented the disintegration of Persia's confederate empire.  <br />
 <br />
As for India, Vijaya and Rajhappurra would fight for the next six years continuously until both were significantly weakened.  The weakening of both Vijaya India and Rajhappura India made King Xerxes' invasion of all India a very quick and easy task.  By 3582 BC, Persia had conquered all of India.  With this newly found confidence, King Xerxes would turn again to Egypt, where he would avenge his humiliating defeat a decade ago.</div>

		<div>King Xerxes’ Indian campaign was a success.  However, having spend several years in this venture, Persian empire’s resources had been significantly drained.  If King Xerxes were to invade Egypt, he would have to do with not very much.  In fact, a Persian army of thirty thousands is all he had to conquer Egypt.  This is half of what he had in his previous Egyptian campaign.  <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, King Xerxes was confident.  He had learned from his two previous campaign that a true master of war does not rely on number and sheer size, but on strategy, and cunningness, which Egypt does not have after the death of General Asire.  <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Cleopatra walked along the long hallway that led to her chamber.  Something was bothering her, yet she was not sure what it is.  News of Persian navy crossing the Great Serian Lake that separates Egypt and Persia had been communicated to her and all of her royal advisors this morning during the meeting.  Plans had been formulated to counter the impending Persian threat.   The plan was simple.  It was decided that the Persians should be allowed to land on the Egyptian coast, where all of Egypt’s army would destroy the Persians before they have the time to organize after their disembarking.  In fact, at this very moment, messengers were dispatched throughout Egypt to re-deploy Egyptian troops to the bank of Great Serian Lake.  <br />
<br />
Cleopatra believes in her intuition, which is telling her that this military plan is too simplistic.  But she does not wish to be troubled by this any further, so she dismissed it right away.  Soon enough, Cleopatra would regret her decision.  <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
King Xerxes stood on the top deck of his warship.  From there, he has a very clear view of whatever that lay at a distance.  What King Xerxes see is land.  This is Egypt’s land, which he would conquer very soon, and with much ease.  <br />
<br />
Why would he conquer with much ease?  Because King Xerxes had fooled the Egyptian government.  King Xerxes had send for a fleet of Persian battleship to cross the Great Serian Lake to create the illusion that the Persians will invade from there.  At the same time, the real invading Persian army is being transported to the eastern tip of the Egyptian empire by another route, one that the Egyptian had never expected.  <br />
<br />

Cleopatra read the report.  Her face was pale white.  The Persian army had landed on the eastern tip of the Egyptian empire.  And since all of the Egyptian army was stationed along the coast of Great Serian Lake, the Persian army faced no resistance at all, and had conquered one third of Egypt by now.  <br />
<br />
Just a few hours ago, Cleopatra had ordered that the Egyptian army be completely be deployed eastward as soon as possible to throw the Persian out of Egypt.  She knows what had been bothering her now.  Her intuition had been trying to tell her that King Xerxes had been playing a big trick on her.  Yet, much to her regret, she didn’t listen to her intuition.  And now she’s playing the price for it.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The Persian army marched toward Thebes, the seat of Egyptian capital.  King Xerxes was confident that the Egyptian army that was coming to intercept him would be quickly destroyed.  King Xexers expected that Cleopatra would deploy the bulk of the Egyptian army to the Great Serian Lake.  And now, the Egyptian army would have to run all the way eastward to confront his Persian army.  By the time the Egyptian army does meet up with his Persian army, the former would be too tired to fight.  And King Xerxes is not planning to give the Egyptian any rest neither.  He would do unto the Egyptian what the Egyptians does onto him ten years ago.  He would make exhaust the Egyptian army even further by harassing them at night so that the already tired Egyptian army would not be able to rest.  And when morale is sufficiently low, the Egyptians could easily be destroyed.</div>

		<div>King Xerxes sat at the throne back in the Persian capital, his countenance betraying his profound satisfaction despite his effort at trying to hide it.  He does not want his pride of the successful conquest of Egypt revealed because he wanted to be seen as a noble and benevolent king.  <br />
<br />
Kneeling before him is Queen Cleopatra, who has submitted to Persian rule in exchange for some form of Egyptian autonomy.  King Xerxes knew of Egyptian's love for Queen Cleopatra and did not wish to alienate his new subjects by executing the queen, so he agreed to Egyptian autonomy.  In fact, since Persian empire is really a confederate empire, the Egyptian autonomy is nothing new anyways.  <br />
<br />
King Xerxes had completed the conquest of all Middle East after almost fifteen years.  For the next eighty years, Middle East would be united under one central authority.  Prosperity and peace would reign, and arts, literatures, sciences and cultures would flourish, ushering the first of many Golden Age in Middle Eastern history.</div>
