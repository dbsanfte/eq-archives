The soliders are sitting around the camp talking and playing cards. They are eagerly waiting for orders from the despot. <br />
<br />
Solider: I got a ace of spades. Haha. I won.<br />
<br />
Solider 2: hey, Let me see in your sleeve.<br />
<br />
Solider: No, stay away.<br />
<br />
The second solider quicly takes his hand and uncovers tons of aces up his sleeve. The two soliders start fighting.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a man comes running in to the camp and shouting.<br />
<br />
Man: The Egyptians attacked a little village near Regia Doughnouthia last night. They slaughtered almost all the inhabitans there, only some kids and women managed to flee to the mountains. <br />
<br />
The Soliders begin murmuring amongst themselves. Some of the soliders had relativs in the village. A unrest is coming trough the lair. They really want the message from the despot to move ahead from this piss-camp on the border of Helenetica. They really want to get to the front line and destroy the egyptians... They are eagrly awaiting the despots orders....</div></div><hr />

Antonio's Legions are seen marching by the camp, headed toward Egypt. The Horse Archers gallop ahead to so they can scout the Egyptian border.<br />
<br />
Legionairy(yelling towards camp): Why haven't you soldiers left for Egypt yet?<br />

Soldier: We are awation orders from the Despot!<br />

Soldier(Mumbling to self): Why won't the despot give permission?<br />

The legions march off, and by an hour's passing the end of the line marches by.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On one bright morning, general vendetta suddenly shows up with her personal guard unit for a inspection of the field encampment of the mobile corpse<br />
VE: &quot;Ah. How i would wish to lead those fine men into battle myself... they will earn fame and glory out there... I must talk to the Lt. General. Guard? Please go and get Arlena&quot;<br />
GU: &quot;Yes General&quot;<br />
The guard walks of Vendetta continues her walk through the encampment. Some of the soldiers look embarrassed as they notice her, but nobody has enough courage to talk to her directly.<br />
A few moments later the guard comes back to vendette with Arlena.<br />
VE: &quot;Ah! Arlena! I must congratulate you for your organization. So soon after i called you to service you managed to prepare our troops for battle... I hope you have everything you need?&quot;<br />
AR: &quot;Welcome to our encampment, General. I hope you are pleased with it even though it was set up very hastily. At the moment i think we do not miss anything... but thank you for your offers...&quot;<br />
VE: &quot;I also hope the despot is soon to give the marching command arlena... but tell me... who is this young man next to you?&quot;<br />
AR: &quot;Oh, i almost forgot... this is major general Scrobius, the commander of my 2nd division. I wanted to introduce you to him...&quot;<br />
SC: &quot;General...&quot;<br />
VE: &quot;Ah... so many nice young man fighting for glory! I am very please we still can bring up such a force...&quot;<br />
AR: &quot;Well, in fact we had a hard time training them, but they seem to be ok now for fighting...&quot;<br />
VE: &quot;Im sorry i have to go again for now, but i maybe will visit you on a frontline encampment soon... if you need anything, just send a messenger and your request shall be fullfilled. And if the despot does not make any orders, also let me know. I will then visit him and ask him whether he wants to give our land to the egypts without any resistance... now please tell me about...&quot;<br />
<br />
The three commanders of the helenatican forces go off talking about the details and strength of their units, military tactics and plans they have for the future... After many hours and as darkness already had fallen over the camp for a long time, finally Vendetta and her guards leave the encampment to go back to gorina</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Under the direction of Lt. General Arlena Gorina we have established a base camp while we await the orders of the despot. It has not taken long for the men to grow restless and myself along with them. We came out here for our own reasons, but we all want to move along and soon.<br />
<br />
There are already rumors floating around the camp. Some say the despot does not wish to usse the Helenetican force at all. That he thinks he can stop the Egyptions by himself.<br />
<br />
There are also rumors that the Egyptions have already began their attack  on our land, starting with a small  village near Regia Doughnouthia. I would like nothing more than to lead my men down there imediately and eliminate the threat, but I must control myself as well as my men and wait for orders.</div></div><hr />

...<br />
What fine men we have! I am proud, proud to be a helenatican citizen<br />
...<br />
But i still wonder whether the egyptian crisis will be solved by force or the diplomats... I hope the despot is strong and now as cowardish as many people maybe think he is<br />
...<br />
Why didnt he give orders yet? I am inclined to just walk my forces over his land to the frontline, but this would trigger a major crisis which could easily destroy the whole nation... and my ancestors just faught too hard to unite it and keep it united<br />

Scrobius marches from his division to the front of the convoy...<br />
Scrobius: &quot;Commander?&quot;<br />
Arlena: &quot;General Vendetta asks us if we need another division of troops... she is ready to raise another at 6 units for our command, and thinks maybe a cavalry division would be good... do we have any suitable commanders?&quot;<br />
...<br />
OOC:<br />
to be continued by SirJohn. I want to raise a new division of cavalry... would we need horsemen or horse archers best? i think it would be horsemen for their fast moovement. this would be a light cavalry to support or armored troops then.<br />
also, i need a commander for those troops. if you can recommend one, go forward and continue the storyline. as end of the line send the messenger back with your response.</div></div><hr />

Scorpius: What?<br />
Arlena: We will give to horsearchers to eachs division for a balistic support. Then the tow remaning units will be horsemen. Theese two will be given under the command of Privat Julius Aqaurius who are to be promoted to major and theese two horseman units will be a reconisanse (not sure how its spelled, Ill just say spy from now on) group wich can either split up and &quot;spy&quot; for both the divisions or remain as one group and spy for one of the divisions. They are wery usefull as they can also be backups in a fight. I hope that General Vandetta will like this plan.<br />
Scrobius: Im sure she will.<br />
Arlena: Yes. Messenger, Have you written it down?<br />
Messanger: Yes, sir.<br />
Arlena: Good. Away you go. We will be on our way to Egypt as soon as the horses arrive.<br />

@Civ: When we get to egypt it is your responobility to get your men to be usefull. You will have to give them orders unless you here anything else from me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope Vendetta accepts the proposal! I will be the commander of 2 horsemen units! How exciting. My plan is to split the group so we can can conduct reconnisance for both divisions. If the proposal isn accepted, I will give command of one group to Maj. Kindzus. He will use his group to spy for Scrobius' division and I will use my group to spy for Gorinia's division. What a day for the Aquarius line!<br />
<br />

Vendetta: &quot;Ah! A good idea... the young one can proove his abilities and may be one of our future great leaders later on... good.... so shall it be! Grand Visir, take a note:<br />
<br />
I, General Vendetta, leader of the helenatican army, herewith announce 2 improovements of our troops:<br />
1) we will give horse-archers into our 2 divisions to give them balistic ability.<br />
2) the &quot;II-b reconnaissance Squadron&quot; with 2 horsmen will be crated as support Squadron inside the HMC. it will be commanded by Major Julius Aquarius, who will receive his direct commands from Lt. General Arlena. The Squadron will be used for reconnaissance missions for all divisions of the corps.&quot;<br />
Grand Visir: &quot;Yes General, i will post the announcement to the public immediately...&quot;<br />
Vendetta: &quot;Good. Messenger, please bring this message to our troops... they may start moovment to the fron immediately as the horsemen will be much faster and be there soon.&quot;<br />
The Grand Visir and the Messenger go off<br />
Vendetta (to herself): &quot;This was really a brilliant idea. But i hope our scientists can soon make our ballistic units a bit more effective... and i need to tell them to look into better armor for our horsemen...&quot;<br />
<br />
OOC:<br />
SJ, the units will be demanded immediately in the conflict thread. i will also post our new structure. note that i created a support squadron with those 3 spearmen..... i put the new recon-squadron under the lt. general as it will be used in both divisions... i hope this setup fits your plans...<br />

Julius(bows as he speaks): General, I understand I am to take my squadron ahead on a reconnaissance mission. Are you aware of this?<br />
<br />
Lt. Gen. Arlena: Yes Major. Take your horsemen and scout the area on which we will battle. Try to find a nice hill where we can setup a &quot;fallback&quot; position, not that we will need it much. Then find a flat area where we can charge down the hill. The horse archers will take auxiliary positions and support our legions with troops. The Support Division will take up &quot;Fallback Hill&quot; to secure the location. Our target is El-Armana. Is your objective clear?<br />

Maj. Julius: Yes General. One request general, that if we see and scouts of the Egyptians, that we may dispatch them?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the attack plan on the egyptians.<br />
<br />
The Blue is the second divison.<br />
The Red is the First Divison.<br />
The Green is the headquearters<br />
The Yellow is where the archers will stand when providing firecover...<br />
The Dark green is the spy divisions spot. Antonius forces will also be there rushing into the city..<br />
The White arrows are the attacking lines of the Jade Commandos<br />
<br />
The backer red and blue are their camps while the fron one are theire attack positions..<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/attackbig.jpg <br />
<br />
<br />
A brief explanation to the picture: <br />
<br />
Both divisons will move forwards to theri attack positions when the attack is launched. The together 4 horse archers (and maby some more to come) will split up from the divsions and provide artillery cover at the yellow point. The battle will be commanded from the HQ at the green point. There will be 3 spears protecting the HQ. The Dark green is where the horsemen Julius command will be spread out. They are to take all who trie to escape the backway... The Antonius forces will also be there. They will attcak just before the Jades.. The Jade commandos will engage their attack from the sides... They will squise them with brute force :)<br />
<br />
OOC: I hoe all agrees to this. CG: If you agree you must move your troops to the tiles that the arrows come from...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our forces have begun to move towards the enemy lands. Lt. General Arlena has devised a multi pronged attacked that will limit the chances of enemy escape. He has even found away a way to make good use of the Jade Commandos without having their unorganized, wild fighters getting in the way of our well trained Helenetican forces.<br />
<br />
The troops are very excited to be nearing battle. Of course the actual battle plans have not yet been given out to non-officers to deter enemy espionage, but all are well aware that we will be striking an Eguption town directly.<br />
<br />
There are rumors floating around that the despot has paid a visit to Lt. General Arlena, and is very upset. I am not sure what this is about but I have been called to meet with her soon to hammer out the final plans for attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to make an apology to two Commanders to the HMC. My actions today were irrational due since I wanted to see that my brother can get the best of this that his Brothers did not get to see. My brother and I have had 3 brothers, but they died very young, thus the reason of my protection to my brother. I would allow Maxuis to be a private and I hope that he can get to command a part of the HMC. Maxius has great leadership potential waiting to be unleashed. What has brought me to this apology is a certan young woman named, Mara Jade IV a General of the Jade Commandos. She has showed me to not be protective of my brother but to be proud that he would one day be in the HMC's Officer ranks. I would also like to apologise to Mara Jade IV for putting pressure on her. I hope that we can forget about what has happened earlyer and take care of my Brother, he will serve you well.<br />
<br />
Despot Augustius suddenly starts to remember his Father-in law, Caeser Jade, that has recently passed on<br />
<br />
And I would like to honor my Father-in law, Caeser Jade's passing with a moment of silence<br />
<br />
1 Minute of Silence<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Despot Augustius Veern Jade starts to feel moornful of the passing of his father-in law and ask one of his advisors to take him back to his palace so that he can spend time with himself to remember Ceaser Jade</div></div><hr />

inside the tent, you see someone lying down and sleeping... looking around the tent, with all that gold plated armor, this must be the lt. general alrena gorinia.<br />
suddenly, the dark figure neaks forward and pulling out a dagger and pushing it into the sleeping body of the lt. general.<br />
<br />
as she had no time to shout, nobody notices the figure. blood is running over the ground of the tent, as the dark figure sneaks out of the camp again and in direction of the egyptian city.<br />
<br />
OOC: note that i had to do this due to the fact that sirjohn was obviously banned from the forum and thus his characters were killed of by rpg-management (see event thread). IT WAS NEITHER PLANNED NOR MY IDEA! it cam as a surprise... disrupting the storyline a bit.<br />

THE NEXT DAY<br />
At the palace of gorina<br />
Messenger: &quot;General! We have bad news from the frontline! Lt. General Arlena is dead! She was assassinated!&quot;<br />
General Vendetta: &quot;NO! This cant be! ... I wonder what is behind all that... ready my horse, we have to do some promotions to continue our attack!&quot;<br />
After a very short time, some palace guards and Vendetta hurry with their horses to the camp at the frontline<br />
<br />
AT THE FRONTLINE CAMP OF THE HMC<br />
Vendetta:<br />
&quot;Soldiers of the Helenatican II Corps! Today, i am here to bring you bad news. You surely heard that the lt. General commanding your corps has been killed cowardly in her tent. We dont know yet whom was the cowardly attacker or who ordered him to do this ugly assassination, nor whether he sole some of our plans for the upcoming attack.<br />
To honour the lt. General, i would like to do a minute of deep silence in rememberance of her great heroic doings in the past. She will be braught to gorina and burried in the royal graveyard with a full military ceremony...&quot;<br />
the soldiers stand for one minute in silence<br />
&quot;I would now like to immediately proclaim the new ranks which will be filled immediately to work around the lack of command caused by the sudden death arlena suffered from.<br />
1) the new lt. general of the II. Corps is a young private of whom i heard tremendous stories of heroism and about his great charisma....<br />
come up here, lt. General maximus veen!<br />
2) our new units (6 legions and 2 horsearchers) will form a new division, which will be controlled by mj. General Julius Aqaurius, a good and reliable officer according to arlenas recordings.<br />
<br />
the changes in the organization will be in effect immediately. the new lt. general will be given word now, and he is free to reorganize his troops as he wishes (this includes promotions up to the rank of major).&quot;<br />
the soldiers start to applause the new lt. general, as he mooves up to vendetta to hold a speach<br />
<br />
civgeneral, now its your turn. i would propose opening a new thread as some info in the 1st post needs to be updated.<br />
a summary of the HMC right now:<br />
II.a 3 spearmen (lt. general Maximus Veen)<br />
II.b 2 horsemen (lt. general Maximus Veen)<br />
II.1 6 legions, 2 horsearchers (lt. general Maximus Veen)<br />
II.2 6 legions, 2 horsearchers (mj.general Scrobius Pantonius)<br />
II.3 6 legions, 2 horsearchers (mj.general Julius Aquarius)<br />
<br />
please also check which of the privates are still alive, as all of SJ's characters were killed off and i believe some are in there.</div></div><hr />

Lucentio: &quot;But still, im the ruler of your province and the general of your army... Also i do not want to interfere with your advanced tactics, but just clarify the priorities of our army...&quot;<br />
Maxius: &quot;True... i must admit you are right... and i am your humble servant, General...&quot;<br />
Lucentio: &quot;No need for that, Maxius... I only wanted to tell you that our troops need to crush the rebels. Even in their homeland. I will reraise all lost troops immediately, and i urge you to attack Julia's home. She shall not be free. If you spot her and cant capture her, then kill her. I dont mind. Moove the troops into position immediately!&quot;<br />
Maxius: &quot;YES SIR!&quot;<br />
Lucentio: &quot;Stop it! We can talk normal in here... no need for protocol...&quot;<br />
Maxius: &quot;Should we wait for the resupply of our units?&quot;<br />
Lucentio: &quot;No. March immediately. Aureus is freed, we maybe need to leave our wounded legions behind... reform as many divisions as possible with full health units, and then crush them.&quot;<br />
Lucentio goes of<br />
Maxius: &quot;Stupid little child. We should have waited for resupply... but if he wants.... lets see what we have left...&quot;<br />
<br />
OOC:<br />
EDIT:<br />
we have left 10 legions, 6 horsearchers, 2 horsemen, 3 spearmen.<br />
i would suppose forming 2 divisions and one squad for fast attacks.<br />
details can be found here (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=1039158#post1039158).<br />
cg, please also define who commands which division.<br />
<br />
also, i rose 10 legions to a) replace lost units b) to stack up the standard divisional strength to 8 legions+2horsearchers.<br />
they will go to aureus, where the 4 half-strength legions stay to heal. so one commander with charisma of at least 14 needs to stay behind in aureus.</div></div><hr />

A follow-up attack is a good idea. Look at the American Civil War. The pansy General Meade never followed-up, so the rebels got away and were able to fight for another 2 years.<br />
<br />
Julius Can stay behind at Aureus to command the units.</div></div><hr />

DEAREST maxius,<br />
i have good news for you... i will raise additional 10 catapults for the upcoming attack on the rebels.<br />
<br />
with those units and our lack of able commanders, i would suppose the following organization of the HMC:<br />
<br />
Maxius Veen (20)<br />
II.a (3 spearmen)<br />
II.b (2 horsemen)<br />
II.1 (10 legions, 3 horsearchers)<br />
<br />
Scrobius Pantonius (13)<br />
II.2 (10 legions, 3 horsearchers)<br />
<br />
Julius Aqaurius (15)<br />
II.3 (4 legions [half strength], 10 catapults)<br />
<br />
<br />
II.3 will be renamed into &quot;II.3 artillery division&quot;<br />
<br />
Now to the attack, i would suppose the following plan:<br />
II.1 and II.2 will be going to circle the enemy troops (in the city)<br />
II.3 will be standing behind the frontline, bombarding the enemy and preparing it for the attack<br />
II.1 and II.2 will then be attacking the enemy after the bombardment finished<br />
<br />
II.a will defend the command headquarters.<br />
II.b will have the special mission to capture or kill the leaders of the rebellion<br />
<br />
Any comments? Please notify me immediately... if i do not hear from you until tonite at 22:00 GMT latest(!) i will post the moovments and raisings.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
the 1/2 strength legions (4) will stay with the catapults in the background to defend them. no direct action will be taken by them. thus they will be healed after the next TC.</div></div><hr />
