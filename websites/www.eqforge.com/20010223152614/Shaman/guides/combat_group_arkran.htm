                  <p> Shamans are one of the most sought after classes for grouping, 
                    and it is not only because they can cast Spirit of Wolf. Shamans 
                    are powerful group members and can find a niche in any party. 
                    This is a guide for fulfilling your end of the grouping bargain.</p>
                  <h4><font color="#333366">Terms:</font></h4>
                  <p><b>Buff:</b> A spell that improves a statistic. Includes 
                    running speed, attack speed, and resistances<br>
                    <b>Debuff:</b> A spell that reduces a target's statistics<br>
                    <b>DD:</b> Direct Damage, a spell that does damage immediately 
                    after a successful casting<br>
                    <b>DoT:</b> Damage over Time, a spell that does some initial 
                    damage, but it will persist and harm the target at some interval 
                    (typically 6 or 20 seconds)<br>
                    <b>Lure:</b> the character in the group that brought the target 
                    back to the ambush site. In the case of camping, there is 
                    may not be a lure.<br>
                    <b>MOB:</b> Mobile enemy. Term traces to MUD origins.<br>
                    <b>Nuker:</b> my term for Wizards and the other DD casters. 
                    Druids make good nukers, as do magicians.<br>
                    <b>Shamans: </b>The dictionary plural for Shaman.<br>
                    <b>Stat:</b> statistic or statistics. The seven basic statistics 
                    are STRength, STAmina, DEXterity, AGIlity, WISdom, INTelligence, 
                    CHaRisma, but Armor Class, Hit <br>
                    Points, Mana, and the five resistances are included.<br>
                    <b>Tank:</b> the character you want the MOB attacking. Typically 
                    a heavily armored warrior, paladin, or shadowknight.</p>
                  <h3><br>
                    <font color="#333366">The Shaman's Role</font></h3>
                  <p>The Shaman can fulfill almost any role in a group. Shamans 
                    have decent HP and AC (until L25 anyway) which allows them 
                    to tank. A variety of spell selections allow them to operate 
                    as healer, direct damage, or any of assortments of other tactics. 
                    In almost all cases, the Shaman's selection of Buffs will 
                    be greatly appreciated by all group members.</p>
                  <p>When joining a party of unknown adventurers, you should make 
                    them know what tactics you will be using. You know your style 
                    and your spell list, while they do not. The other members 
                    may be assuming you are a healing machine when you are just 
                    not capable of it, or they may want you to just blast away, 
                    when your DD is limited. It is up to you to pick your role 
                    and fill them in.</p>
                  <p>The following roles are typical strategies a shaman could 
                    use in battle. These are suggested methods only, and it is 
                    by no means a complete list. Some of these strategies may 
                    not be appropriate from your perspective on role-playing, 
                    or you may simply be uncomfortable with the style. Use whichever 
                    ones you wish, but I suggest you at least try them all once.</p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">The Shaman as Buffer</font></h4>
                  <p>Shaman stat buffs are beyond compare. Shamans can buff str, 
                    dex, agi, sta, chr, AC, HP, and all the resistances. Shamans 
                    also get running speed and attack rate buffs.</p>
                  <p>The problem is in choosing which ones to cast and which to 
                    let slip. The larger the group, the fewer buffs you can keep 
                    up, so pay attention to what each class can do so you can 
                    offload some of the buffs.</p>
                  <p>Clerics get AC buffs that are on par or exceed the Shamans 
                    AC buffs. Let them Holy Armor and don't waste the mana on 
                    Turtle Skin (even though Turtle has a longer duration). Clerics 
                    also get HP buffs that Shamans never see. Paladins can also 
                    offload the AC buffs, but if there is a choice, let them use 
                    their HP buff while the Shaman does AC.</p>
                  <p>Druids have AC buffs that match the Shaman buffs. Rangers 
                    can offload Feet of Cat in the mid-teens. Even when Spirit 
                    of Cat becomes available, it is better for the Shaman to Spirit 
                    Strength all targets and the Ranger Feet of Cat, than for 
                    the Shaman to just cast Spirit Strength OR Spirit of Cat on 
                    everyone.</p>
                  <p>With these offloaded, the Shaman can then concentrate on 
                    Str and Sta for the tanks and Dex for the archers and rogues. 
                    Dex on casters helps their casting too, so don't leave them 
                    out.</p>
                  <p>Charisma is an underestimated buff on Shamans. It will lower 
                    your chance to be resisted and may decrease your fizzle rate. 
                    The mage classes are also pondering whether Chr increases 
                    your chance to resist enemy spells as well. So, you should 
                    first buff yourself with a charisma buff, if you have one. 
                    (At the worst, it improves your selling and buying prices 
                    with vendors.)</p>
                  <p>The non-combat buffs are far more vital, though. Spirit of 
                    Wolf not only helps the group, but also can net you some small 
                    profit. Serpent Sight (Infravision) is an amazing spell and 
                    worth the trouble of finding if you group with the three human 
                    races. Invisibility vs. Animals is nice for outdoors areas 
                    where no one is capable of casting an invisibility spell. 
                    For a PvP, Spirit Sight (See invisible) can be vital.</p>
                  <p>The general rule for effectiveness is that the higher level 
                    you are from a spell, the less effective it is. The strength 
                    and agility buffs definitely need to be replaced at level 
                    19.</p>
                  <p>Since you must pick and choose buffs in larger groups to 
                    minimize downtime, pay attention to what people want or what 
                    they should have. Don't waste Strength on a wizard or Charisma 
                    on a tank. When there is a choice (Strength vs. Agility for 
                    the tank), let the tank choose. The tank will be happier that 
                    way. A smart tank will swap between your buffs to decide which 
                    is more effective.</p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">The Shaman in Melee</font></h4>
                  <p>The Shaman is not great in melee combat. The class is effective 
                    at early levels, but at level 15, other classes get Double 
                    Attack, Dual Wield, and other damaging skills. Shamans get 
                    Dodge -- an ability other classes get at levels 4 to 10. Coupled 
                    with the -1 Combat skill per level versus fighter types, even 
                    basic attacking becomes progressively more difficult. But, 
                    at early levels, Shamans can do a not too bad job of killing 
                    things.</p>
                  <p>Hotkey Slam. It is most effective at early levels, but resurrects 
                    at level 20 where it stuns the target. </p>
                  <p>There are two thoughts on weapon selection: one handed and 
                    two handed. For group combat, the Shaman does not need a shield 
                    because he is seldom the target. If one is not being attacked, 
                    one does not need armor. A shaman should maximize his damage 
                    per round. This could mean a one handed weapon, like the morningstar, 
                    but a two handed hammer is almost as effective as a halberd. 
                    Experiment and see what you like best. It really comes down 
                    to personal preference.</p>
                  <p>Where the Shaman is operating as tank, a shield is almost 
                    mandatory. Tanks require defense to stay alive, not offensive 
                    hitting power. Note that the complete lack of taunt reduces 
                    the Shaman's ability to turn opponents away from undesired 
                    targets and back to the Shaman. If the Shaman is tanking, 
                    there are going to be wizards and magicians doing damage a 
                    lot faster than your measly little two handed hammer. So, 
                    take the AC improvement from the shield and ignore your melee 
                    damage.</p>
                  <p>One more thought: Frenzy. This spell can turn a Shaman back 
                    into a decent melee fighter. It confers an improved regeneration 
                    rate, double attack, and stat increases. There is also the 
                    suggestion it confers an attack speed increase.</p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">The Shaman as Healer</font></h4>
                  <p>At early levels, this is often the Shaman's primary capacity. 
                    Shaman healing spells don't seriously drop off against Clerics 
                    until level 14, where Clerics get Healing, and Shamans are 
                    still stuck with Rank 3 Light Healing. There are some general 
                    rules, though, when acting as healer.</p>
                  <p>1) Save your mana. If you are healer and no one needs healing, 
                    why add to downtime by using DD? Let the meleers kill the 
                    MOB, and be proud to say, &quot;Full Mana&quot; at the end 
                    of the fight so they can go bring back more enemies to kill.<br>
                    2) Be careful whom you heal. A Lure may be badly damaged in 
                    the MOB's initial rush, but a Taunting tank (paladin, shadowknight, 
                    and ranger) can switch the MOB's target permanently. If the 
                    MOB switches and stays that way, why heal the Lure? The threat 
                    is gone, so don't worry. At worst, tell the Lure to just back 
                    off and get out of the fight. <br>
                    3) When in doubt Heal. The amount of damage taken by the MOB 
                    is not always instantly reported on your group display, nor 
                    is the PC's damage instantly reported. This can put a healer 
                    in a bad situation where the MOB is iffy. You've got the mana, 
                    so heal. There's no sense holding back in case the MOB isn't 
                    really hurting the PC much -- the alternative is death.</p>
                  <p>Get close to the MOB's target and watch the damage reports, 
                    don't rely on the health bars in red MOB fights. Watching 
                    the damage scroll can reveal a lot about the battle's skew, 
                    and can report when Debuff's have worn out.<br>
                    <br>
                    One thing to remember about Healing: it is NEVER resisted. 
                    You can be hitting the biggest, ugliest, red con you ever 
                    met, but your mana is JUST as efficient in healing as it was 
                    when you fought the blue cons. DD is resisted or reduced, 
                    and can be a complete waste of mana in those really big fights.</p>
                  <h4> <font color="#663300">The Shaman as De-buffer</font></h4>
                  <p>At Rank 2 and 4, the shaman gets some nice and effective 
                    de-buffing spells. The Drowsy line of spells is extraordinarily 
                    effective when they are first gained. These can greatly reduce 
                    the amount of damage given and taken. The party may not recognize 
                    this, so show them.</p>
                  <p>Malise (Rank 5) is a Resistance de-buffer that hits four 
                    of the five statistics for 20% reductions. It is a powerful 
                    spell and will make all the offensive casters grin. If a MOB 
                    will be taking significant casting damage or effects, then 
                    cast this as the first spell when combat begins. It will not 
                    typically draw a MOB to you, since it does no damage.</p>
                  <p>De-buffers are most effective early in the fight; so, cast 
                    them as soon as the MOB is in range, but if they are resisted, 
                    move on to something else. </p>
                  <p>De-buffers can be intermixed with other styles. Since they 
                    are not overly expensive, they can leave the Shaman at 80% 
                    mana, which is plenty to heal or cast Direct Damage with.</p>

                  <p><b>1. The Bigger They Are The Harder They Fall -</b> This 
                    is the statement from which you should base all your Debuffing. 
                    It is your job to seek out the most snarlingly vicious MOB 
                    from the lure and turn him into a mewling kitten. </p>
                  <p><b>2. The Second Biggest -</b> Nothing tricky about this 
                    one. If you are faced with more than one snarlingly vicious 
                    MOB, turn him into a kitten too.</p>
                  <p><b>3. Let Me Cast Darn You -</b> By opening with the drowsy 
                    line, the need to taunt a MOB off the Shaman is low. The MOB's 
                    attacks should be spread out enough for the caster to get 
                    in a spell without being interrupted. Good time to root and 
                    run.</p>
                  <p><b>4. Debuffs is Gud -</b> Debuffs are one the most powerful 
                    spells you have at your disposal. Use them often.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">The Shaman as Nuker</font></h4>
                  <p>So, you want to be a Wizard? Well, you can be, at least at 
                    some levels. Frost Rift is very effective at early levels 
                    and Spirit Strike makes a wonderful replacement. But there 
                    are times when the Direct Damage spells just aren't worth 
                    the casting time. Do not pretend to be a Wizard all the time.</p>
                  <p>Since Shamans have lots of HP and good AC, Shamans can cast 
                    DD spells early in a fight. If the MOB switches to the Shaman 
                    as a target, no serious harm done, Shamans can take it, at 
                    least until a taunter takes the MOB back. Just be wary, if 
                    the MOB switched once, it will likely switch on the next casting, 
                    too, so be prepared to wait for the taunter to build up some 
                    enmity. Casting just after the MOB turned will usually result 
                    in a Frenzy situation where the Tank is no longer the target 
                    and the MOB has taken an unhealthy interest in the Shaman.</p>
                  <p>It is generally a waste to spend mana on DD'ing fleeing MOB's. 
                    It has been suggested that the most effective use of mana 
                    is to make the MOB start to flee, not to kill it while it 
                    runs helplessly. Once it is running, it isn't attacking anyone 
                    anymore, so it is in no danger of killing anyone. Spending 
                    the mana on Root may seem like a good idea, but the rooted 
                    target goes back to melee when immobile, so suddenly the purpose 
                    of its flight is gone.</p>
                  <p>Shamans DD spells are mana inefficient compared to Wizard, 
                    Druid, and Magician spells; however, Shamans are effective 
                    from sheer mass destruction. Spirit Strike maximum damage 
                    exceeds all Magician damage spells at Rank 4, but where Spirit 
                    Strike is close to 1:1 maximum damage to mana ratio, the Magician 
                    DD spell of that rank is 1.3:1. The Magician quickly gains 
                    the upper hand again at level 16, but 75 damage is a lot for 
                    a very long time.</p>
                  <p>The problem with DD is that it often really doesn't save 
                    much. If your spell does full damage, it could end the combat 
                    one round shorter. Really, is that worth it? If the tanks 
                    are doing 75 between them each round, and the MOB does only 
                    70 to one tank, you waste Spirit Strike with 75 mana to maybe 
                    end combat one round earlier, which prevents 70 damage at 
                    most. For 75 mana, you could heal 75-105 with Light Healing
                  (unresisted&#133;)! But now, by Spirit Striking, everyone 
                    has to sit on their duffs waiting on you to Meditate, heal 
                    them, and meditate some more for the next fight. And all the 
                    while the buff clocks wind down&#133;</p>
                  <p>There are times to try to blow things up, and times to let 
                    the tanks do their job. Learn when to avoid wasting your
                  mana.</p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">The Shaman as Temp Buffer</font></h4>
                  <p>This section is theoretical, as the author has not thoroughly 
                    tested this style. It comes purely from the change in Str. 
                    vs. damage at Level 20. At that level, it has been suggested 
                    that for every 10 points of Strength over 100 a character 
                    has, maximum damage on a single blow be increased by 1. At 
                    level 19, Rank 5, the Shaman receives Spirit Strength -- a 
                    Buff that adds 16 and more to the Str stat.</p>
                  <p>For Trolls, Ogres and Barbarians, the +16 strength can translate 
                    into +2 direct damage, since they all have natural strengths 
                    above 100. But what of the weaker races? This buff on weaker 
                    races will only get them to 100, and confers no maximum damage 
                    bonus.</p>
                  <p>At Rank 4, Shamans get Burst of Strength: an 18 second stackable 
                    Buff that confers +20 Str, +10 Dex, and +9 AC. This coupled 
                    with Spirit Strength confers +36 strength or more on a target. 
                    There are few fighter types that will remain below 100 with 
                    that bonus.</p>
                  <p>Who to use this on? Well, damage bonus goes hand in hand 
                    with attack rate, not weapon damage. Basically, if someone 
                    is attacking 4 times a round, then the damage bonus is multiplied 
                    by four, but someone attacking two times a round, the bonus 
                    is multiplied by two. So, someone with dual wield, double 
                    attack, and a combat attack can use the strength to greater 
                    effect than someone can with just a big old hammer. (It is 
                    currently known that monks derive their damage from their 
                    level and/or skill, not from their strength. This technique 
                    will NOT work on them unless they are using weapons. Weapon 
                    wielding monks are a rare sight for good reason. If you see 
                    a monk with weapons at level 19, ignore them if they try to 
                    group with you.)</p>
                  <p>So, prioritize attackers with two fast weapons, not one big 
                    one. That means forget about you for the Burst. Certainly 
                    Spirit Strength yourself, but use the Burst on rogues, rangers, 
                    and dual wielding warriors. Paladins and shadowknights are 
                    secondary targets, unless they decide to go with a fast weapon 
                    and not the two-handed swords and halberds they commonly select. 
                    Shamans and Clerics are tertiary targets, and given the short 
                    duration, by the time you can cast it on one, the early castings 
                    have worn off. (Burst of Strength has a long recovery time 
                    where it will not be castable while other spells will be.) 
                    And you can pretty much forget about mage types, their strength 
                    is too low to be helped with this trick, and their attack 
                    is too low to get much extra damage. Paladins and Clerics 
                    already assist this technique by casting Yaulp on themselves.</p>
                  <p>An addition to this trick is to also have the Rank 2 spell 
                    Fleeting Fury (which adds 15 Str). During the long recovery 
                    on the Burst of Strength spell, Fleeting Fury could be cast 
                    on a second character. Careful examination of stats could 
                    reveal a character with a Str ending in 6, which would benefit 
                    no more from 20 strength than 15.</p>
                  <p>As this particular tactic is currently theoretical only, 
                    the authors do not guarantee success. The readers are recommended 
                    to test this tactic on their own, and to report their findings.</p>
                  <p><b>Note:</b> Shamans are the only class capable of this trick. 
                    The Clerical Yaulp series is self-only and Druids do not have 
                    a short duration boost spell at all. Only Shamans can provide 
                    this cheap combat assist to other characters.</p>

                  <h3><font color="#333366">Tactical Guide to Grouping</font></h3>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">Pre-Combat Strategies (Buffing strategies)</font></h4>
                  <p>There are a couple different situations for pre-combat.</p>
                  <p><b>1. Spawn Breaker - </b>This is the mother of all pre-combat. 
                    This will be extremely draining for The Shaman. The Shaman 
                    must buff all of the Tanks, Backup Tanks, and himself to full. 
                    Start with yourself first, so that you may use the Timer strategy. 
                    The healer and nuker should receive defensive buffs as well, 
                    depending on the type of fight. This is an important time 
                    to offload buffing if possible to members who can cast similar 
                    spells. This buffing strategy can also be called the Handshake, 
                    because you can use your incredible powers of buffing to delight 
                    and amaze a new group. Magic Resist buffs to the Lure as applicable. 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>2. Timer - </b>This is a common strategy used by shamans, 
                    usually in accordance with the Spawn Breaker. By buffing yourself 
                    first, you can tell when your buffs are running out, and buff 
                    everyone else to whatever you think is needed at the time. 
                    This makes the transition to other buffing strategies almost 
                    seamless. When hunting outdoors with SoW, cast SoW first on 
                    yourself, then on any non-luring tanks, then on the casters 
                    and healers, and finally on the Lure. This gives the Lure 
                    maximum warning that SoW will soon drop. Casting on the non-Luring 
                    Tanks is the Lure's best warning, because they won't be staring 
                    at a spellbook.</p>
                  <p><b>3. Gravy Train -</b> This is the non-stop fighting style 
                    used by many groups, where you have one or more people luring 
                    to a constant source of blue mobs. These mobs usually come 
                    alone or as many as 5. In this situation, you will NEVER be 
                    full on mana, so you must choose wisely. I usually fully buff 
                    the tank and myself (Timer.) I only give the backup tanks 
                    offensive buffs (STR and DEX.) This assures that the massive 
                    number of blue mobs will continue to die as fast as possible. 
                    Usually, only the Lure gets SOW, but hopefully you can offload 
                    it. If I get extra mana, I usually hand out quickness. If 
                    I get even more I place defensive buffs on the Backup Tanks. 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>4. Adventure -</b> This is the mixed bag of fighting. 
                    You don't really know what surprise the Lure will bring next. 
                    For safety reasons (and usually long rest times) I buff the 
                    three tanks and myself to full. I prefer to err on the side 
                    o safety. Endure/Resist Magic is a good addition to here, 
                    at least on the Lure to avoid those nasty Root problems.</p>
                  <p><b>5. Sneak -</b> This is an attempt by a group to get by 
                    a group of tough MOB's (or a bunch of green MOB's) to the 
                    treasure that lies below. This is a good time to lay that 
                    Endure/Resist Magic on everyone so in case you need to make 
                    use of the SOW, you don't get rooted. Full defensive buffs 
                    (at least HP for the mage types), and applicable resist Fire/Ice/Disease/Poison 
                    if you know what you are up against. Spirit Sight, and Invisibility 
                    round out this strategy. Hopefully, you have a bard to reduce 
                    the randomness of the Invis spell. However, a group's ability 
                    to stay within the range of a bard's song seems to be equally 
                    random. (*sigh*) </p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">In Combat Tactics</font></h4>
                  <p><b>1. Mana Management -</b> No one likes a shaman with no 
                    mana. The last thing your Tank wants to do is run back to 
                    the group frantically pressing his &quot;HEAL ME NOW OR I 
                    WILL DIE, COME BACK AND HAUNT YOU, YOU MANALESS BASTARD!&quot; 
                    hot key over and over. You will not make many friends this 
                    way. As a shaman, you will have to realize that people see 
                    you primarily as a source of heals. Few understand the power 
                    of your buffs until higher levels. Some never understand. 
                    This is because at lower levels, extra strength didn't really 
                    make a difference other than to carry more loot. IMO, our 
                    buffs didn't really do much at all at lower levels. At high 
                    levels, the difference is still subtle, but I think people 
                    realize it now. So, don't ever go OOM (Out Of Mana), unless 
                    it is at the end of a long battle, and you have no choice. 
                    I personally try to stay above 60 percent. This keeps he from 
                    entering a group buffing everyone, and then they ask &quot;mana?&quot; 
                    and I have to say &quot;OOM&quot;. Having everyone all dressed 
                    (buffed) up with no where to go doesn't really work either. 
                    Now in a long fight, let's say you go OOM. You have two choices 
                    -- Melee or Meditate. Personally, I meditate. Usually because 
                    my tanks frantically scream &quot;GO MED!&quot; over and over 
                    until I do. But, if there is an extra MOB that I can run around 
                    (notice I didn't say fight) I might aggravate him to chase 
                    me.</p>
                  <p><b>2. Slam -</b> slam is an indispensable skill whenever 
                    you encounter rival spell casters, because its ability to 
                    stun will interrupt their casting. Strangely enough, you could 
                    often be the only person in your group with the ability to 
                    interrupt enemy casters, as tanks usually forgo bash in order 
                    to dual wield or hold a two handed weapon.</p>
                  <p><b>3. Timing -</b> Healing at the beginning of a fight, especially 
                    against multiple intelligent MOBs, is a sure way to attract 
                    unwanted attention. This is always the dilemma on a bad lure. 
                    A bad lure in this case can be described as the Lure dropping 
                    below three bubbles of health. This almost guarantees that 
                    you will have to heal early in a tough fight against multiple 
                    attackers.</p>
                  <p><b>4. Be My Friend -</b> Befriend Animal is a great and highly 
                    underestimated spell. Learn how to use it to effectively remove 
                    two MOB's from the battle. Befriend one animal and have it 
                    attack something that is not directly engaged with a tank 
                    at the time (Not one of the tanks targets) This is a highly 
                    mana efficient spell, especially because NPC's tend to do 
                    a lot more damage than PC's, and it keeps two attackers from 
                    doing damage to you party. This will hopefully apply to the 
                    Charm spell if the remove the level limit.</p>
                  <h3><font color="#333366">Combat Tactics</font></h3>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">Ping pong or Monkey in the Middle 
                    (2 casters)</font></h4>
                  <p>The nuker version of this tactic involves two casters. They 
                    stand a long distance apart (max spell range typically) and 
                    one lures a MOB with a DD spell. The MOB attacks the nuker 
                    that hit it first, so he stops casting. The other wizard now 
                    blasts away until the MOB switches targets. It now has a long 
                    run to get to the new target. The old target waits until the 
                    MOB is almost on the second target, then casts again. The 
                    MOB will likely switch targets again and runs back. Eventually, 
                    the MOB has spent a long time running and very little time 
                    attacking. The danger is Frenzy. The MOB may decide to not 
                    switch targets, but instead stick to killing one. If this 
                    is the case, the other caster Roots the MOB and the pair run 
                    for the zone.</p>
                  <p>The Shaman/Cleric version of this is a little more dangerous, 
                    but a lot more fun. Close the range. You can take the damage, 
                    so add melee damage to the mix. As the MOB switches between 
                    targets, you still get safe castings off. Some of the damage 
                    will heal while you meditate, anyway. Remember to stand on 
                    opposite sides of the MOB so you can tell which character 
                    it is attacking.</p>
                  <p>Even in larger parties, you will often be forced to use this 
                    tactic. You will most likely be fighting in dungeon where 
                    engaging a single enemy becomes a rare event. The healers 
                    will often have to heal the Lure early in the fight because 
                    of the large number of enemies attacking him. The healers 
                    can then ping-pong multiple enemies by trading or timing heals 
                    until the backup tanks can get the battle under control.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">Double Dragon (Shaman and tank)</font></h4>
                  <p>This is your basic two-member team - a healer and a tank. 
                    The tank can be a warrior (common for low levels for barbarians), 
                    a rogue, a paladin, a shadowknight (common for trolls and 
                    ogres), monk, or a ranger. Each tank type has its own abilities, 
                    so you need to select spells accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Whichever tank you have, <b>ALWAYS</b> get behind the MOB. 
                    Attacking from behind improves your chance to hit it. It also 
                    clarifies the MOB's current target.</p>
                  <p>If you want to stop being the target, then stop attacking 
                    it. No, I'm serious. Stop hitting it and let the tank catch 
                    up to your damage. Sometimes, you can wait a moment and back 
                    up slightly to see if the MOB is in the &quot;not certain 
                    who I should hit so I'll keep attacking the old target&quot; 
                    phase. Just because a MOB is attacking you doesn't mean the 
                    MOB will follow you. The longer you wait to disengage, the 
                    less likely the MOB will follow you.</p>
                  <p>But, above all, <b>DON'T PANIC</b>! If you or the tank starts 
                    running away panicking and crying, &quot;help help help&quot; 
                    no one can do anything to help you, because:<br>
                    a) The MOB is hiding you from someone trying to select you<br>
                    b) You run around so fast the tank types trying to catch the 
                    MOB can't follow your erratic path<br>
                    c) You run out of the range of spells.<br>
                    Remember the two second rule: you must be motionless for two 
                    seconds before casting (really high channeling can help with 
                    this), so a healer following you to cast healing can't do 
                    squat while you run around. Besides, the MOB is outrunning 
                    you anyway. If you can't make the zone, standing and trusting 
                    to luck is your only hope.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366">Class Specifics:</font></b></p>
                  <p>When with a <b>Warrior</b>, you have no choice but to heal. 
                    Start early and keep at it. The MOB can out-damage your healing 
                    at certain levels, so be careful. Once the MOB is down in 
                    HP, you can DD it and when the MOB turns, the Warrior is no 
                    longer getting hit. This splits up the damage and makes you 
                    both more effective.</p>
                  <p><b>Rogues</b> do not have taunt, but they have something 
                    almost as good: backstab. They will obviously use that skill 
                    early in combat. If it fails, you can expect them to back 
                    off, hide and try again. Once it succeeds, you can expect 
                    to never be the target again. Have root ready so the Rogue 
                    can flee if you can't turn the MOB's attention back to yourself 
                    in emergencies.</p>
                  <p>A <b>Monk's </b>special attacks also act as taunts; however, 
                    in the authors' opinions, they just are not as effective as 
                    a true taunt skill. In this case, it is best to save your 
                    mana for late in the combat. If the MOB is doing heavy damage, 
                    you will not take it as well as Monks, so you can't afford 
                    to be the target too long. Monks rely more on their skills 
                    (dodge, block, etc.) to avoid damage than on armour to absorb 
                    it. Since you can and probably will be wearing banded, you 
                    may actually be a better target by times, but it will stop 
                    your casting. It is not safe to take on heavy yellows with 
                    Monks if your healing spells are old. Have root ready so the 
                    Monk can flee if you can't turn the MOB's attention back to 
                    yourself in emergencies.</p>
                  <p><b>Paladins</b> can heal, so it is not a bad idea to attract 
                    the MOB's attention early. The Paladin can blow his mana healing 
                    himself while the MOB attacks you, then the Paladin taunts 
                    the MOB back, so you can heal him, too. Remember, you can 
                    back off and Root to double up on healing for a moment or 
                    two.</p>
                  <p>I have no experience with grouping with the <b>Shadowknight</b>, 
                    but I expect similar experiences to the Paladin. The Shadowknight 
                    matches Paladins in offence, but they can not heal. The Shadowknight 
                    does have DoT's and other nice spells, and they stack with 
                    the Shaman's more advanced versions. There is nothing like 
                    large DoT to speed combat to its conclusion.</p>
                  <p><b>Rangers</b> are great to hunt with. They can track the 
                    MOB down quickly; they pack DD and healing, camouflage, and 
                    a couple buffs. You can either follow them to the MOB, or 
                    he can pull the MOB back to you: choose your own style (/follow 
                    probably makes the first method a lot more viable now). Rangers 
                    can also taunt, and have good AC.</p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">A Shaman and His Pet</font></h4>
                  <p> This strategy works for you and your pet (pet or any of 
                    the warrior classes.) This is a slow way to kill MOB's but 
                    good for waiting for a group or killing rare spawns. Full 
                    buffs all around. Open the fight with the drowsy line, then 
                    disempower. Follow with all of your DOT's. Save the rest for 
                    heals. Try to jump in and out of the fight so that damage 
                    is spread around evenly.</p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">Airstrike (2+ casters with optional 
                    tanks)</font></h4>
                  <p><b>Simple tactic:</b> everyone capable of casting DD spells 
                    at a MOB does so. This hopefully knocks the MOB down to flight 
                    mode. Tanks hit the MOB as soon as they can.</p>
                  <p>The danger here is in the MOB turning on the casters. Why 
                    bother with a tank when everyone is out-damaging it? Considering 
                    spells lose effectiveness, a Shaman is not always capable 
                    of keeping up with his part of the damage.</p>
                  <p>When using this method, you will likely be using the Lure 
                    strategy (due to heavy med times). When choosing the Lure, 
                    you may want to choose an Enchanter. The Enchanter can cast 
                    Tashan (or Tashani) to lower MOB resistances, which helps 
                    everyone else in the party. If an Enchanter is not available, 
                    Shamans can use Malise if they are 19th level or above. Both 
                    of these spells are long lasting, whereas a MOB may heal some 
                    of the damage if you lure with DD. Choose DoT for long lure 
                    runs instead and hit with Malise when you reach the ambush 
                    site. (Note: Be careful when using a DOT on long lures. The 
                    tanks might end up taunting the MOB off a corpse. MOB's loath 
                    DoT spells.)</p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">Root and Shoot (Many casters and/or 
                    ranged weapon types)</font></h4>
                  <p>Lure or find a MOB and then Root it. Now, just blast away 
                    with ranged DD spells. The MOB may never get an attack in. 
                    This is a simple tactic with no Tank necessary. It involves 
                    a lot of meditation, so don't waste your time with anything 
                    but yellow MOBs.</p>
                  <p>Heavy caster parties are rare, but not just because casters 
                    are less popular classes. Red MOB's resist most of a caster's 
                    damage and this greatly reduces the caster's efficiency. If 
                    a caster party is going to take down reds, an enchanter with 
                    Tashan (or Tashani) or a Shaman with Malise is vital.</p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">Beat the Stuffing Out of 'Em (lots 
                    of tanks and a Shaman)</font></h4>
                  <p>In a tank heavy party, the Shaman should not have to be a 
                    healer until combat is over. Stay out of the fighting and 
                    play overwatch. Keep an eye out for wandering MOB's and an 
                    eye on the MOB situation. Take melee out of the equation so 
                    that you don't suffer from information overload. Prepare to 
                    Root a fleeing MOB.</p>
                  <p>While doing this, you MUST assign someone from the party 
                    to taunt all MOB's off you. You can not support if you can 
                    not cast, and a large tank party will be hitting groups of 
                    yellows, any one of which could waste you solo (AC dependent). 
                    If the assigned taunter does not notice your problem, tell 
                    him to get it off you. You NEED to support them, and that 
                    means you need to be uninterrupted. Do not be embarrassed 
                    about not being able to take care of the MOB, even a green 
                    one, yourself. You need to pay attention to too many things 
                    to worry about a minor MOB.</p>
                  <p>Look, I am serious on this one. A lot of dumb tanks will 
                    not understand your role, and will want you in on the fighting. 
                    Hang back and keep them alive. You are damage control, and 
                    you should be guiding the fight, not trying to hammer the 
                    MOB. You can see the entire situation, while the Tanks are 
                    watching ONLY the fight in front of them. Tell a badly damaged 
                    tank to pull out, cast Fleeting Frenzy or Burst of Strength 
                    on the MOB's current target. Watch for those wandering reds 
                    and tell the gang to go in a particular direction to avoid 
                    getting stomped. Heal and Root. In a Tank heavy group, YOU 
                    must be the commander. Anyone else can take over between fights, 
                    but you are the only one with all the information during combat. 
                    Keep moving and turning to keep a view on the battlefield: 
                    the tanks can't.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, for tank heavy parties SAVE YOUR MANA. You are 
                    the only one with serious downtime. You can heal them after 
                    the fight and be back in short order. Meanwhile, let the tanks 
                    hit blues to take out their frustrations, so long as the risk 
                    of MOB flight is low. (I would NEVER let anyone hit MOB's 
                    in Guk without a Rooter handy, but Beholder is very safe to 
                    take down some light blues quickly.) They get a little loot 
                    out of it, and they will not take any noticeable damage.</p>
                  <p>At high levels, this strategy doesn't change much at all. 
                    This is the kind of group that works well as a Gravy Train. 
                    Mana Management is key in a group like this. Make good use 
                    of Chloroplast/Regenerate. You shouldn't have to root. The 
                    bard/rangers should take care of that. Rangers/Paladin/Bards 
                    should take care of most of the downtime healing. Save your 
                    big heals for when they are needed in combat. </p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">When Things Go Wrong Or Time Out </font></h4>
                  <p>This is a good strategy when you have pulled more than you 
                    can handle, or even if you just want to reduce downtime. This 
                    strategy is simply rooting one or more MOB's so that they 
                    are out of melee combat. You can root a MOB out of the group 
                    on their incoming lure. You can DOT, or DD one so that is 
                    runs to your position and then root it. You can root in a 
                    general melee, and tell your group to &quot;back up&quot; 
                    (this one is hard to pull off with a group that isn't used 
                    to this tactic.) A good strategy to reduce the amount of damage 
                    your group takes in a battle is vital to long term grouping.</p>
                  <h3> <font color="#333366">Group Formation</font></h3>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">Large Group Tactics for the high 20' 
                    and Beyond (Ranolin)</font></h4>
                  <p> After lvl 15 a wise shaman will begin to notice that different 
                    classes have begun to grow in their special abilities. In 
                    time, this will lead to the specialization of tasks within 
                    a group. As a shaman, progresses in levels they will also 
                    notice that it become progressively more difficult to go it 
                    alone. Many will find that the larger groups are more effective 
                    and efficient. More healers mean less rest. More tanks means 
                    better distributed damage, and more damage dealt, etc, etc.</p>
                  <p>Many will argue over the ideal group formation but I am going 
                    to use the one that I most often encounter as an example for 
                    most of the scenarios.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#663300">Group Member 1:</font> The Tank/Lure 
                    -</b> This is the prime damage TAKER. Most likely they will 
                    also be responsible for luring, and getting pounded while 
                    they are doing it. A pure warrior does this best, since he 
                    wears the best armour and highest AC, has most of the damage 
                    avoidance skills, and has the best HP total.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#663300">Group Member 2:</font> Backup Tank 
                    - </b>This member is responsible for taunting off one or more 
                    of the enemies from the Lure. Any warrior class is good here, 
                    even those without taunt, because in a large lure monsters 
                    that have not yet been directly attacked will turn their focus 
                    to the first to attack them. An important member because they 
                    determine the damage distribution over the time of battle. 
                    You could almost say they set the pace of combat.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#663300">Group Member 3:</font> Backup Tank 
                    2 -</b> See Backup Tank. This is also a GREAT spot for a bard 
                    if you can find one. You have to love that mana regenerating 
                    song at lvl 32. That and their heal song cuts rest time in 
                    more than half. Plus, they make good Backup Tanks. </p>
                  <p><b><font color="#663300">Group Member 4:</font> Nuker - </b>This 
                    member prime focus will be the quick destruction of dangerous 
                    foes. They also make sure that you don't have any runners 
                    in dangerous situations. Great for taking out enemies that 
                    can heal, or nuke. This can be any of the pure caster types, 
                    a druid, or in a bind, a shaman or a cleric.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#663300">Group Member 5: </font>Healer -</b> 
                    They heal. Any priest-based class will do. Clerics are ideal 
                    at the higher levels due to Revive.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#663300">Group Member 6:</font> The Shaman 
                    (Healer Number 2) -</b> the most important addition to any 
                    group. Healing, Buffing, Debuffing, even a little melee and 
                    occasional nukes. </p>
                  <p>This is just a generally well-rounded group formation. It 
                    may not be the best, or the worst, but it is a good, solid, 
                    regular group.</p>
                  <h4><font color="#663300">General Group Formation (Arkand)</font></h4>
                  <p> <b>Team Leader:</b> Healer Class (Cleric, Druid, or Shaman). 
                    This character should control the ebb and flow of battle. 
                    The team leader should spend little to no time in battle, 
                    and should be the most observant member of the party. A good 
                    leader will direct people to deal with unexpected problems, 
                    will observe undesired MOB entry into the fight, and absolutely 
                    MUST be obeyed when he calls a Zone. You must trust your leader, 
                    or the whole structure falls.</p>
                  <p><b>The Lure: </b>This character should be a fighter class, 
                    and a Warrior may be the best for the position indoors. A 
                    ranger is best outdoors. The ranger's tracking will pick up 
                    a lot of undesirables in a dungeon, but outdoors, the ranger 
                    can find the desired target faster than any other class. No 
                    matter what class fills this position, the character must 
                    have the best familiarity with the terrain of any party member. 
                    If the character doesn't, teach him.</p>
                  <p><b>Melee Type: </b>This position is very target specific. 
                    Monks, rogues, and other fast dual wielders fill in against 
                    caster heavy MOB groups. For lone heavy hitters like crag 
                    spiders or mammoths, a double attacker does nicely. A paladin 
                    for extra healing also does nicely here, reducing your downtime.</p>
                  <p><b>Primary Caster:</b> Wizard, Druid, Magician, or Necromancer-- 
                    I prefer the first two, especially later. Their escape spells 
                    are vital, and their continent crossers can really move you.</p>
                  <p><b>Primary Healer:</b> Cleric. Later on, you want Revive. 
                    No one heals like a Cleric. They also have the best HP and 
                    AC buffs in the game. In a pinch, a Shaman or Druid will fill 
                    in.</p>
                  <p><b>Swing slot: </b>This slot swings depending on level and 
                    target. If the target is a lone heavy red MOB, you want an 
                    Enchanter for Tashan. Coupled with Malise, the other casters 
                    will suddenly see their effectiveness skyrocket. Against many 
                    blue MOB's, you want another melee type to pull the floating 
                    MOB's off the healers and casters. A bard can fill in very 
                    nicely here, regardless of situation.</p>
                  <p>Arkand's ideal party: Cleric, Shaman, Paladin, Warrior, Bard, 
                    and Wizard</p>
                  <p></p>
