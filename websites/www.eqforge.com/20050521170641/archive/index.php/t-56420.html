CT is gone and has left no successor. I am declaring myself Game Manager Pro Term to put some order into place. I have been made &quot;founder&quot; of the room by CT, showing my authority.<br />
And now for some declarations:<br />
[list=1]<br />
 I am no longer land manager. This job is now Civanators<br />
 The office of character manager no longer exists (reason is in 3)<br />
 we are reverting back to the player system. this will hopefully bring back people like Cyc and Donsig (and we all wish, Shai)<br />
 I am the law for now. Respect My Authoritay!<br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
So it has been writen, so it shall be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I shall keep my Possition as Conflict Manager and Aid Stuck in the transition.</div></div><hr />

Oh yea, order number 5:<br />
5) The Jedis are allowed back, now that we have Polytheism. They are allowed to use the Force, but no sabers until Electronics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds fair, The Jedis would have to use Colored Swords untill then. I have found a pair of Purple Swords for Mara and I :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW- Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

Reviving the old system will hopefully heal the wounds of this failing RPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GM- Glad to see you back. Now, how about an empire to make storys of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed.  If you check the Despot thread, I have created a new character in the likeness of Grandmaster von Aegir of DG2.  CG willing, I have every intention of rebuilding the Princedom of Vanir in this game (though with a different name of course. ;) )<br />
<br />
Any intentions of starting another artsy rebel uprising for me to put down with tear gas and rap music? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But of course!<br />
Cant use Dada this time, though. What about the Sturm unt Drang movement of the Baroque era? (check google)<br />
Basically, thats me as a strict group of artists.</div></div><hr />

:lol:.<br />

@GM - Looks like you and me would be the Major Story Tellers now :).</div></div><hr />

Perhaps a Wandering is in order?  An odyssey through the Egyptian warzone would be interesting, methinks. ;)</div></div><hr />

Everyone is free to join.  Just post a continuation of the previous post, and leave the end open for somebody to add to.  Easy as that. :)</div></div><hr />

Cool :). Luckly I have my Graduation cerimony to attend to tommorow :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 characters is optional. If people want to be one character, themselves, I wont stop them. And @boots- as for noms and elections, I dont see why not, as long as I ride out the rest of this term as Game Manager to make sure everything dosent fall apart. CG, could you throw the Noms up for me.<br />
and @GM- Sounds like fun. Liza DiSaaMuel would love to accompany you. (and we dont have to worry about kids!) SaaM DiSaaMeul will stay home and bring order to the rioting streets of Helenatica (have to keep Dis's characters till he gets back), and from that will arise the Disorganizer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Chapter One is posted.  Because I was anxious to start and was unable to talk with people before I started writing, I have begun the journey alone, but am not far into Egypt yet, so if you want to join just come on down the road and meet up with me. :)  Oh and watch your step on the way in, you don't want Egyptian on your shoes. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... we need a big event to jumpstart this. Like the siezing of Huntington in DG2. <br />
<br />
What about... an ISLAND! yes... a volcanic island comming up S of Russia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't make me kill you, SaaM. ;)</div></div><hr />
