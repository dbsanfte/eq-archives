I suggest moving the settler to the NE back to the buffalo and building a settler colony there. The SE settler might as well continue exploring and move to the jungle terrain (revealing more sqaures) and the archer should continue exploring SE. Already we have two turns without scientific research, we should really be thinking about getting a city in the next turn or two. Considering that this is deity the need for early scientific research cannot be stressed enough. The opening land may not be the best but it is more the capable of supporting a medium growth city.</div></div><hr />

I would, but I'm on someone elses laptop, and they have no image editing software.  It would be nice to have different colored dots for different possible overlays of specials.<br />

Two of them were gave pretty similar surroundings to us and are marked in dark-green on the map, and the third is not very good because that'd mean we are in the middle of a no-special area and is marked with orange. <br />
<br />
If we discover a special to the south and then east of the archer, all the green squares are true, if not - the closest special is the orange dot.<br />

EDIT: I see DVR beat me to it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the southern settler is standing in an acceptible position to build a city... If we'd want the northern settler also to build a city quickly, i think the grass square at the upper blue dot is the place..<br />
<br />
My idea would be to let the southern settler build a city where he stands, and the northern settler to move to the shielded-grassland square and build a rode onto it, while the archer explores some more terrain in the south-east..</div></div><hr />

http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads3/demo3900bc.jpg <br />
The numbers indicate how I think our units should be used, they include a turn number, a dot and to the right of the dot a number indicating the order in which the units should be moved within the turn in question. I'm taking possible resource locations into account.<br />
<br />
This means the first thing I'd like to be done is moving the archers unit SE to reveal terrain.<br />
<br />
Depending on what this reveals the 'southern settler' should either found a city immedately where it is (if something nice is revealed by the archers) or move (1.2). Also depending on what the archers reveal the 'northern settler' should either move NE and found a city there or SE to eventually found a city E or SE of the lake.<br />
<br />
Movement 2.2 is an interesting possibility since that city site may have access to specials and also the small lake means an inland city on its other side could build ships if desired and send them 'through' the coastal city. I also think we should found a city no later than following movement 2.2, the longer it gets delayed the farther behind the other civs we fall.</div></div><hr />

Thanks to the Duke who supplied the coordinates I was able to calculate the resource seed and pattern distribution. The red dots show the specials locations whilst the yellow dots show hut locations. This is a definate location diagram. What it does show is that there are two good city sites in range (opps I forgot to mark them!) One is located one space W then SW from the S Settler the other is one space E then SE from the same settler. It should be noted that the resource to the far left (that is in the ocean) is definately a fish resource. However it should be noted that this will unlikely be explorable wihtout a trieme. I would suggest going for the eastern city site. Although find out what resource is next to the archer first.<br />
<br />
Jayne if you are in any doubt about my calculations then move the archer (before the settler) directly SE. It will reveal a special.</div></div><hr />

Well, looking at your last post, you seem to have managed quite well :)<br />
I use paint to make the white lines, and paint shop pro to make the dots and to resize / crop the image with.. I don't know about the map seed, I used the map funxus provided before..<br />
No you do not need a webpage to display images, you can attach a file to your post just above the 'Submit Reply' button..<br />
<br />
The reason your image turned up with the Tripod logo is because the images on that server only work when you view em directly from a page on Tripod..<br />
There are free webhosts which do work as we want em to, i think spaceports.com does, not sure though since I haven't used it for quite some time..</div></div><hr />

Looking quickly at Shahadet's picture, the plains tile between inland lake and ocean looks good, since it'll have access to three specials.  Of couse, we don't know what those specials are...</div></div><hr />

What I need before tomorrow afternoon GMT is a concise list of where we need to move units, and where to found a city.<br />
<br />
:queen:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shahadet</div><div class="date">Mar 16, 2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for sorting that out Duke. I did try to upload it but I just got an error message saying it was not a valid jpeg!<br />
<br />
Octavian,<br />
<br />
Our land is situated on the fish resource backbone. The far-left ocean resource is definitely fish but as I have said before it may not become visible without a trireme, unless there is land that curves round. Also, upon closer inspection of the coastline by the archer I believe that the resource two squares SE of him will be ocean (fish). Knowing this I would use the archer to confirm my theory on the coastline then move the S settler to the eastern city point and move the N settler to the western city point where the settlers will both be able to found a city. In movement points this makes sense. Despit what terrain is found a city needs to be found soon because the next 3-4 resource spot is quite a few more turns away and we can't afford to be roaming around forever. ;) <br />
<br />
Below is a list of all possible outcomes for the resources:<br />
<br />
Fish<br />
Grassland<br />
Buffalo<br />
Pheasant<br />
Coal<br />
Gold<br />
Musk Ox<br />
Ivory<br />
Peat<br />
Gems<br />
Oasis<br />
<br />
The land does seem to be quite varied so I do not want to narrow down the possibilities. Already we have uncovered seven of the ten land types!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Mar 16, 2003, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either there or E than SE of southern settler? Maybe the terrain is better there, like less desert:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shahadet</div><div class="date">Mar 16, 2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Concerning the choice for first city site. Either site has potential, although it is yet to be seen as to what terrain emcompasses the SE city site(SEcs) . Having said that, we do not know that much more about the SW city site (SWcs). The one thing we do have going for the SEcs is the proximity of a explorer (archer). We could uncover the hidden land quickly with both the settler and the archer whilst the northern settler moves to the western city site (4 turns). I have a feeling that the SWcs may be surrounded by a lot of ocean squares which could present a growth problem, especially as we know that we are on fish tiles not whale tiles. <br />
<br />
Either way I am sure Dear Leader Jayne will make the right decision for the peoples empire!:D</div></div><hr />
