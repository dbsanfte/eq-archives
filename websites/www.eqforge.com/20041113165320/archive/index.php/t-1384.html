<br />
It is very far from completion yet and everything can still be changed or added. <br />
<br />
<br />
FALL WEISS<br />
<br />
Civ2 MGE scenario about the beginning of WW2 in Europe. <br />
<br />
Nations which are included into the scenario: Germany(+Slovakia), Poland, Soviet Union, Hungary, Rumania, Lithuania, Denmark(+Sweden). Only Germany and Poland are playable (playing as Russia is too easy). <br />
<br />
The map (quite big one &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif&quot; border=0&gt;) includes all Poland, Lithuania and Slovakia, most of Germany and Austria, some parts of Soviet Union, northern territories of Rumania and Hungary, and southern half of Denmark + a small part of Sweden. <br />
<br />
Scenario start from September 1 and end in October 31, 1939. One turn represents 1 day, so there are maximum 61 turns.<br />
Germany and Poland are in war from the beginning. In September 17, Soviet Union join the war, attacking Poland from east. <br />
<br />
There will be 3 versions of the scenario: German, Polish and Multiplayer. <br />
<br />
In German version you must take all objective cities before the end of the scenario.  <br />
In Polish version you must have at least one objective city in the end. <br />
Objective cities are Warszawa, Krakow, Lodz, Poznan, Lvov and Danzig. <br />

Germany kept it's airborne units in reserve until the attack on Norway in 1940. If the scenario functions like history, Poland hasn't got a fighting chance. I would eliminate the KV-1 from the Soviet OoB. It wasn't used until the begining of Barbarossa by the Soviets. Not seeing it was one of the reasons the Germans were so confident in 1941. They had no idea it existed. It could be an interesting situation, but really only from the German side. Civ-2 cannot simulate the mass confusion and disaray that ruined Poland's mobilization. Also, if the historical defense that Poland used (Fortify Western border), the Germans should be able to have the game won in the first two weeks of the attack.<br />

Here is thing what I always wonder: Germany attacked Soviet Union without having any intelligence about its military forces.

Yes, you are right that Germany didn't use paratroopers against Poland. I think that I put them far away from Polish borders and make them unbuildable. AI never moves paratroopers, it only paradrop them if there is empty enemy city in range. So they are not in the campaign unless Polish army invades into German territory http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/eek.gif <br />

The question of Soviet armor, the Germans were completly unaware that the Soviets had such advanced designs as the T-34 and KV-1. The first reported encounter with KV-1 was near the river Daugava, on June 25, 1941.The spearhead of the XLI Panzer corps, the 6th Panzer division, encoutered the Soviet III Armored Corps, which had KV-1s as part of their inventory. I have never heard of any Soviet Airborne units being used in a jump in the Polish attack. It would be unlikely anyway, as Poland's army was in dire straits from the German attack, when Stalin delievered the stab in the back to Poland.<br />

modern German army swept past the Polish defenses. By previous agreement, Russia shared in the <br />
invasion. Britain and France immediately declared war on Germany, and the British sent an army <br />
across the Channel. <br />
<br />
The conquest of Poland was over in less than a month. Germany annexed wide stretches of <br />
territory that had once been held by the Kingdom of Prussia. In the small territory left with the name <br />
Poland, the so-called &quot;General Government&quot; was an instrument of German domination. Anti-Jewish <br />
legislation was imposed across the country. Millions of Jews were herded into ghettos and <br />
eventually concentration camps. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact guaranteed the Soviets a free hand <br />
on the Baltic coast. Stalin's armies first imposed protectorates over the Baltic republics and <br />
occupied them with Soviet troops. Within a year, staged elections annexed the Baltics to the <br />
USSR. &quot;<br />

Yhe russians probably did not paradrop in Poland. If they did, they did it in such small numbers that the event wouldn't be relevant for the scenario.<br />
<br />
Marko, make sure you use antitank guns in the scenario. The Polish army did have 37mm anti tank guns capable of knocking out German tanks. They just hadn't them in large numbers. I also didn't see any german PAK. What about the Polish airforce? How about FLAK? <br />
<br />
Be warned that using this number of tank/armour car units might create a unbalanced, panzer heavy scenario. Make sure that a army is in proportion with it's historical operational strength at that time! Use the correct images for the different types of tanks. (ex: short barrelled pzIV kwk75/L24 instead of long barrelled pzIV kwk75/l43 or even L48.)<br />
<br />
Make sure to include Cavalry... etc...<br />
<br />

I jsut wnat to add that in history the polish airforce didn´t fly really long, only 14 days to be correct. Neverteheless, the germans lost a total of more than 150 planes destroyed or damaged, 0ver 80 per cent of the casualties from polish flak!!! Maybe a good way to simulate this wuold be to change city walls to flak defenses or create some kind of special FLAK unit for Poland in key places (invisible?!?). <br />
If you need any historical help, just e-mail me. Keep up the good work!!!<br />

[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
What kind of Howitzers do they mean? The same ones the germans used at sebastopol (Crimea)?<br />
<br />
Cavalry should be a general unit. The Polish did use them for sure. The germans had a cavalry division in the front line as late as Barbarossa and also later on in the war on the eastern Front. Germans used cavalry also for anti-partisan duty and in areas which where hard to manouver, like the Pripjet marches for instance. The russians used cavalry units throughout the war. The russians mostly did use cavalry for the fast exploits of breakthrougs in the german front line. They didn't really fight like cavalry in the sence of the old fashioned charge (they did occur sometimes though)Perhaps they should be named mounted infantry. They mostly used the horses for transport. <br />
<br />
The Polish cavalry did charge german tanks during Fall Weiss. They where massacred by the coax and bow-machineguns of the panzers. The last &quot;old fashioned&quot; cavalry charge took place on the Fillipines in the beginning of 1942, somewhere on the Bataan Peninsula. US-cavalry succesfully charged a advancing japanese unit, chased them out of a village and prevented a japanese force crossing some river. I don't know which village it was or which units were involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siggy</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2001, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps another suggestion for the scenario: Fall Weiss was a quite short operation during the war. If you do like a historical scenario, make sure that the players cannot build any new units. Just give them what they actually had and let them fight it. <br />
<br />
If this is to drastic you might want to let them build infantry or other basic units. Do not let the Polish player build too many tanks for instance. It will spoil the scenario...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably not.  The most famous mortar, Karl (60cm) did not fire at an enemy until the Russian campaign (Brest-Litovsk, Sevastopol, and 1944 Warsaw).  Likewise the 80cm railgun, Gustav.<br />
<br />
There are other guns that were available, but I couldn't find citations of their use.  A 21cm field piece was available early in the war, as was special chrome-vanadium steel ammunition that could penetrate 12 feet of reinforced concrete.  <br />
<br />
 Supplies of these shells were provided for battering through the fortifications on the Polish, French, and Russian frontiers.  They were not used as much as they were expected to be, due to reluctance to allow them to be fired incase dud specimens were recovered by the enemy; in any event, the Blitzkrieg managed to do without them....Ian Hogg<br />
<br />
A highly successful 28cm railgun, the 'Schlanke Bertha' was also available.  A link about this one can be found at http://www.cix.co.uk/~nrobinson/railgun/germany/  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps...sounds like a fun scenario topic!</div></div><hr />

I don't think such actions happened during the war. Not everybody is such Indiana Jones as you.<br />
<br />
Siggy, if you mean sth like bazooka or panzerfaust then I don't think that polish army had them in 1939, but i'm not any ww2 expert.<br />
<br />
About these railguns... How do you want to make in civ2 unit that will move only by rail? Do you even intend to use railroads in this scenario, Marko? I think they're a bit unrealistic.<br />
<br />
If scenario lasts to october 31 then I don't think if polish army could defend so long unless there is some possibility to avoid soviet aggression. In history, last of polish major cities to surrender were Lvov (22.09) and Warsaw (28.09).</div></div><hr />

I know them from WW1, they were called &quot;Big Bertha's&quot;. They were 40cm heavy arty or something like that, mounted on rail. In my opinion these nearly immobilized guns were not useful for german blitz-war tactics cause they needed time to be transported and be prepared to fire. And they could easily prisoned by some dugged in light 75mm field guns firing on the railroad tracks. So these heavy guns wouldn't have a chance to escape because of their own weight they needed good prepared railroadtracks.

They were cumbersome rifle like weapons (about 10mm-15mm caliber) which were used by infantry teams to fire at lightly armoured targets. The weapon fired solid armor piercing shot. It was a overal reliable and accurate weapon. Found some text-based evidence thet it was also used as Sniper rifle ( I found that a bit strange however; the thing is about 1,5 meter long...) I donnot know the effective range, depends on type and type of ammo used. <br />
<br />
Rexx, Railguns did exist during WWII. Germans used them as described above (Crimea, Warsaw 1944 and so on). Anzio Anny was a notorious railway gun used by the germans against the Anzio beachhead (Allies gave it it's nickname). It was (I think) a 28cm naval gun mounted on a big flatbed railway car. The targets were not as immobile as you think. It was common practise to rail the guns out of a tunnel, fire it once or twice, and rail them back in. If there wasn't a nice tunnel nearby, they protected the gun by other means of camouflage and offcourse by numerous light and heavy Flak batteries. They were no easy targets. Low flying aircrafts would be very vulnerable to light Flak, high flying aircraft would have big difficulties finding the targets and hitting a relatively small target like this. <br />

Is anyone still working on this scenario?</div></div><hr />

I can't really tell one tank from the other, and despite having an interest in the war as a historical event I really don't know it in THAT much detail.<br />
<br />
 But on a side note, which I feel forced to express due to my swedish heritage ( not really, but I guess that's why I thought about it at all ) is the Denmark (+Sweden) thing, as one of the playable nations. Assuming a purely hypothetical scenario in which the germans would turn on Denmark ( say during the battles against Poland, or some such ) that would mean Sweden would align with Denmark against the Germans ( seeing as how they'd be one Civ in the scenario ) which is slightly &quot;unbeliavable&quot;, seeing as how the only thing the Swedish nation ever did with/against the Germans was to bend over politically and let the German troops swoosh through the country and invade Norway. So I doubt Sweden had much to do with Denmark during the &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; period either. <br />
<br />
 Just a thought, though...<br />

I was in India, Kashmir - actually quite near to Afganishtan, didn't see any Taliban people, though :)  No Internet connection but I could play Civ 2 and worked with TSFE upgrade. <br />
<br />
I decided that Fall Weiss will be Civ 3 scenario because it seemed pointless to design a new Civ 2 scenario when supposedly superior Civ 3 is so close. :crazyeyes <br />
<br />
Now, as it is clear that there is no place for scenarios in Civ 3, all my next scenarios will be for Civ 2. At least in foreseeable future. <br />
<br />
I shall start serious work with Fall Weiss when TSFE 1.2 is out. <br />
The main question is now will it be for Civ2:MGE or ToT? <br />
Test of Time is superior engine in scenario design aspect (much more event possibilities, more units, better AI etc) but it seems to have too few users. :confused: <br />
<br />
Lets make it clear! Quite many people are waiting Fall Weiss. But how many of you will play it if it is for Civ2:ToT?</div></div><hr />

IMHO, you answer your own question - if you want your hard work to pay off, MGE is the only choice as too few people have ToT (I have both though ;) )</div></div><hr />

In fact, I even made a few units for it (polish side). They are mostly based on units from captain nemo and alex mor. There are also a few units included wich are entirely made by them, but I think they will fit in greatly in your scenario. <br />
<br />
Here is a good site about the polish war:<br />
<br />
http://mops.uci.agh.edu.pl/~rzepinsk/1939/index2.htm<br />
<br />
If you like my units, you can ofcourse use them freely, if you don't like 'em, well, see for yourself.<br />
<br />
I've made a few other units as well, if anyone is interested in units from the american civil war or the aztecs, just say it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gukguk</div><div class="date">Nov 10, 2001, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you may ofcourse use them. If you need more infantry units of any side, just say what kind of unit, and I'll make it for ya.</div></div><hr />

So, much is yet to be done, especially for polish side. I think that I can deal with all these tank and aircraft units. But I have trouble with units involving infantry in some form. I have always used mostly Nemo's units in these cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
cavalry: I made two different ones, see for yourself wich one to use<br />
<br />
anti-tank gun: Nemo made a beautiful one for red front, I included it. If you want a different one I'll try to make a new one.<br />
<br />
105mm gun: I've never made artillery, but I wanna try. If you could show me a picture of it I will make it<br />
<br />
AA gun: you can use Nemo's one, or the edited (by Case, if I remember correctly) version. If both do not resemble what you want it to be, explain what you want and I'll create it.<br />
<br />
Armored Car: sorry, can't help you here</div></div><hr />

You remember correctly :)<br />
<br />
Here's all the amroured cars I've seen. I've also included the graphic that I'm using to represent the old German battleships (which served off Poland) in 'The Cruel Sea 2.0'. The high resolution armoured cars are taken from Tim Smith's Highres modpack.</div></div><hr />

It would also look good if polish units were faced west, and german east.<br />

BTW: Do you include any special events in the game?</div></div><hr />

Good luck with creating units, I'm sure you can do it far better than I, since its not as difficult as most people think.</div></div><hr />

TSFE takes now most of my time. Making the Light Edition for it right now. As fast as I finish it I shall continue with Fall Weiss.</div></div><hr />
