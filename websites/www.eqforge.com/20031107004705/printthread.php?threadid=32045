<p><b> Screenshot of the Day #17: Epic Battlefield</b></p>

<p>Today's screenshot of the day illustrates the importance of having a strong military, even if you don't plan to invade other civs. Without a strong military, your words and your borders don't mean a thing! Other Civs will enter and leave your territories at will and you are too scare to demand them to leave your territory at once. <br />
<br />
<font color="brpwn">This is a classic screenshot of what it means to survive in a Deity game, in which the Persians and Chinese fight a war against one another with tons of units in my territory. For the curious, I should mention that I destroyed the Persians about 50 turns later. You can find the full story of this game on my website. </font><br />

<p>No offense to Thunderfall, but what he typed really wasn't the point of the screenshot at all. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> The point is that in a Deity game you have to lie low in the early game, allow the other civs to walk all over your territory, let them fight massive battles near your cities, and so on in the hopes that you can catch them later after they waste hundreds of shields fighting pointless wars. Having a strong military is important, but I was really trying to demonstrate the importance of letting the AI walk all over you when you are not strong enough to fight back against them. THAT's the lesson you should take from this; don't do something stupid and refuse an AI demand when they have this kind of force to punish you with. You can always have your revenge later, as I did in this game. <img src="images/smilies/cool.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>This is exactly what I do too.  It feels good to see the other civs slaughter each other while I carefully build my infrastructure.  I add to the fun by giving right of passages to all the warring factions to speed them to their doom.  I also give money, resources and tech to the losing side to drag it on longer. <img src="images/smilies/evil.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>is it just me or are the persians and chinese always going at it right from the start in a deity game? in all of my games where the chinese and persians have been in, they start off going at each other's throats.</p>

<p>I am not a deity player, so I viewed it using my perspective. It sucks to be stuck in the middle when a civ needs to walk across you to get to another Civ. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

And it's even more frustrating when you offer the AI an ROP to help him get to his enemy faster and he won't accept it! <img src="images/smilies/mad.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="images/smilies/wallbash.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="images/smilies/aargh4.gif" border="0" alt=""> When will they see the light?<img src="images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

Yeah!! I do that all the time. Whenever a strong civ is "eating" a weak one, I'll supply them with every resource they need. It's great to know that your rubber is being used to make your top enemy waste zounds of shields <img src="images/smilies/goodwork.gif" border="0" alt=""> . I also <img src="images/smilies/love2.gif" border="0" alt=""> when they go commie and "self destruct".<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>hehe... I supplied the Russians with like 300 golds per turn in my current game but despite the aid, they eventually got wiped out by the Persians. <img src="images/smilies/cry.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>In one of my deity games I had fun watching Romans and Greeks warring at my territory for hundreds of years, I had fought Romans with Greece before but when Caesar declared a new war againt Alexander I decided to pass. I paid ROPs for both of them to speed things up, and sold iron and my only source of salper to Greece to help them out. I used my troops to block the way so that Roman could not combine their forces for town siege<img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""> Despite my effort, Greece was losing the war and eventually forced to sign peace treaty.<br />
<br />
The next turn Roman declared war with me, and captured a couple of my cities, including the one I am working on a forbidden palace.  <img src="images/smilies/mad.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />
Eventually I won the war against Romans, but the damage was done.</p>

<p>I recently finished a game just like that -- though certainly not on deity. i was playing normal map, 7 civs. 5 of them wound up on this moderate-sized island and 4 of them (me excluded) were constantly at war with later-game MPs with the other two civs. and my nation controlled the wide isthmus that separated them all. weird. at first i tried chasing them off my property, but it just got to the point that i would have been constantly at war, too. so i let them go at each other and tried trading resources/techs to the losers to keep them in the game. i won a diplomatic victory in like 1814 or something. i was the only one they could agree they didn't hate.</p>

No offense to anyone, but why is that the SOTD.  I thought that only odd pictures and glitches were the only things that were even considered for SOTD.<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

No, for it to become a SOTD, it needs to be shocking, weird, interesting, OR funny. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I had a weird event in a game once where a galley "jumped" a 1 tile choke hold because it was forced to move. And that side wasn't even explored yet! If only I took at screenshot of it.. <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

The AIs do not want to sign the ROP with you.  They want to able to go every where and walk all over your empire as they please; however, they do not wish to see you setting foot on their empire.   So basically, no ROP deal, but don't border asking them to leave either.<img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>
