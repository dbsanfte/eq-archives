The man speaks of leadership, of conquest of their enemies - the barbarian raiders that constantly rain down upon the villages, and acquiring wealth. This is the NPC Despot, Markus Viviano (OOC: I sure hope we have Rome or something. ;)).<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Name: Markus Viviano<br />
Character Gender: Male<br />
Character Stat: dead<br />
Character Health: no vital signs<br />
Character Age: 29<br />
Caste: (NPC Character)<br />
<br />

Discipline - 20<br />
Charisma - 20<br />
Constitution - 5<br />

Belligerent, Intellectual, Tracking<br />
<br />
Markus is a ripe young leader, from a roving militia family that have fought off Barbarians. Having had his father taken away by Barbs, and his uncle turn on his village, he trusts no one, not even his advisors. He also likes wealth and has plenty of possessions from his hunting activities.</div></div><hr />

Once again, the barbarians are being sent in from the north! Assemble our axemen and men with wooden spears! The encampment is just beyond the light forest about a day's walk (OOC: 8 miles) from here.<br />
<br />
Little did they know, that the despot had planned a 2nd barbarian invasion from the east. The people were restless, but still didn't believe their lives were in any great danger. &quot;People only react in fear&quot; was the despot's motto, and he knew that this would be a motivation. The ONLY motivation to get what the despot wanted:<br />
<br />
There were sightings of plentiful deer and other game to the east. Not in mass quantities, but enough to sustain a small village. There were also brilliant colored stones and rocks that the despot wanted as their palace. There was a hostile tribe in that direction that the people refused to confront. The despot had actually hired some mercinaries to 'scare' the poplace. Still, the despot doesn't trust them 100%...</div></div><hr />

Markus: You, I've noticed you before, you are the runner correct? He stares at John, John keeps his head down, for fear of insulting his most sovreign leader<br />
<br />
John: That's right, is there anything I can do for you? John looks up<br />
<br />
Markus: I'm always seeking to expand the territories, do you not agree this is a worthy goal?<br />
<br />
John: Absolutely, we may need more food in the future.<br />
<br />
Markus: HA! Food, it may be a decent idea to look into that afterward, but for now, I need you to serve me. Will you? or must I look to someone else to help our people?<br />
<br />
John: Oh no, I wouldn't think of turning down an offer like this, what can I do for you? Anything, just ask, Ill do it.<br />
<br />
Markus: Good, you can serve me well, I need you to head past the deer hunting grounds to the east, and look to see what lies beyond. Wealth, or doom, your return will be the only indicator of which.<br />
<br />
John: I have a companion, may she accompany me as well?<br />
<br />
Markus: If you so desire.<br />

<br />
John: That sure has been burning for a while, I wonder what's going on...<br />
<br />
Monica: maybe a feast for our safe return?  she gives him a shove, then goes back to warming her hands with the campfire in front of them<br />
<br />
John: Its a nice place, our lands, this will make a beautiful land to live in one day, when there are happier times.  john shifts on the dirt, getting comfortable so he can try to sleep. Monica lays down next to him, they warm each other with their hands <br />
<br />
Suddenly, a thundering is heard over the horizone, slow at first, however, it is slowly getting louder.....louder...faster.....Yelling is noticed from inside the thunder, john sits up<br />
<br />
John: BARBARIANS! John runs toward the cart loaded with food and a handful sharpened poles he recieved from a friend in town. He hands them off to the others, including monica, and picks up a rock<br />
<br />
Small pieces of wood, twigs almost, fly over the horizon and land all around john, as he runs toward the thunder, what strange weapons are these? he wonders. He looks to the left and sees a man, a stranger, younger then he, be penetrated by one of the flying sticks, he goes limp.<br />
<br />
John is stopped for a moment as he sees what has happened, in that instant, a quiet whistle screeches toward him and imbeds into his shoulder, he screams and falls<br />
<br />
Monica: (running toward him) are you okay?  John nodds<br />
<br />
 Monica and the others run toward the approaching barbarians, their largest are in the front, not many of them, but they have superior weapons. Monica kneels down, holds her spear up as the enemy run by, ignoring her, one runs straight into the spear. She sees the look of horror on his face as she drops the spear and runs toward a fallen comrade to pick up his spear.<br />
<br />
the battle ensues, when it is over, 5 barbarians passed through the scout group, leaving 8 of their fallen in the same field where 6 villagers lie dead,. 3 injured, including john.<br />
Wasting no time, the remaining villagers, including john, still with the stick in his shoulder run toward the now engulfed villiage.<br />
<br />
 The scout group return to the villiage to find it damaged, luckily another group, a much better armed group was there to stop the barbarians, John returns to his and Monica's hut as she runs to the palace to check on the wellbeing of Markus<br />
<br />
Monica: Sir! e did what we could, are you unharmed?<br />
<br />
Markus: Quite actually, another group of mercenaries were present to stop the barbarians, how did they perform?<br />
<br />
Monica: (out of breath) they looked like they had suffered many casualties, but their leader is surveying the damage outside<br />
<br />
Markus: and the man I met with earlier today? (feigning interest)<br />
<br />
Monica: he's hurt, but hell be okay, we lost 6 villiagers though, a few of them scouts and hunters. If there is nothing further sir Id like to check on john.<br />
<br />
Markus: By all means, tke your leave.<br />
<br />
 Monica runs out the door, as markus takes a sip of his drink.</div></div><hr />

So far, from what I can tell, the emperor is indeed dead.  He who takes his place, however, must be determined by the players.  As no line of sucession was left by the previous ruler, people will now have to start invoking old loyalties and taking out enemies to see who gets the throne.<br />
<br />
However, so far as I can tell, the only person really in the lead is Sage Atrous.  Unless I'm very much mistaken, the other people vying for power are not more than 15, while Sage Atrous is in his 20's.<br />

Both carry packs and the huge Goth also pulls a travois loaded with supplies. As always when the Karbala enters the town people begin following him to see what rites he will perform. This time they hang back quite a bit, cowed by Germanicus' impressive stature and questionable mein. The pair walk quickly and pass the Stone of Rites and then the Pool of Rites. When they also pass by the cairn of the Fire of Rites the townsfolk mutter. Surely the Karbala does not mean to use the Cliff of Rites, the place of purity for rites of the air? When the pair also passes by the trail to the cliff the people express their dismay. *<br />
<br />
Townie: Karbala! Great one! Do you mean to pass us by? Great danger has surfaced and our leaders are in turmoil.<br />
<br />
Marvcus: I follow an augur, one more powerful than than the omens of Noshuret. I go north and when I return I shall have with me another who is pure and loved by the spirits. What tales could I tell you children that would weigh more heavily than that on the balance of my soul?<br />
<br />
Second Townie: (kneeling in the companions' path) Oh, please! We beseech thee. We need your guidance for without it we are certainly doomed!<br />
<br />

<br />
Marvcus: Very well. I will tell you what I have seen for Noshuret though I would have preferred to save you the pain of knowing.<br />
<br />
* Marvcus breaths deeply and his eyes roll back into his head. He begins swaying rythmically and the wooden hoops pierced all over his body click against each other like dried bones. *<br />
<br />
Marvcus: The great wolf of the hill pack grew weak and was slain by his kin. As the steam rose from his rended flesh, the three brothers, with blood hot in their maws did circle each other. They were well matched and none knew which would prevail. In a flash they attacked, tearing at each other, ripping, rending. They battled mightily and none were cowed. At the same moment they broke apart, each nursing his own wounds and limping away. Perhaps they would all have fought another day but Aranna, that mischevous spirit of the air, had brought the smell of the great wolf's death to another pack nearby. Emboldened by the smell of their rival's blood they attacked the hill pack. None of the brothers had the strength left to fight. Their mates and cubs were slain in front of them and the brothers died under the fangs of their enemies, the cracking of their own bones their last sense of the living world.<br />
<br />
* Marvcus swoons and falls but Germanicus is their to catch him. He supports the Karbala until Marvcus comes back to himself and stands on his own. *<br />
<br />
Marvcus: And so is the fate of Noshuret. As you act like spoiled children tugging at a prize while your gravest doom approaches. Come, Germanicus, we have far to walk this day.<br />
<br />
* Germanicus picks up the travois and the two continue on their way, leaving the stunned townfolk behind. *</div></div><hr />

Atrous- Do you think it could have been Aza? the visitor I mean.<br />
Izcoatl- I don't know..- Izcoatl looks to the north, into the far off waters and sighs- I'm old Atrous...I may not look it, my knowledge of plants here have kept me young, in apperance at least.. I need to make one more travel before I'm certain.. there is another barbarian tribe to the west of here, they had ties with those that recently attacked us, maybe they know something we don't. I need to see them.<br />
Atrous- but you may not make it<br />
Izcoatl- I know, but if I don't remember that Aza must not reach power... he musn't!-<br />
With this, Izcoatl descended the hill and made his way off to the west, as Atrous looked on his old friend with a sense of gratitude and worry.</div></div><hr />

All the same, he has sent messengers throughout the Fanatican Empire, telling the citizenry that if they swear loyalty to him, they will gain much power after his invasion...<br />
<br />
OOC: Summary: Fanatica will be attacked after the next turn chat, on Thursday.  If you think that it'll be succesful, you can post here or PM me to swear loyalty to Nero...</div></div><hr />

Hy daddy, it is strange to communicate with you from the distance, but i just wanted to bring you good news:<br />
ITS A BOY AND A GIRL!<br />
you are finally a grandpa!<br />
Praeditus Lifespanius Maximus has much of his father, but Diutia Lifespanius Bellona goes more into my kind :-)<br />
<br />
You must visit us soon to see them play!<br />
<br />
Diutius and us are now living in Gorina, but we are very concerned about the recent rumors that we will not live in peace there. I would really like to see some of your troops to protect us, as we are not able to raise troops at the moment ... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a suggestion for the great despot X (dont know his name yet). I think that you should in your greatness reward all noble houses that swear to protect you and your family one single piece of land each so that they can protect you even better. I am sure that evry noble house in Fanatica would swear loyality to you and use this land singelhandey to protect you. <br />
<br />
BTW: This would also be a good thing if corruption is put on lands...  Since we dont have a large amount of land yet, You could do it later, if you want to do it all. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As the huge crowds gather outside of the Palace of Gorina, carpenters are just finishing up a large wooden stage. People start to climb the soft hills and knolls around the stage that seem to be carved out in a shell shape around it. The hills have been terra-planed slightly to produced small graduated levels, good for sitting on. As Diutius looks out from the Palace he estimates 1000 people. It is time.<br />
<br />
Diutius steps out onto the stage accompanied by his close family, other Noblemen, and a contingent of high ranking Jade Warriors. There is a hush over the huge crowd.<br />
<br />
Diutius throws his arms out to the crowds and then lets them fall to his side.&quot;People of Fanatica. I come to you this day in May of 1550bc with a message of Hope. Although we have been set adrift by the death of the great Sage Atrous, I intend to put us back on course with today's procession. Warriors raise your weapons, farmers lay down your tools, and workers cease building roads, for today will be a national day of rest. For we truly have cause to rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tasius (the Bold) brought his father to Gorina just before the great Sage Atrous passed on. After his father's death, we have not heard one word from him. He may have set off into the hills on a sabatical, but none the less, we as a nation have no sign of a Despot. We know Tasius married Princess Kaesa Atrous Aquilla, but no words have been heard from the Princess either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Therefore, as the highest ranking member of the Royal family, I Diutius Lifespanius, do hereby claim the title of Despot. I now have command of Fanatica's military might, and will preserve the core responsibilities of the ruling family. We are all countrymen of Fanatica, but there is only one Despot.&quot; At this point  the increasingly noisy crowd comes to an overwhelming cheer. Again, Diutius raises his arms and shouts, &quot;I   am  that  man, and from this day forward, Fanatica will be ruled by the Lifespanius family!&quot; The crowd which had quieted to hear the last statement again rises to its feet and cheers in a deafening acceptance of the new Despot.<br />
<br />
Diutius bows to the crowds, then turns to his family and friends. After a few words with his wife, and then the military, he leads the way back to the Palace.</div></div><hr />

Changes may occur within this document as time moves on, but we need a starting point, and this is it.<br />
<br />
First things first. This may come as a shock to you, but I believe it is the best for the nation. Because of its central location and its future growth potential, Gorina is hereby proclaimed the Capital City of Fanatica (just in the RPG). Our working Palace is located in Gorina, as is our family. Our knowledge of the area is more extensive and the opportunities for our citizens are more bountiful here. Good, now onto Land Grants and promotions. :)<br />
<br />
As you know Queen Helena owns the land in and around Gorina. At present, these lands, except for the city, fall under a proposal of the queens for distribution under a new system. More on that later. The land Helena owns is outlined in blue on the map.<br />
<br />
Beyond these lands, I have granted land use by some of our best citizens. These citizens will recieve a promotion to Nobility, either a Baron or Baroness, until such time as they are worthy of another promotion. At the present time, we are mustering Legions in each of the tiles to be used by the Nobility in charge of the tile, in service of the Despot. These troops will be used for protection of the tile, its citizens and assets. The Nobility will not bear the cost of the Legion in its tile, but the upkeep of the Legion will be their responsibility. Upkeep per Legion is 1 food and 1 shield. Income above and beyond the upkeep will be the possesion of the Baron(ess) in charge of the tile. This is subject to change as one's relationship with the Despot may change in the future or/and taxes may be applied. The map below shows colored tiles that have been granted for us by the person shown on the tile.<br />
<br />
Pink - Katie - Given the title Baroness and use of a good land tile.<br />
<br />
Maroon - Desmond Nevelis - Given the title Baron and the use of a good land tile.<br />
<br />
Orange - Janus Nero - Given the title Baron and the use of a good tile.<br />
<br />
Green - Julius, son of Aggripina - Given the title of Baron and the use of a good tile. Julius, your Legion will protect the city of Nar Shadda and the tile assigned to you. Any movement of your troops from your tile must be posted as per the troop movement rules. (This actually applies to all Nobles).<br />
<br />
Yellow - Anthony - Given the title of Baron and the use of a good tile.<br />
<br />
More to come later.<br />

shaitan: we considered iron to be available as soon as discovered in the last rpg. thats why we assumed it to be like that in this game. would propably make things easier... the rpg till now is not resource reglemented, but more or less tech reglemented.<br />
as such, the units can be created as soon as the tech is there. if we dont do it that we we should also only allow businesses or people to create iron things if they walk up to the iron and build it there. or at least connect their business location with a road to the iron :-P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 19, 2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boots - In answer to your last question, yes. I have given all the Nobles the use of 1 military unit to protect the tile (you are also stationed to protect the city of Nar Shadda). I have covered the cost of the unit, the Noble will cover the upkeep (1 food, 1 shield) per turn (or as a whole, per t/c). <br />
<br />
In reference to the begining, I assumed at the time of the writing that the Conflict Manager's ruling was correct. Octavian X claimed that you lost control of you last unit, so I gave you another. The tile you are caring for only has the resource to cover the upkeep for one unit.

To this day, only two parcels of land are owned by people other than the Despot. Those would be the 13 tiles owned by Helena and the three tile owned by Marcus (three hills between Noshuret and Gorina), both of which were given by the great Sage Atrous. <br />
<br />
All current Land Grants (see last proclamation) will carry over indefinitely, but may be increased (in responsibility or rank) or decreased, even ended if need be. Servitude would go to Maximus. I ask that Maximus carry on the works of Land Grants to worthy citizens.<br />

That statue is a constant reminder of what a true, noble leader the man was.<br />

He son, Tasius (the Bold) is now with us as a citizen of Fanatica, but has no evidence of his stature as the great leader he is. I will therefore rectify that situation by granting ownership of three land tiles SE of Noshuret.

ANNOUNCEMENT:<br />
the fanatican populace is revolting against their illegal despots in the defected lands. from this very moment on, couter-revolutionary troops of civil peasants armed with forks and shovels gather at the housing of the illegal despots and claim their fanatican identity back. all tiles not occupied by troops at this moment will revert back. all tiles for which no ownership was posted (e.g. civanators tiles) automatically revert back to me, the despotess.<br />
<br />
the illegal despots are driven out of the nation, and as such will from now on be known as &quot;banned&quot; and &quot;non-individuals&quot;. they will be tracked and hunted down by specialized commandoes. they will be caught upon sight and put into the dungeon to be executed the day after their capture. this will also be true for all their relatives and decessors as well as all people who supported them.<br />

this will at the moment(!) only be done for proclaimed ownership tiles and illegaly proclaimed nations.<br />
any person having ownership of tiles being granted by this or any former despot are NOT illegal. they are legal. they will be conquered back or being left alone as the despot wishes.<br />
<br />
so afaik, only diutius and bootstoots character have legally founded nations, but i dont know which tiles were legally transferred or not. i would like to stop all activity until somebody can draw a clear map of which tiles belong to whom now. otherwise i will have to fight down all nations instead of letting them live!</div></div><hr />
