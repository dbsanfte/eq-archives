<br />
If anyone has issue with this, please PM me or post un the Presidential thread in the Government Forum.  Do not post here, unless you are required to post instructions for the chat.<br />
<br />
Either way, it looks like it will be a short turnchat as:<br />
<br />
a. We are discovering Literature in 4 turns and will have many trade opportunities to sift through.<br />
<br />
b. It will give us a better chance to assess the war once our advancing troops gain more info on Egypt's military.<br />
<br />
c. We will need to discuss the ramifications of our Golden Age(which should commence immediately after our first Legionnaire victory).<br />
<br />
I am actually going to discuss our Golden Age in the Citizen's Forum, as there are some who are concerned about its timing.</div></div><hr />

Im gonna post now, since I have auditions for Taming of the Shrew tomorrow (wish me luck! I wanna be Lucentio)<br />
<br />
Embassies:<br />
Pending the results of  This Poll  (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=54938), build a Greek Embassy<br />
<br />
If we can afford a Military Alliance, and we decide to do an offensive war, create a Greco-Roman Alliance (this is only IF both these factors occur. I dont want an alliance any other way.)<br />
<br />
Come, now Sirrah. To Penguinadua!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We should have extensive discussions on trade, should The Great Library be built, etc following the discovery of Literature in 4 turns.  To facilitate this discussion, please stop at that point and gather information:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Set research to polytheism and check how many turns it is at the max slider value which does not run a defecit.  If this is less than 35 turns or so we need to discuss / poll the choice between min and max research.  If it's close to 40 turns or building the Great Library, then min research is still the way to go.<br />
 See what we can get for literature<br />
 See how much we need to pay for other techs if we hold back lit<br />
 <br />
<br />
Of course a lot will depend on how the war progresses, and whether we need all production queues to be on military or if we can afford to start on a wonder.  If wonder production is even a possibility, start moving workers to the place it will be built (Gorina was the concensus choice when this was discussed) and build up the area as much as possible, irrigating plains and mining grassland and hills.  It would be a good idea to have the workers behind the front lines anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-No offensives to be launched the first few turns of this turn chat, concentrate on keeping the cities defended, if a city is taken... TAKE IT BACK, even if it requires a legion.  I'd rather not rush our GA but that's only within reason.<br />
<br />
- The Warrior to the far East needs to be recalled, it will likely not get home in time, so have it explore the Black area at the end of that penninsula first.<br />
<br />
-upgrade as many warriors as possible to Legions<br />
<br />
-Move Warrior NE of Aureus in town and garrison there (DO NOT upgrade a warrior in Aureus, at least not until After the current warrior threat east of the city has been taken care of.<br />
Needs Governor Approval or Council Override to pass<br />
<br />
-Gorina should pump out Legions ASAP, Gorina may be able to wait for temple.<br />
<br />
-When Inadatto finishes it's temple switch to Spear<br />
<br />
-Switch Noshuret to Spearman and upgrade and move forward the Legion there (wait for Spearman to be completed first)<br />
<br />
-When Aureus finishes it's Spearman build either a Spearman or a Wall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Jun 03, 2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 2 settlers caught going to their respected city locations. Call them back to settle in the west, according to the last image here (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=54502). Go for spot 7, 10, and 11, as they'll be away from the action.<br />
<br />
Keep the lux slider as is, since we need the gold for upgrades. On turn 4, please upload the save so I can take a look at it. I will decide then.<br />
<br />
Workers - There's one set of workers in the east. Keep the garrison over them until they build a road to the lake. If AJ doesn't wish to name his city, then please continue the naming of the lake city with Fionn's chosen name. <br />
<br />
Once that group is done, take them west so there can be 2 groups of 3 workers building roads to the next city locations.<br />
<br />
Build a road 1 east of Funky Towne, but do NOT connect it to the rest of the civ. It's a warrior factory. Those workers will be finished next turn. Please build a road towards &quot;Gold Rush&quot;, as our settlers will have to head in that direction.<br />
<br />
Note to Science: Domestic is in charge of the science and lux slider, not science.<br />
<br />
Cities under domestic control:<br />
<br />
Lake Asphinxia: Warriors<br />
Aureus: Spear, Legion<br />
Regia: Worker, Warrior<br />
Inadatto: Temple, Settler, Legion (note: we'll need irragation on that cattle - once the eastern road crew is done, have them head on over and irragate the 3 roaded tiles between Noshuret and Inadatto).<br />
<br />
Worker Note: There's a worker south of Gorina that should head for the Nur Gisnod workers. That's our road building crew.<br />
<br />
Warrior Exploration<br />
<br />
There's 2 warriors in the north and south. Have the northern one (by Corinth) continue NW (or SW then N). There's what looks like another coast. It could be land. If you see land, fortify it just incase there's a civ. There's a settle by the Dyes, and another by Noshuret. The settler on the dyes is with the Legion. Take him south to the port location.<br />
<br />
Settler/Legion pair by Regia: Take this to &quot;The Fog&quot;. This is 1 north of the iron south of Regia.<br />
<br />
Settler/Legion by Noshuret: Take this to the Northern Iron (1 east of the iron in the north), or to &quot;Gold Rush&quot; (#7 - 1 NE of the gold by Nur Gisnod).<br />
<br />
Also, set aside 150g for treaties and such.</div></div><hr />

This city will continue producing warriors and workers until domestic tells me we have enough workers.  Please keep the next worker nearby to bring irrigation to Nar Shadaa and Xak Tsaroth.<br />
<br />
Funkytown (this should be renamed Xak Tsaroth)<br />
<br />
For the time being I want this to be our second 'Citadel'.  It should produce a barracks and then warriors.  Make sure to not connect it to the rest of the empire, although a road leading east almost to Noshuret would allow us to get units produced here to the front much faster.<br />
<br />
Inadatto<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this city is under my control.  If it is, complete the temple and then produce settlers as quickly as possible.  Irrigation of the cow tile to the west would help in this respect.<br />

Ahh, the great DZ talks a good game, but needs to work on his chat skills, and DP skills.  We are about to lose an unescorted Settler due to my unassuming arrogance.<br />
<br />
Look pretty good everywhere else though, and we discovered Literature!  No GA yet, either.  Cheers!<br />

Just to note, domestic is NOT happy. The settler and escort botched 2 turns of movement. 2 turns later, the settler is WITHOUT THE ESCORT IT CAME WITH!? DZ - PLEASE, P-L-E-A-S-E BE SPECIFIC FOR EACH TURN AND EACH MOVE!!! Do not go moving units until you're sure the leaders want you to move that unit!!!<br />
