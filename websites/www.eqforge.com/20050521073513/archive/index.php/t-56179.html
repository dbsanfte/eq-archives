So the point of this thread is when do we sue for peace?<br />
We are at a crucial point in the war. We have enough troops to repel an attack and we have enough to take a little more territory. However we do not have enough troops for a  sustained and difficult campaign against Egypt's inner cities. So should we settle for taking Memphis, fortifying it and using it as a base to launch a future attack or should we press on and on until we are exhausted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good question, Peri. Memphis will surely fall to our Legions and this victory will open the door to 3 or 4 other Egyptian cities. Asyut to the North (future gold deposit), Giza to the NE (a harbor city on the Northern coast), and Thebes and Heliopolis to the East. All of these cities are very crucial to our future expansion as well as stabilization of the area.<br />
<br />
If you check the Histograph you will find that Egypt still has twice the Culture as Fanatica does. Keep in mind that Cleo owns NO Wonders. She has done this with only city improvements. If we take Memphis, it will be under direct fire culturally from these cities and a prime flip candidate.<br />
<br />
To me, there is no way we can afford to stop at Memphis. We definitely need to take Thebes and Helio. Make them relocate their Palace and take their wines from them. <br />
<br />
Victory to Rome!</div></div><hr />

We can't stop at Memphis; it will flip straight back to Egypt. So Thebes and Heliopolis will have to be captured as well. And this is where Cyc and I tradionally disagree on war-matters. I think that then we will not stop but will deny the Egyptians their Iron by taking Pi-Ramesses. And then their will be voices to take Giza and Alexandria as they have too much culture and then; while we're at it Hieraconpolis (a lonely city) will be taken, just because we are near it. Then we'll desire Asyut and Abydos for the gold and then also Avaris, because we don't want to keep the Egyptians alive. And thus with capturing Memphis we'll go for the whole Egyptian empire.<br />

By going for Memphis we'll be going for a complete war of annihilation. Do we want this ?<br />
<br />
So we have to make a decision now. Are we strong enough for the elimination of Egypt and do we want that ? <br />
<br />
* Yes: Go for it<br />
* No: Stop before Memphis, or raze Memphis for workers.<br />
<br />
I think we should stop before Memphis. I can live with the razing of Memphis. I am against this total war.</div></div><hr />

Take more cities to break Cleo's power for good and hopefully get some techs at the peace table.  Risk a flip or two because once we gets Cleo's techs (assuming she has some we need) we can always absorb the rest of Egypt at a later date.</div></div><hr />

Egypt was the only civ we knew of with 1 tech up on us; Polytheism. Now they have no more. They Also have no gold left. It is a bad time to make peace. <br />
<br />
The question is: are we strong enough to conquer Egypt completely ? They are in the dust now, struggling; standing or their last legs. But are these last legs too strong for us ? <br />
<br />
War is also damaging us. I think we can conquer Egypt, but at what cost and how far will we be behind ? I am thinking of the yet unknown civs in this.  And also: Will this war path block us from our desired Spaceship - victory ? <br />
<br />
All is linked, nothing can be viewed seperately. We have to see beyond the short term victories and focus on the long term victory. We don't want to win the battle but loose the war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RM - Egypt is struggling to keep on its last legs while it shines in first place with twice the Culture as us. We've just set them back Militarily for the moment. We need to take 3 more cities - Memphis, Thebes, and Heliopolis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if Egypt is on its last legs and a cultural powerhouse and we can gain nothing by making peace then it seems we should continue the war and completely absorb Egypt.  Remember we can possibly get a great leader by continuing the war.  That would allow us to instantly build a forbidden palace in our new Egyptian province once Egypt is totally subdued.  A forbidden palace would go along way towards helping us to recover any &quot;ground&quot; we lose by continuing the war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sad fact is that there were things to gain from Egypt at the beginning of the last two turnchats.  13 turns ago, we could have walked away with El Amarna and a small bit of gold.  6 turns ago, we could have taken Polytheism and almost 100g from Egypt.  Unfortunately, these trimmings weren't enough for a good majority of the electorate, so here we are.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we could have been at peace with Egypt with strong fortifications in the hills south of Egypt's mainland.  We could have been making dents in Egypt's culture lead by adding culture to our cities instead of sending out a constant barrage of Legions.  However, I am not going to play the &quot;could have been&quot; card.  That time has passed.<br />
<br />
Now, I want to press on with this war so that I can say we did not waste those 13 turns.  As DP, I will keep an eye on Egypt's comparative culture with each city we take.  When I feel there is a bit more parity, we can talk about possible peace.  And I believe that cultural parity will come only by taking the three cities Cyc has mentioned at least.<br />
<br />
Taking anymore cities at this time will just make neighbors out of  Greece and the Aztecs.  I would prefer to have only one neighbor.  Therefore, I think we should leave some Egyptian cities as a buffer between these two civs so that we only share borders with one nation --- Egypt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please don't get me wrong.  I do not fear the nations of Greece or Azteca.  As a matter of fact, fear will never be a reason for a single proposal suggested by this administration.<br />
<br />
I tend to lead by strategy, and to me that does not mean casting aside a perfect military stronghold due to untimely military greed.  That stronghold is the mountains south of Egypt's mainland, and that opportunity is gone.  Ironically, I am one of the few who did not fear the Egyptians as I would have had no problem keeping them as a neighbor while we maximized the vast amount of land within our grasp, wildly surpassing them in the process.<br />
<br />
Now, instead of concentrating our entire defense within 11 tiles of hills and mountains, we will be speading our troops out in two different directions.  So, to me it really makes no difference how far into Egypt we go.  Let the people decide and I will dutifully maneuver our troops to the best of my ability.<br />
<br />
But please, gentlemen, don't mistake my attempts to lower our risk for fear.</div></div><hr />

I beleve we should keep pressing on. Keep producing more Legonares to replace the fallen ones. As long as the Egyptians are keept at bay, we can fill in the gaps with our cities (The ones that have been raized). <br />
<br />
We don't even have enough Settlers to fill our own lands in the Western province and East on the Peninsula and in the area where Byblos and El-Amarna once where. You also want to keep building Legions. Can you be more specific on numbers, designated cities and turns in order to make it clear how we are going to build these. I hope you are not planning to :whipped: them?  <br />
<br />
It is easy to say something that others have to solve: &quot;I want the Ameticans, Greeks and Aztecs of out Island by 350 AD !&quot;, but it is harder to come up with a plan to support it. <br />
<br />
CG: I'm not being personal, I just think your plan should be more founded and checked to see if it's a realistic proposal. <br />
<br />
Conquering Egypt is not getting us closer to our goal; a Spaceship victory. Focussing on a good second core of cities, production, growth and science is helping us in this. It's unfortunate that fear made us go to war, fear didn't allow us to stop in time and fear is still pressing us forward. We should learn to know when it's enough.</div></div><hr />

We need to have something substantial to show for our GA. Crippling Egypt would be a good start. We can rush settlers from the captured cities to help us colonise. If we stop now the Egyptians will quickly fill up the land again and we will be back where we started. We know egypt wants peace so we might as well go for broke and take as much as we can from them first.</div></div><hr />

Well it takes citizens to be sacrificed to pop-rush in despotism; + 2 citizend for the settler-group. The city would have to be at least size 4,5 or 6. <br />

We can do that in Monarchy or Republic, but not really in despotism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@ DZ - Good Mr. President. I'm glad to see that you are not going to be using the &quot;should have been&quot; card TOO MUCH :lol: I would hate to see you use it  OVER AND OVER AGAIN ;) But whether you you being cynical or sincere, I agree with you. We need to take Memphis, Thebes, and Helio and then stop. Hopefully, the people will vote to switch our Government to a republic soon. That should come into the picture about the same time as we complete taking these cities. <br />
<br />
@Peri - I don't have a problem with your idea about populating the new territories, but with the way Egypt is coming up with new units, these cities may be very small by the time we capture them.<br />
<br />
@ Rik Meleet - Hey, you look pretty good with a whip ;) . I think the plan of taking these cities is planned well and founded on our existing forces and sucess. It will alsohelp with our future plans of going for the Spaceship Victory, as Egypt will not threaten us with a Culture Victory or with a better economy. Knocking out these three cities is a win/win situation. What we do after that will determine how well we proceed towards our goals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also for those talking about taking ALL of Egypt I'm starting to favor Bypassing the Northern cities (Avaris and  Abydos) and potentially letting Egypt &quot;survive&quot; up there, preventing the rep hit and saving us some effort IF we do go for a full fledge war.<br />
<br />
Also, continueing this war does mean slowing down settling</div></div><hr />

<br />
@Rik Meleet - :hmm:, I have checked it numorus times. It is possible to churn out Legonares to repalce the fallen Legonares. My plan is founded and is in a realistic proposal. We need to Eliminate Egypt untill they beg for peace<br />
<br />
Proposal I<br />
It Will be possible if Gorina has a build queue of an alternating settler, legion, settler, legion build (or add legions to reduce wasted turns). When the GA is over, Then once city should be desginated Settler Cities (3 Minimum and should be one of the top Food producing cities)and the rest Legonare factories.<br />
<br />
Proposal II<br />
All cities should be able to be Settler Factories so long as the following conditions are to be met.<br />
<br />
Cities with the population 3&lt;=x should build Legonares<br />
Cities with the Population 3&gt;=x Should build Settlers<br />
<br />
x can be in any number</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Cyc - I was being sincere.  Now that we are going for it, we should take Memphis, Thebes and Heliopolis as I am sure these cities possess the lion's share of Egypt's culture.  And as I said in my first post here, I will check on our cultural parity with Egypt after each city falls.  Once we are culturally equal with Egypt, we can consider peace.  <br />
<br />
@Falcon - (ok, this is the last time, but you guys have got to quit setting me up.....) Can't you see all of the work involved with your plan to raze the cities surrounding Thebes etc?  The ideal &quot;cultural buffer zone&quot; would have been the hills south of Egypt's mainland.  Nothing can be built there, and we can station our legions there to pick off all comers.<br />
<br />
@CG - I agree that we should have no problem replenishing our Legions if necessary.  However, I don't want Gorina to produce Settlers as that city produces too well to spare the population.</div></div><hr />

Also, continueing this war does mean slowing down settling And that is what I meant CG. I don't think we're fast enough to settle our backyards in the west and the Regia Doughnut Peninsula if we also produce more Legions. <br />
<br />
I start to agree with taking Memphis, Thebes, and Helio, but we'll have to settle our teritories. If we wait with that or need too much time we'll find foreigners trespasing our teritory. <br />
Cities with the population 3&lt;=x should build Legonares<br />
Cities with the Population 3&gt;=x Should build Settlers<br />
I hope not (I am a mathematician). If you choose x as 1; all cities of size 1 and 2 build settlers and no Legions are being build. If you choose x as 4, only Legions are build and no settlers. <br />
<br />
I suppose you mean: Cities of size x and larger build Settlers and Cities of size x and smaller build Legions ? <br />
<br />
I do not agree. I think this matter needs more finetuning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falcon02</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DZ keep in mind taking cities doesn't decrease a civ's Culture, just Culture per turn.  That's why when you eliminate a civ it jumps from really large to nothing, unlike power which tends to widdle out.<br />
<br />
Cleo will keep the Culture she has already gathered from those cities, but will just fall behind in the long run since she has less cities to give her Culture per turn, such a difference won't be seen immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point, Falcon.  You are ablsoutely right.<br />
<br />
Then we really need to consider the cultural ramifications of continued war.  With this in mind, is there a strong possibility that we will lose these cities to a culture flip soon after we take them?  If so, do we then want to raze these cities and get our settlers up there as soon as possible so we don't have to conquer Egypt all over again at a later time?  Shall we just work to disconnect Egypt's strategic resources, and then build up for another attack later?  Should we hold off for now and fortify in my precious hills south of Egypt until we make some culture of our own?  ;)<br />
<br />
Can we sustain the conquests we take from Egypt?<br />
<br />
I am asking these questions with all sincerity and no more cheap shots about the recent past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falcon02</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That question was my own concern when I said I was toying with the Idea of razing a buffer zone.  I feel these cities have a high likelyhood of flipping if we don't take measures to ensure it doesn't happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Yes, DZ. The Egyptian Army is weak compared to ours, so we should not have a too difficult time taking these three cities. On the other hand, if we back off and fortify in the Hills, no matter how quickly we build our Culture up, we will be racing against the already self-sustaining cultural powerhouses of Egypt. This means if we don't miss ANY steps on the Cultural Ladder towards parity, as you say, we may someday catch them. Let's stop them in their tracks and this will enable us to make intelligent decisions for our build queues. We are still at the point where we can let them determine our course into the future, or we make up our own minds how to do it. Press on and don't leave very many units in any city, in case of a flip. If one flips, win it back. You know how to do it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know how to do it...<br />
<br />
Yes I do, Cyc.  Thanks!  :D<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that we are so invested in this war now, that even I don't want to stop now.  I would just like to excercise caution in our every move.  I am suspecting that we will cut through Egypt's defenses with relative ease and will find ourselves near a turning point by turnchat's end.<br />
<br />
Let's continue discussion to see if anyone has more to add about our success against Egypt's culture.  We descend on Memphis at 2100 GMT tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've gone past the &quot;point of no return&quot;. There is no more benefit from stopping the war, only continuing will do. <br />
<br />
As I pointed out in my post earlier (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=1052362#post1052362) we will always be able to find a reason to continue. Now it's the build up culture Egypt has. The next steps are outlined in the link.<br />
<br />
So if Egypt is weak, at it's knees and in no way a threat to us any more, is it really necessary to continue the fighting after we take or raze their core cities? I am not saying: &quot;make peace&quot; (there is nothing in it anymore), but we can also stop fighting. If we raze Egyptian cities and rush in setllers we'll have foreigners in our backyard. If we don't bring in settlers to fill the holes I know 3 or 4 civs who will; we'd be strenghtening our opponents. If we take the cities they might flip and cost us dearly. If we remove Egypt from the earth it will damage our rep, take a huge amount of war-time and thus has the danger of unfriendly MA's against us. I was not in DG 1, but does the word &quot;Domino&quot; mean anything ? <br />
<br />
What about stopping after Memp, Thebes and Helios, but not making peace until either: <br />
a) we got a Government type who suffers from war-weariness<br />
b) Egypt has something useful to offer for peace<br />
c) we have settled our backyard and have enough settlers to fill the holes immediately<br />
d) Have advanced tech-wise to have units who are strong and have speed <br />
<br />
We already have, or think we have, too many land to settle quickly. I think we should focus on settle our teritory first before taking more. <br />
