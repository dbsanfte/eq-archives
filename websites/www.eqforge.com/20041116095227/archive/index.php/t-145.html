I was going to buy a game for my dad's birthday. He likes RPGS and strategy games. So when I saw civ, I thought it sounded pretty cool. Build empires, armies, blah blah blah. I knew nothing of it before I saw it on the shelf. I knew my dad would like it, even though it didnt sound particularly exciting. So I got it for him. Well, as often happened, I tried it before I gave it to him (shame on me I know). And I had such a great time playing it! <br />
<br />
Guess what? Dad got a different game for his birthday and I kept civ 2 for myself. Upon playing the game to death, he finally got his belated present. Soon after he was hooked too! Behold the power of civ..........<br />
<br />
So how did everyone else get into civ? Word of mouth? Good review in a magazine? Just picked out at a store? How?</div></div><hr />

About a year or so later - like '96 or '97 - I saw it as I was cleaning out my computer room and put it in the CD ROM drive.  I had no idea what to expect as I somehow misplaced the instruction book, so I played the tutorial.  That's all it took.<br />

I was into board wargaming back then, so I quickly got the board game. It was loads of fun, and quickly became a great favorite. Moving ahead a few years, to 1994, I was looking to add some games for my SNES. I always was into strategy games, so that was what I was looking at, when lo and behold, what do I see but a game called Civilization! I grabbed that baby and got home as fast as I could. I started playing without even reading the manual (and loving it!), and before you know it, 8 o'clock at nite became 3 o'clock in the mourning! I was hooked, big time. I finally broke down and got a PC in 99, and civ-2 quickly followed. So for me, this odessy is nearing 20 years! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

I liked building things up, all those games offered it but they were lacking in many areas.  Well one day I'm in a local Babbages and there she is, Civilization.  &quot;Build an empire to stand the test of time&quot;.  That was the original quote from the box I still have.

I don't have any idea where it came from--maybe it came with a CD-ROM or something?--but there it was.  A CD containing two games from Microprose, &quot;Mantis Experimental Fighter&quot; and &quot;Sid Meier's CIVILIZATION.&quot;  So I tried it out for the heck of it.  I never did try Mantis--still haven't, don't even know what it is--but Civilization sounded interesting.  &quot;Build An Empire To Stand The Test Of Time.&quot;  How could I resist?<br />
<br />
So I tried it out.  Took me a while to figure out what was happening, but once I did . . . I was hooked.  I played it all the time after that, and so did my sister.  We both became major Civkies very quickly.  We kept upgrading.  First CivNet (not that great in and of itself, but we liked the multiplayer option once she got her own computer).  Then Civ II.  Blew us away.  Then the scenarios.  Then MGE.  (Then TOT and CTP, the false Civ, but we didn't care for either.)  And soon, Civ III, and whetever else may follow.</div></div><hr />

I played it continously (along with Pirates!) for five years or so until one day in a bazaar in Tuzla, Bosnia Herzogovinia I saw a copy of Civ II classic.  I still have that copy to this day.

For Father's day, my wife and kids basically said &quot;Go get yourself a game for the computer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I had played a few games on other people's computers and I liked the 1st person blow'em up games like Wolfenstein/Doom/Descent but never faired real well on games that relied on quick reactions and itchy trigger fingers.<br />
<br />
But I remembered back when I was 14 (this was a LONG time ago), my sister and her then-husband (who worked for Hewlett Packard) let me computer-sit for their HP &quot;desktop&quot; computer while they went on vacation.  It was about the size of a suitcase with a 3 or 4 inch (no kidding!) green-screen monitor built in.  (This was also when I tought myself to program in BASIC).  About the only game on it was a text-based game called &quot;King&quot;.  You were the King of an island and had to control things like taxes, money left for food, tourism, and industry to help your population grow.  You had to worry about emigration (essentially unhappyness), revolts, starvation, and the like.  I had a blast playing that game.  <br />
<br />
So when I heard about turn-based strategy games, they seemed like the same thing on a much larger scale - and no worry about &quot;who can fire 17 rounds with a plasma cannon first.&quot; I looked into which one had the best reviews and went out to get my copy of Civ2 MPG. <br />
<br />
I played a game on cheiftain, and won fairly easily, despite the fact that didn't know what I was doing.  By the time I was done I had read one or two strategy guides and tried one more chieftain game to try things out: waging wars, different governments, different units, having a pet city, building a spaceship and so on. But I didn't finish that game before football season started. Once that happened I put civ aside for the better part of 4 months. Once football was done I got it back out and have been absolutely addicted ever since.<br />

<br />
Oh my god. That is EXACTLY how I got Civilization. My parents bought me that CD Drive kit for christmas (I was in grade 9)came with the cd drive, a sound card, speakers, and tons of obsolete games. One of those was a 3 game CD with Silent Service, Railroad Tycoon and F117.<br />
<br />
I loaded up Civilization one day without having any idea what it was. The first thing I saw was a lone settler unit on small little green area. the rest of the screen was black. i said &quot;What the hell is THIS crap? Next.&quot; And I turned it off and never touched it again.<br />
<br />
One day when I was bored and needed a new game I reluctantly picked up the Civilization manual and skimemd through it. i had played Railroad tycoon (also by Sid Meir so i was thinking &quot;if he made civ as well it can't be all bad&quot;) The more I read the more excited I became. This game sounded SO cool!<br />
<br />
So i sat down to play one saturday.. I spent the entire day in front of my computer. I think I played as either the Russians or French.. not sure now. But it was the start of my fascination with the civilization series.<br />
<br />
So when Civ II came out I think that i bought it probably the first month it was in stores.<br />

WAAAY back in Junior high/High shcool (late 70's-can't believe I survived) a good friend and I played all sorts of board war games (Avalon Hill and the like).  We were always making up world empire/conquest games, using the board games to fight out the wars, and just making up the diplomacy/maps/etc. on paper and making our own rules as we went.  After moving out to attend college, mom sold most of my board games (wish I had them now), but I still dabbled now and then.  I would even make up world conquest games on paper like we used to do and play them by myself, making up the rules, adjusting economies, etc,  (is that sad, or what?).  Don't remember the circumstances, now, but had some money much later in life for a computer game (present from my wife, if I remember correctely.  If only she had known http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif  )  I had seen Civilization, Caesar (or whatever it was called) and similar on store shelves, but didn't know anything about them.  Had played Sim City some and enjoyed it, but never totally got hooked.  I read a review somewhere comparing the new Civilization game with the old one, basically saying the old one was better.  Knowing what I know now, it must have been CTP or TOT compared with Civ II.  Anyway, the game sounded like what I was looking for, so I took a deep breath and bought it.  The rest (pun intended) is history...</div></div><hr />

No what really happend was,  that it was refered to me by a friend of mine. He had played the game at a relatives house or something (he was out in cali) and spent a good portion of his time mastering the game, when he came back he immediatly told me about the game. I was a bit skeptical at first, but bought it anyway, it was the best choice in my life(or one of the top few!).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sekong</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2001, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My intnse game playing back to 1991, hwen there were some war games. We had a small gang to do somehotseat togather. On 1993. we began to hear stories about a interesting game that you discover computer. Finally, One pal got it, and our gang gatherred and saw the icon of a funny settler. Here began more sleepless night. I played emperor from almost the beginning. For pretty long time, What I did was getting beated by AI with advanced units. Then I began to know the importance of changing Goverment, etc. At the leisure time, our ganags exchange the new tricks just learn and so on. The strategy of ICS+republic was 1st heard at that time. Without those gang-workshop my skills never be the same.<br />
Then we began to have RR before 1000BC, Armor before AD. Kick AI's planx and wipe out a whole empire with ONE or two armor was the fun at that time. But we never had civnet. But I did tricked the save file, and found out the byte that indicate the color of human civ. But still difficult to make a real MP game. <br />
Left my gang, since 1996.</div></div><hr />

  I was the son of a black sharecropper. . . hmm, that can't be right, I'm white as the driven snow. . .<br />
  Ok, I remember now.  It was back in the good old early 1990's.  I had just dropped out of college, and finally given up in despair on my Amiga, because even though it ran rings around the best PC on the market, CBM never spent a dime on advertising, and noone wrote software for their wonderful computer.<br />
  Despondent, I purchased a 386 from a friend at work, and started looking around for games.  A buddy I role-played with supplied me with Lemmings, Prince of Persia, and some other lame crap.  Around this time, I discovered that the Gold Box AD&amp;D games had been ported to the PC from my venerable old C-64, so I snapped those up, and replayed them.  Then I saw it.<br />
  The name on the cover was Sid Meier.  'That's the guy who did that cool Railroad Tycoon thing', I mused.  'Colonization, huh.  OK, I'll give it a try.'  While I was getting the hang of running a revolution, my buddy was learning the settler cheat for Civ 1.  We shared information(and install discs), and the rest, as they say, is history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">R</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2001, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My story:<br />
In 1992, when I was 13, me and my brothers got an own 386DX-40. It had a few games on it, like Lemmings, Testdrive, and a boringly looking strategy game. I deleted that game to save space on the 100 MB harddrive.<br />
<br />
Then, half a year later, 2 of my friends suddenly got very exited about a game they called Civilization. I scepticly tried it, after seeing it was that same old crap... I didn't understand much, I just fooled around at chefitan level, despotism, not knowing how to use resources, tax or wonders etc.<br />
<br />
It didn't take long to get addicted, and soon I learned all the details... It must be the best game ever.<br />
<br />
How many other games have those freaks like us, who keep playing it, over and over again, year after year, night after night?<br />

Hate to reply to myself, but I didn't explore this question before -<br />
I don't think there is a cure. Someone suggested it might be a Wonder in CivIII - Cure for Civ Addiction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claudius</div><div class="date">Apr 09, 2001, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many years ago I played empire on my old Amstrad PC, in which you started out with a single base and a unit with which you explored and conquered a world. Recently I was working on some Linux problem and found freeciv for the linux community. Well one thing led to another and after downloading civnet (abandonware) from the Underdogs site (still working on getting the linux one working!) I scooted to my local EB and snagged a $12 copy of ToT (not really a huge mistake..http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif but now I'm gonna grab that Civ2 jewlcase which the dude in the store was really pushing me to get (now I see why!) Which sageway's (sp) back to my original Empire days, this was the only game I think I spent consecutive hrs if not days. It also had hotseat and me and my friend would spend litrally all night sessions playing. Now I hope to rekindle those experiences (yikes! nearly 20 years later..) I found out that the game &quot;Empire&quot; that I played was also a board game and also a port of a PDP10/11 (very..very old computer) game called &quot;Empire&quot; which dates from around 1968 (now we're talking over 30 years!) I even have the code for that one in one of my dusty data banks somewhere (it's played in ascii graphics and I believe each move is output to a printer (!!). So the short of it is empire--&gt;linux--&gt;civ a round about way but as Dan Ackaroyd's character in Ghostbusters II said &quot;Man! What a trip!&quot;<br />
Also, maybe this should also be posted in the &quot;what will you be doing in 50 years&quot; forum too! With proably 30 years in history under it's belt (only 20 from the 50 mark) and Civ3 coming out... yea! we'll still be making those Zulu's pay..</div></div><hr />
