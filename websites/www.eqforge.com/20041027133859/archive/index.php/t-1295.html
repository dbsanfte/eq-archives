I think I've had enough of Star Trek for the moment and there is nothing I can think of to try trek-wise (except for a Borg Cube dungeon type scenario).<br />
<br />
There are many great WWII scenarios out there but as far as I know there are none that are research heavy. I'm sort of putting up this post to gauge demand for this type of scenario. I'm have in mind the following advances:<br />
<br />
closed circle engines - elektro boat<br />
schnorchel<br />
rubber coating<br />
radar detectors<br />
Acoustic homing torpedoes<br />
foxer (counter measure)<br />
Adsic/radar<br />
high Freq direction finder<br />
<br />
Combined arms - blitzkreig<br />
radio equipped tanks<br />
bazooka<br />
sloped armor<br />
torsion bar suspension<br />
different calibre guns<br />
different HP desiel engines<br />
surfact ot surface rockets<br />
semi-automatic rifles<br />
electric turrets<br />
anti-magnetic paste<br />
armoured skirting<br />
<br />
radial aircraft engines<br />
formation bombing<br />
airborne radar<br />
tallboy<br />
pathfinders<br />
4 engine air frames<br />
jet engines<br />
presurrized cabins<br />
wire guided glide bombs<br />
air launched rockets<br />
anti-aircraft rockets<br />
dambuster<br />
<br />
I'll be designing the tech tree first. Does anyone have anymore ideas about what other advances are applicable to WWII? Please post them here. Or if you desire an explanation of any of these tech, I'd be happy to oblidge.</div></div><hr />

Wasp is the powerplant of U.S. Navy aircraft such as the F4U Corsair and the F6F Hellcat. It is an air-cooled radial design that delivered more horsepower then any other radial engine. I'm at work Kob, so i can't look it up right now. E-mail me and I'll send you some specs.<br />

I thought the only radial engine used was by kurt tank's FW190. (and later the Hawker Fury which was reverse engineered from a FW190 that landed at a british airfield by accident)<br />
<br />
Guess I can't use it since I have no Cosair or Hellcat, those were Pacific theater carrier planes. Counter rotating propellors were used in the Seafire, but I had to leave that out cause its from the pacific war as well. Drats! Anyway, I already have a radial engine tech listed.<br />

I'll give you any of my expertise in stategy and tactics if that will help.<br />
<br />
One thing though, some of the scenarios that i have played were overly involved with too many units, and too much technolgy to research. Just becareful. Also, I personally love lots of production. Hills that produce more shields and stuff.  <br />
<br />
Also pay attention to where germany gets its resources. If you have a maps(which i never did) please make sure that you include the iron deposits in Norway. The oil fields in Romiania and in the Caucus. If you leave those area bleak there's no reason to occupy them. Resouces was the reason that Hitler invade Norway and Russia (along with the need for Lebenstraum).<br />
<br />
One last thing i just remebered, some of that technology should be used for internal improvemant not just weapon tech. Keep in mind, US war moblization, and the Russians movement of war factories beyond the Urals.<br />

If you want to really get a name in scenario making, create a great vietnam war scenario. I would make one but i'm not that good well in making scenarios. If i knew how to write rules ect.... i'd make it.<br />
Yes make sure you place germans resources. And the Krupp Steel Works at Essen in the Rhineland. That was germany's major industrial area. Also you should try and make the Lend-Lease deal between USA-Rusia at Murmansk. I dunno. Maybwe there's away that whenever a allied(USA) tranny gets to murmansk you can trigger a unit production automatically at murmansk or whatever. <br />

One of my ideas is to have factories as a resource and have bombers 'plunder' them. It won't work for the AI but this is meant to be a two person multiplayer game. <br />
<br />
The Krupp steel works is a good idea. I was going to have the battery factory (for U-boats, can't remeber where it was located) as a target as well.<br />
<br />
The scenario will have many technologies to research I'm afraid but I too don't like to have too many units so I've planned it so that only one type of tank is the main unit at a given time.<br />
<br />
As for the lend-lease and moving factories beyond urals, let me think how to incoporate them.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad to see that you are making fresh art for your units. The ones on the net are alright, but look a bit cartoony. <br />
***<br />
Won't comment on what's available on the net, but as you know, I like to make my own units in the case of those important to the main theme. I'll probably 'steal' some from the net for the generic items. <br />
<br />
***<br />
How can you have the European theater without B-17 and B-24s, but with B-29s? <br />
***<br />
<br />
The idea is to save unit slots and consolidate the British and Americans into one race and having one unit represent all the rest for certain stage of development.<br />
<br />
For the middle stage heavy bomber, I have basically to choose only one from Lancaster, Stirling, Halifax, Flying Fortress and Liberator.<br />
<br />
The superfortress was never used (or at least not much) in the European theatre but it would eventually have been if the war dragged on. It is the only bomber which stands out from the rest and so it holds the last slot. That being the case, I gave the earlier slot to the British. The idea is not to replicate the events of WWII but to replicate the technology and let the players figure out how they want to do it.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Why Bf-110s?<br />
***<br />
Need one long range escourt per race. The Me109 and couldn't really stay up with the german bombers during the Battle of Britain. This will be the equivalent (but inferior) of the Lightning. The Me410 was a much better plane but did not appear until very late.<br />
<br />
***<br />
What about P-40s, the stardard US fighter when they entered the war? <br />
***<br />
Same reasoning as the bombers. I have one early fighter from the British and one late fighter from the US. The typhoon is the equivalent of the JU-87 for the allies and not a fighter.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Why Mig-3s instead of La-5 and La-7s?<br />
***<br />
Pictures are hard to find. No particular preference here - Russians will be an AI race and does not have the full range of units.<br />
<br />
***<br />
How can you have carriers without carrier aircraft?<br />
***<br />
Not enough unit slots, plus carriers did not feature prominantly during most of the European theatre. This is primarily a tank scenario. Thinking of getting rid of all the ships and just using naval task forces.</div></div><hr />

The French will be part of the Allies and the low countries and other misc places will be Allied allies. The Russians will be neutral at first but will eventually hate the Axis (since they are not adjacent to the Allies)<br />
<br />
No alliances will be fixed and no ban of negotiation except between the Axis and Allies. So the AIs can build anything eventually.</div></div><hr />

How will you handle France? I very much like the idea of task forces, as opposed to individual ship units. Instead of transports, how about convoys? It could be a research tech, such as 'organized convoys' or something like that. For the Soviet Union, the fighter that was most used in 1941 was the Polikarpov I-16 Rata. Here is a link:      The I-16 Rata (http://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/i16.html)   Lavotchkin La-5  (http://www.kotfsc.com/aircraft/la5.htm)   Lavotchkin La-7 (http://www.kotfsc.com/aircraft/la7.htm) .

Thanks for the links to the russian fighters. I will have a look. I have already done the Allied and Axis planes so no need to worry about those. I had to look through over 50 sites to find a picture of the HE277 but otherwise it was smooth sailing.<br />
<br />

Our e-mail game. I have looked through the Third Reich (by Mike Janzenska) events fils (there is one for Allies and one for Axis) and looks like it will be relatively easy (but time consuming) to merge the two into one and delete off all the free units meant for the AI.

I think I will stick with the Yak3 as the later plane and use the I-16 type 24 which was the model in use in 1939 during the invasion of Poland.<br />

Sounds good. The Yak was the most numerious a/c that the Russians had in the later half of WWII, just as the I-16 was in the earlier war period. I just think the La-7 looks cooler. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif PS: I downloaded the scenario.<br />

Oh yeah. I think you should use the B17. It was very important. More important than the Wellington or the B29. The B29 was more of a Pacific airplane. The b17 was far more active in Europe than the B29 <br />

Your absolutly right on this Willem, but the allied (Britain and United states) pilots always used the incorrect designator Me for the 109,110, and the 108 trainer. It is used in official US documentation(the incorrect Me), and in endless memoirs(By allied personnel). This is something that persists to this day. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

I support the plea fir B-17 they were by far the main US plan used. The B-24 and B-25 were mainly tactical bomber and do not dtick so well in the memory of WWII fans. (no one else will ever see the difference)<br />

It can't replace the Wellington (or Blenheim, Beufort, Hampden) as they were used much later.<br />

Personally I think the B-24 was a better bomber(B-17 was a much earlier design)but I must agree that B-17 is much more famous and representative.<br />
<br />
If both the B-17 and the Lancaster (of tallboy-tirpitz, dambuster fame) appear, how should they be distinguished. One will make the other obsolete but they were both used at the same time (albeit by day and night).<br />
<br />
I also need the B-29 to give the allies a good bomber advantage at the later stage. That's supposed to be the Allies strong point.<br />
<br />
p.s. I will use Me BF109D as the unit name so that everyone will be happy. That's the name that typically appears on model kit boxes.</div></div><hr />

If both the B-17 and the Lancaster (of tallboy-tirpitz, dambuster fame) appear, how should they be distinguished. One will make the other obsolete but they were both used at the same time (albeit by day and night).The B-24 was used both by the British(In costal command), as well as the US, and there were three times as many liberator wings as flying fortress wings, so the B-24 is more important then the B-17. However, the B-17 was available from 1939, and the B-24 not untill 1942, the same as the Lancaster. You could pull the wellington in favor of the B-17. The Lancaster must have a place. It carried the largest bomb load of any allied bomber untill the B-29, and how can you have tall-boy and dam-buster tech without it?<br />
 I also need the B-29 to give the allies a good bomber advantage at the later stage. That's supposed to be the Allies strong point. I agree, keep the B-29.<br />
 p.s. I will use Me BF109D as the unit name so that everyone will be happy. That's the name that typically appears on model kit boxes.<br />
I think you mean the BF-109E. The Dora(109D), had a different engine and was used in small numbers in France, but not after that. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif I think it's a shame to lose the Wellington. Don't you have a slot saved that you sneak in a Flying Fortress? You could use it in tandom with the Lancaster. The Lancaster could have longer range and higher attack factor, but the B-17 could have a higher DF and more hit points, but both could appear under the same tech(is that possible?). <br />

Although the B-17 is 1939 vintage, the Americans didn't join the war effort yet and they didn't lend lease any B-17s to anybody. <br />
<br />
However, it must be done in such a way that the Allied player will build both Lancaster and B-17. Maybe it will be a special unbuildable unit and the Allied player will get 10 free in stages in America or something. Let me think about it more.<br />
<br />
One more thing, let me say again that my idea is to give minute attack factors to all bombers and simply letting them pillage (as Axis and Allies will be played by humans). The ground attack craft will be the one which can attack tanks.<br />
<br />
On a related note, does anyone know of an idea to stop the players from launching their big bombers from carriers?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 08, 2001, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with you completely on Holland. It was probably the same with many other 'neutrals'. In fact most of the minor Axis allies were 'coerced' as well with the exception of Bulgaria and many fought on both sides like the Finns. I will try to put in two Dutch cities including Rotterdam. <br />
<br />
I will use 109E instead of D as you suggest but the later plane has to be FW190D which was far superior as the 109 airframe was already a decade old when the 190 D series was introduced.<br />
<br />
Yeah the HE 277 is there for balance. It is the four engine variant of the HE 177 and was used primarily for long range maritime functions. There was probably only one squadron and one was modified to carry the A-bomb which never materialised. The other four engine plane was the FW Condor which was a pre-war airliner converted to maritime recon.<br />
<br />
A bit more on the air scheme:<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how the US bombers moved over to Britain. Did they fly non-stop or did they have to refuel in Iceland or something?<br />
<br />
Any strong objection to making all the high altitue bombers as helicopters? Then they will not land on carriers and they have to return to base after a few turns any way.<br />
<br />
The fighters will have two turns so they can stack with a bomber for one turn while the ground attack will have one turn but multiple attacks.<br />

They just couldn 't say something against Germany bewcause Holland would be bombed until the Northsea had flooded the whole country if they'd done that. But I can understand why you put us in the &quot;neutrals&quot; and I'm not asking you to change it.<br />

The first one was important in the early stages, the last one in the defence of Germany (together with the K).<br />
<br />
I have my doubts about the He 227. I know you probarly chose that one for the balance in the game, but Germany didn't really have much airplanes with 4 engines.<br />
<br />
And are you going to have 1 or 2 Dutch cities (or do you call it HOLLAND). If you take a second city, take Rotterdam. It's famous for the bombing raid by 100 Heinkels. The Dutch already surrendered, but the Heinkels still bombed R'dam, killing over a 1000 people, making 34000 homeless and destroying over a 2000 buildings.<br />

I read somewhere that the first bombers that flew over to Britain, had to refuel on Greenland. One of those convoys couldn't find the airbase there and ran out of fuel. Maybe they didn't refuel later. I don't know. And did you kow the Allied had three American/English bases in Russia? They weren't allowed to do much, but what they did do is dropping food/ammo/etc. for the resistance in Warsaw.<br />

Also in the end the Italians revolted and the Germans confiscated everything and took over comletely. They also sank the entire Italian fleet including one famous episode where a battleship was sunk by a wire guided glider bomb.<br />
<br />
In the scenario, the Germans will have the option to annex their satellites if they are uncooperative. <br />
<br />
Finland also turned coat after they couldn't hold off the Russians anymore and they fought on both sides and managed to stay independent. Same thing happend in Romania (or was that Bulgaria). So you see its quite realistic.</div></div><hr />

OK OK OK OK I will squeeze the B-17 in somehow ....<br />
<br />
Did some checking, courtesty of<br />
  http://www.aviation-history.com/index-aircraft.htm  <br />
<br />
B-17 max payload 6,000 pounds and max range 1,100 miles<br />
<br />
Lancaster max payload 14,000 pounds and max range 1,660 miles<br />
<br />
B-24 max payload 8,000 pounds and max range 2,200 miles<br />
<br />
B-29 max payload 20,000 pounds and max range 4,200 miles<br />
<br />
Well as you can see, the B-17 is an early design and not even in the same class as the Lanc. Other than for sentimental reasons, the B-17 really isn't relevant to the scenario scheme. I could really use this redundant slot to add the SU-100 tank destroyer.<br />
<br />
added later<br />
<br />
HE-277 max payload 9,000 pounds and max range 9,600 miles (cause it had another role - as sea recon and anti-shipping for another variant and it was meant to eventually drop the A-bomb on America)<br />

<br />
<br />
I tried to find something official about the US Bombers since I was apparently out numbered on the issue of the B-17. I finally came up with the US Strategic Bombing Survey Report (sept 1945) which was established by the Secretary of War of the period.<br />
  http://www.anesi.com/ussbs02.htm  <br />
<br />
It contains many interesting facts among which:<br />
<br />
The Allies dropped 2.7 million tons of bombs in total.<br />
<br />
About 160,000 Allied airmen were lost in action.<br />
<br />
Over 40,000 Allied planes were lost or damaged beyond repair.<br />
<br />
The Luftwaffe was defeated not because they ran out of planes (of which they had plenty) but because they ran out of pilots and fuel.<br />
<br />
Beyond disrupting oil supplies (this proved to be instrumental in Germany's defeat), the bombing of other targets proved to have little effect on production which continued to increase. Plenty of cities were leveled in the process. The report also says that the RAF tried daylight bombing in 1940 and gave up after sustaining heavy losses. <br />
<br />
The interesting coment was that the B-17s of the 8th Air Force had limited range and effect when they were introduced in late 1942. They also mistakenly thought that the B-17s could fly unescourted in daylight but by 1943 when losses became unacceptably high, they too gave up on daylight unescourted bombing. It was only when long range escourts (i.e. Mustangs) became available in early 1944 did the 8th Air Force's bombers become viable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alcibiaties of Athenae</div><div class="date">Mar 24, 2001, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last deep penetration raids that were unescorted by fighters was the Scweinfurt/Regensburg raid on 17th August 1943, and the second Scweinfurt raid of 14th October, 1943. Over 60 Flying Fortresses were lost by the strike force out of 376 dispatched in the first raid, and 60 were lost out of 291 in the second raid. Unescorted bombing was never possible without heavy losses. My point is that the Lancaster would have been lost in even greater numbers then the more sturdy B-17. The biggist fans of the Flying Fortress were oddly enough, the German pilots that fought against it! Adolph Galland, German ace and commander of all German fighters in the second half of WWII said as much in his book &quot;The first and the Last&quot;. Steinhoff and Nowotny also were of the view that the B-17 was a dangerous plane to engage in the skies over the Reich. The survey was correct. Strategic daylight bombimg bled the Luftwaffe white, and by 1945 had laid waste German fuel industry, and wrecked transportation routes throughout Europe. It never reduced German production in the long run. Germany built more single engine fighters in 1944 alone then it did from 1933-42! The Flying Fortress was the queen of the skies over Europe. The last word goes to the crews of the planes themselves, who said that that they would rather serve on a B-17 more then any other bomber, even the B-29!<br />
