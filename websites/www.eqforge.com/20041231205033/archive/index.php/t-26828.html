<br />
0.  This is a fun trivia game....<br />
<br />
1. Cumulative Trivia is different from Cumulative Quizzes.  The main areas of difference are set off in a quote block for clarity:<br />
<br />
(1).   The objective: Trivia, info, and tidbits related to the world of computers.<br />
<br />
(2).  This is a fast-moving thread:  48 hours (max) from question post to the next question is the limit.<br />
<br />
(3).  Research IS allowed... online, books, friends, etc.  The one caveat is if you don't know the info from your own knowledge, simply state the specific reference (&amp; hyperlink, if internet-based).  This is not a battle of individual &quot;smarts&quot; or memory retention, but an exchange of info and trivia.<br />
<br />
(4). Current questioner:  visit at least daily (preferably a few times a day while your question is active) to check replies; you can give hints if you like.  If the question is not aswered to your satisfaction within 48 hours (maximum) of your first post of your question, then state the answer (and reference, if you used one) and either ask a new question or pass the question to another participant.<br />
<br />
(5). Respondants:  Check back by that 48 hours after you post your reply, because the original author will have confirmed or rejected your reply by then. You are expected to post  your new question by the end of the 48 hour limit from the previous question... <br />
<br />
(6). The basic idea is that anyone, even computer neophytes and non-native English speakers, can effectively participate :)  You need only be able to locate or research info... databases and reference books are cool  :cool: .<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  All questions need to be related to computers, software, computer history, historical people in computing, etc.<br />
<br />
3.  If the question ages 48 hours form the original post time/date with no correct reply (as acknowledged by the author), then the 1st one who posted the &quot;right&quot; answer gets the next question; if that is ambigious, then the person who replied immediately after the author's original question can go next &amp; keep the quiz back on track.  :)<br />
<br />
4.  Naturally, question makers should know the exact answer to their question before posting, LOL....<br />
<br />
5.  Again, research is OK, both for questions and for answers.  But try and choose questions that are of at least marginal interest to &quot;average&quot; people.... the kind of general trivia that CFC people might enjoy discussing in real life.<br />
<br />
6.  Note:  researching questions, esp. with internet search engines and reference books will likely add to (or refreshen) your general knowledge for the Cumulative Computer Quiz thread.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 09, 2002, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1:<br />
<br />
Easy....<br />
<br />
What was the name of the first PC hard drive defragmentation program, and what was the name of the program's author?<br />
<br />
Hint#1:  Try looking for terms such as &quot;defrag&quot; and &quot;fragmentation&quot; and &quot;198&quot; (the program came out in the 1980's).<br />
<br />
Another hint will follow in a few hours if no answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sumthinelse</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not the answer, but I thought this metaphor was weird enough to quote:<br />
<br />
&quot;DEFRAG reorganises the hard drive of the industry by taking the lost files of silliness and displaying them on the screen saver of ridicule, while working in gratuitous references to professional wrestling wherever possible. Defrag has never won a Walkley, but Linus Torvalds suggested Kerrie Murphy was on drugs after she theorised the Linux penguin would lose a deathmatch against the BSD Deamon.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the search engine did not seem to help out too much (too hard to extract the exact info) when I tried to use it to see what ya'll might locate. <br />
<br />
So I'll state the references and answer, and choose to pass the question to the closest answer.<br />
<br />
References:<br />
- My original box &amp; manuals of Norton Utilities 4.5 (1988).<br />
- Using the original program Spinrite in 1988-89.<br />
- 1991 Microsoft DOS 5.0, manual page 207-08.<br />
- http://grc.com/<br />
<br />
Answer:<br />
<br />
Steve Gibson wrote a program calle &quot;Spinrite&quot; in 1988 that could do a lot of things, including the now-commmon defrag.  Others followed shortly.  My Norton Utilities 4.5 from 1988 does not have Speedisk (Peter Norton's defrag program).... but NU jumped right on it, and even MS eventually followed suite.  Originally, defragging was even touted (mainly by Gibson) to extend the life of a dard drive because the heads and servos did not have to move around as much (HD crashes were more common back in 1988).<br />
<br />
&quot;Spinrite&quot; (much changed!) is still in existance today, and currently in version 5.  It  no longer defrags, changes sector interleaves, or supports MFM and RLL drives... but it does do an excellent job of predicting, detecting, and fixing hard drive errors and recovering from certain kinds of data loss.  The program is $89, however, and is not really the best value for home users with modern (reliable) hard drives. <br />
<br />
<br />
As a historical note, here is Microsoft's original method, on page 207-08 of their MS DOS 5.0 manual (I still have mine) to compete with Gibson's Spinrite.  I sh!t you not:<br />
<br />
&quot;If your system is reading and writing information more slowly than usual, the files on your disk might be fragmented.  If you don't have a disk-compaction program ... you might want to compact your disk by reformatting&quot;<br />
<br />
:lol:<br />
<br />
The &quot;Microsoft Solution!!&quot;   Reformat your drive!  Why not take out a hammer and bash your machine to bits?  No more &quot;disk compaction&quot; worries, right?!<br />
<br />
But Microsoft, ever the master of the obvious, went on to thoughfully warn: &quot;... the FORMAT command deletes all files on your hard disk.&quot;  Hmmm... yup, with no files, fragmentation should not be an issue for the average user ;).<br />
<br />
Micro$oft actually listed this as the third of the 3 &quot;advantages&quot; (as MS saw it) of wiping out your hard drive:<br />
<br />
&quot;- Doesn't require you to purchase additional software.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gee M$, how thoughtful!!!!  <br />
<br />
No need for us to support innovative software authors and companies like Gibson and Norton!!   But a year or so later, MS put the true innovators out of  business with the release of MS DOS 6.xx.<br />
<br />
M$ stole the utility and included the DOS command, &quot;DEFRAG&quot;, as a  command prompt defragger for the first time.  This effectively ended profitable independent innovation in this area.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ainwood's reply of &quot;Norton Disk Doctor&quot; (aka NDD) is actually not a defragmenter.... NU's Speedisk is the defragmenter.<br />
<br />
But....  since ainwood was the closest, I'll pass the next question to Ainwood....<br />
<br />
So it's your question, Ainwood!<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Add more info.</div></div><hr />

The earliest one I can think of is EZ something. Then they got a bunch of money and became EZCORP but I think they didn't do well after they got bigger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not the one I was after. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is also the &quot;killer app&quot; that was responsible for really fueling the massive growth of the PC!!!  And I remember it well, drooling over it, but unable to afford either it or a PC as a college student :( .    <br />
<br />
The spreadsheet was VisiCalc, and I know for a fact it ran on the TRS-80, The Apple II, and the IBM PC, and maybe even more PCs of the era.  I know 1983, and I think also 1982, were years of the Spreadsheet.  So I'll say it came out in 1982.  I believe the company name was VisiCalc, as well as their flagship product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sumthinelse</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I think VisiCalc changed its name to VisiCorp when it got bigger. <br />
<br />
(Not intended as an answer: There was a  later  company that tried to compete with VisiCalc. That company's name was Visi-On. Don't you love these cute 1980s company names?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jul 11, 2002, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was visicalc.  It came out in 1979.:goodjob:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sumthinelse</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry about that. I was out in the monsoons, literally.<br />
<br />
For Intel processors 8086, 286, 386, 486, Pentium you can buy an &quot;ICE&quot; machine from Intel. What does &quot;ICE&quot; stand for and what does it do?<br />
<br />
Yes, I know the answer is easy to find but it's educational....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, seeing as research is allowed, I had a look.  I presume you weren't after &quot;Indiana Computing Educators&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rather than put the answer I found, could you expand the question to also include an explanation of the term?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No need to research that one. :p<br />
<br />
ICE stands for &quot;in-circuit emulation&quot;.<br />
An ICE device acts as a &quot;normal&quot; CPU but is controlled by the actual CPU. It monitors the bus for certain events to set a breakpoint for the CPU. Once this happens, the CPU gets into ICE mode and can perform certain functions specified in the instruction set.<br />
<br />
In-circuit emulation is a hardware emulation method not only used by Intel, but for Intel processors it fulfills certain task like breakpoint handling. It considerable speeds up the CPU.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sumthinelse</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Explain the term? Er, that's what you are supposed to do -- tell me what an intel &quot;ICE&quot; machine is. <br />
<br />
The three letters are the starting letters of an intel product.<br />
<br />
I would search for &quot;486 ice&quot; &quot;pentium ice&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Correct. We called it &quot;In Circuit Emulator.&quot; really the same thing.<br />
<br />
When your machine has a hard-to debug bug (how the **** did it do that???), for example, you can get a trace of the instructions and other cycles that led up to the error. Expensive but useful. You have to take out the pentium (or 486 or whatever) chip and replace it with the ICE probe. Be careful not to bend those pins!<br />
<br />
Lucky, you are up!</div></div><hr />

Make that 18 months ;)....  For awhile, some pundits have been predicting the demise of it, but so far, it's held up for over 20 years.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2002, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That the number of transistors on a CPU will double every 18 months. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep! <br />
The law was actually inspired by the linear development in semiconductor technology, the linear decrease in structure width. Moore deducted from that, that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would also grow in a linear way. :yeah:<br />
<br />
Either of you, Serutan or ainwood, go on.<br />

Ok, here goes again:<br />
<br />
Describe the OSI network reference model (all layers)! Is it the correct model for the <br />
<br />
networks (e.g. internet) of today? If not, which model is and what are the differences?<br />
:D <br />
<br />
  The layers (from the ISO site) are (descriptions are<br />
 fuzzy memories of networking class):<br />
  <br />
1. Physical layer  <br />
-- The actual hardware.<br />
  <br />
2 Data link layer<br />
-- More or less the driver software for the HW.<br />
  <br />
3 Network layer<br />
-- The protocol S/W<br />
  <br />
4 Transport layer  <br />
-- Interface between O/S and higher levels.<br />
  <br />
5 Session layer<br />
-- More or less a UNIX socket.<br />
  <br />
6 Presentation layer<br />
-- Interface between socket &amp; user S/W.<br />
  <br />
7 Application layer  <br />
-- User application.<br />
<br />
 OSI is not the current Internet model.  Although a nice abstraction, in practice a literal <br />
<br />
implementation would be too<br />
cumbersome (too many layers, too much overhead).<br />
<br />
  The current model is 1973's TCP/IP.  It has (IIRC) 4 layers,<br />
which (again IIRC) maps the following way:<br />
<br />
 TCP/IP level 1 maps to OSI level 1.<br />
 TCP/IP level 2 maps to OSI levels 2-4.<br />
 TCP/IP level 3 maps to OSI level  5-6.<br />
 TCP/IP level 4 maps to OSI level 7.</div></div><hr />

When they took it apart to figure out what went wrong, it turned out that a moth was causing the problem... it was a removed, but the the discussion about the insect in the machine stuck... and instead of moth or insect, they referred to it as a bug in the machine.  It came to mean any general glitch in the hardware of the era (1940's).  As hardware became more reliable, more and more glitches originated in the analogue wiring, and later in the digital software.... and today, it usually refers to a glitch (or unintended error) in software.<br />

<br />
Answer:<br />
<br />
USB 2.0 runs at speeds 40 times more than that of USB 1.1.   USB 2.0 includes everything that USB 1.1 offers and adds a high-speed mode, which  runs at 480Mbps. USB 1.1 supports two speed modes: 1.5 and 12Mbps whereas USB 2.0 has  three of them: 1.5, 12 and 480Mbps. USB 2.0 also uses the same USB 1.1 compliant cables to  connect high-speed devices. However, classic USB hubs will slow down USB 2.0 devices. In addition, a USB 2.0 host controller is required to enable the high-speed connection with a USB 2.0 device. Plugging a USB 1.1 device to a USB 2.0 hub  is okay, but connecting a USB 2.0 device to a USB 1.1 hub is prohibited.  USB 1.1 devices still operate at 12Mbps at full-speed and 1.5Mbps at low-speed on a USB 2.0 bus.   Even though USB 1.1 devices won?t run any faster, they can work alongside of USB 2.0 devices on the same bus.<br />

<br />
 Must've been a cut-and-paste error then.  The problem (IIRC) was that the S/W was reacting to sensor readings as if it were in<br />
an Ariane IV instead of a V, and in IV terms, the data indicated<br />
a situation that required self-destruct or some such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The actual mistake was an overflow error when converting the altitude data from float to integer. It worked in the Ariane IV because it was not as high as the V in the same time.<br />

<br />
As for the FORTRAN version, I'm pretty sure that back then, that with programming by punch cards that it was a lot of trial and error/testing. ( I guess this error was not caught! Might have actually been a hardware error though in this case but I don't have any facts to substantiate the claim.) Definitely had no precomplier to help in debugging (Some systems produce Punched tape from the cards but I'm sure that was not the process on this system.). Oh, I've did some programming of FORTRAN on punch cards so it is not really a guess cause even in later years this sort of thing was happening and precompilers were implemented to reduce codeing errors. :) <br />

After thinking about it like I should have, I'm sure the problem was not in the Fortran spec, but completely a compiler issue.  Ours would reject on pass#1 based on syntax errors, so I never had experience with compilers that allowed faulty code to execute.  APL would do that, but it was an interpreted interactive language.... but when it hit a bad syntax, even that would be identified and execution halted.  It boggles my mind that at least a two-pass compiler did not process all code, even if the testers did not do their job and generate test cases to exercise all sections, no matter how obscure, of the source code.<br />

Absolutely.  In 1961 (when this S/W would have been written), even Fortran IV was a figment of the imagination. Also,<br />
compilers had only existed for 5 or so years at this time...<br />
I suspect (but cannot cite evidence) that this probably helped<br />
trigger development of the multpass compiler.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
OK, hmmmm.  Let's see.  <br />
<br />
Hard drives.  What is the difference in a &quot;primary&quot; hard drive and a &quot;secondary&quot;, with regard to the BIOS in a PC?<br />
<br />
And what is the difference in a &quot;master&quot; and a &quot;slave&quot;?  In regards to hard drives.  Computer hard disk drives, that is.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Primary: The drive, usually assigned to the letter C: by the BIOS, where it will look for an operating system. Newer BIOS software allows choosing a specific drive though.<br />
Secondary: Well, the drive the BIOS will not look for an OS. Again, a newer BIOS may be able to select several harddisks to look for an OS.<br />
<br />
Master: The drive that has the primary connection to the IDE bus. Must be installed for that specific IDE connection to be activated.<br />
Slave: Can only be plugged in when a master is present on that IDE connection.<br />
<br />
Master/Slave is for IDE bus systems, but not for example for SCSI drives.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 11, 2002, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty close.  Good enough so you get the next question, Lucky  :).<br />
<br />
<br />
But here is what I was talking about...  The Primary channel is the INT 14 (interrupts are assignable, but the convention is INT 14) for the primary, in BIOS.  The Primary can have a Master and Slave IDE device attached to the same interrupt.<br />
<br />
The Secondary channel (INT 15, by default) also can have a master and secondary device attached, giving a total 4 IDE devices on an average system.   <br />
<br />
The devices are usually hard drives, but CD ROMS, CD RWs and even lots of less-common devices like the Zip drive can hook up, though each device must be set as master or slave.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can also add extra cards, with tertiary and quadrenary (3rd and 4th) IDE channels, each supporting another master and slave.<br />
<br />
If you want more than 4 total IDE devices (e.g, hard drives, CD ROM/RWs, Zips, etc.), then you need to cough up more interrupts, and (unless you have a special motherboard) need to add a $40 IDE card.<br />
<br />
Your question, Lucky!</div></div><hr />

Oh and starlifter, I thought we shouldn´t be that technical. <br />
Hope you have a boat or some golashes!   The answer just sounded techincal... it is just the very basic, but confusing, way that IDE ATAPI drives work (e.g, 4 on most machines.. 2 on each interrupt, a master &amp; slave, and a Primary... these determine the drive lettering that some people have discussed in other posts lately, and should be understood by people adding a new hard drive, as some have recently posted).<br />

<br />
<br />
My answers will assume single cables, not enroute signal enhancers that can extend range dramatically, like USB up to about 80 ft.   This is a good reference document for people that don't know about computer cabling... great question Lucky, and it is very useful for people, too!!<br />

<br />
<br />
SCSI <br />
<br />
The SCSI question are trick (I use SCSI a lot, even to write this!).  Cable length is not a function of those terms, as phrased.<br />
<br />
Ultra = 50 pin cable (assuming internal) (8-bit devices)<br />
Ultra Wide = 68 pin cable (16-bit devices)<br />
Ultra2 SCSI, U2W-SCSI, Ultra3 SCSI - LVD<br />
<br />
SCSI Cable Length is a function of transmission method (the send/acknowledge turnaround), and waveform.  The faster (in MHz) the signal, the shorter the cable.  <br />
<br />
These are total cable lengths, from adapter to device (or device to device if adapter in middle):<br />
<br />
Non-Fast devices (basically SCSI-1, 5MHz): 6 meters (19.7 feet)<br />
Fast devices (e.g., SCSI-2, 10MHz) - 3 m, 9.8 feet)<br />
Ultra (20MHz) - 1.5m (4.9 ft)<br />
LVD devices (e.g., U2W) - 12m (39.4ft) , but can change, based on characteristic line impedence. <br />
<br />
EXTRA CREDIT:<br />
Any SCSI Differential device = 27m (88ft) ... but conservatively used at 25m (82ft).<br />
<br />
<br />
OTHER <br />
<br />
USB - Trick question (more than one std answer)- Full speed (12 mbps) = 3 meters (16 feet); 1.5 mbps =  3m.<br />
10BaseT (10Mbit ethernet, twisted pair, Cat5) - 100 meters<br />
100BaseT - 100 meters<br />
Firewire (IEEE-1394) - Trick question (depends on cable type).  Common 28 AWG = 4.5 meters, but 24 AWG = 10m, and Optical = 700m.<br />
RS232 (old, slow serial port: 9600baud) - 15 m, 50 ft.<br />
<br />
EXTRA CREDIT...<br />
<br />
RS232 (Normal Serial, DTE: 64,0000 bits/s) - 3 m, 10 ft.<br />
Parallel Cable (Old Centronics) - 15 feet (9 is safer!)<br />
Parallel Cable (IEEE-1284) - 30 feet in length (go short for data reliability!)<br />

What is advantages &amp; disadvanatages to using the following formats for an avatar: JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF PSD<br />
<br />
JPEG is very good at cutting down on a picture's file size but is not that good at preserving some details. GIF also cuts down file size but not as much as JPEG, it retains more detail and can have transparency. BMP has several different types which can hold differrent amounts of colors which are: 24-bit Bitmap, 16 color Bitmap, 256 color Bitmap, and Monochrome Bitmap. Generally BMP are large and don't lose color unless you save it in a type that doesn't support that many colors. Don't know about the other two formats there.<br />
<br />
Also, which are lossless and which are lossy?<br />
<br />
In my experince if you use the right type BMP don't are lossless, GIF are lossy but not much, and JPEG can be pretty lossy at times.<br />

<br />
The GIF can have a transparent background.(Which is why so many avatars are in GIF format!)<br />

For the graphics programs, I'll get back to you on that.;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 23, 2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is advantages &amp; disadvanatages to using the following formats for an avatar: JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF PSD<br />
<br />
JPEG - Lossy, true color (16.7 million), best in natural life (not straight edges &amp; same-colored areas).  Variable compression (small size/poorer quality to larger size/higher quality).  Can be interlaced (aka &quot;progressive&quot;).<br />
<br />
GIF - Lossless (in detail), but can be lossy in color shifts because of its small palette (256 colors), best for most graphics, cartoons, things with continious stretches of the same exact color (they will compress more).  Can have transparant background, and can be interlaced (aka &quot;progressive&quot;).   The GIF89a standard allows animations, text blocks, and extensions.<br />
<br />
BMP - Not compressed; Normally 256 color palette, but some software has options for 16 bit and 24 bit in addition to 8 bit color.  Best for graphics at 256 color.  At True Color (24 bit, 16.7 million), BMP will store a lossless image with exact color... but the file is huge, and generally not suitable for websites and internet transfer due to large size.<br />
<br />
TIFF - Several companies developed the Tagged Image Format (including Aldus and Silicon Graphics) to be the ultimate image file format.  It is lossless, and true color, and has many ways of compression.  It can actually support up to 48 bit color (true color is only 24 bit).  A TIFF good for archiving an exact copy of the work, but while it is smaller than the BMP, it is generally larger than GIF and JPEG (unless using one of the newest experimental TIFF compression formats).  I typically save edits in TIFF, and then convert them to GIF or JPEG when the result is done.  Future re-editing is done from the TIFF, not JPEG and generally not the GIF.<br />
<br />
<br />
PSD - Photoshop Document.  This is the ultimate format if you use high end editing software, since it can store channels, layers, and lots more information than other formats.  It is lossless and exact color, naturally.  And it is big.  Many programs cannot read it, and PSD is not good for Web/Internet usage... but excellent (better than TIFF) for high end editing and use.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, which are lossless and which are lossy?<br />
The bit battern of the image is lossless in .BMP and .GIF, but the colors may be altered (approximated), depending on color depth selected, # of original colors, palette transform, method, the pallet itself (e.g., windows standard, netscape standard, optmization method, etc.).<br />
<br />
Which is generally best for graphics &amp; cartoons?<br />
GIFs.  Typical graphics are usually limited in colors (GIFs are limited to max of 256), and the actual bit pattern is lossless.  The color may be shifted (see prior answer).<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is generally best for natural life?<br />
JPEG, since it uses 24bit color, and a cosine transform to approximate what looks &quot;best&quot; to the human eye.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which can have transparent background?<br />
GIFs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To clarify some of Piny's answers, JPEGs are always 24-bit color.  Layers are not what gives transparancy and animation.  Animation is simply consecutive images stored in one file, according to the GIF89a specification.  Transparancy is setting a particular color (the &quot;background color&quot;) to &quot;transparant&quot;, which means the image's pixels of that color are not rendered when displayed, and whatever is underneath shows through.  There is much development in the world of graphic standards, but the problem in the end for any &quot;latest, greatest&quot; thing is widespread compatibility.  GIF and JPEG are no longer the absolute best for web use, but they are the most universal and compatible!<br />
