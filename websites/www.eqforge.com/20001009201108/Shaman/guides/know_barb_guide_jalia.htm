      <font color="#333366"><b><font size="3">Levels 1-4</font></b></font>
      <p>You start out in Halas, a not very large town but it has just about
      everything you need. Wander around a little and hail the npc's to see if
      they have anything interesting to say. Some of them may want to send you
      on quests, and some of those quests are simple and useful at the early
      levels. Then, when you've memorized your spells, take the ferry across the
      lake. After your first trip you will probably start doing what most people
      do, which is to swim across. It's usually faster and it increases your
      swimming skill.</p>
      <p>On the far side you will zone into Everfrost. This is your hunting
      ground, and is divided into two halves. The eastern half is the plains,
      full of nasties that you don't want to go near for several levels yet. Far
      to the east is permafrost, a dungeon for very high level characters; you
      may notice powerful players coming through on occasion because of this.</p>
      <p>The western half of Everfrost is a maze of paths that wind between
      frost-covered hills and chasms. This is the newbie area, with Halas on the
      north end and Blackburrow on the south. It's easy to get lost out here;
      there are not a lot of players about, and there are many things for you to
      kill. It's an excellent place to hunt. Everything except the spiders and
      skeletons are agressive and will attack without provocation, especially
      gnolls and goblins. You can get in over your head very quickly, and you
      can get lost easily if you wander. Stay close to home for the first couple
      of levels... you will find yourself running for the guards with a sizeable
      train following at some point. Gnolls and goblins carry money and
      sometimes sacks and backpacks or other good loot, so kill them when you
      can, and kill any skeleton that carries a weapon, especially a staff. The
      merchants by the tents in the cavern will give you a good price for them.</p>
      <p>I strongly suggest teaming with at least one other player, even when
      you're starting out. The beasties will gang up on you, so you need to gang
      up on them. At some point you're going to find yourself waist-deep in
      polar bears, wolves, goblins, and gnolls, and you'll need help taking them
      all down. Don't be shy -- ask others, especially those of about your
      level, if they'd like to team up. It's for your own safety, and theirs as
      well. Just two players of 3rd to 5th level can wade through a pile of
      beasties without too much trouble, especially if one is a shaman.</p>
      <p>Going solo, even at 5th level, is more of a risk. I can't stress enough
      that you will, at times, be battling 3-6 beasties at once. Multiple polar
      bear cubs can wear down even a 5th level character who's soloing.</p>
      <p>Save those ruined bear pelts, and if you don't take up tailoring, find
      someone who has. There is no excuse for a barbarian to not have a set of
      patchwork armor by 6th level at least; polar bear cubs are everywhere and
      drop pelts a lot, so the raw materials are more plentiful than anywhere
      else that I know of.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#333366" size="3">Level 5</font></b></p>
      <p>You get new spells, including Frost Blast (which will immediately
      replace your flame blast as your preffered direct damage spell) and Gate,
      which instantly transports you back to where you spawn when you die.
      What's not so cool about this is that, for a fifth level shaman, it will
      cost more than half of your mana to cast, and may well fizzle out.
      Practice it a lot. It will allow you to not worry about getting lost, but
      it isn't a great way to excape a battle at this level. There is also the
      spell Sicken, a direct damage/poison spell which you can't get in Halas
      but you CAN get out on the plains. It's well worth it, but this might be a
      dangerous journey for a 5th level shaman. Ask a more powerful shaman about
      where to find it and how to get there safely.</p>
      <p>Gnoll pups, goblin whelps, and decaying skeletons are no longer worth
      experience points. Unfortunately, bears, wolves, and spiders don't carry
      weapons or cash, so you may find yourself killing the smaller monsters
      anyway. More powerful gnolls and goblins can be found, but not easily and
      not a great number of them. Until you reach sixth level, it's still a good
      idea to take on every bear cub and wolf that you find.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#333366" size="3">Levels 6-7</font></b></p>
      <p>You can now wander the newbie area without fear, but will find precious
      little worth killing, just the occasional wooly spider or goblin scout.
      It's time for you to move on, and this means either to Blackburrow or to
      Qeynos Hills, on the other side of Blackburrow. If you group with others,
      you might brave the Everfrost plains, but there are lots of nasties out
      there than can chew through a 6th level shaman in a hurry. If alone, I
      reccoment killing the four gnoll guards that spawn at the entrance to
      Blackburrow, or hunting in Qeynos Hills. Otherwise, you should group. I
      also travelled to Western Karana at this level (very dangerous) and the
      Toxxilia forest near Erudin (across the water, you will need to group to
      hunt there and there are few players about to group with). Basically these
      are really difficult levels to get through, you just have to persevere.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#333366" size="3">Levels 8-9</font></b></p>
      <p>When you reach level 8, make a trip back to Halas and put one practice
      point into Meditate. You will be ever so grateful to have this skill! At
      this point, you are going to want to save all of the money you can just to
      buy the 9th level spells once you get there. You can hunt in Western
      Karanas or on the Everfrost plains with a little more confidence at this
      level, but the best loot will come from the gnolls in Blackburrow, and you
      need the cash. Group if you can, and if you're desperate for cash, bash on
      gnoll pups and goblin welps/scouts. You won't get experience, buy you'll
      raise the capital you need for your spells.</p>
      <p>When you reach 9th level you will get some very nice spells. Spirit of
      Wolf is a very cool spell; you can make friends everywhere you go by
      casting this spell, and you can earn money. More importantly, you can run
      from all of the nasties out on the plains or in Western Karana, save the
      dreaded hill giant. You can hunt with confidence now, even kite a little.
      Also you'll get Tainted Breath out on the plains (your first serious
      Damage over Time spell, although still not that great), and if you go to
      Qeynos and have a human friend buy for you, you can get Serpent Sight. You
      will never need a lantern or torch again.</p>
      <p>Once you've gotten a bubble into 9th level, you are more than ready to
      make that trip to Rivervale, Freeport, or even the far continent of
      Faydwer. As a precaution, bank any possessions you can't afford to lose,
      then cast spirit of the wolf and run run run! The further you get from
      Halas, the fewer shaman you'll find, and the easier it will be to group
      with other players. However, if you only get as far as Rivervale and Misty
      Thicket, you will at least have found a great place to hunt for the next
      two to four levels. Have fun!</p>
