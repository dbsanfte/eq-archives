Any thoughts or opinions regarding possible strategies?  I know it is early since the map and rules aren't out yet, but how about some basics considering we have religious, industrious, and a war chariot?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking less warlike than the Germans in GOTM8.<br />
<br />
What do any of you think about skipping the charriots to avoid the early golden age?  <br />
<br />
Potential neighbors: Romans and Greeks.  Obviously there is no  on this, but I'd say they are more likely than any of the others, dependant on Matrix's whims.<br />
<br />
I am thinking more of a building game with a larger focus on culture.  But then again, crushing your foes never gets old. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philippe</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it would be interesting to have a island gotm.<br />
island sux and it is more difficult.more a challenge an that the big players here will not get a huge advantage be exazmple building pyramids early because pyramids is only for 1 continent etc....<br />
so i wat a island game.seems like fun.but there should be a huge coast not only sea or else we are stuck on a island and we cannot sail to see other civs</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knowing my(everybody's) luck with starts in the GOTM, we'll either start in the jungle or on some 3 billion year old, 10 square island, covered with mountans except 2 hills and a desert. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally think the egyptions have my favariot two attributes, industries = fast early roads = more growth = faster everything,   religous = cheap tempels = taking cities can rush temples to prevent flipping easily; = no time between govs = ROCK!!!   I personally would prefer to hold off on my GA unless we end up on a pangea, then I will probably just hold off using the untill the discovery of chivalry, hit hard, GA, and upgrade tons of war chariots to knights, go for earliest conquest vic!   If though I think I took to long I will use all that land in another attempt to learn how to milk, that way I will at least place high.  The real question we should be pondering hear Pinky is what difficulty setting will the next GOM be on!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gregski</div><div class="date">Jun 27, 2002, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Religious modifier is certainly my favourite, but the industrious can be a bit of a problem. Normally I try to create groups of 3 workers (1 turn to build the road, 2 to mine), but with industrious 1.5 workers would be the preferred unit size.<br />
Unless I can get foreign workers, things will be a bit wasteful. Last time I was the Egyptians, I managed to buy a few workers and paired up home workers with foreign ones to get the 1.5 worker unit.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I'm in for an archipae...island map. ;)<br />
<br />
I think I'll turn off the culturally linked starting positions. Or is that a bad idea?<br />

Maximum number of Civs? :)</div></div><hr />

Sounds fine to me.  I could take it our leave it.  Wish we'd have done that with the last one so we weren't next to those expansionists and their scouts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Player:          Egyptian (this way I'm sure to get 1 right) <br />
Level:            Regent<br />
# Rivals:        7<br />
Map size:       Large<br />
Barbarian:     Roaming <br />
<br />
and I hoping for:<br />
Non-culture linked rivals<br />
large land masses (40% water)<br />
maybe remove a couple of victory conditions to add some spice</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised we haven't had a cheiftan yet, and releived.  KNOCK ON WOOD KNOCK ON WOOD!!  I personally would like it to be monarck or above.  Another Diety would be fun but I don't think we'll have one of those for another year or so.  But I would live with any GOM just if it got here sooner.   Regent though, how may out there would like to play on a regent level game?  Easy builder game at the least.</div></div><hr />

I'll give any of them a try, but I would prefer regent and above.  I hope we don't have a chieften ever, but if the powers that be want one, that is their call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too would prefer a more difficult game, but the lower level ones can be challenging in their own right.  For example if you are used to playing on a higher level you tend to be very concerned about happiness.  You don't have to be on the lower settings.  This changes the way you play a bit.  I think it is good to mix them up, and have both the most difficult and the easiest with the whole realm in between.<br />
<br />
The fun in the GOTM is trying parts of the game that you don't normally try!!:)</div></div><hr />

Even though I haven't played many emperor games and haven't won any yet, its more fun playing on a tougher level.</div></div><hr />

They are &quot;Civ with training wheels&quot; intended for new players, to ease them into the game.<br />
<br />
GOTM is a competition.  How often do you see cyclists using training wheels in the Tour de France?<br />
<br />
Counter-argument: How often do you see Civ 3 players get corporate sponsership?  :)</div></div><hr />

I'd go for for Monarch or higher on the difficulty level.<br />

I always go for max number of civs.<br />

I've been reading the forums for a while now and I have learned a lot from all the quality posts.<br />

I've been looking forward to try the GOTM feature and this month, I will give it a try.<br />
<br />
A tough try it will be since I've never played at emperor level :confused: <br />

Looking forward to post in the spoiler thread to see how I performed on my first GOTM game.<br />

If you are curious for possible strategies on how to play an archipelago map on Emperor, you may want to look at the game I played in Epic#2, an archipelago Emperor (small map) game with variant scoring rules. :D<br />

Which reminds me, in one of yer other games I read, you said you knew that you were only 6 squares from getting the Dom.Victory, then later you went over the limit and it still took a couple turns to win, my question is: how did you know how many squares you had left before the win? Can you link me?</div></div><hr />

Choose where you want to download it.  Once this is doen, you should have a file called “Civ3GOTM09.SAV”.  You should check that the file is about 78 kb in size.  It should be able to be opened from civ III.  Note that you have to start civ III, and choose “Opend save game” (or similar) from the menu – you can’t double-click the file to open it.  Good luck! :)</div></div><hr />
