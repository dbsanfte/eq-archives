This is the best land I've seen in ANY Civ3 game! :)<br />
Rivers, resources, luxeries!<br />
Too bad there's jungle to the south - I sure hope I have this continent/island to myself!</div></div><hr />

I wanted to play a good GOTM for a change but I'm getting my *ss kicked by the English. Well, not really but because of this everlasting war I can't develop and both the English and the Russians are in te medieval period and I'm far from it. :( And to make matters worse Frankfurt went to the Russians because of culture flipping. My temple there was almost done!!! :cry:<br />
<br />
I wanna cheat and give myself one modern armor. :mad: I would if it wasn't a GOTM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm currently attacking Russia, and am slaughtering them with 15 swordsmen. <br />

The jungle hasn't really been a big deal, but those crazy horsemen stacks are really annoying.</div></div><hr />

Except for the barb hordes.  England and France have been having it out with each other while me and Russia have stayed peaceful.  I'm finishing up some of the barb camps north and expanding that way.   Just set up my horse city and I have a city in the jungle at Size 4 pumping out spearmen and swordsmen.  I've got the 3 nearby lux as well.  I'm more a Warlord player with a few forays into Regent usually ending in disaster so trying to stay on good terms as much as I can in this game.  Someone is already eliminated elsewhere according to the latest chart of the top nations.  England is getting close to being hit hard and out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Russia and England have been warring for years with Russia gaining the most ground.  English seem to be defending their cities with a rifleman - spearman combo even though they are technologically advanced and leading in the histograph.<br />
<br />
I signed MPP's with France and Japan (maybe that will stop the Russians demanding stuff from me) and have them now both gracious.<br />
<br />
India are down to one city due to a previous war with Japan I think so of course they then decided to declare war on Russia who are quite big, with a huge military and on the other side of the world. (Crazy AI)<br />
<br />
Hopefully some more good tech trading will enable me to get fission the same time the AI gets it so I can build the UN.<br />
<br />
Diplomatic seems to be the only way I can win this (I only just started playing regent this week (and won!))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2002, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, now I'm the largest, with Japan, India, China, England and France at about the same size (a little small than me). England and France seem INTENT on building little towns all over the place! A few of those cities are now being choked by my culture. ;)<br />
<br />
The age of muskets is fast coming, so I may hold off on war after I take the last Russian city. In the meantime, I'll be building my infrastructure and waiting for Panzers to come online. The strange thing is, after I got The Great Wall in a wonder cascade, I haven't seen much of the barb hordes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rangers85</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2002, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT, same with me, when I got the Great Wall by accident (I was prebuilding the Hanging Gardens and forgot to watch turns till completion, finished the Wall same turn as I got Monarchy, STUPID ME!  Still got the Gardens though by some luck).  I haven't seen but a couple barbs since then.  I guess they're attacking all those English and Russian cities around me.  I can definately say I'm not in the top of the world right now.  Other continent had no wars (I forgot only 7 civs) and our continent has only had a English-French war.  I'm holding out till Panzers then will knock off the continent.  May start an early war with the Russians if I can build up enough of a military before Panzers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aebrahim</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2002, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my game, Russia had modern armour around before I even had Panzers! Lack of resources was a problem (no oil or aluminium). As luck would have it, when I got Panzers the English still weren't destroyed, but had two very poorly defended cities. So I took an army of Panzers and killed them off in one turn. Very surgical, and exactly as planned. I didn't want it to last more than 1 turn because of WW, and I *had* to kill them for me not to go into vast disorder. Not only did I get a golden age out of that, but I got a supply of oil as well! :)<br />
<br />
That golden age really saved my ass, because I was quite far behind in tech, and it let me catch up. I got the golden age at the perfect time, just when I had about 5 techs left to get before Laser.<br />
<br />
The golden age gave me a huge cash stash, so when it ran out around when I was getting the Laser, I was able to switch science to 100%. I beat the Chinese by just a very small number of turns I think. :)<br />
<br />
Russia stole my only source of coal when I was in the industrial age. Luckily, by that time coal was not much in demand and I bought it from them on the cheap. Eventually, that city reverted back to me, but not before I started culture whoring like mad in my city next to it. Even when my city was producing 16CP/turn, and theirs none, it still took forever to revert back to me.<br />
<br />
I also did a LOT of drafting as well, because at one point Russia attacked me out of nowhere, and I basically had no standing army. So that did not go so well. Luckily I got the French and the Chinese to sign a MPP, so I didn't take all the brunt.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've posted a savegame in the main GOTM thread if anyone wants to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still playing along but well enough into the game to know what's going on. Haven't seen all of the land where Japan and China are cohabitating with India but that's only because I haven't cared yet.<br />
<br />
I have never seen this much food (wheat, flood, and cows) on one continent. Several areas look the Kansas City stock yards.<br />
<br />
Used the worker as explorer gambit to the east and popped a settler from the huts in the mountains. Sent one archer and warrior south and met Cathy just as Moscow built a settler. When the settler left Moscow to head west and found another city, I killed the settler and the the spearman guard to harvest the two slaves and then recharged hit points for two turns and killed Cathy to avenge all the abuse in GOTM7. Serves her right. Moscow on the floodplain without an adjacent shield bonus caused it to take Cathy 27 turns to make build her first unit, what sort of brain damage causes the AI to ignore balancing food production and shield production while fixating on just building a settler.<br />
<br />
Lots of barbarians are good for making sure all your military units are always promoted up to elite level before attacking the real enemies. Barb warm-ups plus military promotion rates equals death to all neighbors with prior records or deceit an misconduct.<br />
<br />
Locating barbs in the jungle belt is really a PITA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rangers85</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2002, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I just finished my game up.  Got a victory something I haven't even done except by retirement on Regent.  I stayed out of war the whole game and kept everyone polite towards me.  World wars helped that too, since I helped a lot of people in their war efforts with iron or saltpepper.  Everyone but me and England were at war with Russia at one time.  Other continent seemed pretty pacifist towards each other, I think there was only 1 war there.<br />
<br />
I got behind in tech a bit at one point, but I deprived myself of resources to catch up.  Traded away my only hooked up iron source to Russia for 3 techs, 41 gpt, and some gold, then right after that to someone else I traded my only hooked up source of Saltpepper to France for the next 3 techs and some gpt.  This was also in the middle of a French-Russian war.  Plus I had other sources I could have hooked up in 5 turns or less.  After that I caught up and pretty much stayed a tech ahead or even the rest of the game.  I was first to fission, and got the UN.  Buttered everyone up with gifts of about 500-1000 gold (I had a treasury of about 10000 due to all my trades of techs for gpt.)<br />
<br />
Anyways, I never had a golden age in the game and only got the Hanging Gardens, Great Wall, Hoover Dam, and UN.<br />
<br />
Also, got lucky with resources, I seemed to always have one within my borders.  Not sure about aluminum, I was so close I never looked through my territory to see if I had it.  I basically settled going north and got my oil source from the island to the northeast.<br />
<br />
Anyways, wasn't that bad for my first Monarch game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">God</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2002, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game is going well for me. I lead the score with over 1100. Just entered Industrial age. Russia is destroyed by swordsmen 1000 years earlier and I rused FP in Moscow. <br />
<br />
I managed to get Sun Tzus, but lost Bachs, so went for Smiths and got that and also Newtons. Didn't bother with any other wonders, they would have been a waste. <br />
<br />
Currently made MPP with England. France seems threatning and has moved 10 stack archer group, and I'm getting ready for war. The Ai being the idiot it is, didn't upgrade them to atleast longbowmen, so drafting rifles and rushing some others. After I have 30 knights, I'll buy Military Tradition and upgrade for 600 gold only! :D. Then I'll finish off the French. Hopefully England will do some damage to France. <br />
<br />
On the other continent, China declared war on India, and is kicking their @*$. India will be out soon, and I'll try to make a war between China and Japan through MPPs. <br />
<br />
I hope to take out France with Cavalry, and then finish England with Panzers. Then I'll deal with Japan or China. Probably go for spaceship since its the easiest. <br />
<br />
Techs are going good. I don't have military tradition or printing press, but I don't want either of the two as yet. No point in going for democracy because its a waste of turns with anarchy and I'm going to be fighting some wars.</div></div><hr />

I really loved get hit by three stacks of barbarians (25 horsemen each) from three different directions at the same time. I guess that is classed as a national disaster (does wonders for the bank account). Oh, well just a minor set back. Speaking of barbarians I saw a Japanese galley hit our coasts but it got sunk by the barbarians before I could make contact.<br />

So far my strongest enemy has been the barbarians. That's a real switch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 03, 2002, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not a rant, but I really am going to have to hack further into the AI code to see what sort of stupid idiot programming would lead Joan to attack me in the early game.<br />
<br />
I began the game going 100% cash and 100% military with the intent of using the military trait to smack a neighbor early and then focus on Barb control to supprot switching to full growth mode.<br />
<br />
My gambit to the south with an archer and a warrior, wandered through a couple of barb villages and the accompanying trios of &quot;disturbed warriors&quot; so by the time I got about 10 squares south they were both elite.<br />
<br />
Smacked Cathy forthwith because I find her to be an unfriendly and unreliable ally. (Come to think of it, Otto starts on the continent with all the girls in this game. Seems like lots of raging hormones early on.)<br />
<br />
About 15 turns after Cathy has been turned into a postscript. I have most of the military tied up chasing down the omnipresent barbs. Moscow is near to France and located in floodplains and only defended by an Elite archer (I am building almost all archers and then horsemen since this is an aggressive military plan). Nearby, to the west, Joan beats me to a barb village and I withdraw my other Elite archer back toward the North and the existing core. To the east of Moscow, I have 3 archers (2 elite) returning from barb wars, certainly Joan must be able to see these units outside the city of Moscow.<br />
<br />
Joan marches her two warriors, that were used to kill the barbs just west of Moscow, into my territory around Moscow and makes a beeline straight for the one archer in Moscow. Joan also brings in a third warrior from the south. On the power graph, Otto is 2 to 1 ahead of Joan and stronger militarily thanks to the barbs on the map. Moscow has roads left over from Cathy's brief tenure as governor. Moscow is also producing butteloads of food per turn and growing unhappy citizens by leaps and bounds. I pop rush a spearman and quick march two elite archers back into town from the east. Then Joan attacks Moscow.<br />
<br />
What the hell has she (aka Soren in a religiuos fanatic dyke dress) thinking.<br />
<br />
The plan had been to cuddle up to Joan for the long run while planning to farm Libby up to prime meat killing size, now all that had to be abandoned since Joan promoted herself to furious and cannon fodder.<br />
<br />
Joan's two northern warrior's attack from the north and impale themselves on the spearman who gets reduced to one HP after the two attacks. Joan's one regular warrior from the southwest attacks off the hill across a river and kills one elite archer (yeah, statistically possible but a little skewed). This leaves the warrior on the hill with one HP but then Joan is out of steam.<br />
<br />
I counter attack the Warrior on the hill with an Elite Archer and TADA, Barbarosa time.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I have researched my first tech &quot;Horsey riding&quot; and rushed a horseman one city back up the road. Run that horseman forward and load it into Barbarosa's army and we now have the poster child for an ad campaign &quot;An Army of One&quot;.<br />
<br />
Head the one horseman army south across the rivered plains looking for Joan and drag the two Elite archers along in tow. More horsemen are coming up fast from the rear, even though we are hobbled by having to tie up so many units in barb control.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed that with V1.21 we now seem to be able to load units into an Army when it is in the field??? Not sure if this is intentional, so I only tested it with a one horseman addition to the lone ranger, but I have not noticed this is the past. (note: this issue was addressed as a planned feature by Firaxis that has always been available even though the printed book was never updated.)<br />
<br />
I am earning about 25 extra gold per turn from the barb hunt. Kill one village an new one emerges with two warriors in residence. Horseman are really speeding up this hunt on the northern frontier, but in the central jungle it is still an archer war. I always seem to have at least three barb villages in sight and to be hunting at least two or three more.<br />
<br />
I should add that I never saw a scout from England or Russia. Either they got killed by barbs or went off toward France.</div></div><hr />

I agree, compared to France and England as far as I can tell, we start with a real geographic disadvantage.  Having to travel 30'ish squares for horses forced me into an early building of the FP.  But Russia isn't exactly sitting on golden lands, and they soon learned the wrath of Bismark...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jun 03, 2002, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or at least what method to win by.  Last GOM it was a space race vic, but that was only because I had no choice.  I am one that doesn't like early war if it will interupt my ability to spread.  So I spread, so far I haven't stopped spreading, I am about twenty turns from Panzers and don't know if they will ever even get to see any action, that is unless I decide to go conquest.<br />
<br />
The early game was pretty straight forward, build masses of warriors, and settlers.  Found about eight GH, one knowledge, one settler, six @#$%. :(  This game has the worst RNG I have ever seen before.  My settler was too far from the homeland to be of any use so I turned him into a worker factory.  Turned out he was reletively close to the northern horse, so I had a quick rode to the horsies at least.  I concentrated on mad growth.  I Built the FP up north in my horse city, not the best location for the future, but gave me a good producing second heart for the future war.  I managed to build the Great Library  and Sisteen on my own, but nothing else, without a Great Library at least.  I was hoping for a GA out of it, but I my hopes were lost.  Russia had an early war with France, so they both didn't spread very well.  By the time I ran out of room to spread I was only three turns from Military Tradition.  I intentinally beelined it there for a war.  I don't like stopping my spread.<br />
<br />
I have learned Military Tradition, my settler spread is over and it is time for my military spread.  I learn nationalism and push the button, the war-time button that is.  I want as much Cavalry as I can possibly get.  My target, England.  They are the most Tech. advanced so they are my targer, I wish to keep the AI's tech level below mine so I need to stop the trading.  Just my luck Russia has noticed my troup build up and asked for a MP/RoP.  I agree, they are a little civ only seven cities, nothing too worry about.  I Build twenty cav's since england is very colonial, and has cities on three sides of me, I wish too hit them all in a glories blitz.  They apperantly didn't see it coming they lost four cities from my intial strike, and one of there little colonial sides is gone right off the bat.  I get my first GL two turns before Industrialization and hold him for Univesal Suffrage.  Golden Age time, rock!  I got a GA out of it and was still in a war-time state, half my cities were producing cav's in three turns.  England falls fast, catching me two more GL in the process.  One army and the next wonder I sign pact with England so they only have their island cities, and mobalize for France.  I stop my war-time producing, since I am in a GA and wish to produce some culture Items.  I learn Scintific Method and go money.  Hit the frenchies hard, they fell in roughly ten turns.  Three more GL out of it though, gotta love militaristic with the Heroic Epic.  Built hoover dam, moved my palace to a more centralized location, for the future game plan, and don't yet know what to do with the current GL.  Just got him on the final French city.  Signed peace with France, Got all there cities but there capitol.  I now have cities on the Islands, when I get flight I will conquer the islands and finsh them both off.<br />
<br />
I have now turned my eyes towards my long time ally Russia, they are a little civ of now ten cities, I have eighty five cavalry now so they should be little more than a five or six turn bump.  But I have to head off to work, pity :mad: but the game is going well, how to end it though that is the question.  I hope the AI doesn't learn replacable parts soon, it could make russia live a little longer like three turns or something.  I just learned it two turns ago so I think they may be close.  <br />
<br />
Oddest thing.  In my game France built Sun-Tzu's.  Yet when the Ruskies took out the town it was in they burned it to the ground, now it doesn't exist?  Why did they do something foolish like that?<br />
Also there damned cities took so much to kill, they seed in this game really, really, really, sucks!  I had twenty cavalry outside of Paris, they conscripted from 12 to 8 and had six rifleman inside of it.  They killed five of my cavs and the rest where left with one HP.  I had too wait till next turn for reinforcements to take the lone survivor!  Four of there units where conscripts when I hit, they almost all made it to vetran before they died!:confused:<br />
<br />
It turned out russia was a little bump, if you could even classify them as a bump.  But they did manage to give me a GL every turn, nothing like attaking with fourty elites to get a great chance at a GL I guess.They where wiped from the face of this GOM in a matter of three turns, more than half their cities the first turn, all but one the second, and the final city the third turn.  I have now turned up money and luxeries to concentrate on attempting to milk this sucker now.  I am still not sure what victory type to go for.  Something intersting I hope.  Maybe try to conquest all in one turn, that would be fun.  Build four hundred modern armors and ransack, well I'll see sometime this week, this damned milking thing takes too long!  I don't like, but my score on the historograph as of yet is 3911, it's not even the modern age yet either.</div></div><hr />

I had been going all commerce in this game and buying techs at huge prices from the other civs virtually doing no science research whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I built my first wonder (Shakespeares Theatre) in 1822 and I still had MPPs with Japan, France and now Russia.  At this point I was still going for a diplo victory.  <br />
<br />
Someone declares war!  I cant remember who but lots of MPPs leads to everyone kicking Chinas ass.  Sent over some panzers and hit GA around 1890.  I capture 3 cities including Beijing with the great library and most important a city with aluminium (i have none). Japan actually burns down most of China so there is now a huge land area already developed for settling in.<br />
<br />
Manhattan Project in 1906 followed by United Nations in 1910.  YES I GOT IT AND EVERYONE LOVES ME.<br />
<br />
Let the vote commence - Germany votes Germany<br />
Russia votes Russia<br />
France votes France<br />
Japan votes Germany<br />
<br />
Cue much jumping up and down and running around and shouting YES !!!<br />
<br />
Only to sit down and realise I dont have a majority.  Bugger!<br />
<br />
3 civs in the vote cause I have the UN and France and Russian due to population and land mass.  What can I do? Hmmm.<br />
<br />
8 settlers produced in one turn are sent to the former Chinese lands to try and push me into 2nd position in land mass or population (about 6 of these cities are undefended but surely there will be no more war, not with everyone having MPPs with each other).  If I can get into 2nd postion in any of these areas then I must win the UN vote.<br />
<br />
Japan goes and attacks Russia. MPPs come into play and everyone is at war with Japan.  Japan burn down all my cities in the former China. AAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH<br />
<br />
New plan needed.  Lets go for spaceship victory.  I buy aluminium from France for an extortionate amount of cash.  Japan offers me peace for some cash.  I take it and making sure I am out of the MPPs let them fight it out.  <br />
<br />
No one will sell me synthetic fibres.  And then I see the winning move - No one has Nuclear Power.  I switch to full research on Nuclear Power.  France builds Longevity and Cure for Cancer. I dont care.  Nuclear Power arrives.  Trade it to Japan for synthetic fibres.  Spaceship nearly complete.  Japan aint gonna give Russia or France Nuclear Power.  I research the Laser.  <br />

then for fun do a 8 swordsmen charge and take out Moscow.<br />
The two GL are wonders to build wonders :P.<br />
<br />
the big barb rush are easy to deal with, they tend to hit the outlieing cities, which general don't have anything so spend all your credits, and sell the improvments in the city and move military one space out.  Barbs, trash the city leaving a 1 pop remains.<br />
since there was ranging Barbs build city walls, and then build the great wall. double defense vs barbs and city walls more effective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Jun 04, 2002, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I settled in the start position and produced a couple of warriors to explore - the first one got a settler from the hut to the west! I used a fairly straightforward build, producing warriors and settlers for a while, exploring and expanding as quickly as possible to claim land.<br />
<br />
I opened a fair number of huts throughout the game. Most of them gave barbarians but I also got two techs and a warrior.<br />
<br />
I met Russia, then England, and then France. I decided early in the game to go for a Space Race. So I traded tech whenever possible, and kept my research at 100%. When I discovered a new tech, I sold or traded it immediately, for whatever I could get. I wanted to ensure that the other Civs were researching new techs whenever possible.<br />
<br />
As soon as my southern borders collided with the other Civs I started filling in the NW region. Eventually I got it all - France settled one town there but it culture flipped to me later on.<br />
<br />
Barbarians were a nuisance. A couple of times early on single barbarians hit undefended towns. There was one barbarian uprising. I was able to lead an eastern horde through the jungle to eventually hit Russia. But another horde in the NW was unavoidable. Before they struck, I gave all my gold (a few hundred) to France. I was able to get about 1/2 of that gold back in a tech trade soon after the barbarians struck - they didn't get much :)<br />
OTOH, barbarian camps were a great source of income over the long haul on this map. For a long time I had warriors patrolling the eastern wild lands and taking out the barbarian camps which kept popping up.<br />
<br />
I tried to build the Great Lighthouse but never did complete it. I was building it in a 50% corrupt town and the build was slow. By the time it was nearing completion I'd nearly reached Astronomy. So I switched production there to another wonder.<br />
<br />
As soon as I learned The Republic (390BC) I switched to it. It was a bit early for this, with just 3 luxuries and few happiness improvements, but I wanted the maximum science rate I could get and I planned to stay in Republic for the entire game if possible.<br />
<br />
I started a build of Forbidden Palace NW of Berlin at the large lake, figuring it could be done at 3 shields/turn. (It eventually reached 4/turn during this build.) Did FP this way because I didn't plan on enough warfare to get a leader.<br />
<br />
In 150BC England declared war on me. Strange since relations were very good, due to the tech I'd been giving away. I just defended my territory in this war, losing nothing and killing a number of invaders. After a while England agreed to peace. That was the only war I fought in the game. (And I only saw one other war happen, quite a bit later, between England and Japan.)<br />
<br />
I tried to build Sun Tzu's, as one of the two triggers needed for a Golden Age, but England beat me to it. I switched to Leonardo's since that also counts as a trigger for militaristic Civs.<br />
<br />
Soon after I learned Astronomy my Galleys discovered the other continent. They were very backward! From the time I had contact until the end of the game, I dealt with the other Civs as follows:<br />
Russia, China, and India were weak relative to the others. So whenever I had a new tech (or a spare luxury or resource) I sold it to these Civs for however much money I could get (however low or high), and a luxury when possible.<br />
France, England, and Japan were stronger. Whenever I got a new tech I traded it for any tech these Civs had learned at the same time. I also traded for whatever cash they had on hand and a luxury when possible, but never for gold-per-turn. I didn't want to reduce these Civs' research capacity. If they had nothing to offer for a tech, I just gave it to them, to keep them researching something new.<br />
<br />
Shortly after completing the Forbidden Palace I completed Leonardo's and Newton's and entered a Golden Age. A nice period of rapid development followed.<br />
<br />
I kept building, especially libraries and universities of course. Managed to build JS Bach's, Theory of Evolution, Hoover Dam, the UN, and SETI. I was beaten to Smith's unfortunately, wanted to get that one too.<br />
<br />
When I discovered Steam Power I didn't have any coal available. A settler was able to hurry to my southern border and claim some at the English border. Later on oil was a similar problem - I hurried a settler over to an island and culture squeezed oil out of China's hands there.<br />
<br />
I maintained a small military force throughout the game but never had to use it after the early war with England. Too bad to not have used the Panzers! :)<br />
<br />
Research by the other Civs dropped to a very low rate around the end of the Industrial Age. I didn't quite reach a research rate of 4 turns/tech but got fairly close to that by the end of the game - the other Civs just couldn't keep up by then :lol:<br />
<br />
I launched the space ship on the turn after learning The Laser.<br />
<br />
Quite a different game for me: little warfare, lots of polite Civs (and even some gracious ones), I had research at 100% for much of the game, I produced a lot of workers, and I was a Republic for most of the game. Good fun! Especially nice was keeping the AIs off balance with the tech pace I set. A very nice change from them doing that to me :lol:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started out like most with 2 warriors, then a spearman, then a Settler.  This set me up well for a solid spearman/settler pattern that allowed decent expansion.  The English found me first, then the Russians, then the French.  Fortunately France and England were Polite (and easy to keep happy) and Russia was easy to win over.<br />
<br />
The barbarian hordes were a mess to deal with but fortunately they seemed to hit my outlying towns.  By the time I had traded maps with my closest neighbors I realized I had the largest empite (but not by much).  I did this at the expense of my military so I gave the women on my continent whatever they wanted.<br />
I attempted to build the Great Library but was beat out by 4 turns!  Worse, I had no other options so I wasted a ton of production.  I was so far behind in techs I thought I was doomed.  Turns out I was so wrong.<br />
<br />
I went for Wall Street to get the extra cash and it seemed to work.  I worked my way towards Panzers, hoping for a military victory.  I researched half the techs and bought the rest.  I was pissed to see Russia held 2 sources of Oil JUST outside my borders.  I was hopiing for a culture flip but luck was against me so I decided to go for Diplo.<br />
<br />
I set research to the max at the expense of cash.  As I was learning Flight France was starting the UN.  I thought I was going to miss Diplo too since no one would trade me radio.  As I entered Modern Times, Russia also started the UN.  I contacted China in hopes for a trade and they were willing to trade Eco for Fission!  Perfect timing too!  I changed my top producing city from Battlefield Medicine (with one turn left until completion) to the UN.  6 turns later it was mine.<br />
<br />
Since I didn't fight a single war, sign a single MPP, kept every treaty I entered into, and generally kissed everyone else's backside, I was elected Sec General.<br />
<br />
In 1814 I managed the Diplo Victory with 2374 points.  I'm sure its nowhere near the top but its a win on a level I thought I stood no chance on (especially with Raging Hordes!)</div></div><hr />

A long way from the gee gees. Barbarians swarming all over me all too frequently. Eventually got a few knights together and took out England and Russia. I feel I then fell between two stools - neither building up forces fast enough, nor researching fast enough. My compromise was ineffective. By the time I got to Cav I was well behind France in both research and forces.  Quick decision to change tack for a diplo victory. Saved my leader for UN. Put science up to 100% and caught up tech fast. Was running at a 200GP per turn deficit for a while - losing one building and one worker per turn was a bargain! Built a few panzers and had a quick victory over some wandering chinese to trigger GA. Drove to fission. Put science down to 0%. Signed MPP for lots of GP per turn and built the UN. Didnt have to pay long. Won the vote next turn. Winning ugly I think its called in sport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gotag</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty standard build-up. I also early decided on the spaceship as my goal.<br />
<br />
The whole northeast of the continent was a sea of blue. I finally put the breaks on the settlers when I got to munich1. The rest of the game was watching the AIs bash themselves silly while I tried to figure out the best way to bootstrap the rest of the world. I wound up triggering the GA with TOE  and from that point pretty much kept the techs to myself. I still wonder why Joanie went all the way to stealth :crazyeye: with nothing else in the MA.<br />
<br />
The only difference was that it was the Russians that attacked me. I had built a modest army given the size of my Civ but it was huge compared to theirs. I took about 8 of their cities before calling a halt and letting them have peace. I had the good luck to have aluminum spawn on one city I took (Kiev?) which allowed me to at least build the spaceship without having to resort to any more war. Finished in ~1790 with 3k for score.<br />
<br />
I don't mind saying what year I was done as i doubt it will be anywhere close to the best. I made 2 horrible mistakes early. 1st I clicked a GPT deal with France instead of just amount. It was about 3 turns later that I realised what I had done. For 20 years Joanie was living off the a signifigant portion of my civs economic output. No doubt she was whooping it up.<br />
<br />
The second mistake was in FP location. The game did not shape quite as I had thought it would and it wound up being in the wrong spot. If the english had attacked me it would have been perfect.<br />

Still my first GOTM and it was both fun to play and also fun to read other's accounts.<br />

Oddest thing.  In my game France built Sun-Tzu's.  Yet when the Ruskies took out the town it was in they burned it to the ground, now it doesn't exist?  Why did they do something foolish like that?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Since you don't get barracks in your towns when you capture Sun-Tzu's, it's only logical to raze it. A town with this early wonder is most probably a core enemy city with a lot of accumulated culture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I, uh... I mean... I've got this friend. (Yah, that's it... a friend) He started GOTM #8 and promptly got himself into an ongoing war with England. It all started when he refused to pay 5g tribute soon after first contact. He was WAY behind in tech. Couldn't get decent trades with anyone. And finally ended up losing Berlin around 500 AD. &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
Anyway, I... I mean HE... gave up and started over. Now things are going quite a bit better. Paid tribute to England, France and Russia. Sold his soul to catch up on techs and built Sun Tsu's. Went on another trading spree to get Theory of Gravity, and was able to build Newton's University. This triggered a Golden age in 1080 AD.<br />
<br />
Now the question:<br />
Do you think my uh... friend should still play through and submit this game? I know it is technically against the rules, and this friend really didn't have to say anything about starting over. But, you see, he usually plays at Warlord, and had no idea that refusing one little tribute early in the game would start such a nasty downward spiral.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what do you think my friend should do?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2002, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally finished. What a game.<br />
<br />
I will be on the record that the Random Number Generator (RNG) totally suuuuuuuuuuuccks for tournament type games because it can be severely unbalancing. Last month in GOTM7, I got almost nothing out of about a dozen huts while using expansionist scouts. This month in GOTM8, I got settler-settler-warrior using a worker and warrior as the initial scouts and then LOTS of barbs and one tech.<br />
<br />
In the long run this evens out, but it really can be a severe advantage swing that gets outside the balancing game. The yield from these first three huts gave me an insurmountable advantage in the game and just confirmed what path I was choosing to head toward victory.<br />
<br />
I think that an option to select a flag that will cause the outcomes from the goodie huts to be randomly generated at the beginning of the game but then fixed according to the locations of the huts for the duration of the game should be included in the set up mode. It would be nice if this flag set the hut contents so that each player had the same possible outcomes if they found the same huts as another player.<br />
<br />
I definately do not think that having one player get two settlers out of huts right off the bat results in a fair game play comparison.<br />
<br />
I am saying this when I was the beneficiary of the golden eggs in this case.<br />
<br />
Never got all the jungle cleared and my capital city was not in the top ten demographics because it built settlers and military units almost the whole game. At one point I was running about 90 workers. (the AI functions of &quot;Shift-I&quot; and &quot;Shift-J&quot; couldn't be used because they were written by a total idiot that never played the game).<br />
<br />
This map seemed to be missing a few civs on the main continent because there was definitely a lot of open space on Otto's side of the continent. It would have been a different game, if the civ that would have been up north west of Berlin and the civ that would have been on the east coast (on the other side of the inland sea) would have been included.<br />
<br />
I have some screen shots of the massive barbarian uprising in 270BC. When it occurred in the game, I had 6 villages go critical and spawn horsemen hordes all on the same turn and when I looked back at the data after all was said and done, there was actually 1 other horde that Libby had to deal with all on her own.<br />
<br />
I still think that having all the villages go MENTAL on the same turn because they key off of one RNG is really inappropriate. It may seem to effect me more because of my style of play that tends to surround and contain the AI aggressors, but I still think it is wrong.<br />
<br />
Something about the hordes spawning is not fully understood, because in this game I really had the barbs under control for the most part, and would just oscillate a set of horsemen or archers back and forth between two prime farming zones for barb villages.<br />
<br />
When the big horde spawn occurred, I could swear it was not due to letting the barb villages just sit there for too long and fester. I am examining the log files to see if I can detect a pattern.<br />
<br />
After the massive barb uprising in 270BC there was never another uprising and in the late game the number of barbs waned back  from the early count of 3 per hut down to only one per hut by the time I settled Mickey Mouse's Ears. This seems just bass-ackwards to me. I saved the late huts to try an promote up a few cavalry to Elites, but there were so few barbs coming out by that time in the game, that it was hard to get promoted.<br />
<br />
One thing I have noticed is that the routine the pops the barb warriors out of the huts seems to only pop out warriors proportionate to the available land squares around the hut. A hut on a pennisula tip rarely pops three warriors. I haven't seen the warriors pop out of the hut and land with three in one square. They always seem to be spread out in three different squares and this part of the program that finds where to pop the barb warriors may not be able to handle restricted land masses.<br />
<br />
I'm going to run a test map that uses raging hordes and then surrounds the barb village with workers before moving a warrior into the hut, just to see what happens with the barb warriors that would get popped.<br />
<br />
more later ...............</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you have an ROP with another civ AND you have railroads in place, then that can be a death sentence unless you are so militarily superior to the other civ as to be able to guarantee a successful defense of any city against a reasonable sized army from the other civ.<br />
<br />
Your picture looks like you have Berlin being defended by a lone pikeman and since the city is located on grassland underneath, then the defender would only be a speed bump for Joan's infantry.<br />
<br />
Much of the interpretation of what Joan is up to would hinge on what lies further to the north. If Joan is alread at war with someone who has cities up to the north of you, then you might still survive for a few more turns.<br />
<br />
IF Joan has no other enemies to the north that provide more tasty targets than the undefended Tiblisi and virtually undefended cities including your capital, then any time the AI units stop off in the middle of your territory instead of using the railroads to pass through, you can assume something bad is afoot.<br />
<br />
I would add that I cannot think of a reason why I would use railroads to jump up on an unroaded mountain that is not adjacent to a city. With the two stacks of infantry Joan has, she could take out 8 or 10 of your core cities all in one turn if each city is only defended by pikes.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you end up needing a stiff drink or a few band-aids.<br />
<br />
Just for the record, I rarely leave ROPs in place once railroads become a major feature. You cannot trust even your best friend in this game if they have infinite movement ability. Even with the ROP, if your ally is a bozo and happens to stand a warrior  or even a lowly worker on a major railroad junction, then they can shut down your ability to use your railroads even if it is just out of ignorance with no malice attached.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AndyS</div><div class="date">Jun 07, 2002, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what happened in my game:<br />
<br />
I built Berlin in the starting tile.  I started off with max science (0 income).  I explored with 2 warriors to the south and then split them east and west.  I paid 2gpt to Russia early for a worker.  I wasn't particularly lucky with the huts.  Got a couple of techs and a warrior.  No settlers for me.<br />
<br />
Did anyone else notice that the barbs were stronger than usual, or did I just have some bad luck with them?  They were beating fortified spearmen in cities and fortified on mountains across rivers.  They were rarely losing any hit points when attacking me.<br />
<br />
I got the Great Library in 10BC and got 8 techs to catch up.  At this point, I have a decent defensive military built up and I have the southern border sealed up with culture boundaries.  It is time to build culture and expand up north.  I switch to Republic a few turns later to help speed this phase along.<br />
<br />
In 510AD, I discover the island northeast of me.  There are 3 goodie huts on it which yield me only money, maps, and angry warriors.  I establish an embassy in China and examine Beijing.  Tell me if this sounds strange.  The units that China had in this city were as follows:  6 settlers, 12 spearmen, and 2 archers.  Is this supposed to represent their entire army or just what they have in this city?  I thought it was just this city but after seeing this, maybe I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
In 700AD, England gets Sun Tsu when I'm only 1 turn away.  At least I am able to switch to Leo's and get the GA that way.  I'm still building up my culture.<br />
<br />
I finally get the FP built (manually) in 1290AD.  I have been avoiding wars and just building up culture and science.  I did have a very brief war with Japan around this time and I managed to get 2 cities despite having almost an entirely defensive military.<br />
<br />
I sign an MPP with Russia since they are huge and we share a large border.  In 1540AD, France and Russia go to war, dragging me into it.  On the VERY SAME TURN, they sign a peace treaty and France won't speak to me.  I get England allied against France.  During the war, I get a GL and will save him for the UN.  The Hoover Dam is only 8 turns away from being built so I will chance it.  I inspece the two other cities building the Hoover Dam.  Russia (Moscow) is 55 turns away and France (Lyons) is 37 turns.<br />
<br />
After I capture 1 French city, I make peace since I have no offensive army to continue the war.  I am able to get lots of gold since I am bigger.  Of course this makes England angry since we had an allience.  The very next turn, France and Russia are at it again and I get dragged right back to war.  I capture another French city, move all of my troops into it, and give the city to England.  This gets them back to polite and is a quick way for me to get all of my troops back to Germany.<br />
<br />
In 1685, I start a war with England and drag Russia in using an MPP.  England was number 1 and very large.  They wouldn't have trouble with me or Russia, but with both of us teaming up, they had no chance.  Here is something strange but useful to know.  I had 6 tanks outside Oxford.  5 of them were stacked together in grassland and 1 was along in a jungle.  England attacked the one tank in the jungle which had a defensive bonus instead of attacking the stack of 5.  Not only are they more likely to win a battle against the stack of 5, the attacker will not advance, thus remaining in the city to defend it on my turn.  Obviously they should have attacked the stack of 5.<br />
<br />
I eventually capture London and get Sun Tsu.  I make peace with England and they give me a French city that they captured previously.  This city has JSB in it.  I give London to Russia because there are 15 resistors in it and I doubt if I could hold it very long.<br />
<br />
1766AD:  Our People Want The Iron Works!!!  What? Where?  This is the second game in a row that I was able to build this.  The last one was Grey Fox's tournamen (Vet 1-3).  After searching, I see that it is York.  This city has 13 production, but only 3 after corruption.  I buy a courthouse and start working on the Iron Works.  This will still not be a very productive city, but I can't resist building this wonder.<br />
<br />
Now here is something that makes me mad.  I had an undefended transport filled with 8 elite Panzers.  Not very smart but I was taking a chance.  I moved him along my coast, careful never to get within 3 tiles of a Japanese fleet near the island to the northeast.  There is no way the Japanese could have seen this transport due to fog of war, but as soon as I moved him out of the city, they came right after him (and sunk him).  I'm not upset since I was taking a chance moving him around undefended, but how did Japan see this ship?  I read some other posts about the AI cheating with the fog of war and this kind of convinces me that something is not right about it.<br />
<br />
In 1798AD, I get the UN (GL I was saving).  Can't do an election since England and Japan are still the top two on the histograph and they hate me.  I land some elite Panzers in Japan and take Osaka, get a leader, rush a settler, abandon Osaka, and rebuild the city.  I then rush an airport, fly over tons of Panzers and crush Japan.<br />
<br />
In 1846, all trade agreements with England expire.  I cancel them and declare war, eliminating them from the game.  I am now heading for a space race so I want to plant spies so I can keep tabs on them.  Here are the results:<br />
TURN 1:  Russia (caught), India (caught), Chine (caught)<br />
TURN 2:  Russia (caught), India (caught + war)<br />
TURN 3:  Russia (success)<br />
Man, what a waste of money.<br />
<br />
In 1864, I take a chance and have a UN vote.  I vote for me, Russia votes for herself, and the others abstain.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
In 1950, I finish my spaceship and launch (score:  2307).<br />

<br />
unfortunately wont be able to replay this one as i know too much.   I got SunTzu's and was building the FP way up in the northeast brick-by-brick.   Entered the golden age on the completion of suntzu's -- its too bad because i wanted to wait.<br />
<br />
France had become a cultural behemoth, so their one NE city wouldnt flip.  i was working on flipping some poor english cities that ended up there.  <br />
<br />
about 300AD, England and France started a war.  Then immediately after, Russia decided to demand from me.  I refused and got England to join in my war against russia.   Russia and I traded cities, and unfortunately i had to break the alliance 2 turns before it finished :(  -- i had 8 turns to go on sun tzu's and was about to lose Berlin to the Russians.<br />
<br />
After the war, i built up my military and was about to re-attack russia (no iron), but unfortunatly, my hard drive is now toast :(<br />

good luck all other players!</div></div><hr />

I have finished off England and have the continent except France who has the southern peninsula area, and all the way up to where Moscow is. <br />
<br />
So far England, India and Russia have been eliminated. France got mech infantry so I'm waiting for Modern Armor. On the other continent I engineered a war with Japan vs. China. Japain is getting beaten badly. But because China is using infantry against defending infantry the number of troops is evening out. Soon japan hopefully will be able to halt the Chinese advance. Before China had about 100 infantry, now it has 70. Japan had about 65 before, now 50. <br />
<br />
China doesn't have any oil, which is really good. Once I finish France off with upgrading my 50 panzers to MA, then I will probably invade China if they are going for spaceship. Built the UN in Moscow so no worries there.</div></div><hr />

My milking pretty much failed.  I relied on apollo to tell me the year of a culture vic, that I was trying to avoid.  And found an error in it, after I deleated all my scientific cultural improvements, I found that I had only gained one turn on the toward the impending culture vic, my current culture was 89367, and it was the late 1800's.  So I deleted every culture Item and found that the next turn, I had still only gained one turn.  I let lavro no about this problem and it turned out that apollo still took into effect delleted culture improvements when calculating, so I deleted all my religous improvements probably when I didn't have to.  My population contiuned to grow for the next hundred years, but my score grew none.  So I gave up the milking and in the late 1900's attacked china to get a domination vic.  I went in with a few armies of MA and MI a few scattered MA and about seven nukes.  I hit their big cities all with nukes before attaking them, and used my spy to succesfully steal their miltary plans, and nuked their big stack of units, about 90 MI.  I didn't do as well as I had hoped, or as well as I did last GOM.  I finished around the 1970's with a score of around 6800.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2002, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish that long term we can collect some data to better understand the variables that lead to the massive barbarian uprisings. I know that some of it has to do with the age that a barb village is allowed to get to before you destroy the village but I believe that I have been observing that one old billage on the planet will cause all the villages to go mental at the same time even when the other villages may only be one or two turns new.<br />
<br />
Here is a map from my GOTM-8 in 270BC when Seven (7) barb villages went ballastic all at the same time.<br />
<br />
The Gold arrows point to locations with villages where 24 horsemen have just spawned in each village.<br />
<br />
The Green arrows are 4 locations where I have just destroyed a barb village or war party on the previous turn. To the far south east, I had used an army of two horsemen to smack a village on hills.<br />
<br />
You should be able to click on the map and load a large view into a separate window that should be 2 times the size of this view.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/barb_map_size_compact.jpg (http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/barb_map_size_medium.jpg)<br />
<br />
What I was doing for most of the game was defining small regions of frontier where I could move horsemen back and forth between two prime barb village spawning locations in only 5 or 6 turns. The key was to have the locations be far enough apart to let a village spawn in one place while the horsemen was standing at the the other location. Then I would kill one village and let the horseman recover and just head back towards the other location and a barb village would almost always have spawned back in that location.<br />
<br />
Just oscillating back and forth was like &quot;barb farming&quot; for almost 2500 years. Every turn I was smacking at least one village for 25 gold and often it was two or three villages in one turn.<br />
<br />
The barbs were very aggressive in their village spawning and the frequency seemed to keep jacking up a notch here and a notch there until they finally got to this turn in 270BC where all the barbs boiled over at one time.<br />
<br />
Of the seven villages that spawned hordes only one of them was more than 5 turns old (the one up north or England). The two villages on the eastern coast near the mouth of the inland sea (down near the title box) were only 3 and 4 turns old respectively.<br />
<br />
The village on the north tip was one turn old.<br />
<br />
The village on the far west tundra tip (west or Lyons and Dortmund), the village on the tundra tip South East of Paris and the Village on the far east jungle coast had just appeared in this turn because I had killed other villages nearby in 290 or 280BC as shown by the units at the green arrows.<br />
<br />
I was using the cash to rush settlers, galleys, and improvements whenever possible. There was just too much land to garrison or settle all in the few turns after Cathy became a postcript and Joan committed hormone driven suicide.<br />
<br />
The horde spawned from the village near England ended up killing my horseman up there before descending over to make patty-cake with Libby but otherwise I had to deal with the the other 6 piles of pestilence.<br />
<br />
I am fairly convinced that the festering village north of Libby probably set off the uprising due to its age and the fact that I had to send a horseman over that way to help speed Libby's attempts to deal with the problem.<br />
<br />
Since I do not fully understand the variables (read this as &quot;what are the rules&quot;) that control barb horde spawning, I am just guessing as to why I seemed to have lost control of the barb situation in this year when I seemed to have it so well in hand throughout most of the game.</div></div><hr />

I think your right on about the barbarians,my game with multiple barbarian camps uprising simultaneously would support this theory.<br />
<br />
However, this map is 270BC, no sign of China, yet in a previous post (the settler one) you made contact and embassy with China in 400BC, I guess just confusion with all the different versions of the games you were playing.<br />

I think I have editted the date to reflect the actual time line.<br />
<br />
I got the Great Lighthouse in about 310AD and immediately threw galleys out from Dortmund and away from the War with Libby up by Liverpool and Oxford. (notice also on the map above, how crappy the placement of Liverpool and Oxford are on the northeast tip of England's territory.)<br />
<br />
The barbs up on the north tip had also lead me to the discovery of the &quot;Weeeee Island&quot; off the north tip and when I moved to claim that I found the West Ear of Mickey Mouses head. It was a thousand years later before I saw the East island just because I was too busy elsewhere.<br />
<br />
In one sense, the war with England was a backwards God send because it had me with galleys up off that peninsula and side of the map just as the Great Lighthouse came on line. Without the war, I probably would have had galleys more over to the east and southeast side. But with the war, I only had enough tools to be on one side and that side turned out to be the key to the end game strategy.</div></div><hr />

Now you know why my first post on that thread showed surprise at the date. I don't feel so bad with my discovery date now. Although I could have done the domination routine in the 1100's AD, I'm doing the milking thing, &lt;sigh&gt;.<br />

I debated a milk run, but milking from 1100AD until 2050AD sounded like torture. If I was going to that much milk, then I would have to make some ice cream or something enjoyable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2002, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my game I didn't farm barb villiges the way everyone else has seemed to.  Most of you had horseman on the frontier moving around like cracker mentioned the way he farmed his barbs.  I kept my horsies stationed in specific points around the map so that I was only a few turns from spawning locations.  I then made a point to trade maps with the AI every turn.  The funny thing about the way the AI cheats is that I have found that almost always the AI knows where the barb. camps are.  So all I had to do was examine the map after trading to see where the barbs had popped up.  No guessing where the barbs popped up, no random searching with the horsies, just trade maps and go to the camps.  Though in my game their was only two uprisings all game, lucky me I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are exactly on track with reversing the AI cheat ability that gives them total visibility of every unit, town, village, and resource on the map. On a map like this, knowing that you can get the AI to reveal the locations of barb villages that  are no where near its territory just buy trading world maps is a great exploit.<br />
<br />
This is one of those exploits that should be documented and put on the rules page of GOTMs as an allowable exploit. (After all its the AI cheat that creates the exploit and not the human player). I feel that any player playing this type of game map that did not know how to use the &quot;AI Worldwide Instant Barb Locator&quot; would be operating a severe disadvantage.<br />
<br />
This barb locator exploit combines well with the &quot;sell the map every turn&quot; exploit, that becomes a must do sort of action on Emperor and Diety difficulty levels. You can sell you map every turn to every civ you know and earn somewhere between 1 and 5 gold per turn per civ. These is tedious busywork, but in tight games it can generate the one or two coins that will make the difference.<br />
<br />
In a game like this one on Monarch and with Raging barbs, I only had Libby to trade with for about 500 years, but every turn I sold or traded her my world map to gain visibility of barb camps near my territory or gain a coin or two.<br />
<br />
This exploit does not work to peek at barb villages under the Fog of War in tiles you have not yet gained access to see, but it does reveal those villages that are just beyond your visibility.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Matrix will add this exploit to the list of OK todo things, so that it will help level the playing field a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ProPain</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2002, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My game is going reasonably well till now (about 1500AD). Started of with an early military strat in mind and set science and luxury to 0%. Founded a few cities and send of a few warriors to explore. Opened a few huts, got one tech, one warrior and nothing (not even maps!) <br />
<br />
So things went along pretty quiet. Build up some archer military and was the bought my way in the tech tree. Got lucky when I got map making cuz the french, russians and english hadn't shared their maps yet. This really amazed me since normally they throw every bit of knowlegde at each other at every possible moment for crazy prices.<br />
<br />
Was ready for war with the russians when I got 6 or 7 barb uprisings. This whole uprising thing drained my coffers and i decided to settle the rest of the continent quickly before this got worse. This temporary change in strategy made my conquest of the continent taske much longer in the end and probably cost me a lot of points. <br />
<br />
After the settling of the continent I took out the russians pretty easy. During the russian war the english demanded tribute and declared war when i refused. Got an alliance with Joan and finished the english. In the meanwhile the english and french made contact with the other civs. They were about as tech advanced as we so no real problem there. <br />
<br />
The Chinese started kicking some Indian #*ss So i gave away my two former english north-island cities to them and donated iron and some lux to them. When the chinese and indians made peace ungratefull ghandi still was annoyed with me. I think this was because'trade agreement' ended when he lost his last mainland harbor city. I personally think this is a bug in the program, I GIVE away resources, Ghandi loses his OWN harbor because of his military incompetence. This forces him to retreat to the island I gave to him and now he's mad anyway. Don't think I'll try diplo this game :)<br />
<br />
Although I had been very nice to JOan al the game and bought a lot of techs from her somehow she changed from polite to furious. Built up my military again, got mil. trad. and decided to go for france. France got MPP with China, so I got MPP with Japan. Started the war with france and sent the other continent in war with me :)<br />
<br />
The French war is going very well mainly because off the stupid AI. Joan keeps sending her armies for the undefended/Poorly defended cities just behind my front line, well garrisoned, cities. So for me the wat started waiting for Joan's troops to pass a frontline city, bombard the troops and finish them with cav. Now I'm razing her cities easily. Japan and china are bashing each other senseless so although I'm still 0% science I'm not far behind in tech and forced everybody out of republic. I think I will have razed france in a few turns. I'll be alone on the large continent and will build up my cities (I got only 2 libraries and still don't have a marketplace :crazyeye: )<br />

I settled on the river, and built a warrior.  Sent him south exploring, and quickly found the russians.  I was a bit worried at how close they were, and surprised that they were not very advanced (poor starting position).  I therefore thought Id try and knock catherine out early  the cities to be gained from conquest should make up for the slower expansion on my own part.  Built a barracks and a couple of archers, and sent them off.  By the time they got to Moscow, I think that Catherine STILL only had two cities built.  Moscow fell easily, (only one spearman).  I healed my troops, had another newly-built one join, and went for St Petersburg, leaving moscow defended by my original warrior.  Took that as well for the loss of a single archer.  I found that Russia had one other city, defended by only a warrior, so I took that to knock Catherine out completely.  At this stage, I had two elite archers.  I noticed that the French were to the southwest.  The nearest city was defended by only a single warrior.  Well, faint heart never won a fair lady, so I attacked and took the city (I let it get to size 2.  I was a bit worried though, as I had few troops in the area.  I was still building them in Berlin, but that was a looong way to travel.  I waited a couple of turns, and sued for peace.  This I couldnt believe  Joan gave me ALL her money and ALL her cities for peace!  Suddenly, Joan had a major setback, and I saw an opportunity.  I rushed archers in all the former russian towns, and sped them towards paris.  By the time they got there, Joan had made two more cities.  I broke peace, and attacked paris, getting a GL in the process!  This was used to hurry the pyramids.  I took two more of joans cities before suing for peace.  At this stage, she was effectively out-of-the-game -&gt; left with a single city in the middle of the tundra.  My early conquests meant that technology suffered somewhat.  When I found Liz, she was well ahead of me.  However, removing russia and france meant that she wouldnt go so fast, as she couldnt trade for tech.<br />
<br />
With the pyramids, I turned to maximum expansion.  I pumped out settler/spearmen combos from a coupld of cities, along with the odd worker here and there to claim as many luxuries as possible, and to try and keep Liz in the west.  I started the FP in the former Moscow.  I wanted to finish Liz as quickly as possible, so made a beeline for fuedalism and on to chivalry.  Liz demanded chivalry, I refused and she declared war.  Fortunately, she was slow in sending troops across the mountains, and only attached from the northwest.  I lost one city before I bribed for peace  I gave up chivalry, but by that stage I had a few knights, and Sun Tzus was well-on-the-way.  I finished SunTzuss and built a knight army.  At this point, Liz was furious and walking all over my territory.  It wasnt a difficult matter to start a war!<br />
<br />
The FP had been finished in Moscow (speeded along by rushing a courthouse), and a few cities down south were pilling out knights.  I moved these in to attack Lizs south-east cities, whilst another group of knights attacked / defended my north.  Up north, Liz had a LOT of archers, longbowmen, swordsmen and spearmen.  I used hit-and-run tactics with my knights to keep her in check, but we ended up trading a couple of cities back-and-forth more than a few times.  However, my forces in the south met almost no resistance.  There were only one or two counter attacks even.  I was bee-lining again for cavalry.  I was hoping for a golden age when I used a leader to rush Leonardos (as I hadnt got one with SunTzus).  Not to be.  However, I had taken about  of Lizs lands when I got military tradition and upgraded.  Liz didnt last much longer.  At this point, I had an army of cavalry, and was building the Heroic Epic.<br />
<br />
I found that following all my warmongering, I was well behind China and Japan in tech.  I had discovered them earlier on (lucky galleon seeing japanese shore), but it wasnt until the latter stages of the war with england that we could trade luxuries.  I swapped a few luxuries for tech from china, but the prices were going up, fast.  I felt that the only way to keep up was to get them fighting each other.  I paid for a MPP with China, and got Japan to attack me.  I pretty-much stayed out of the war completely (the only troops I tried to send to Japan were sunk by Tokogawas massive navy :( ) so my skirmishes were limited to the little islands up-north.  I got GL though, and saved it for the TOE.  I bee-lined to that, sold scientific method for lots of techs and GPT, and rushed the TOE.  Now Im ahead in tech.  The TOE gave me a golden age.  Now Im selling techs for very high prices, and running towards Panzers to attack the Chinese  as far as I can tell, there is only one source of rubber on the other continent, and Japan has it!<br />
<br />
One thing that has puzzled me is that NO-ONE has yet researched democracy!  Im still in monarchy, and waiting for Panzers before I go back to get it.  I'm well on the way to building the Hoover Dam, and am withholding electronics from the AI, until I am 1 turn from completing it;)<br />
<br />
In the interim, Im clearing jungle like mad, and really kick-starting my production with factories in all my largest cities.</div></div><hr />

I am in the process of milking the score at the moment and it will take me a while.  Here is a brief synopsis of what has happened so far.<br />
<br />
I started the first city right at the starting position.  I then began building settlers and warriors as fast as I could while setting my research rate at 100%.  I beelined it to Literacy and began building the Great library.  As soon as I had that I shifted taxes to 100% to upgrade my warriors to swordsman.  It took a while before I went to war.  There was a lot of room to expand into and I took advantage of that.  Eventually I grew tired of the peace and attacked Russia.  She was not very strong and lost several cities before giving in to peace.  I was able to get communication with all of the other civs as part of the peace trade.  I then began my second wave of expansion, filling in the rest of the territory and gaining a strong foothold on the newly acquired territory from Russia.<br />
<br />
I had a huge amount of area and as it turns out almost all of the saltpeter resource.  I needed it for my Calvary, but I could afford to trade it away to France for a while.  I had no plans on attacking the French until I had Tanks.  I was in no rush.   The French gave up a fortune for the stuff (Furs, 60 GPT, and a tech).  Somewhere in here I attacked the English with Knights and the Russians again for more territory.  <br />
<br />
All the while this was going on I have been trying to clear the huge JUNGLES.  They are finally gone, but it took forever!!<br />
<br />
Once I got to tanks it was time to get my Golden Age started  (I love having a GA late in the game, you get things done so much quicker) I quickly eliminated the Russians and the English, and then moved in on the French.  After gaining a good bit of Territory I let them have peace for a bit (I am staying in Democracy) I then absorbed the new parts of the empire, and launched another campaign against the French.  They should be gone in another turn or two.<br />
<br />
It is 1830 and there are a lot of turns left to milk the game.  This was the first time I have played the Germans and they Panzers make them a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

Is it really that disadvantageous to exceed the optimal number?  And if you do, can you raze a city or cities to put you back to the optimal number and escape the corruption penalty?</div></div><hr />

France is knocked off to an island in the north. I really don't want to bother with them. I want their 2 techs but they aren't giving them to me, even though I just thrashed them. English were eliminated with Panzers. France was tougher. Decided to wait for Modern Armor. Made alot of panzers and upgraded them. <br />
<br />
I really spoiled myself in the France war. Used nukes a bit too much, as if they regular artillery. Basically nuked all their cities except 3. Something like 12 cities nuked. Then just walked into their cities. The war started off tougher, but then I lured their massive stack of mech infantry towards an unguarded city, and nuked it. <br />
<br />
China and Japan are on the other continent. Neither has started their spaceships but finally made peace after over 50 turns of war. There was one Japanese city that was conquered and reconquered by the two sides over 15  times! Not exagerating as my destroyer watched the whole spectacle. Even though China was more powerful Japan pulled through towards the end, and many Chinese infantry were killed against a few Japanese mechs. <br />
<br />
As of now, I'm not going to really bother with China or Japan but if they start building the spaceship, I'll fire off some ICBMs and destroy them. I have about 60 modern armor doing nothing at all at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In these GOTMs, the score you finish with is so important that I do not even consider the optimal cities number in any strategy.<br />
<br />
Your score is predominantly based on the number of tiles of terrain that you possess and then the number of happy, content, and specialist citizens that you support.<br />
<br />
Because the your score is actually an average of the per turn scores for the game, you can maximize your score by having the largest possible territory as early as possible in the game. The only way to have a significantly larger territory is to have more cities.<br />
<br />
For the 16 cities number, I can figure that even at the maximum terrain spread factor you could realistically support you could only cover 37 to 45 tiles per city and that would only give you about 640 tiles of territory compared to the domination limit for this map which is somewhere between 1640 and 1700 tiles of territory. The domination limit reflects the maximum amount of territory you can have in your empire before the game &quot;shuts itself down&quot; by engaging a &quot;victory condition&quot;. <br />
<br />
Since winning is not the only objective, that is why I think you see so many players going for game strategies that include 3, 4, and 5 times as many cities as you might expect if you just used the optimal cities numbers.<br />
<br />
Another factor in gameplay is the city size 12 limit, that can technically be crossed with by building a Hospital but for many practical purposes can cause game shutdown due to population generated polution that cannot be totally eliminated.<br />
<br />
Many power players use city placement that only expects to have cities of size 12 and smaller just to avoid the extra maintenance costs of hospitals, mass transit centers, and the extra workers you have to keep around just to fight late game pollution. Smaller cities demand tighter placement if you wish to pursue the points that come from the population side of the game score equation.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see a player submit a game that strictly adhered to the Optimal Cities number and resulted in either a high score or early game finish in any category.</div></div><hr />

The position is mediocre, many jungle, forest and plains. I set up a four city archer production and started pruning the other civs at the continent. Wow, the archer rush rocks in that game, and Germany is THE civ for it. I succeeded to vassalize all three other civs. The Japs built the Lighthouse and sailed over in the early ADs. Made contact, traded maps and leveled tech. The barbarians are driving me crazy, but I think I have the worst behind me. Masses of uprisings, I stopped counting them when it were five. My guess is 10 or more.<br />
<br />
It's 1000AD now. The continent is mostly blue, with orange, pink and brown spots. And a few green cities, as the Japs succeeded to sail settlers over. Since I concentrated on expansion, I am slightly (2 techs) behind. But I am by far the most powerful and am sure that will pay off, once I build up my infrastructure.<br />
<br />
Got 2 leaders so far. Gave both FP and Sun Tzus in Hastings. I could've built the Sistine, but bleh!, my cities are pretty tight packed and won't grow very large anyway, so happiness won't be a problem.<br />

Well, monarchy is still a difficult level for me but I like the GOTM.  I would have thrown in the towel when the 2 French SoDs came at me but since I want to keep my streak of submissions going I stuck it out.  Since I survived at diety I should be able to survive here.:D</div></div><hr />

Started with the forbidden palace in the big Russian city that had just flipped to me.  That's the area I had originally wanted for the FP anyway.  So I spend a hundred years rebuilding and climbing the tech tree in a catch up race.  Still no coal.  China wipes out India.  (I never even got to see India on the map!)  Russia, France, Japan and England have several war amongst themselves which I ignored.  One of my cites flips back from the French.  I build Wall St., a couple armies, factories, I have one rubber, make infantry, build the pentagon and finish my second forbidden palace.  Still no coal.  Built an explorer and scope out France and Russia.  Hmmm... Russia has many cities with English names and their borders are not locked.  Here's a river with coal on one bank and silk on the other!  I made some settlers to fill these gaps and get that coal!  I've got one oil and I start my first panzer.  Working on a hospital or two, the intelligence agency and infantry.  I want 2 in every city and 3 or 4 armies of 'em to go with all those Panzers I'm gonna build.  First I'm going to take back my cities from the French.  Then I'll take a chunk of Russia. (hehe)<br />
WHAT! Russia declares war on us! No!<br />
Yes, the glorious Germans were blitzed by Russian tanks on the very eve of the Fatherland's drive for dominence.  Lost all the big Russian cities I had in one fell swoop - including my SECOND forbidden palace.  Catherine showed no mercy as her bombers took out my only oil field.  Leftover cossacks even cut off my saltpeter supply and to rub it in moved on my iron.  Left with the ability to make riflemen and knights I could only watch in horror as the Russians razed my precious cities.<br />
This gotm was almost as bad as when we played China!<br />
I had such high hopes for this one and never even got the first panzer built.  No golden age either.:(   I when I remember that I stood outside Moscow with 9 units in the ancient era and gave them peace when they asked for it...:mad:   Something in the back of mind said I 'd regret that someday...:cry:</div></div><hr />

Always kill Cathy. Never kiss Cathy. Cathy is a snake.<br />
<br />
Trade with Cathy only to gain enough time and advantage to kill Cathy. Chop Cathy to little bits and cast her ashes to the wind.  Cathy is the reincarnation of Soren's prom date who spit in his punch bowl and the left dance early with another guy after picking Soren's pocket to steal his wallet and car keys to make sure she had his cash, credit cards, three condoms, transportation, and even his library card and Chuckie Cheese tokens. Every moment Cathy lives is potentially a risk to your survival. Even as a science research partner, Cathy sucks because she will do stupid things like turn off all research in her empire to save up cash so her spies can try and steal techs from you instead.<br />
<br />
Usually the luxury trade rate is the last straw for Cathy in my games even if I let her live that long. Since I can't trade her spices, ivory, incense, furs, plus 30 gpt to get just one of the three extra gems she has, then she is obviously suffering from siphilis induced insanity and must be dispatched.<br />
<br />
Kill Cathy and everyone who has ever spoken to her.</div></div><hr />

Your score for Cathy has one too many digits ;) but it gives me great pleasure to know your Otto smacked your Cathy early on as well.<br />
<br />
Remember that this is the average score of all of Cathy's per turn scores so the more turns you have with Cathy getting a per turns score of zero, the lower her score will be.<br />
<br />
Its sort of silly that 4000 or 5000 years after Cathy gets whacked then she still has a score hanging around. It ought to cost you at least 1 point per turn to have your name listed on the histograph. That way the scum would eventually fade away and vanish.;) <br />
<br />
This points for all eternity thing is part of the reason, that allowing the AI players to respawn was such a numb nuts idea. Cathy used to get the chance to start over 3 or 4 times with 4x as many military units plus she got to keep her culture and keep her points. Kill Cathy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find her a good neighbor in most of the game, although not so helpful.<br />
<br />
If I have had a look at the thread and saw that SirPleb the great also want to add a space ship to his trophy list I would never choose this way!:cry: <br />
<br />
Well, I have never saw this much land in any civ games. So I totally forgot I could go early war and destruct the French and Russians. I just expand w/o spearman. Got caught by barbarian uprisings several times, lost, er, about 100-200 gold, maybe a good lesson to me.<br />
<br />
In middle ages I began to research myself. Joan was generous enough to give me 100 gold per turn for any of my techs, so my cash flow always turns good. Joan was also in a good shape with my advanced techs so she went war with Lisa and soon crushed her. Then she started to battle with Cathy. Meanwhile I got Panzers and would like to start a GA to get Computers and some other Modern techs faster. So I used 12 Panzers to join Joan in the war. In 6 turns Cathy lost most of her cities(to me, of course :D)and I sued peace for yet another city.<br />
<br />
Never turned to Democracy because I never had the time to do the research and when Joan discovered it, it was late-industrial and I was already in my very-late GA.<br />
<br />
Got ship launched quite early. Actually it is my earliest SS victory. Still wonders how many centuries SirPleb would be ahead of me.</div></div><hr />

Unlike what many others appeared to have done, I am not a gambler and this didn't attack anyone early on. (I do find it somewhat surprising that so many people knew exactly where to send their archers to take out Russia quickly though :rolleyes: ) I simply expanded until I ran out of room to put more cities, then began my attack. The winning move was my upgrade of 23 horsemen to knights on one turn, who then rampaged through Russia, conquering them in 15 turns. I then noticed that France and England had no saltpeter; poor Joanie and Liz! :lol: My knights immediately turned on France and ran through their cities as well, taking over all of France in 19 turns. I stopped for 10 turns after that to research Military Tradition, then upgraded 30 knights -&gt; cavalry and rampaged through England in 8 turns (!) The three move of those cavs is almost unbalancingly powerful. Now I've just got to take care of the civs on the other island and then hit spacebar about a million times. :D The conquest timeframe isn't BC years here, but it's not exactly that late either. I expect a score somewhere around the 10k range. :king:<br />

Quite often it's the difference between being able to attack the next city in one turn or having to wait two turns (and likely being exposed for one of those turns).<br />

I don't find that stumbling straight into Moscow early in the Game would be weird or unusual at all. I have not gone back and counted the tiles, but Moscow and Berling were almost at the minimum separation spacing and right on a virtual N-S axis.<br />
<br />
Sent my first unit east and faded to the north when I ran into mountains and big water. That decison was driven by looking for the fat part of the map and running away from the first jungle and mountains I could see. (note: I used my worker for this)<br />
<br />
Sent my second unit straight north 5 turns later and stumbled into mountains, goody huts, and pachyderms.<br />
<br />
Kept building miltary units because the goody Gods smiled on me and then sent my third unit in a straight line south that found a goody hut off the path to the east and then waltzed straight into Moscow. --- Badda boom Badda bow. ---  I probably would not have attacked Cathy with just an archer and a warrior (with another archer not far behind) if I had not seen her first settler pop out with a spear escort. I feel that the AI cities are at their weakest in the early game just after they have produced a unit and particularly just after they pop a settler. Making a settler drains their production bin and drops the population down to where they probably cannot rush an extra defender above and beyond the units you can already see. Strike one turn earlier and the can shift production to a military unit, plus still rush 1 or 2 more defenders.<br />
<br />
Even if I lost the gamble to take Moscow, it would be 25 or 30 turns before Cathy would produce another settler and by that point (60 or 70 turns into the game) a civ with only one city would be doomed to a secondary role at best.<br />
<br />
Would have sent the fourth unit straight west but quick contact with Cathy refocused the strategy. Met Libby and Joan in the Barb wars around Moscow after it was dressed in blue.<br />
<br />
I thought it odd that I never saw Cathy or Libby's scouts at any point in the game.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, the shortest route out of the jungle was right through Moscow anyway.<br />
<br />
I would be interested to read more is to how people exploited the traits of Otto to their advantage. We shound see a different ratio of cultural and diplomatic attempts in this game. I only built one barracks early on and Berlin never made it into the top cities on the demog listing because I built military units and sttlers there almost constantly until Sun Tsu's came on line.<br />
<br />
I was on a beeline for mapmaking and/or literature as first tech priority, hoping to buy up to mapmaking from contacts and then make libraries available as the planned first improvement in all cities. I bought horseback riding, temples, and polytheism from Libby as well and pretty much turned on the research and never looked back.<br />
<br />
I was trying to add up the income from barb farming, but my note taking skills had a few holes in the process where I forgot to keep good track of things here and there (was doing more whacking and less note taking), but I am certain that the total income due to barb villages at 25 gold per whack was well in excess of 2000 gold. I got tired of the barb farming and shut it down with fortified and spaced frontier guards even before I could fully get enough settlers out to claim all the spaces.<br />
<br />
One exploit that I felt was critical to this game was the &quot;AI knows all the barbs on the map&quot; exploit and that was one reason I was so hot for mapmaking. Trade maps with a neighbor and get all the barbs displayed for free even if the AI you trade with has never been near the area where the barbs are located. Later in the game, India and China where locating barbs in my backyard for me with their maps and yet they had never even seen my continent up close. <br />
<br />
Any player that did not know of this exploit would have been at somewhat of a disadvantage in this type of game.<br />
<br />
I said early on that the game would have looked much differently if Matrix had not editted out the civ that may have started on the Northern Plain and the civ that may have started on the eastern coast.<br />
<br />
This map definitely had a culturally linked starting flavor: asian civs on one landmass and european on the other. The Meds, Mids, American, and Zulus were on break. What if Rome had been to the north and Greece to the East?</div></div><hr />

I'm not trying to accuse anyone here; I believe that all of the best players, and almost all of the overall participants in the GOTM, play this game completely fairly and honestly. But at the same time, the spoilers thread always starts out with 6 posts and 150 views - happens every game. I'm sure that the majority of people found Russia fairly, but it does make me wonder sometimes. Maybe I'm just being paranoid; I tend to do well in the GOTM, and I certainly don't begrudge other people's success. :)<br />
<br />
I think my game played out differently than other's, from what I've been reading. While I'm going to save most details for when I do my full write-up, in my game the expansionist civs seemed to get an enormous advantage from their trait. I found no more than 2 goody huts the whole game, and I had several warriors out scouting in every direction. Russia and England must have popped a ton of huts; they got 5 techs ahead of me by like 2500BC! I expect that on Deity, but not on Monarch. England may have gotten a bonus settler at some time too, because they were several cities ahead of the other AIs (and me!) for the whole early game. I also had next to no problem with barbarians; ONE uprising the whole game. Was that due to the fact that the AI civs were out there scouting so much? I don't know. <br />
<br />
And three-move units rule! :D How else do you think I blitzed through roughly 20ish English cities, capturing all of them and quelling resistance in each, in a mere 8 turns? This is before the age of railroads BTW; I might have been able to do it in 1 turn with them. I have heard of others doing that, and I might try it with another civ later in the game. We'll see. I'm getting lots of feedback from my comments though, so that's a good thing. :)</div></div><hr />

Anyway, Cavalry is only overpowering when you get em before the AI get's Nationalism, and that don't happen so often on the harder difficulties, and they are just as good versus Riflemen as Horsemen versus Spearmen, so overpowered? Nope.<br />

I see no surprise here, at least not at this map. Russia and England are expansionist and, in my game, their scouts found me early on. It's not too hard to search in the direction the scout came from, if prolonging the line from my capital to the place of meeting. I started to attack Russia about 2000BC with 5-6 archers and a spearman and could've done this even without having met their scouts, since 3 or 4 scouting warriors would have found them in this time for sure. After Russia, I attacked England, and only this peace treaty gave me contact with the French.</div></div><hr />

I too find it &quot;interesting&quot; that there are lots of views, and little posting early on. :lol:<br />
<br />
I, personally, don't read the spoilers until I have the entire world-map.  I think that at this point, the game is well enough advanced, and that the spoilers don't &quot;help&quot; me. :)  However, I don't post my progress on the thread until the game is progressed much further.<br />
<br />
I sent my first warrior south, and did find the russians by a fluke.  With warriors, I move to mountains to get the maximum field-of-view.   I basically followed the mountain chain south, until I saw the russian cultural boundary.  I was very surprised that it was so close, and given her poor starting position (littel food etc) I  immediately decided on early conquest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GF thanks for the tip.  I have never thought of Horseman in that way, and I have failed to use them properly in every game.  :o For some reason I always go for swordsman to attack and it takes me longer to get enough together before I feel comfortable attacking.  I am going to try that on my next game and see what happens.  It should help out tremendously when I have to try for an early advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Jun 14, 2002, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not trying to accuse anyone here; I believe that all of the best players, and almost all of the overall participants in the GOTM, play this game completely fairly and honestly. But at the same time, the spoilers thread always starts out with 6 posts and 150 views - happens every game. I'm sure that the majority of people found Russia fairly, but it does make me wonder sometimes. Maybe I'm just being paranoid; I tend to do well in the GOTM, and I certainly don't begrudge other people's success.  <br />
<br />
I understand your comment, but I think most people are honest when they play the game.  I don't ususaly post until the game is in the wrap up stage which is very late in the game.  I do look at the posts earlier though.  I always wait until I have the world map, which is usualy not too long into the game, and I wait until I feel confident that I have the game won. <br />
<br />
I found the Russians early on just by exploring the mountain range as others did, but I did not attack until I had 6 swordsman ready to advance on them.  Three for moscow, and three for another city.  There were more comning just behind them.  I tend to be too cautious when I attack.  The plus side is I almost never loose when I attack, but the bad thing is I don't get as early of an advance as I probably could. Russia lived in my world for a while before I finished her off with Calvary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 14, 2002, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the view count for the thread counts every time you personally open it up. SO if I have posted an early post and then come back and read the responses 5 or 6 times over the next two days, then I count as at least 7 or 8 views against my one post.<br />
<br />
I for one like to post and early impressions post in the spoiler thread even without reading what others are saying and then get back to the game until it is pretty much set on the path to its final outcome.<br />
<br />
I am a believer in extreme patterns of play to maximimze score, so I beleive that the real scoring ouctome is set by 1) the sequence of moves in the first 100 turns combined with 2) effects of randomly generated events.<br />
<br />
I don't think that anyone who found out that I built the GreatLight in about 310AD would really be able to do anything different in their game to get it any earlier unless they just happened to be the beneficiary of a well timed GL from combat and just lucked in into having an appropriate coastal city, AND were just lucky enogh to already have built their FP, AND were just lucky enough to probably have had mutiple GLs so they could already have an ARMY and the Heroic big bronze thing.<br />
<br />
I am really amazed at how totally different the games really are by just 100 turns into the game.<br />
<br />
If I was into creating interesting game formats that would provide something different to the GOTM after we complete the initial game cycle, I would post a game set that only used tiny maps and only counted the score up to perhaps 1000BC. There would be 4 or 5 different maps and your score in the game set would be your point total for all the maps.<br />
<br />
The game is won (for the most part) by the person who builds the 8th through 10th cities first. Random factors such as Goody hut yield or not, and early combat luck, can induce as much as a 10% swing in the game results FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL EARLY EVENT. If you have a sequence 3 or 4 lucky breaks early in the game it can result in a 30% swing of the advantage in your direction. As the game progresses and more things occur each turn, then the outcome of each event has a less critical effect.<br />
<br />
In one very early turn, I got a settler out of one Goody hut and a warrior out of another. Considering I had a total population of 1 citizen and an army of one worker and one warrior, that Goody Hut yield would be rated as a jump that virtually doubled my position in the game. In some ways, the randomly generated outcomes that give early game play depth also contribute significantly to making the games play differently for people even if they start with exactly the same features.<br />
<br />
After 20 or 30 turns of play, Sulla's game would not really be the same as mine anymore. If you look at the SirPlebe's or CB's games as well you will see that there will be common elements suchs as the terrain and the start position but beyond those common issues and the box that the CD came in, the experiences will vary widely and diverge more than they will converge into the possibility of a single winning outcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jun 14, 2002, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Following on from what Cracker said, I read somebody's (forgive me, I can't remember who!) post suggesting that the goody hut contents be fixed at the start of the game, rather than calculated randomly.  Hopefully this has been passed on to Firaxis - its a very good idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 14, 2002, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should expand on what Ainwood said, since I have repeatedly posted the request for a flag to lock the goody hut yield outcomes in a game.<br />
<br />
By having the goody hut outcomes be randomly generated at the start of the game but fixed for the dureation of game play, I mean that the general type of outcome should be set at the start of the game. If a hut is randomly generated to produce a tech, then it might produce different techs depending on who opened it and if all the techs had been researched it would shift to gold.<br />
<br />
If a hut was randomly generated to yield a warrior it would always yield a warrior, unless you were already in era 2 in which case you would get gold.<br />
<br />
If a hut was set to spew out barbs you would always get barbs unless you were expansionist and then you would get a map or gold, or a deserted village. Since expansionists can't get can't get barbs they need something substituted just for their case.<br />
<br />
If the hut was set to give gold it would always give gold regardless who found it but perhaps the expansionists would get more gold if that fit the game model.<br />
<br />
The key point is that a flag needs to be available for tournament style play so that when I open a sequence of three huts and Ainwood opens the same sequence of three huts then we get the same outcome if we are playing the same civ. I should not get settler-warrior-settler while Ainwood gets deserted-barbs-barbs just because I took 6 steps to reach the first hut and Ainwood tok 5 steps or vice versa.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps the removal of all goody huts would be an answer until a better solution was found; like locked outcomes. I doubt that the AI benefits as much as the human player with regards to the goody huts, at times it seems that the AI does not even try and open some goody huts. Anyway, removal keeps things balanced for both the AI and the human.<br />

Besides stacks of 24 horsemen sacking my cities, my warriors couldn't kill them, my archers couldn't kill them, and my horsemen couldn't kill them. Spearmen on mountains were killed by lone barb warriors. I went as far as rebooting to see if it might change the random # sequence. No noticeable change.<br />
<br />
I missed all the early wonders as usual. Once i eventually got horse hooked up, i built as many horsemen as i could and joined an alliance againt Cathy with Joan. Most of her cities became mine. By the time it was over, Cathy had 2 cities to the far east of Moscow.<br />
<br />
Right about the time i got chivalry and upgraded my horsemen, i started demanding things from Liz to get her furious. Then i demanded she remove her troops or declare war. She did and i signed aliances with everyone else (except Cathy). I took most of her cities but Joan took her share as well. Got my first GL in this war and a knight army gave me the heroic epic. No more Liz.<br />
<br />
I had Newtons and needed suferage for a GA. As soon as i got it, Joan decides she doesn't like paying all that money for techs i sold her and starts moving units towards some inner undefended cities. She declared war and i signed alliances with everyone on the other continent. I took one of the old english cities and she moved a stack of 30+ riflemen  towards it, so i backed off and let her take it. For the next 20+ turns, i fought a defensive war because my military wasn't that good. Using bombardment first then taking out her attacking units, i whittled her down to my size and got lots of elite cavalry. My second leader moved my capital to Moscow. This really upset her and she focused on attacking there which made a defensive war really easy. I took a city here and there slowly shrinking her empire. India had made peace with her, and eventually signed a MPP with her, so i signed one with him also. This whole war lasted over 40 turns as a republic.<br />
<br />
The other continent never warred among themselves that i could tell. India started it's spaceship so i either had to go take them down or win via space race.  With the huge continent and my core cities centralized, i never had much of a navy so it would be a major undertaking at this point to 'go get them'.<br />
<br />
I'll post results because i probably didn't do that well and i see no reason to be secretive about it.<br />

I might be able to provide some insight into the high view and low post-count early on in the GOTM threads.  Unlike you guys, I don't own a copy of Civ III yet (Dell promised it in 4-6 weeks... we're in the middle of week 3 right now).<br />
<br />
Even though I don't own the game, I do enjoy following how different players play the same scenario.  In particular, I find Sulla's and Zachriel's summaries entertaining and enlightening.  I think there may be others that own Civ III but maybe are intimidated by competing in the GOTM and follow it like I do.<br />
<br />
Just a thought...<br />

<br />
Score: Somewhere in the 10k area<br />
<br />
<br />
I used a quite useful teqnique to stop Barbarians from appearing I used ALL my produced warriors (which was 1-2 between every settler in the beginning), as scouts, putting one on every Mountain top(here and there), so I could see every single tile around my nation. I only had 1 Barbarian uprising.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I started by attacking Russia, but not so early as many of the other players here did. I had 30+ horsemen when the war broke out and because of an RoP deal I could take 4-5 cities within the first 2 turns. I left the Capital alone with the intention of having it build the wonder it was building for me. The Great Library. But it lost the race and started building the Sun Tzu... I got peace with em, did some espionage and noticed the turn amount left on the project. I also noticed that there could be some more improvements done on their worked tiles. So I sent some workers to their city and mined 3 plains and 1 hill for them, shortening the work on Sun Tzu for them by half or so. By now I also signed an RoP with England, and I ran to their only Iron deposit with a warrior and a spearman, and sat there waiting.<br />
When the Sun Tzu was built it became mine. And I took the rest of russia.<br />
<br />
Now my eyes went for England, I sent all my horsemen at em, and conquered em I did. (Many knights was used in the process aswell), after that I took a look at France and was afraid that they were gonna get Musketmen. But they had no Saltpeter so I attacked em with my Knights. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't know when I controlled the entire continent but it was somewhere in in the 1000 AD area.<br />
<br />
Then I had some wars with Japan and India to take Luxaries, and a World War broke out because of MPP's.<br />
<br />
Anyway, when I got Panzers I took out Japan, then I went for India, crushing them, and then I atacked China. (Only razing cities here because I didn't want Domination).<br />
<br />
My tanks ran out when I attacked China, so I got peace. Rebuild my army, and later attacked again, leaving them with a tundra city on my main continent.<br />
<br />
I settled some good grassland sites on the smaller continent and abandoned my tundra cities 1 by 1. <br />
<br />
Later in the game I used Nukes to create Floodplains, and increased the amount of citizens on every grassland tile that I nuked with 0.5 , and every plains tile with 1. <br />
<br />
Got anarchy twice when warring in Democracy even though every citizen was kept happy with entertainment.<br />
<br />
Researched 17 Future Techs, and got a total of 5.7 points from it :D   there is deffinatly something wrong with the score formula for Future techs...<br />
<br />
Anyway, won by Culture at 2050. I guess it won't be the earliest :D. Would be pretty funny if it is, so please don't win by culture!<br />
<br />
Anyway, it was quite a fun game. And the first where I used my Nuke The River Teqnique! (to create floodplains).<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, have a good game!</div></div><hr />

As I understand it the rules for a spoiler thread is that you cannot look until the world is known or you are a long way into the game.<br />
<br />
In my games I do not post early but do look at how others progress. In my game while I discovered Russia early I did not invade but concentrated on filling my borders. I wish I had as it is 1990 and Cath is the most powerful nation with me and Liz in awe of her army/culture/the lot:eek: .<br />

This is the last time I try a make the world love me strategy as CIV III is a conquest game. Someone built the UN a million years ago but no election has been held.<br />

France is truly dead now.  I sent several tanks at them and within a few turns theu were gone.  I then went to work on clearing the second large continent.  Japan went quickly under to my modern armor.  China was nice enough to weaken herself in assisting me in destoying Japan.  I then cleaned China off from the map in a short period of time.  It is early in the 1900's and I am getting bored milking the score.  I think I waited too long before I wiped out the enemy, my score is not going to be very high.  Currently it looks like I might be able to get about 7000 or so.  I will have to watch my culture though.  It is already getting too high.<br />

I dealt with barbarians by spending my money, evacuating the cities and letting them beat their heads against nothing.  Looked like mass suicide.  Very satisfying.  I stayed peaceful and built culture and knowledge beelining to motorized transportation (Panzers).  I had a factory in every city (28) and began building nothing but panzers.  I attacked England with 30 Panzers and the GA kicked in.  I was pumping out 6-7 Panzers per turn.  I wiped England off the continent and decided to try a UN victory since I have never tried that.  Got the UN and the vote came up offering Otto and Cathy as candidates.  I forgot who I was (major brain cramp) and abstained.  There was no clear victor so the game continued.  I realized what I had done and frantically tried to figure out how to trigger another vote.  I guess it's just a random number of turns thing so I started bribing everyone every turn trying to keep them polite.  The vote came up after Japan had nearly sucked me dry and I won!  Not a high score but very satisfying despite my foo-pah.  Good luck to all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But some questions which have been bugging me since I read this thread, some people did very well with early attacks, I intended to do this, but in the end never fought a single war, never had a golden age, only got a couple of wonders, Adam Smiths (was aiming for JS Bachs and was beaten to it by 5 turns), and UN. Didnt bother trying for early wonders thou.<br />
<br />
I got 7/8 cities up and running ASAP, built temples and barracks in most (all?), after a warrior or spearman defender, then hooked up the nearest iron resource, and built a dozen or so swordsmen, and prepared to attack russia - then realised they had pikemen and a few musketmen, so backed down. The units I built never saw combat.....<br />
<br />
So questions;<br />
<br />
Early military rush - do people bother with barracks (cheap for germany), or in fact many buildings at all?<br />
<br />
I built most cities in the jungle area - trying to snag the luxury resources - Bad Idea? (took lots of worker to make these cities productive, but when they were they were very good - 200 turns later :)<br />
<br />
Horses were added to trade network in time to make six or so knights/later cavalry.<br />
<br />
Spent most of game with low tech rate, and bartered for techs for luxuries and cash, (later on I led tech race in some branches - in modern era)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2002, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">JediSloth, <br />
<br />
Here is my two cents worth.<br />
<br />
I tend to attack somewhat early in the game and this is what I do.  I like to wait until I have Iron before I attack.  I build warriors for future upgrades to swordsman and let them explore until I have Iron (Science rate is 100%, and I am micromanging my city(ies))).  While they are exploring I have them attack the babarians, this generally gets them upgraded to Veteran or Elite.<br />
<br />
When I get iron, I build a barracks in a high productive city.  I them send all warriors to that city as well as having that cities production switch over to producing swordsman.  After I discover Iron Working I switch my science to 0%, and my tax rate to 100%.  My goal is to upgrade my warriors and I need money.  The techs I will get from the civ I will be attcking.  In this GOTM it was Russia.  When I get at least 6 swordsman I attack.  I like to have at least 3 swordsman per city.   This gives me a comfortable edge to ensure that I will win.  <br />
<br />
From here it is a matter of style of play.  I may take one or two cities or a whole bunch.  One thing I always do before I kill of the civ is to let them have peace for at least a turn and take their techs, money , and map.  This will recoup the investment you just made in the war effort.<br />
<br />
Others are more aggressive on attacking than I am.  I am experimenting with Horseman vs Spearmen and it may also work well.  I am still not sure how much I like that one.  It does give you the units to upgrade to Knights or Calvary for later in the game.<br />
<br />
As far as the golden age is concerned, you should never miss it.  I once played the Egyptians and kept 4 chariots in reserve to trigger my GA when I wanted it.  I was just entering the modern age when I wanted my GA.  I found a unit that I was at war with that was almost dead (1 health rifleman) and had the chariots attack it.  The first two died and the third one won the battle.  You may have to get creative, but you need to trigger the GA.  It is too important to miss and in a lot of cases can be the equalizer against the AI.</div></div><hr />

This 20 turn warp drive shot of productivity and cash is just what you need to complete any strategy.<br />

Whether you get it by building wonders or by carefully setting up condition to use a badly out of date UU, just make the effort to include getting a golden age in your game strategy and your whole outlook for the game may change.<br />

My thoughts are generally that I want to trigger the GA after I have enough cities to really benefit from its power. Preferably I am in Democracy or Monarchy/Republic.  If the FP is already complete then the power of the GA is virtually doubled.</div></div><hr />

Everyone should have a Golden Age. I had mine with the first Panzer attack. Germany was mobilized for war at the time, and every one of twenty-one native German cities had factories, and hydro-power (Hoover Dam). Productivity exploded to say the least. This is the battle plan that brought Germany into a Golden Age<br />

<br />
This was my first game playing the German's, and I must say that Panzers rule.  The extra movement point is a huge difference maker over regular tanks.<br />
<br />
Established Berlin at starting position, made three warriors for exploration(east, west then south) then my first settler.  Established 2nd city on the pond by ivory.  Discovered Cathy and noticed close proximity of Moscow.  Established cities at spices (?) in jungle, and on hill by incense.  Discovered iron in mountains by Berlin and sent my next settler there.  Built barracks in Berlin and second city and started building swordsman (no horses conected yet).  Attacked Cathy with 6 swordsman, and took Moscow.  Too many losses after a couple of turns, so we made peace.<br />
<br />
Spent the next several centuries expanding, then attacked Cathy again with knights.  Took almost all of Russia's cities, and made peace again.  Another hundred years or so and France declares war.  Not really sure why, but I made her pay.  Luckily she had made several cities along the east coast and throughout the jungle for me.  I took all of her outlying cities in a few turns, but never penetrated her homeland, as she had musketeers, and I had knights still.  After supplying me with nearly 10 cities we made peace.  I then declared war on the remants of Russia and banished Cathy to an island.  The whole north and east were mine, with the south belonging to Joan, and the west to Lizzy.<br />
<br />
Tha was my last war until I had Panzers.  I spent the years in between building infrastructure, buildings, and a tech lead.  My first wonder built was Theory of Evolution, but the most important was Hoover's Dam.  As a side note, I actually go to build the Iron Works, but it came much later in the game.<br />
<br />
As soon as I had the ability to build Panzers, I starte almost every city building them.  I did not have oil, but Joan had traded it to me for 1gpt!!!!!  After 20 turns of 1gpt oil, Joan had lost her supply, so I did too.  I immediately attacked Lizzy, with the assistance of Joan, the Chinese AND the Japanese.  With no more oil I had to beeline for Lizzy's supply of oil deep in her territory.  After about 12 turns, Liz was no more.  I kept all of her outlying cities, but razed her core cities and built my own.  (Thanks Liz for building railroads throughout my new realm:)  After a few years of peace, I decided it was time for Joan to go.  Joan's cities were larger and much better defended, so I had a tougher time, and more losses agianst her.  She also had a stack of nearly 60 infantry, riflemen and lonbowmen wandering into my territory.  That stack never did attack, only walked back and forth.  By mid 1700's I owned the entire continent.  At that point Cathy, Joan &amp; Lizzy were all extinct.<br />
<br />
I slipped a city in between China and Japan where Inda had been (they were destroyed by Japan a short while earlier).  China and Japan were in constant warfare for the next 80 or so years, neither gaining ground, but falling hopelessly behind in tech.<br />
<br />
As soon as I had modern armor, I airlifted a total of about 80 MA onto the other continent.  I first eliminated China, the gifted Japan 1 city on an island ajacent to a city of mine, then attacked.  I eliminated about 25 Japanese cities in 3 turns, 18 of them in the last turn.  Of course, I razed all of China's and Japan's cities, and built three of my own on luxuries.<br />
<br />
Spent the next 170 years milking.  After reading the above posts I see areas to improve.  It never occurred to me to get rid of tundra cities and place new ones on fertile land.  I also see I wasted my time researching the rest of the tree.  Should have gone all entertainment.  Hardest choice was figuring how to win the game.  Could have gone culture, conquest, space race or domination.  Japan pissed me off by trying to make a new city in 2030, so they chose conquest for me....</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the past when I've used the GA to build units, I've tended to be rather disappointed with the results; the units built are pretty close to obsolete (or worse, dead) shortly after the end of the GA, so there has been no long-term boost.<br />
<br />
My strategy now is to mine as many grassland tiles as I can in the core area during the GA. Those grassland tiles that were producing zero shields will now produce two for the balance of the GA.  In certain cases, I'll even take some irrigated tiles and mine them, subseqently re-irrigating them. <br />
<br />
Once this task is complete, I have workers hop into the cities and hit the &quot;build&quot; key.  Going for massive city upgrades during the GA may provide an advantage that persists for the remainder of the game.<br />
<br />
GA in my game <br />
<br />
My GA was triggered when I built Sufferage  (used a GL) in 1485. I used the GA to build factories and hospitals in the core cities.<br />
<br />
I was very satisfied with my GA in this game.  The (two) cores got big and massively productive.  By the end of the GA, Germany was overwhelmingly powerful. <br />
<br />
I did a &quot;MapStat&quot; statistics in 1545, even before all the factories were completed. At that point I had eight cities producing 50 or more shields; twenty cities with 25 or more; thirty-three cities with 12 or more (that's net, after subtracting the waste).  Before the GA I think I had three cities that were over 25 shields.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I had a total of 106 cities at that point in the game.<br />
<br />
I'll write the game up once the milking is complete (jeez, milking is boring).</div></div><hr />

Well it's 1750 AD and I just built the Longevity wonder, my score is a bit over 8000 and with 200 turns to go and scoring over 50 points a turn.<br />
<br />
CB <br />
Cartouche Bee - I find your performance shocking, compared to my game. So, I'm trying to figure it out.<br />
<br />
In my game with 1640 tiles under control (one under the domination limit), a 70% luxury tax rate, all eight luxuries under control, a marketplace in every city, and pretty close to the maximum population my tiles support, I am getting 29 points/turn.<br />
<br />
Quoting SirPleb:<br />
<br />
The scoring works by averaging your per-turn scores throughout the game. For each turn a (hidden) per-turn score is calculated as:<br />
<br />
(Territory + HappyCitizens*2 + ContentCitizens + Specialists) * Difficulty<br />
<br />
Monarch difficulty = 4<br />
<br />
Territory contribution to score (1900 tiles of territory)<br />
<br />
In this game, the domination limit is 1641 tiles. Let's say you have 1240 land tiles, 400 coast tiles, and 260 sea tiles, for a total of 1900 tiles.  The internal score contribution of territory is 1900 * 4 = 7600.<br />
<br />
Happy citizen contribution to score<br />
<br />
What's the minimum number of cities required to cover 1900 tiles?  Simple division: 1900 / 21 tiles per city = 91 cities.  Based on terrain, and the cut-out corners of city area, more cities are required to cover every tile.  For simplicity of calculation, let's just round it up to 100 cities. <br />
<br />
The significance of this is that the first citizen in a city covers two tiles.<br />
<br />
Let's say that every available tile in your territory is occupied by a happy citizen.  The happy citizens score contribution is:<br />
<br />
(total number of territory tiles - number of city tiles) * 2 * difficulty level.<br />
<br />
The maximum contribution to your score provided by happy citizens on this map is:<br />
(1900 - 100) * 2 * 4 = 14400.<br />
<br />
Specialists contribution to score<br />
<br />
Let's take a gross estimate of specialists. Let's say that every land tile in your territory (again, minus the city tiles) produces sufficent food to support 1 specialist (a 100% grassland map).  Coastal and sea tiles have two food per tile - enough for a self-supporting citizen, but not a specialist. This gives us a specialist's contribution to score of:<br />
(1240 land tiles - 100 city tiles) * 1 * 4 = 4560.<br />
<br />
Grand total internal score<br />
<br />
Adding up the pieces: 7600 + 14400 + 4560 = 26560<br />
<br />
The total internal score is then 26,560.  The per-turn increase in overall score is then 26,560 divided by the number of turns in the game, that is, 540.<br />
26560 / 540 = 49.18 increase in score per turn.<br />
<br />
Given that the map includes a whole lot of mountains, as well as plains, desert, and hills...I'm really curious how you are getting over 50 points per turn.  It does not seem possible on this map, even in theory. What do your MapStats show?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Fossil,<br />
<br />
I did receive a few PM's and emails about this today, some have even asked for saves of my game to this point ( regrettably I must decline those requests for a game in progress).<br />
<br />
I'm currently running 4 squares shy of domination. However I'm not sure if I would trigger domination because my population is so high that it is listed as -1,000,000,000. If you use SirPleb's calculator I punch in the numbers and see that a score of 8000 in 1750 and going up about 54 or so is about 26414 (very close to your estimate) with a projected final score of 14820. This projection assumes that you are no longer increasing the internal score, but I think I will still increase this internal score although I'm not sure how much. Aeson, Bamspeedy and I have done some posts on this before in the GOTM6 spoiler threads.<br />

<br />
I wonder if you are doing the same thing I'm doing in my HoF game?  I think it might be possible to have a higher internal per-turn score on my regent game than Sir Pleb has had in some of his Deity games!!!!  But, what I am doing in my game, I don't think anyone would have time for to do in a GOTM.  I'm blazing to longevity now that I have most stuff rush-bought.  I'm kinda thinking I should have gone for longevity sooner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure we are going down a pretty similar road. I've changed my view of this process now from &quot;worker harvesting&quot; to &quot;specialist relocation&quot;. This is a more accurate way to milk more from the process. At my current pace now that longevity has set in I may get my internal score upto the 66000 range by the end of this game.<br />

Yep, we have the same idea!  I might get my internal per-turn score up in the 90,000 pt range, maybe over 100,000.  Aeson had an internal per-turn score of 103,000 on Deity (which should be twice as much as Regent), and it was on a bigger map!</div></div><hr />

If you get a chance would you mind explaining a bit on how you are getting the score so high?  I am very curious and I would love to see some of the saved games along the way (After the GOTM is over of course).  This is my first time trying to milk a game and I am learning a lot but I want to know more about how the score is generated for future games.<br />
Also I am curious as to how much of an impact workers have on the score?  I am builing a whole bunch of them to pop into the citys population at the end of the game, but I am unsure as to how much that will change my score.  For example does the fact that they are starving take away from my score?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2002, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can I take from this that you are finding cities that are expanding with WLTKD and Longevity, building workers with them and adding these workers to cities as &quot;specialists&quot;???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fossil</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2002, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...I think the light's coming on for me. My calculations above were based on a sustainable population in a city. <br />
<br />
So, are you guys building workers before population dies of starvation, then stuffing them in somewhere else, and rotating specialists around?<br />
<br />
Slick.  :goodjob: <br />
<br />
With Longevity, city populations quickly grow to unsustainable levels.  Then the food level drops, and the population starves down to size.<br />
<br />
I can clearly see that population juggling gives a short-term boost. But ultimately the food boxes drain anyway, correct?<br />
<br />
It seems to me, but I'm not sure, that a long-term boost using this method would require that on the turn a city builds a worker, that the worker is first counted as a population point for scoring purposes, then built.  Is this the case?  If so, all of a sudden it starts to make sense (I was completely baffled yesterday).<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a write-up of the management process you guys use.<br />
<br />
I've just been letting excess population die. If they can't find a restaurant, then they don't deserve to eat.   ;) <br />
<br />
One more question: As my total culture was leading me to a premature cultural victory, I was forced to sell off most of my cultural improvements. Once the temples and cathedrals were gone from the totally corrupt cities, I could no longer maintain 100% happy citizens in most of them.<br />
<br />
How does your strategic planning take this into account? Do you sell off cultural improvements in core cities early to preserve the happiness-builders in the corrupt areas late? Do you only build max-size cities on premo-land in corrupt areas? Do you relocate the palace late in the game? Or... do you use some other techniques?<br />
<br />
That's five questions. I guess I lied.  :o <br />
<br />
Thanks to all for contributions to the thread. Collectively, I find your writings entertaining and informative. It is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2002, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By building workers in cities that have specialists and then moving those workers to one city and adding all those workers to that city you create a specialist capitol. The cities that you move the specialist from now has a reduced food consumption so they produce another specialist. Rinse and repeat to the end of the game. I recommend 1 specialist capitol per continent, it will save you alot of ferry traffic.<br />
<br />
Now the specialist capitol is starving for food but you only lose one population per turn so as long as you add more than one worker per turn to the specialist capitol then you have a net gain. I'm adding about 50 new specialists per turn in this game.<br />
<br />
Since I have 8 luxuries and most wonders, happiness is not a problem. Almost all my cities are a size 12 or less to save on happiness and pollution. If a city does have a happiness problem and you can't add a cultural building to help then build workers until the city is small enough to have only happy people. Also on the cultural subject, cities around the edge of the continent need there borders expanded to gain workable area so build culture improvements but once they expand I sell the cultural building. Indeed you must manage culture so as to not trigger a premature cultural victory. I have absolutely no temples or cathedrals. Culture is reserved for science and wonders only.<br />

This might have answered some questions indirectly, if I missed something of interest let me know.<br />

I missed the boat completly on my GOTM with your idea here, but I will try it next month.  I never thought of the &quot;specialist capitol&quot;.  I was saving all of my workers for the last turn to add in to the game, and thus missing out on most of the points.  I also failed to realize my mistake on larger cities.  I am set up with most of my cities with max production area so they tend to be a size 22 or more.<br />

It is part of the game, and should be allowed.  There are all kinds of ways to win and exploit traits of the game.  If Fireaxis wants to change it; then that is fine, but until then IMHO it is legitimate and any one who goes through the pains of using this strategy should reap the rewards. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can easily hide reloading too, but it's still banned.<br />
<br />
Actually I would think this would be pretty easy to spot. Anyone who used it heavily would be at the top of scoring, and using a tool to show the internal score of the final save should show that something is fishy. <br />
<br />
Someone may be able to use this to boost their score a little bit and get away with it, but GOTM is, after all, &quot;on your honor&quot; so I don't think it's worth worrying about.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I think it's a cool strategy, and I'm really impressed with it. If I had the time and patience to try to milk a game I would be tempted to try it myself.

<br />
Your right about the banning, but what do you ban. Late in the game you may have many cities that are starving cause they have grown a bit too much, especially with Longevity. Should we just ban milking? Do we limit the scoring to be achieved to a certain figure each game? Anyway, Firaxis has set the city size limit at over 2 billion yet you rarely have enough food for 60. I just think that the rules should be left to Firaxis and they seem to pretty much address issues in a timely manner.<br />
<br />
Everyone plays the game with a different angle and different objectives. I can pretty much end a game as quickly as most, this milking thing is just another little avenue to travel. I think it's the choice of roads that make the journey interesting, and allow for us all to learn new things about how this game model works. If we all play the same it would really get boring fast.<br />

<br />
Add 50 starve 1; rinse repeat for 150 turns looks like a city with population of 7000+ people to me. This is in inspite of the theoretical maximum population of somewhere around 56 citizens who can be fed in the most perfect metropolis with 21 fully productive irrigated railroad tiles and lots of cows and wheat.<br />
<br />
I had never thought of the exploit possibilities of this programming error. Since only one citizen can starve per turn, you could technically get some amazing city pop numbers.<br />
<br />
What does the bottom line of the city display screen look like with all those itty bitty heads crammed in there? I would think that somewhere near a couple hundred people this graphic routine would just give up.<br />
<br />
This is truly the most amazing exploit I have every seen. I am impressed.<br />
<br />
I definately think this is deserving of some sort of Grand Golden Award and permanent recognition from Firaxis for whoever fully discovered this exploit. <br />
<br />
And this will be disabled fairly quickly by a patch. I don't think that city populations in the 100s or 1000s were ever part of the game design. Really cool snafu, but eeee gads what an exploit.</div></div><hr />

Nope, it just does the best job it can, by cramming them in on the line and then running off the side of the display dialog. Don't try and change the specialist types around though. ;)<br />

I think that the idea of the 2 billion city limit was a good one, it was set to allow more diveresed scenario's, when they become more practical.<br />

<br />
To disable this exploit they will have to add a code piece that disables the &quot;join city&quot; command whenever a city is producing less food than is required to support the population (or something like that). This fix is probably what we will see since it would seem to be simpler from a programming standpoint.<br />
<br />
A hard coded population limit would create future problems with scenarios with extra luxuries and greater food production values.<br />
<br />
Hard coding a limit to the number of pop points that can be joined to a city in one turn would also create conflicts with other legitimate strategies that do not use the 1 starving person per turn exploit.<br />
<br />
I am still so impressed. Beers are on me. A round for all the discoverers and a whack on the peepee for anyone who knew about this moons ago but said nothing while merrily milking away in the insanity zone.<br />

I'm going to have to go do this in a game real quick before the exploit is closed just so I can see what it does.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bamspeedy</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This concept originally started in GOTM6 when I had 275 or so extra workers that I added all to one city.  Didn't think of continually adding workers until I was about half way through my game when I had 900 workers!<br />
<br />
After this revelation, Sir Pleb may have to entirely re-write his 'maximizing score' article.  Most of his ideas still hold true (grab all grassland, go for quick conquest but stop just short of domination, etc.).  I could have scored thousands of more points had I more planned for this style.  Right now it is 1680 A.D.  My capital has over 3200 population points and I am adding over 100 pop points to it per turn!  So right now my capital is worth almost 10,000 points for the internal per-turn score (regent level).  I only have 1 hospital, but with no mass transit, that city has 3200 pollution icons!!  I've had several turns where I had 12-13 tiles change to global warming.  The sun finally turned red, never had seen that before except when nukes were launched.<br />
<br />
Normally, awhile after you reach max territory and population/happiness your increase of points per turn actually decreases.  I've been continually gaining 95 points/turn for the last 250+years.  Now that I am rush buying workers (only cities that have specialists), I'm starting to increase that.  When I get longevity, I should start making well over 100 points/turn.<br />
<br />
In the capital, about 2/3 are entertainers (still considered specialists), with the other 1/3 either scientists or taxmen.  With so many scientists I can have science set to 10% and still get any tech in 4 turns!  Once I get longevity and mass transit I will set science to 0, so the governors turn all specialists to taxmen and I should be making over 6000 per turn profit.<br />
<br />
I thought this would take forever, but if you turn the governor off in the capital, there isn't the long delay of when your adding each worker, the governor has to recalculate how to assign the specialists.  I just turn the governor off before adding the 100+ workers, then back on before I end my turn.<br />
<br />
I should end up with a score of 35-40,000 on this huge map I'm playing, but I bet I could have beat Aeson's 60,000 pts he got on deity, if I played this map again, or if I played on Monarch level.<br />
<br />
The demographics screen is a mess.  Notice I have a negative population and productivity.  The capital had several billion people ages ago, now it should be in the trillions, but when I look at the city screen the population numbers overlap with the date.<br />

Tell us what happened as the outcome from Joan's parking all those infantry next to your cities in post #43 or so??<br />
<br />
We know you survived, but what was really going on at that point in the game. AI Random unintellible behavior or was it an attack pending to somewhere that you were not paying attention to? <br />
<br />
There was no attack...ever!.<br />
I have since figured out why everyone was so gracious to me.<br />

Because of the pollution problem, I stored up as many specialists in all the other cities as I could until I got ecology. Then I rushed workers where ever there were surplus specialists. This all sounds so easy but you and I know that there is alot to be learned from this exercise.<br />
<br />
I'm lucky I don't have to deal with the dynamics on a huge map. Those deity players really get an edge cause they can get through the tech tree alot quicker, thus a higher potential score.<br />

Talk about a major population loss.  <br />
<br />
I only have 1 opponent left, with 1 city in the middle of the desert.  With her city stuck at size 1 she will never be able to build a worker to irrigate that desert even if she does get the electricity tech.  Cleo only has 2 techs in the middle ages.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where are you getting all these workers from to put in your city? You can't constantly produce workers in your other cities because soon there will be nobody left there. And at the most you can have 800 or so workers. And you're adding 100+ each turn. <br />
<br />
Having every city (except the capital and 1 wonder-city) producing nothing but workers is exactly what I am doing.  With every tile irrigated, they grow faster than they can build a worker.  With a very dense build it doesn't take very much to keep those people happy, nor too many citizens before it starts producing specialists.  Now that I have tons of cash, I rush buy a worker in every city I see that has a specialist.  All you are doing is transferring a specialist from one city to another.  As long as you are only losing the specialist, and not the happy person working a tile, you will not be losing any points.  The city that lost a specialist now has more food to produce another specialists/worker.  Meanwhile Washington loses just 1 specialist/turn, whether it had 200 people or 2000.<br />
<br />
I think the points are calculated AFTER workers are built.  After rushing several hundred workers on one turn, my points/turn increase dropped.  But on the next turn, after those workers got added into the capital my increase of points/turn went back up and above what I was making before.  This may come into play around 2048 or 2049 A.D.<br />
<br />
I have probably about 473 cities or so.  The limit is 512.  So I could have had another 39 cities building workers to help my score.  I have a few cities on islands, but I'm not going to worry about ferrying workers from there, too much of bother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the key point is POP POINT PRODUCTION. Post Railroad a typical city in an empire with the pyramids can easily grow one person per turn when there are no specialists sidetracking food.<br />
<br />
Most of us don't see this because our mindset is fixated on stabilizing the  cities so they will be happy and stable.<br />
<br />
When these guys get to longevity, each pop point is only costing 5 food units in the ICS type cities of 6 people. I could easily see the cities cranking out 1 worker per turn and growing by 2 pop points every other turn.<br />
<br />
With most cities other than the Specialist Concentration Camp set only to produce food, pop points, and workers. You could get by with only one library and one university for the whole empire. Gives a whole new meaning to starving students on a grand scale.<br />
<br />
The Rallying points feature in the XP will even make this exploit easier to do since you just set the cities to automagically send all their output of worker units straight to the Soylent Green City.<br />
<br />
I have always viewd the Longevity wonder as a royal PITA since it came too late to assist in empire growth. Now I see that its primary purpose is to enable growth that will exceed the starvation rate. We need one of the advisors to automatically convert to looking like an Edgar G Robinson character and we need a special unit that looks like the Soylent Green &quot;crowd control&quot; trucks to make this exploit into a complete scenario.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, the firaxis block to this exploit will be via a General settings flag that lets you toggle this exploit back on for the Soylent Green mod or mods based on out of control popualtion growth.<br />
<br />
Just too cool!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 0 libraries, 0 univerities, 0 banks, 0 courthouses.  Learn a new tech every 4 turns and make over 2400 gold/turn profit with science at 10%.  With science at 0% I will be making over 6000 gold/turn, and that will continue to increase.  I eventually want 1 or 0 specialists per city.  The more specialists in a city, the slower it takes for each city to add another pop point.  With placing cities ICS style I have almost no cities making over 10 shields/turn so they easily grow faster than I can build a worker.</div></div><hr />

This is so far outside the spirit of the way Civ3 is supposed to be played that it boggles the mind. Everyone seems to agree this is an exploit, so we can all agree that there should be an end to this, right? I mean my god, milking is one thing, but this is waaaay past that, and not in a good way. Are you playing Civ3, or are you trying to see how high you can get the scoring machine to go? It's one thing to maximize score by staying just below the domination threshhold; if you want to waste your time when the game's already won that's your own business. But using a programming loophole to create a city with 5000 people in it so your score can increase without bound? Forget it. And this is now a &quot;brilliant strategy?&quot; It's clever, but it's a game-breaking feature. Is this &quot;fun&quot; to those who are doing it? Does this mean that those players who play this way are somehow &quot;better&quot; because their scores are higher than everyone else? I will never use this, and if this is the way the GOTM is going, I'm out RIGHT NOW. <br />
<br />
Now I'll admit that this is mighty clever, and those who came up with it independently should have their due in this game (I guess, though it essentially ruins the competition for all those who don't do so). But seriously guys, this needs to end after this game. It's not meant to be part of Civ3, and it's going to ruin any future competition game if it isn't closed out.</div></div><hr />

Most people will not be able to cheat effectively because the game is deeper than just knowing where things are on the map.<br />
<br />
Your score would not be benefited the map of barb camps as they were randomly placed on my map in 270BC becasue your map would never look like that. There is a less than 1 in 30 billion chance that you would play the first 200 truns just the way that I played them or just  the way that CB or Bam played their games.<br />
<br />
I sense that you will gain skill and patience with time, but for now the performance of others will not have as great an impact on your score as other self improvement stratgeies that only seem to come with practice and time.<br />
<br />
While many people may read this thread and say &quot;Kewl, lets do that&quot;, there are only 4 high score awards to go around and I will bet that all those get claimed y masters who have at least three or four shots at refining this exploit strategy.<br />
<br />
All this is good because it means that we end up partitioned in to game play segments by the scoring system. You will see the power players working on a variety of different game play strategies and end game sequences to enhance their enjoyment.<br />
<br />
You can do this as well and then just live it up (except on Diety level which generally sucks about 50% of the time ;) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its definately an exploit in the standard sense of the game, but man it opens a whole new realm of possibilities in scenario play.<br />
<br />
Since the AI won't be able to figure this one out, I am fairly sure how this will turn out.<br />
<br />
But every post about this subject should start out with reverent awe for the core group that mastered the technique. All this whining and cheating screaming fails to recognize the sheer brilliance of the game play here.<br />

I find it not even painful to loose to this strategy because it is super human brilliant. But the strategy is also so overpoweringly brilliant that it alters the game to another totally different levle of objective attainment.<br />

Even though he consider's a lot of things exploits which I don't, this one is going way to far. I wonder if they will even allow this in HOF. <br />
<br />
And come guys, its a GOTM, a competition. If you want to go for a high score do it in the HOF. Here we're competing against each other. <br />
<br />
Some GOTMers do milk their games, but I don't think anybody seriously puts this much time into it. I don't its going to be very fun if everybody starts doing these things. <br />
<br />
I could have milked my game to whatever points. But instead I ended it early with a spaceship launch. Meanwhile I do have a couple of HOF games going on. Yeah I'll use all the strategies in the book for that one, but not for a friendly competition. <br />
<br />
What makes GOTM fun, is not just scoring and getting no.1 position in the GOTM charts, but comparing stories and ideas. I didn't play GOTM 7 but I read alot on it. I may try it sometime on my own. Also reading stories such as Sulla's and Zach's are what GOTM is about. <br />
<br />
Keep the milking in the HOF and the fun easy gaming alone in the GOTM. <br />

At least this tactic does not treat the AI like the retard it is, when you want us to treat it like a human being and 'play fair'.  This only affects score and does not help the human beat the computer in any way (unless you win by histographic, I suppose).  I consider some exploits like scout resource denial are no worse than sending an obsolete unit(s) to pillage so the AI sends most, if not all of it's units at the pillager instead of attacking your army or cities.  You think that second one is a great tactic and 'smoke and mirrors'.  Would a human player fall for the pillager tactic?<br />
<br />
Do I think this should be banned in future GOTM's?<br />
Of course.  But if it isn't this someone will figure out a way to ring the score up even more.  But I hear alot of comments from people like &quot;I don't play for score&quot;.  So why should they care anyways?<br />
<br />
Just shows how faulty the game's scoring system is.  They based the score on average throughout the whole game, so you couldn't just get all the land, and crank luxury up to 100% on the last turn to get an impossible to beat score.  To score higher, you have to get to domination faster.  Not true anymore.<br />
<br />
Philippe- You can't ban this for this GOTM.  Cartouche Bee has already played most of his game and you can't add a rule in the middle of a game.  For the next GOTM, sure go ahead and ban it.  But I think you using your worker to send 200 barbarian horsemen at Russia to wipe out thier military and gold, so that their capital is undefended is an exploit also. <br />
<br />
Since we all agree that the game's scoring system is faulty, does anyone have a better idea on figuring out who played the 'best game'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2002, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also think that the population stuffing is an exploit and should (after this GOTM) be banned. I hit this loophole quite a while ago by accident when I stuffed a whack of workers into one city to get rid of them. I was quite surprised to see them starve at just one per turn - that clearly (to me) is a bug which exposes unintended scoring. I haven't used it since, it seems to me to be an exploit which is as clearly out of bounds as the no-corruption trick, though this one is a lot more work :) I don't think it will be hard for Firaxis to fix and I hope they do eventually. The logical fix to my mind is for the starvation rate to increase as the population:food ratio increases. I.e. the more excess population, the more that starve per turn. Simple solution which was probably their intent anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, since competitions based only on score are inevitably going to follow the same pattern in every game (who can get to the domination limit first, generally speaking), I've been spending time playing in the Realms Beyond Epics (http://diablo.realmsbeyond.net/civ/epics.html) recently. These games each have their own scoring system, which is usually designed to causes the player to do unusual or unorthodox things to score points. The focus of the games is on comparing stories afterwards and discussing the way events played out differently in each game, and not so much on who &quot;won&quot; the game. It's not for everyone, but I think those who are becoming bored with a system where score is the only thing evaluated might be interested in taking a look. :)<br />
<br />
I do not play in the Tournament run on this site by Grey Fox, but it also seems to be organized well to avoid running up score in the endgame. The GOTM should retain its traditional scoring formula and will always have plenty of players, but I offer these alternatives for those who are interested in other ways of comparing games.</div></div><hr />

Hi Sulla,<br />
<br />
Well we just did something unorthodox and as you say not everyone was pleased. Problem with these kinds of things is that they get discovered and not exposed. They can not be addressed unless they are exposed, so it's our duty to expose these things. In the long run the game is better for it. Many times no one wants to listen cause they might have to take some sort of action.<br />
<br />
As for the so called tournament, they still haven't revealed a scoring system. I assume the scoring will be adjusted to highlight the games they like best, for reasons yet to be disclosed. Kind of like when we were kids and made the rules as we went or did not disclose the rules except to the inner circle.<br />
<br />
The GOTM is played for fun and points. Everyone knows it rated on points scored and sometimes it's hard to accept what others score but that is the way it is.<br />

The scoring system is one thing that Firaxis has not addressed.  People have exposed many exploits in this game that firaxis has fixed with patches, etc. (bombard anywhere, trading cities, 'multi'-cheat, etc.).  I don't know if Firaxis ever reads the GOTM threads, so someone will have to post something in the general discussions forum to alert them to this.  I do know they at least read the general discussion forums.<br />
<br />
Like Cartouche Bee said, someone could have found this exploit and continued doing this, without anyone discovering it.  They could use this, then abandon the city on the last turn.  Unless someone downloaded the game and watched the replay no one would know.  You would be puzzled &quot;why the heck did they abandon a city on the very last turn?&quot;  Now we know.<br />
<br />
Realm beyond Epics sounds like a good tournament, but like you said, it's not for everyone.  The goal of GOTM is just using the standard rules of the game going after the standard victory conditions.  If you award points for certain things, people will find ways to use these to be able to rack up the 'score' more or easier than someone who played just as good of a game and was of the same skill level.  With enough people you will always find more efficient/easier ways of racking up the points.<br />
<br />
The tournament on this site is emphasizing fast finishes.  They don't want to totally ignore points (someone who finished 1 turn later, but scored 1000 more points should not lose).  They've gone to the extreme of weighting turns to score with a 10:1 ratio (the game score accounts for 9% of your tournament score).  But even with this method someone who finished real early with a one-city challange will most likely lose to someone who finished much later with a bigger empire.  The guy with the 1 city played a better game IMO.<br />
<br />
What I kinda meant by 'any better ideas', I was asking for changes that should by done to the scoring system that Firaxis could do to make it more reasonable.  For example:1.  Award an early win bonus based on turns, not years, and it being high enough that could never be achieved through 'milking'.  2. Award points for wonders, improvements, great leaders, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Histographic Display and scoring code changes, fixes and add-ons: <br />
<br />
1)	Add the ability to generate a set of scores called tournament score for every player in the current game and display this score as fourth option in the histographic view. This score would be calculated using a simple text based equation load file that will co-located in the folder with the .bic file. The equation would use variable names from a Fireaxis released list of variable names that could be published and updated from a website with minimal effort or and minimal ongoing support costs. The default tournament equation file would include a first line of none or if the tournament equation file could not be located, then the program would default to displaying no tournament score. When the game is started and defined it would load the equation from tournament equation file and then lock the equation in for the duration of the game. This could be used to establish normalized or specialized scoring for tournament games like GOTM etc. An example tournament score calculation for a naval power game might be: = [happy citizens + specialist citizens + coastal tiles occupied] * 2 + [content citizens + sea tiles occupied] + naval units + [battleships + aircraft carriers + nuclear submarines] * 2 + [aegis cruisers] * 4. <br />
<br />
2)	Reveal the per turn score numbers (unaveraged) as a fifth option in the histographic display.<br />
<br />
3)	Fix the histographic score page to show the correct relative scores for culture and power when these option are selected from the drop down menu. Currently the graphics change but the scores stay unchanged at the average per turn score for all civs.<br />
<br />
4)	Fix the histographic score page to display the current year date and the score changes since last turn.<br />
<br />
5)	Calculate and display the current projected final score for the human player (including any early finish bonuses). This can be shown slightly separated from the listing of all civs and down at the bottom of the list. The score could be labeled current possible close-out score or something equally noncommittal and would appear any time after over half the other civs on the map had been discovered</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but I don't think anyone realized at that time what an effect it would have on score if you continually added workers to that city.  It certainly didn't enter my mind at that time.  Sure, I was thinking, 'wow, that's some free points'.  But that was excess workers I had that I had used up population points to make in the first place.  Once I realized that specialists slow down the population growth and when 'transferring' them to somewhere where they never die and allow all the cities to produce another one faster, I was amazed at the scoring potential!  It would be easy to get over 100,000 pts. on Deity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since opinions do differ, I guess we'll need a formal decision on whether it should be disallowed in GOTM in future. Does anyone seriously propose that it should be allowed and therefore even requires a poll? :)<br />

(Also IMO it should be disallowed in HOF, and in the HOF case it seems to me it should be disallowed for any submission, past, present, or future.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I started doing this in my current HoF game, I was thinking it will probably be disqualified.  But I went ahead with it anyways.  First, I didn't realize it would increase score by this much!  Secondly, I wanted to test how much it really does help.  I had made many mistakes in this game since it was my first real attempt at Aeson's 'settler flood', so I wasn't really worried about having to start a new game over because I would iron out any problems/mistakes I made in the second attempt (on a different map, of course).  I don't think there are any submissions in the HoF that have used this tactic, yet.<br />
<br />
If there is a poll, I think there should be seperate polls for GOTM and HOF.  HoF is aimed more at seeing how many points can be possibly made from a map.  HoF allows some things that GoTM doesn't.  Re-loading if you accidently trigger domination being one of them.  I have no problem whether it is allowed or not.  I will still finish this game regardless just to see what score is possible and see how much longevity helps this.</div></div><hr />

If required he could present his findings to Firaxis. Pretty much the rule has been to allow what Firaxis allows, in the past anyway. Funny how some exploits will be over looked, it appears to be based on how it fits into each ones game. Lots of cheap tactics are accepted but I guess we need some kind of advantage over the AI. Milker's will support concepts that allow them to score more, easier and warmongers seem to favor concepts that make the war faster and easier. Of course I favor things that make it harder for everyone else. :lol: <br />
<br />
And yes, Bamspeedy longevity is making a big difference. My per turn score is still going up. May not be legal in the past/present/future but it displays why some things work better than others, in any scoring game. I guess the trick will be to calculate the score that should be acceptable for a map and then make it so.<br />

It has 4400+ population points.  As you can see, the specialists goes off the screen.  I have over 2000 scientists in that city that you can't see, all that you see is a couple happy people and nothing but entertainers.  The actually population at times has been over 1 billion, but now only shows 470+million.  The ending digits gets cut off, so I have no idea now if it is in the trillions or quadrillions.  There isn't a simple calculation that I know of to figure the actual population.  I looked at a size 2 city and it had 40,000 citizens (20,000/1 pop point), while a size 12 city has 800,000 (66,667/1 pop point), plus you get a couple thousand more citizens for each food that is stored in the granary.<br />
<br />
The amount of food that is being ate and the pollution icons also run off the screen.  With over 4400 pollution icons I have lost about 400 of my grassland squares to global warming and I am still 20 turns away from mass transit.  I'm using the wonder as a pre-build for mass transit in the city.  I only have that city working on the coast tiles, because pollution only forms on LAND tiles that the city is working, thus at least I have no pollution to clean up.<br />
I'm sure once I do get mass transit I will only have ONE pollution icon.  <br />

IMHO it should be allowed until Fireaxis fixes the bug.  It is a lot of work to sucessfully implement this trick and I am sure that in order to get a higher score several things need to happen early in the game.  Everyone is aware of the potential issue here and can use the trick in their games if they choose.  So there is a level playing field for everyone.<br />
<br />
I understand that we are on an honor system for no reloading, but if we also have to rely on an honor system for this as well the potential impact to the score is too great.  There will be people who do not abide by that honor system.   The impact to the score is much larger with this scoring tactic.  Just by using it for a little while in the game and disbancing the city your score could go up by the thousands.  There is no way to detect this, and the rightful winners will not be at the top.<br />

The long term solution is to have fireaxis fix this.</div></div><hr />

When I add workers to a city size 12 of more to create cities of the size 20,30,40,50,60,100,1000, or 10000 I do it to exploit points (sometimes production and commerce ;)). If a city has food or not is of no concern to me. If I have to micromanage the squares that a city works to make food available so that I can add workers, I will. Once the deed is done I will then allow other cities to work those same squares so that I can add workers to them.<br />

<br />
you are both fairly sharp participants so it surprises me to see you advocate making it impossible to add workers to cities of pop 12 or above.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, never, never, never advocate or support hardcoded limits that make it impossible to do something if these limits are not accessible in the editor to allow adjustment. Some of the stupidist and most disruptive dufous head programming mistakes that we have seen in Civ3 have been directly tied to hard coded limits that impede the application of the game. (witness hardcoded rule that prevents naval units from transporting any naval units and the hardcoded limit that makes it impossible for any bombard unit to ever hit any non-combatant or artillery unit or any aircraft or naval units parked in cities.)<br />
<br />
There are scenarios which will include different food support levels of the pop points as well as significantly different happiness, luxury, and food resources.<br />
<br />
The problem (also known as really cool exploit) that we are discussing here is the ability to continue adding pop points to a city even when that city is slowly starving at the rate of one pop point per turn.<br />
<br />
A solution to this would be to add a spinner to the general game settings that would limit the maximum number of pop points that can be added to a starving city in any given turn. A starving city would be defined by any city where the current food production was less than the food consumption (the same condition that generates the display of the shortage dialog in the city screen).<br />
<br />
If the spinner were set to zero, then no new pop points could be added to a city with a food shortage. If the spinner were set to 1, then 1 pop point could be added to a city in each turn, even if the city was showing a food shortage. If the spinner were set to 100 then, 100 pop points could be added to a starving city in any given turn (Yes, this feature should be retained for its value in gameplay scenarios.)<br />
<br />
I would set the default value for the &quot;added pop points&quot; spinner to be 1 because this would be the break even case but it would still allow a civilian worker to be added to support the cases when you have to balance happiness and food production on a micro scale.<br />
<br />
It would be important to makes sure that the added pop point limit per turn does not engage as long as the pop points can legitimately be added to the cities. There are many examples where you finish railroading the world and need to get rid of hundreds of excess workers and I have often needed to add 7 or 8 workers to a size 12 or greater city just to get them producing something in a single turn. We should not throw out this legitimate use just to disable an exploit that can be prevented in other ways.<br />
<br />
Everytime we ask Firaxis to add an uncontrolled hard coded limit or every time Firaxis adds a hardcoded variable limit, then someone ought to get smacked because this is the wrong approach.<br />
<br />
The default game can always be limited to what the hardcoded value might have been, but at least there is flexibility to adjust performance variables when the need arises.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't say they have to hardcode it to 12 , but standard rules could be set to that, make it changeable. The adding of workers to create large cities is the number one exploit of all high scoring games. If you make too many workers and have no place to add them in smaller cities then you would have to disband them. Every single milker uses this exploit and may or may not realize that it is an exploit. Starvation has nothing to do with the real exploit, it is the relocation of workers that make it too easy to make great producing cities. I would expect alot of resistance to this because I'm sure the exploit is extremely prevalent and I'm sure the AI does not do this so, fair is fair.<br />

<br />
The exploit, however, has to do with using the fact that no matter how big the population/food ratio is, only 1 pop-point will starve in a turn, allowing you to create and maintain a population that far exceeds what your territory can support. I think any rational thinker can agree that this was not intended.<br />
<br />
I personally think that Firaxis should fix this by making it impossible to add a worker or settler to a city that is currently starving. Changing the starvation rate to match the pop/food ratio is another option, but I think that would make it too easy to starve captured cities down to 1 to avoid the problems of having a foreign population. Maybe if starvation caused some unhappiness this would be alright. The former just seems like a simpler, effective solution to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game designers clearly intended that large cities would take longer to grow. They did that by requiring more food to be gathered for the growth to occur. So moving workers around clearly defeats the intended growth rate of large cities.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not saying that it should be hard-coded, but I would like some form of &quot;control&quot;.  And I'm sitting on the fence a bit over worker addition is the limit, or the starvation rate is changed.  I actually think that I'd like the starvation rate changed.<br />
<br />
Basically, I enjoy playing the GOTM, but get a bit bored with milking.  I would like the score to be more a reflection of playing strategy than time available for milking.<br />
<br />
But don't get me wrong, I admire the people who develop these strategies, and the people who get the really high scores (not me :lol: ) get them from skill, not just milking.  The milking phase only ensures that you reap the rewards from a good early strategy.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clearly the exploit here is that civilians who are starving to death do not require any food or gold to keep them alive until the next turn as long as they are not the first person in line at the starving to death checkout line.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with the fact that workers and settlers could legitimately be added to larger metropolises if sufficient food was available. Using the fatser growth rate of smaller town ans cities to balance population is a legitimate and worthwile strategy. This is why settler farming should be done in towns and not in cities if you want the most number of settlers per unit time.<br />
<br />
We should not confuse the two issues.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Soylent Green&quot; exploit is brilliant and exciting but it definitely should not be an allowed strategy.<br />
<br />
Doing something spiteful to impede the flow of population from fast growing towns into other towns or cities should be avoided in any case where the desitination could legitimately support the population with food and happiness balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your analogy was my reasoning in why I was leaning towards the starvation fix, as it is more realistic.<br />
<br />
I was thinking that reducing the amount of workers that could be added to a city to (say) 12 would reduce milking, but actually the starvation thing would as well - you could only grow cities to a certain size, and it would probably be more worthwhile to move specialists out of large metropoli (is that the plural form :lol: ), to convert them to happy citizens in smaller towns / cities.<br />
<br />
Yep.  Fix the starvation.  Note that this fix on the starvation could make pollution one hell of a killer, especially following a nuke attack!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bamspeedy</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2002, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the thread from when this was originally brought to 'everyone's' attention. http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=246809#post246809 <br />
<br />
Notice that no one mentioned of any possible scoring made from this.  I added these 275 workers at 1996 A.D. I think.  So with 275 specialists at 1 pt *2 (warlord level), that was 550 pts.  Now, I had about 10% of the game left (54 turns out of 540), so this only helped my score by 55 pts (less when you consider starvation).  In my current game with this 'worker farming' or 'specialists relocation', whatever you want to call it, this has helped my score in the thousands!<br />
<br />
Normally, when people have excess workers after all the terrain is improved they added them into any city that still was growing, thus speeding up the time it would take that city to reach max population and help their score by 1 or 2 points maybe.  And there have been some times where every city already was maxed out, thus if you add 1 worker to each city, they all starve on the next turn anyways, so you might as well have disbanded them.<br />
<br />
I don't support the idea of the starvation (if you have a city size 12 and now it only has enough food to feed 8, you lose 4 pop points in that one turn).  This would lead to another exploit.  Since citizens can't work on a tile that an enemy is fortified on, players would send tons of units all over the place and fortify on every tile, thus starving a city from size 12 to 1 in just 1 turn!:p <br />
<br />
I don't like the idea of not allowing the addition of settlers/workers into cities over size 12, either.  Remember, in an ideal city, the city has 20 tiles to work.  Should the limit be 20, then?  Early in the game (on lower levels), I would sometimes add workers/settlers from nearby cities to boost my capital's population up if I wanted to speed up the process of building a wonder (like the pyramids, for example).  Now why shouldn't I be able to do that post-hospitals to get a wonder faster if my city needs to be working more production tiles?<br />
<br />
I like the idea of setting maximum city size at say, 60 (with this adjustable in the editor, of course).  To get to size 60 you would need every single tile worked by that city and it being irrigated, railroaded, flood plains, with a bunch of wheat (nearly impossible to have that perfect food city).  With a city maxed out at size 60, you would need so many more of these 'specialists capitals' to gain any real points, and for each one you have, you start losing even more scoring potential than just having one.  To get 3600 'free specialists' I would need 60 'specialists capitals'.  Thus, I would be needing to build 60 workers/specialists per turn just to keep up with starvation!   I guess this still will net some more points, but a heck of alot more headache on someone trying to pull this off, with diminishing gains in score.</div></div><hr />

You were upfront about declaring this discovery, I just think we may have been too narrow focused to recognize the real magnitude of the impact this would have on game play.<br />
<br />
I for one did not recognize the full impact on scoring or the fact that the one citizen starving per turn limit would effectively open the door to semi-infinite population farms.<br />
<br />
I still think that recognizing what this would do and then turning it into an exploit is absolute brilliance. We are all getting quite an education here.</div></div><hr />

That way if the city starves down one at the end of the turn you will only ever be able to maintain a city pop according to your food supply.<br />

I have to go head to head with you here and make sure your solution is recognized as creating punishment and barriers for legitimate strategies in games that you may not ever play ofrrecognize as having value.<br />
<br />
Locking out the ability to join workers (or settlers) to cities of pop 12 or above is a bad solution that eliminates many legitimate game play events that can be used in a standard game just to prevent the one extreme bad case we have discovered here.<br />
<br />
Even if the 12 number is technically adjustable, this is a bad idea and should not be implemented.<br />
<br />
The key exploit to prevent here is controlling the number of pop points that can be added to a city in any given turn when that city is already showing a shortage of food production.<br />
<br />
This exploit should be controlled by a spinner setting on the general settings page of the editor that will limit the number of pop points that can be joined to a city in shortage status.<br />
<br />
The default setting for this spinner should be 1, because there are legitimate cases where balancing population count and happy faces to get break even food production might require the 1 pop point addition. Further, there are cases where you might be using the stored food reserves in the granary to expedite production of an improvement or unit by just a shield or two per turn in order to combat the integer production problem that is so prevailent in the mid to late game.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Max added pop points in shortage&quot; spinner set to one reflects the break even case, where you add one but if the shortage is not resolved one will die. You can never exploit this case for excessive point gain as in the current situation.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Max added pop points in shortage&quot; spinner could be set to zero to make it impossible to add any people when a city is in shortage but that may be excessively tight without gaining extra benefit.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Max added pop points in shortage&quot; spinner could be set up to a large number (either 99 or 999 depending on the field size Firaxis gives) and this would restore the expolit as an option to support games like the &quot;Soylent Green&quot; mod of some of the StarTrek and StarWars type scenarios that will evolve.</div></div><hr />

Well, if I could make sense out of what you are getting at we could go head to head. ;) If you want to mini-micromanage to get an edge on the AI then so be it but I think it is frivolous and if it is really a problem it should be resolved properly and seperately not by us having to twiddle the controls.<br />
<br />
My case is based against farming workers off cities that require only 20 food to expand and then adding those workers to cities that require 60 food to expand. That is cheating the game out of 40 food and still getting to expand. This is a cheat, cheat, cheat. If you needed 3 of those workers to add to the population of a metropolis then I would concede the point. That solution then requires different classes of workers and I don't even want to bring that up.<br />

<br />
So I thought, theres plenty of luxuries around, Why don't I try doing a peacefull game (something Iv'e not done since the first time I played Civ III; and lost, my first loss in the Civ series in about 4 years), Unfortuanetly the map conspired with my usual stratagies to land me an apalling position; By the time the other civs had reached the industrial era I was behind in techs, culture cash and population, with no wonders at all; My capital had given me the ability to build more cities than any other civ, but as the were all almost surrounded by Jungle, they were all about size 2-5. <br />
<br />
I ended up retiring cos I had fallen way behind in culture and although I had the biggest army of any civ, I couldn't win any battles cos the others all had reached nationalism and had built their border cities on hills. I had two great leaders, but couldn't doa anything with them cos my armies would be hopelessly out dated and unable to take the Drafting mania that filled my opponents, and when I finaly did take a major city or two they flipped right back :( . Denying me the oppertunity to cath up in techs by negotiating peace. <br />
I have to say it is possible to come back from almost anything apart from a deficiency in culture; Cos the other civs will have 1000/2000 year old+ cultural improvements that bring in twice what yours can and you can't capture any wonders, cos if you do the city just flips right back.<br />
For this reason alone I like the cultural addition to Civ III, but on some maps, bad tactics can leave you in an unrecoverable possition. :) <br />
<br />
(My usual early trade tactic, for militant games, is to produce loads of cash, and then use military supremacy and cultural advantage to sweat techs out of the other civs, But when playing a peacefull/gardening game, where 70-90% of you army is workers/setlers You cant follow up your threats, and you end up getting realy bad deals for your money). <br />
<br />
But despit my failure and my moaning, it was actualy quite fun playing the GOTM, I'll try again next month, Hopefully there will be less jungle. :lol:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you will eventually be able to build up the population in the city to some level, but it will reach equilibrium with the food supply and that is not the current case.<br />
<br />
I think you may be fixated of the exponential population growth costs of food and that is definitely the wrong approach here. If you have managed things well in the early game, you will have hordes of population points stored in and dedicated to worker units and as you complete the railroad cycle all these resources have to go somewhere.<br />
<br />
Your suggestion of a hard cap limit that absolutely prevents workers from &quot;retiring&quot; and joining into large cities just so you can force that city to regrow the pop point from scratch is failing to recognize many of the designed in features of how the game is really played.<br />
<br />
Make lots of workers when there is lots for them to do and then have them retire and join cities when they run out of &quot;work&quot; to do.<br />
<br />
Your hard cap limit would create circumstances where the only solutions would be to disband the workers and waste at least 2/3rds of their value or to just settle more crappy cities to provide retirement homes for the workers at a maximum of 11 workers per city.<br />
<br />
Just sounds like your suggestion is trying to punish all population transfer strategies just to share the pain for loosing the &quot;Soylent Green&quot; expolit that is clearly outside the intended bounds of the game.<br />
<br />
It is legitimate to grow people in cities with granaries and then transfer them to cities without. This legitimately focuses cities on agricultural, commercial, and production strengths.<br />
<br />
It is legitimate to make lots of workers to help store pop points that may be unhappy and unsupported by luxury factors that are not yet available until the game progresses.<br />
<br />
It is legitimate to build workers with excess pop points before Aqueducts or Hospitals and then add these pop points back to cities at a later date.<br />
<br />
It is legitimate to store pop points in workers until mass transit makes it possible to add them to cities without pollution nightmares.<br />
<br />
You suggestion of hard limit that prevents adding pop points externally to any city above a certain size, eliminates all these legitimate strategies in one hacking blow instead of focusing on the one problematic behavior.</div></div><hr />

You listed many legit reasons for building workers. Your points are all well taken, but in reality most of the problems that you describe rarely occur but if they do for you then I accept your reasoning. I just don't think that dogpiling workers into any city is a valid way to use them up, whether the city is size 30 or 60 or 600. Besides, most retiring workers prefer the slower pace of the smaller towns (I polled them). Yes, milking score is a legit tactic and there are many ways to acheive a good milking, the most effective way is to dogpile workers into cities, I agree 100%.<br />

<br />
The maximum population that a city can possible sustain is 41 pop points when located on 100% irrigated grassland with railroads. With mixtures of floodplains, wheat and cows thrown into the picture, the absolute theoretical maximum population for a metropolis would be (1 + (20*7)/2) = 71 pop.<br />
<br />
The 71 number will never be reached in legitimate games because that would require the extreme case of floodplain+irrigation+railroad+bonus resources in every one of the 20 squares in the city radius and that just won't happen without outside intervention.<br />
<br />
One reason I missed the early impact of Bamspeedy's original post of this subject was that I was too quick to just right off the 250 worker dogpile to one of those &quot;Lets have fun burning all the extra workers we cannot find a place to retire&quot; sort of things. I have had cases in the past where I ran out of places to put the workers when time came to cull the work force. I missed the exploit that was hidden in the legitimate tactic and the exploit was that if the rate of addition of pop points could exceed the immedaite rate of death by starvation, then the added pop points could effectively never die and would never require food or support costs. This is the exploit, not the fact that the workers can be added to a large city or that more than one pop point can be legitimately added in one turn in many cases.<br />
<br />
Before they eliminated the option of forestry for hire, I would put the extra workers to work on tree farms and this would at least let their 1gold per turn support cost gte converted to some useful purpose. After forestry was eliminated, I began to manage things more closely and could easily see a worker force of 400 individuals drop down to the 32 to 48 worker range in just 1 or 2 turns after railroads were completed.</div></div><hr />

What you are failing to understand the dynamics of this system. Whether the dogpile is small or large is not the problem, the large dogpiles show off the problem more spectacularly. It's the creation of the dogpile at all, that is the problem. Using this method of milking you can create 70 small dogpiles on a standard map and sustain them. Or 175 small dogpiles on a huge map. You may have to store up some workers to get there but assigning them all to railroads and/or tree planting keeps them busy till your ready for the big push. You can run the entire system without any luxuries or science and only have happy and specialist citizens. Yes the more dogpiles the less the benefit but the benefit is still there and the benefit is created by moving workers produced in small cities and relocating them to large cities. As long as you allow this, you will allow an extra 2450 specialists on a standard map and 6500 extra specialists on a huge map; and I base these estimated figures on having multiple dogpiles on the map.<br />

<br />
If these specialists are eating food, they are not extra.<br />
<br />
If you can find a logical way to get more people than food if we have installed the &quot;Max added pop points in shortage&quot; spinner just explain your approach in simple one city micromanagement terms and this may impact the discussion.<br />
<br />
Otherwise moving people from one city to another where they can still be fed or supported is a legitimate tactic even if it took 10 food units to grow them in the source city but would have cost 80 food units to grow them in the destination city if they had not just moved in from the boondocks.<br />
<br />
Food and population growth is the one uncorrupted resource that frontier cities possess in a game that is dominated by the effects of radial corruption and waste.</div></div><hr />

So maybe Monday, we can pick this up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2002, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So lets see,<br />
<br />
You add workers to a city till it reaches the +1 starvation level and lets assume the city is a super city location that can support 41 pop points so now you are at 42 people.<br />
<br />
Then you could micromanage all the people off the land so that everyone is a starving specialist but now only 1 person can starve per turn.<br />
<br />
Then you micromanage the next adjacent city to work all the land and jack its population up to 42 people. Then micromanage all the people off the land to be starving specialists.<br />
<br />
SO in one turn you could pigeon hole the equivalent of 82 excess pop points into the game by micromanaging two cities that had perfect use of 100% irrigated grassland fully covered by railroads.<br />
<br />
If you had the ability to place cities at a perfect overlap so that every food tile could be used by exactly 4 cities then you could fan out and replicate this process across your empire at the rate of about 2 cities per turn as long as you had enough unscrewed up cities to keep producing 60 to 80 workers per turn.<br />
<br />
Figuring that each food tile was being used to support the exploitation of 4 cities in rotation that would mean every city would always be using at least 5 food tiles as a minimim plus its core. This minimum would mean that 11 pop points were legitimate in this exploited scenario but any above that number would be exploited.<br />
<br />
Each city would also need at least a hospital to support the exploit.<br />
<br />
You would need to be producing at least the number of workers per turn to replace the number of starving workers, so there would have to be two worker factory towns for each starving specialist town to maintain equilibrium before Longevity kicks in.<br />
<br />
So if someone had the perfect terrain map, and had the planning and forethought to layout all cities on a perfect 2 space grid in the specialist farms while setting up semi-productive cities that could produce at least 5 shields and 5 wheats per turn, then they could sustain 1/3rd of their cities in some state of excess population status as long as the starvation rate has no means of detecting this exploit and compensation for it.<br />
<br />
I can see a residual exploit here, but this points further to a need to modify the starvation rate under cetain conditions rather than eliminate the legitimate process where 5 workers might be added to a pop 12 city to retire them from active duty and raise the cities pop to 17 in one turn.<br />
<br />
Admittedly the residual exploit would border on the insane level of analretentive micromanagement combined with unimaginable terrian good luck and rarely would it approach even 50% of its maximum potential, but it would be an exploit nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Cartouche Bee deserves the beer AND the whack!  Cartouche, did you do this to some extent in GOTM6? (although no where near the efficiency that you and I are doing this technique now).<br />
<br />
In fact, he TOLD us all about it, but NO ONE caught on to it!  In GOTM6 spoiler thread he stated the population sizes of two of his cities and they were in the billions.  That was much higher than my city was, but I just figured he had more extra workers.  I didn't stop to try and figure out how many workers that would be to realize that it couldn't have just been a few extra captured workers he had.  And I thought it might have just been a typo and he meant millions instead of billions.<br />
<br />
Ironic, though that I started doing this at the same time he was doing this in this GOTM, before he exposed this to all of us, and we both figured out that the transferring of specialists was so much more efficient than just rushing workers in every city (which would sometimes result in loss of happy people).  Me and Cartouche Bee have PM'ed back and forth comparing notes on GOTM6 and the tournament, but didn't really go into detail of this 'worker dogpile'.  He did mention to me something like &quot;stuff like that worker dogpile will make you win some games&quot;.  I didn't really understand what he was talking about, because in my game it only helped by 50 pts, and almost always a game is decided by well over 50 pts.<br />

Anyways, getting back to spoiler topics. I had destroyed France with MA, and alot of tactical nukes flew around, all from me. France escaped to an island with 3 cities. The idiots refused to give me superconductor and satellites even after I had totally wrecked them. Meanwhile Japan and China were duking it out, and had fallen behind in techs and resources. I made peace with France and China and later Japan made peace with China, but not with France. I switched to democracy and built some nuclear plants and spaceship parts. Later I started build ICBMs. Meanwhile Japan started to destroy France. <br />
<br />
There were a few turns left. I cranked lux tax to 100%. Moved some of my workers into cities and joined them so now I had several size 25 cities. Then I rush bought 6 ICBMs. The same turn the idiotic Chinese demanded rubber and I refused. War, they defeated my mech infantry army with just mech infantry, ridiculous! I had ROP with them before so I had about 50 modern armor sitting next to Beijing. I nuked Beijing and razed it and destroyed the SS. Nuked 3 other Chinese cities, 1 Japanese city, and all of Japan's SOD of about 30 mechs. Then I ran into space.<br />
<br />
I had a score in the 3000 range. It was a good game, not too hard. I could have milked it and whatever, but I was getting bored, and really didn't care since it was a GOTM. I much rather milk some HOF game I'm preparing. <br />
<br />
Russia fell fast and early with about 15 swordsmen. Then alot of expansion and catching up and surpassing AI in score and all other things in the late late Ancient Era. Middle Ages, I built up in monarchy. Industrial age, built factories and Hoover Dam. Then built tons of panzers, about 60 really, and destroyed England. Upgraded those panzers and added another 20 MA to destroy France. Then built some SS parts, and nuked China alot and ran off with the win! :D Easy fun game.  <br />

Cartouche Bee- how much does longevity actually help?  I probably won't get it until 1810 A.D. or so.  Right now I'm gaining 101-102 pts/turn.  At that pace I will still end up in the 30,000 pt range.  To get over 50,000 I need to be gaining 200+ pts/turn once I get longevity!  I can see some big gains in points because I will set science back to 0%, so I can have tons of money to rush-buy workers.  Right now with science at 10% (still learning techs in 4 turns), I only make enough money per turn to rush in about half the cities that could.  But I can't imagine Longevity doubling my pts/turn.</div></div><hr />

     This is my first GOTM. I bought the game back in Feb. and I just found this website two weeks ago. I won a space race victory in 1916 with a score of 2919. I am not posting my game (unless I get an ok from the administrator) because I think I cheated. Here's what I did. Late in the game, as I started to build the spaceship parts I was concerned that Japan might be building a spaceship too. I saved the game and tried to plant a spy. The spy was caught and Japan declared war on me. I loaded the save game and tried again to no avail. I never got the spy. I realized later that all I had to do was talk with the guy to see what techs I had and he didn't. It turns out he didn't even have rocketry.<br />
     I'm suprised to see so many of you took out Cathy early. I try to avoid war until there's no more room to expand and no more city impovements to build. Early on, I fell behind in tech. It was then that I got my first great leader in a war with Cathy that I couldn't avoid. It was a difficult decision but I decided to use the GL to build the Great Library and it paid off. I got six techs from it. Later on I was attacked by Joan. 20+ knights came at me. I was unprepared and I thought this was the beginning of the end. Then Libby joined Joan in a MA against me. I thought I better bring in Cathy on my side. Russia was not doing well but every little bit counts besides, she'd be easy to bribe being so small. Cathy accepted a MA against Joan in exchange for medicine tech. The next turn I saw English and French units fighting each other. I checked the foriegn advisor and as I suspected England and Russia had a MPP. France was too busy fighting England and Russia to worry about me anymore. Whew!!! I was saved. I made peace with France. A few turns later Libby got Cathy to sign a MA against me. Then, in the very same turn, Libby asked for peace with me. That little instigator!!! That was the most underhanded thing I've ever seen the AI do.<br />
     When I got combustion, I realized that I had no petroleum. I had to take a city on one of the two nothern islands. One source controled by England the other by Russia. Another exciting war which could have been the end of this game but I prevailed. I should've set up a wall of fortesses along the short border with England before starting the war but I didn't. I lost two towns on the mainland and took two on the island.<br />
     This was the closest and most enjoyable Civ3 game I've played so far. Looking forward to the next GOTM. And no cheating this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice picture. But honestly, I feel that is boring (for me)! I haven't got time to prepare a Website yet so just give a short summary.<br />
 <br />
But in my history (game), I was always level with AI's in science. That means never get over them in millitary until very very late (what's a waste!). I never buy alliance in war time and usually have 2 or 3 enemies (but France and Russia had few wars and never get along well.) For me, it is fun to play around with 40 infantrymen and 60 cossacks of Russia in the critical time. I had only 20 infantrymen, 10 calvary, 10 panzers and Russia is very close (they actually control the spices in South of Berlin). I had to use one famous tatic among the classic &quot;36 tricks&quot; in Chinese literature to release Berlin from n Russian cossacks (I couldn't count them). I have to &quot;milk&quot; in this game too just because I want to produce cultural victory in one city.<br />
<br />
Anyway, great game. Good website. I wonder how to beat an enemy with a great army like yours. Hahhahah I may have to use the trick number 36 or 35.... (you're gonna love it)<br />

Not long, every city on wealth and no units to move. Still takes my old computer about a minute though to get through the turn sequence though. (There is a pause when it hits that one big city with a size over 5000, the starvation causes the specialists to be realocated each turn, bit of a drag.)<br />

God, it looks like we did start off similarly. One difference as we went along - I must have made more workers, because I scrubbed the jungle *clean*. The only tiles in my entire core that I didn't get value from were a few mountain tiles that were inaccessible.</div></div><hr />

I didn't have an effectual war until panzers. However, I was able to completely take over the French territory by making about a dozen settlers, signing an ROP and waiting while Russia and England totally demolished the French (at my urging) <br />
<br />
As Russia/England took over or razed French cities, gaps appeared where I instantly planted cities! By the time France was defeated, I had supplanted her entire nation under the noses of the Russians!<br />
<br />
After that it was easy to take over the rest of the continent with panzers, since Russia and England were boxed in....<br />
<br />
I ended up with a domination victory around 1949.</div></div><hr />

Well my strategy was this:<br />
I used the forest bonus to quickly get a granary in Berlin. At this stage I was about 2 cities behind everybody else. With the granary, I was able to create a lot of cities, but still not much of a superpower. When the French started conquering the English I joined the plunder and conquered about 6 English cities on the North of England plus two cities on the two small islands using cavalry. Waited till Panzers for my next attack. When they arrived, I took out the 10 or so Indian cities and just as I was finishing them off, the ****** French declared war on me. ...To their cost, because all the armies I used to run over the Indians quickly returned to the motherland and crushed everything the French threw at them, which wasn't an awful lot to be honest...<br />
Luckily the French captured Moscow (containing SunTzu) so I captured the crucial wonder without ever declaring war against my umm friend Russia (I owned about 4 cities originally built by the Russians. Eventually settled down to building the spaceship, but triggered the domination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I quickly realized this was the type of games I hate - Culturally linked.<br />
<br />
The first key event was in the BC time frame when I refused a demand from a polite England.<br />
War started - I burned all cash - allied with Russia, then Russia got France to join in.<br />
In the end - it cost me no cities - however, France has loved me since.<br />
<br />
I lost more in the BC time frame to Vet Spearman escorted settlers finding stacks of horseman as I filled in the North.<br />
<br />
Around 800 AD - England made contact with the east.  The other Island turned out to be the Asian group.<br />
I was still busy filling in the north at this time.<br />
<br />
1100 AD - The first major war begin.  Rails had just begun, and Russian troops begin pouring over the border.<br />
I sign MPP with England and France.  Demand Russia leave - war, they attack.<br />
It is now the world vs. Russia.  I enter a golden ages just as this starts, when I have to switch to Newtons after losing the race for Smith's.  We rate the largest nation already.<br />
1140 AD - The first Russian city fall.<br />
1220 AD - sees the first German leader - in such an akward spot, it will take several turns to use him.<br />
The 1200 sees several rushed factories, thats to $500/turn during the GA.<br />
1330 AD - Suffrage completes - since the republic is starting to suffer ww - we are very happy to get it.<br />
1355 AD - Every war has a critical juncture - the capture of Rostov is this one.<br />
Russia loses it's last saltpeter souce, and I find junk as the BEST defenders.<br />
1390 AD - One of the fastest culture flips I ever saw.  I own the town just 2 turns, and Sevastopol flips :mad:<br />
Multiple units lost I didn't even have time to empty the city yet.  I raze that city to the ground in revenge.<br />
However, the 4 cavalry lost were a big chunk of the attacking force!  <br />
I was doing a one city at a time push through Russia, why I got factories and infastructure on-line.<br />
1445 AD - France is an idiot, and declares war.  Nothing gained except tripping my MPP with England.<br />
The have cut themselves off what I believe is there ONLY source of Coal and Iron.<br />
1455 AD - Moscow falls, and we own the Sistine Chappel :)<br />
1505 AD - We RAZE St. Pete - Russia is dead, War Weariness should be solved.<br />
1510 AD - I buy refining, at we have just ONE oil source - on the Ice Island to the northeast.<br />
(I) We get the ToE - Hoover Dam is ordered.<br />
1520 AD -<br />
(I) China destroys India.<br />
1540 AD - I decide to ally with England vs. France.  I need a diversion to keep going.<br />
Maybe the English can lose a few more cities to the France, so that I can &quot;liberate&quot; them.<br />
This has been the ultimate in frustrated with RnG game.  <br />
Every elite seems to be dying the very next fight.<br />
Still only one leader despite fighting forever.<br />
(I) I get hit with the total BS flip - A city with ZERO French cities nearby, flips back.<br />
1595 AD -<br />
(I) The Hoover Dam is OURS!<br />
1655 AD - <br />
(I) China / France mpp - you know what is coming next.<br />
1660 AD - I counter with a Japan MPP.<br />
Oreans is captured - we know own Smith's.<br />
Japan declares war on France.<br />
1690 AD - After an obscene drought - Richtoffen appears - instant army.<br />
1695 AD - We have a victorious army.  Besancon is captured.<br />
1735 AD - Japan declares war.<br />
Time for a revolution - ww is becoming a pain after 1000 years of fighting in Republic.<br />
We finally have enough troops that we can avoid to be without production.<br />
1750 AD - I learned something brand new - If you a doing a 40 turn, 1 scientest play - you can finish researching during anarchy!<br />
1766 AD - Finally, France is DEAD.<br />
1786 AD - WAR begins with England.<br />
1794 AD - England is DEAD - they collapsed a lot faster then I expected.<br />
1802 AD - We take the first city from Japan.  Our next leader finally appears, and rushes a harbor there.<br />
1812 AD - We caputre Izumo, we get another leader - instant library.<br />
1818 AD - Sometimes the RnG can be real wierd.  I loss a cavalry army, but get a leader to build a new cavalry army.<br />
1830 AD - GAME OVER - domination win, I never even saw a panzer ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
This game showed how much one thing can drive the game.<br />
<br />
I was selling Iron to France and gaining all types of techs, plus good cash flow for Iron.<br />
It ended at when France declared war, but this got me into the Industrial age in a very strong position.<br />

<br />
The start was plain bad. I had war with the English for a long time with effect that I couldn't expand fast enough. So I was pretty small in the beginning. Then the Russians and a little later the English were destroyed (by almost the whole rest of the world together) and with that I was able to seize more land. Then the only problem was I was far behind in technology.<br />
<br />
When there was finally a good stable peace on the planet I was able to get technology at a faster/normal rate. I went for a space race victory; I don't even know who won (probably the French), but they were just 6 turns before me. :mad:<br />

I got a lousy score too. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2002, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once again I started late but Im confident I can finish in time again. :eek:<br />
<br />
Another GREAT game, I just love the Germans. :yeah:<br />
<br />
It started with the all out settler production and colonization in the early days, almost built no defensive nor offensive units at all, just for exploration. This resulted 3 or 4 times in a super babarian raid. :mad:<br />
But since I spent my gold to buy techs I didnt have much to lose. And the cities sacked were small and undeveloped too. Barb camp hunting turned out to be the decisive factor in keeping up tech-wise in the early game. In the late BCs it even gave me the opportunity to set up a force of about 8 swordmen with a few accompanying horsemen to attack Russia. I captured most of their cities but razed Moscow to rebuilt it in the probably greatest city site Ive had in all my games so far! :yeah:<br />
<br />
Meanwhile France was busy building all the wonders (only Great Wall and Oracle were built by the Chinese and Japanese), I was busy expanding even more and starting to build my tech lead. (well more like equal with France but ahead of the others)<br />
I manually built Sun Tzu and later Copernicus as well as Newton. Sun Tzu was the decisive factor for the next invasion, England this time.<br />
Newly upgraded royal knights advanced with astonishing speed and wiped out the British &quot;empire&quot; :lol: in only a few turns. An arctic hideout fell last.<br />
The French had made a 3-4 tech lead again. We researched eagerly and bought hastily to keep up, but had our own goal, militarism!<br />
Having attained that knowledge, a new plan was set, Invasion of France!!!<br />
Just like against the British and the meanwhile totally exterminated Russians, we let them declare war by being insulting and demanding a leave of their units. Once they did what we wanted, the newly established Cavalry forces advanced.<br />
Even though we successfully neglected them Saltpeter and therefore Musketeers, the fight was hard and long. Slowly pressing forward and getting constant reinforcements by highly productive cities eventually led to the expelling of France from the mainland. They had a few outposts on the arctic isles though.<br />
We graciously let them live, made peace for magnetism and changed to Democracy.<br />
So before long, the main goals were achieved. But we needed more luxuries to keep our people happy. The other civs were too reluctant to trade at reasonable prices, so another small war was unavoidable. ;)<br />
The Japanese were the only target, since they possessed 3 different luxuries we wanted. So the isthmus and the western peninsula was conquered. Unfortunately this also led to more war, involving all countries. China sneak attacked us without cause and it was a hard time to get peace again before our democracy would collapse.<br />
Stupid Joan decided to take part, too, so I had no choice but destroy her last cities. The era of riflemen and for us already Infantry made this task rather difficult with only a small expeditionary force.<br />
But instead of keeping her as my personal slave :groucho:, she begged for being burned at the stake. :mwaha:<br />
<br />
Eventually Germany came to rest. We decided to stay out of everything since we are by far the largest and most advanced nation now. Almost to the domination limit, about 10 tiles left, but 1 city ready for disbandment should we get too close.<br />
<br />
India and Japan are still warring, but we dont care. As long as they stay out of our territory, everything will be fine.<br />
<br />
Tanks are the next research step, they will hopefully ensure our peace.<br />
<br />
There is still lots of time to pass, but everything is rather far advanced and going quickly this time. A really nice game.<br />

At first I thought, hmmm, Germans, I think I'll wipe everyone out first chance I get. Then I made contact with the Russians, who were very nice, and, well, I thought Bismarck and Catherine looked like a nice elderly couple in the Diplomacy screen, so I made friends instead. When I met Elizabeth, she was awful friendly as well, probably because Bismarck was the first man she met in 1500 years. Catherine didn't get jealous, so what the hey. Then Joan came into the picture, and it's Bismarck on the continent with all these ladies in BC times, it just didn't seem appropriate to go on a killing spree. I switched gears for a diplo win instead. I had a very peaceful continent for thousands of years until Japan subjected me to what must have been the feeblest amphibious invasion in the history of CivIII. That lone warrior on my shores was either very brave or vastly miscalculated my strength. The lone pikeman 10 turns later probably expected to drive my forces across the continent, but it was not to be. I pulled India into the war, and they did not fare so well-my buddy across the ocean was completely wiped out! This I think messed up my diplo victory-when it came time to vote, some of the civs were impressed with Joan's charms, and the vote was inconclusive. So now what? Diplomacy being a bust I decided to go for the space win, with the domestic policy of present-day President Mugabe of Zimbabwe- vote for me or DIE. My old pal Catherine didn't know what to do about all my modern armor, and crumbled. Should've voted for me. I went to wipe out Libby next, but having focused on a diplo win for the whole game my military was not exactly overwhelming. She had paranoidly built dozens of mech infantry which more or less held me off even though overall her military was slaughtered. France was simply way too defended, so I enlisted Joan's help in destroying the ungrateful English. The campaign only got so far before the spaceship was complete, and then it was Sayonara ladies, I'm going to a planet where they appreciate a friendly old German. I got the victory, I really enjoyed this GOTM, but my score is definitely nothing to rave about. Bring on GOTM9!!!</div></div><hr />

Germany was clearly winning, but there was no way I could finish the game in time. :(<br />
Took Moscow early and survived the uprising of 144 barb horsies in 330 BC with minimal losses ($7). )<br />
We had 4 luxuries connected, covered half the continent, and were easily culturally most powerful with a library in almost all our cities.<br />
Long wars with Russia and England (and barbs) brought no leaders, but also only a single casualty (mountain-fortified elite warrior behind river died to a wounded barb warrior - yuck).<br />
In 480 AD, we were about to finish the Sistine Chapel and ready to start building an army of Knights to take care of the English, now that we were running out of free space for new cities.<br />

<br />
Im around 5-15 tiles under the domination limit, having entered the 17th century and also the Modern Era earlier.<br />
Got all but one luxury but I am trading for it. One advance per 20 years and the last 3 civs are still more than half an era behind. :yeah:<br />
<br />
Im not sure what to do with them, I didnt even have the chance to use my Panzers. :eek:<br />
Yet. :p<br />
But I will probably wipe them out sooner or later. I got the UN so diplomacy is not an issue, but Im unlikely to win by it, too. Even though Ive been very nice to them, only conquered part of Japan, the Chinese are also furious, because I dared to defend against their sneak attack. I just razed my own city they captured earlier. :eek:<br />
I hate the AI logic. Not to mention the prize for 1 luxury!!<br />
<br />
Culture is no problem either, except my own. <br />
<br />
But since there is still so much time left, they will have a chance at a space race sooner or later. So I will probably have to wipe em out! :mwaha:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir Yelof</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya folks... pretty straightforward GOTM this time for me.  I decided pretty quickly to go for Domination, and came up with the Master Plan (everyone should have at least a couple Master Plans at all times...)<br />
<br />
1) Start with small quick cities, then plant outposts to grab land.<br />
2) Eliminate Russia and expand, planting FP at edge of Cathy's land.<br />
3) Secure the continent, possibly with Panzers.<br />
4) Invade weak countries on the other continent, just enough to get Domination.<br />
<br />
The plan worked well, with my Panzer/Golden Age kick starting the elimination of England and France, finishing only a few turns before the victory itself as I wiped out what was left of India and half of Japan.  I couldn't shake the feeling that I could have done it a lot faster, but I became obsessed with waiting for Panzers to make the final push.  Boy did they help!<br />
<br />
On another note, seems like the simplest fix Firaxis could do is to prevent unfed/unsupported population in a starving city from counting towards your final score.  Doesn't that work?  Go ahead, pile 'em on, you're still only getting credit for a size 14 city...<br />
<br />
On a completely different note... I have a third interview with Infogrames today!  Color me very excited.<br />

Speaking about the adding workers bug/cheat.<br />
Ive never used nor seen it, I just more or less evenly distribute my own workers when there is almost everything done and let the &quot;slaves&quot; do the dirty work of standing by for cleaning up.<br />
But as written above, I had to start the last global war to prevent the AIs finishing their SSs. An easy task considering that ALL 3 had no Rubber and I of course didnt trade it, so it was Modern Armor against Riflemen and Cavalry all the way! :lol:<br />
I even took my time to build up 2 invasion fleets and attacked the Chinese from all sides without using RoPs. The Japanese and Indians insisted on having RoPs though. :mwaha:<br />
5 armies and lots more steel rolling across the second continent gave way for no real opposition, although they did put up a decent fight.<br />
I naturally couldnt take the cities (domination), so I had to raze them and was stuck with hundreds of workers. :eek:<br />
Most of them were later send as welcoming comittees to barbarian encampments, but I also experienced in earlier games that the AI disbanded captured workers instead of bringing them home. Well, not this time, at least not always.<br />
<br />
Now guess what the Indians did with the recapturing of 20-30 of their workers. They added them to ONE city, which grew to size 68!!! :lol:<br />
I had to raze that one, too, of course and was stuck with even more workers.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I dont want to incite a discussion, but if the AI uses this bug/cheat, why arent we allowed to do it?!? :p<br />
<br />
Now there is only one Indian city left, I only have to click through the turns and pay HUGE amounts of money every 20 turns to remake the new RoP with them to successfully contain them in their arctic hideout. Ill probably give them a chance the last 50 turns or so, to rebuild their &quot;empire&quot;, as long as they dont start on a new Spaceship.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I have submitted just now! :yeah:<br />
Should still be in time, Matrix has also extended the deadline a little.<br />
<br />
All has gone as expected, except that I almost was too late in selling all culture buildings.<br />
Cultural Win in 2049AD, without building any building in the end to get this date! My first victory of this type, now Ive got all kinds in the GOTM, except histographic and a Diplo win. Im probably too egoistic and evil to be liked by the AI.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zur</div><div class="date">Jul 05, 2002, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't manage to finish in time :(. Only had time to play until 1100AD. Russians dragged me into an interesting war which was fun but ultimately annihilated any chance of submitting on time.<br />
<br />
I explore South and find Russians near. Decide to go for horseman-&gt;knights upgrade and then attack in the medium term. <br />
I settle most of the good land available, reducing need for granaries. AI manages to grab some jungle/desert land near my cities which I figure will not be productive and which I try to culture flip. Have enough cities to build solely cultural improvements (libraries!) in border cities which surprisingly is sufficient to maintain par on culture.<br />
<br />
Goody huts not particularly lucrative: map, warrior, barb, map, 50g, map, barb<br />
<br />
I don't expand near English cities due to their slightly higher culture, until I have enough cash to rush improvements.<br />
Decided to forego wonders for quick expansion. Out-expanded everyone else, but France built Pyramids which turned many of their cities into powerhouses and led to many other wonders for them and runaway culture.<br />
Improved cash flow in monarchy/republic by keeping cities small by expanding (produced settlers, not workers!) to avoid using military police (in monarchy). Used luxuries instead.<br />
<br />
Map at 630AD:<br />

<br />
Got 1 Russian city by culture and 2 more militarily. No one discovers chivalry and I am unable to buy it for the knight upgrade to attack Russia.<br />
<br />
900AD:<br />
Russians declare war after I discover banking and when my economy starts to take off! Wanted to rush banks before attacking but will now do the upgrades first. Russian cities fall slowly as I lay siege to Moscow. Citizens become happier and WLTKDs trigger off with the corresponding palace upgrades.<br />
It feels like playing chess at this point due to detailed planning required for war without railroads. Fun but it cost me my submission.<br />

Defensive/expansion strategy with long-term offensive (horses) and culture rush in borders.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on speeding up gameplay with minimal strategic tradeoffs are greatly appreciated! I need to speed up play in real-time by 30-50% with any hope of finishing GOTM on time.<br />
I already automate all workers and exploration after the initial phase. Is it worth it to use governors? They seem to make awfully stupid builds IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">Jul 06, 2002, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zur, try to play peacefully, avoid wars which will waste your time.<br />
<br />
By playing peacefully I mean you should have enough defenders in your every city.<br />
<br />
And if dragged in war you can always ask for peace if you lose 1-2 cities..:crazyeye: <br />
<br />
Try to get techs as fast as possible, and finish the game early, in the case of GOTM 8, I finished before 1600, fought only a 6 turn war with russia by using my 12 panzers to took all their riflemen/cossacks and all their bases belong to us. Didn't used much time.:goodjob:</div></div><hr />
