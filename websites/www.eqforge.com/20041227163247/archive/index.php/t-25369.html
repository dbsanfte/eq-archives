<br />
MMM (file:///C:/WinPgms/utils/MicroMeter/MikesMicroMeter.htm)  - Mike's Micro Meter, which is best in Win9x OSs.... it puts a tiny Icon in your system tray that  contains four tiny graphs that show (from left to right) the percent of free memory, System resources, User resources, and GDI resources.  It is excellent for monitoring you system in real time... esp. those ill-behaved programs from MS &amp; others like Copernic.<br />
<br />
Cacheman  (http://www.outertech.com/product.php?product=3)  - I still use an old 4.x version, but it is very good for easily setting some essential performance-related registry settings most users have no clue about.  Nicely explained for a novice, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and it is 1.3 MB.<br />
<br />
The Free version (gold) lacks some features, but is the right price ($0!).  naturally, they would like people to upgrade to Platinum, which lets you do more, hehe.   <br />
<br />
Now I've installed and tested it.  The biggest disadvantage for me is the BMP-only format, the lack of cropping, and no basic text editing (eg, add text , boxes, arrows, etc.).  For $35, Platinum will net the 1st 2 features.  The &quot;toggle&quot; feature is nice to switch back and forth between the Gold and 30-day limited Platinum test!   :)<br />

<br />
I agree!  I have the StarOffices, but OpenOffice is even better....<br />
<br />
There is no reason for most average users to pay M$ these days for their $600 OfficeXP/2K.    <br />
<br />
MS Office will not run on all 3 major OS's  (Mac, Linux, and M$)..  OpenOffice will, and is almost identical to MS Office so there is minimla learning curve.  Plus you can DL the source code if you want to change something!!<br />
<br />
Long Live OpenOffice amongst those that yearn to breath free and cast off the evil skin of MS.... bathed in the purity of Open Source Code, mankind casts off the shackles of M$ spyware and awakens to a fresh new dawn of cross-platform operability!<br />

I went back and spent more time with it.  After consulting help about crop (which was no help, LOL), I still culd not figure out why teh &quot;crop&quot; button was greyed.  I had assumed it was not an available function.   But...... later I found accidently out the button to it's left is the required first step for a crop.... you used that button to select an area, then the crop button to do the cropping!   A bit nonstandard, but it works just fine!!  :)<br />
<br />
The documentation mentioned the .BMP only aspect for the gold version, so I took it at face value.  But in testing the gold version, I see that the .jpg, etc. is there!  <br />
<br />
Those are really the most important features, so I do agree that this is a pretty good (and good price: $0) screencapture!<br />

A couple features like e-mail and calendar have been removed, and any embedded 3rd party code like the database engine is removed. OpenOffice is a worldwide project, and the source code is free.  Eventualy, StarOffice 6.0 (yet to be released) will incorporate many of OpenOffice's improvements.<br />

OpenOffice is undergoing rapid improvements, and is fine for most needs (e.g., Word Processing, Spreadsheeet, and Presentation).<br />

My greatest new find has been Trillian.  Keeps down the number of annoying programs running in the Systray, and allows me have all my buddies on one screen. Plus its skinable and auto-connects to all the IM Clients.</div></div><hr />

I know a lot of computer stuff, but I also don't know a lot.  One thing I'm not too familiar with is current BBS software, such as the pros and cons and limitations that you all are talking about.  It would be cool if one or more of you had a BBS thread, so I'll make one.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I just created this (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=28646) thread to learn more about BBS differences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.onlythebestfreeware.com/default.asp<br />
<br />
A lot of the suggestions made here are also up there.  It appears to be a very clean site with good quality freeware and not much spyware and junk as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
2 programs I found there that interested me (past what was already recommended):<br />
<br />
A download accelerator that improved my download time by 4x.  Also integrates with IE, Netscape, and Opera.  Unfortunately, I have the attachment.php problem with forum attachments, but everything else seems to work great.<br />
www.stardownloader.com<br />
<br />
An open Civ game project trying to design a great AI.<br />

Cool site!<br />
<br />
Anyone who has experience with Mailmoa. Or Mailmoa vs. ePrompter? The spamfilter in Mailmoa looks promising!</div></div><hr />

I recommend Irfranview...a graphics viewer with some limited editing tools.<br />

Also OPERA: a free internet browser<br />

And yes, it does work, in apps where the max cpu usage isn't necessary.</div></div><hr />
