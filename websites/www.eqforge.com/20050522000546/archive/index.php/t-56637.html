<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I am thinking of having 4 Perm Council Members (The number would increase when we get more Provances into our Alliance). The circumstances to be a Perm Council Member is most importanly, Be an active Player in the RPG. Inactive Players automadicly loose there Council Seat if they are an unexcused absents (I dont count excused Absesnse so long as they eather post in here or in the Leaving thread in the citizens forum.)<br />
<br />
Another way to ensure your place in a Council Seat is that each Council Member would have to Nominate someone who is not in a Council seat. Once we have the nomines in place, the entier Alliance would get to PM me the votes (Same reasion as Zarn in the Jedi Council Thread, not to clutter up this thread with votes).<br />
Right now, since we are just starting, I am happy to give the last Seat on a first come first serve baisis.</div></div><hr />

and btw: U should add this to the charter:<br />

If a member of the alliance is attacked the all other provinces in the alliance has to defend the attacked nation or declare war against the alliance...  <br />

I say it should be changed to:<br />
<br />
If a member of the alliance is attacked all the other provinces in the alliance must help defend the attacked province at its request. If a province who's help has been requested refuses to help, they will be ejected from the Alliance and force to pay a 200 gold fine.</div></div><hr />

Its ok I guess... but I do think that denying the charter of the alliance should be considered an act of war against the allience..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I put my vote towards Civanator's proposal.  Just because you don't want to or are unable to help in the defense of the Alliance doesn't mean that you are waging war against it (see: France, 2003.)  However, it should be cause for ejection from the alliance and a hefty fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GM: I see ur point and it could be like this:<br />
<br />
Rejection to help because u dont want to: Ejection from alliance and a fine.<br />
Rejection to help because u cant (good reason must be presented): a Fine..<br />
<br />
what about this GM and civ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here, as you are innocent before guilty:<br />
<br />
If a member of the alliance is attacked all the other provinces in the alliance must help defend the attacked province at its request. If a province who's help has been requested refuses to help, they will be trialed for ejection from the Alliance and forced to pay a 200 gold fine, whether or not they are ejected. The gold will be used towards raising troops for the Alliance.(like the modern-day UN)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good.  There are good reasons for noth helping (inadequate troop strength, incapability to defend one's own borders, absence of a civic or military leader).  I agree the fine should always be levied.  And the trial is a good idea.  Perhaps call it a tribunal rather than a trial.  Also, one more thing should be added, to make it less likely that member states refuse to help (by removing what some might consider a &quot;good reason&quot;):<br />
<br />
The FFP and its charter override all other alliances.  In the event of war between the FFP and a non-member state, any member states who are also allied with the non-member must fight for the FFP unless they have another reason for neutrality.<br />
<br />
Similar to a (highly unlikely) scenario such as Israel (US ally) attacking a NATO nation (Germany for instance).  The US would have to side with Germany and NATO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, once we have some basic concepts for rules passed in the manner we are doing now, I volunteer to thake them and write them up into a single, conherent, well-worded Charter.  Everyone alright with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2003, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2003, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, how does this look?:<br />
<br />
Charter of the Federation of Fanatican Provinces<br />
<br />
	We, the Parties of the Federation of Fanatican Provinces, do hereby affirm our faith in the Purposes and Principles of Freedom, Liberty, Security, and Democracy, and our desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments.<br />
<br />
	We are determined to safeguard these Principles, as well as the common heritage and common security of our Provinces.  We seek to promote safety, security, peace, and cooperation in the Empire of Fanatica.<br />
<br />
	Therefore, we do hereby resolve to unite our efforts in the common defense of our Peoples and our Sovereignty, and in the preservation of peace and stability throughout Fanatica.  We do hereby agree upon this Treaty:<br />
<br />
<br />
Article 1<br />
<br />
The Parties do hereby resolve to form a defensive alliance, in which the Parties would unite the common defense of any Province that is attacked by another.  Any Province which does not contribute to this Defense will be fined two hundred gold, and will face a Tribunal of its peers.  If it cannot justify its failure to commit to the Defense in the eyes of the Tribunal, then it will be ejected from the Alliance.   If it has a proper justification for this failure to commit, it will be allowed to remain in the Alliance but must still pay the fine.<br />
<br />
Article 2<br />
<br />
The Parties of the previously mentioned Alliance are not obligated to join another Party in waging an offensive war against an enemy, but must fulfill the previously mentioned obligations if the said enemy enters the borders of the attacking Party.<br />
<br />
Article 3<br />
<br />
This Alliance reserves the right to utilize military force against any Province who threatens the peace and stability of our mutual Region, the glorious Empire of Fanatica.  This military force will take the form of a Peacekeeping force, made up of military units from all Parties.  This force may take pre-emptive aggressive action against a peace-threatening Province, or may act in the Defense of a Province that is not a Party of this Alliance.  Any Party of the Alliance who fails to commit to this Peacekeeping force will face a two hundred gold fine.<br />
<br />
Article 4<br />
<br />
So as to ensure the Freedom, Security, and Stability of our glorious Capital, Noshuret, this Alliance reserves the right to place a permanent garrison of Peacekeeping troops in the city regardless of its ownership.  Noshuret will always be considered a protectorate of the Federation and a free city.<br />
<br />
Article 5<br />
<br />
This Federation promotes cooperation between its various Parties.  This cooperation extends to the Military, Economic, Scientific, and Social sectors.  All Parties shall work together for the common good in these sectors.<br />
<br />
Article 6<br />
<br />
This Federation will consist of two Assemblies.  The General Assembly consists of delegates from all Parties, and is responsible for changing or amending this Charter, making general decisions for the Federation, holding Tribunals, and negotiating with non-member Provinces.  The Grand Council consists of only the Permanent Parties, and is responsible for waging joint defensive and offensive war against the Federation’s enemies.  The Grand Council may cancel any action of the General Assembly with a majority vote, but the General Assembly may override this cancellation with a 2/3 majority vote.  The Grand Council may veto any action of the General Assembly with a unanimous vote.  A veto may not be overridden.<br />
<br />
Article 7<br />
<br />
The Federation in no ways asserts any sort of independence from or rebellion against the Empire of Fanatica and its democratically elected Government.  All actions of this Federation are subservient to the Law of Fanatica.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks good Grandmaster :). Eventhough I am the Head of the Alliance, a Vote should be in order :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2003, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a amendment to Article 1.<br />
<br />
Because sending 1 unit is virtualy sending a defense, I propose that as the council can specify a Minimum number of units to be sent, based on the situation.<br />
<br />
Other than that it looks good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2003, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This better?<br />
<br />
Article 1<br />
<br />
The Parties do hereby resolve to form a defensive alliance, in which the Parties would unite the common defense of any Province that is attacked by another.  The Grand Council may define the number of military units required from each Party as part of this Defense. Any Province which does not contribute to this Defense will be fined two hundred gold, and will face a Tribunal of its peers. If it cannot justify its failure to commit to the Defense in the eyes of the Tribunal, then it will be ejected from the Alliance. If it has a proper justification for this failure to commit, it will be allowed to remain in the Alliance but must still pay the fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats good but can we form a security council that wouldb be like the one in RL? Can we? Can we? Can we?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SJ, the problem is that this alliance is more like modern NATO than the UN.  NATO doesn't have a securty council, the entire alliance is a military one.  And the Grand Council functions somewhat like a security council, with it being charged with waging war and all. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ooc:<br />
Btw: im not up to date with reading, but i believe helenatica as the biggest province should hold a council seat... or maybe helenatica may found a countering aliance if not &gt;-)<br />
<br />
but i will have to keep on reading until i post something ic in here :-)<br />
<br />
also, maybe some of the ideas are good, but the word used are &quot;out of tech&quot; :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't believe words can be &quot;out of tech.&quot;  Unless you want everything to be in ancient Latin, of course.  The concept of such an alliance didn't exist at this historical time period, so obvious the proper terminology didn't either.  Sometimes you just to have to sacrifice realism a little bit to have fun. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OOC: Oh well, so what if they're out of text? we have code of laws... didn't you see? we are on the player/2 character system. You can have 2 characters that never die. Stuck is now Game Manager.</div></div><hr />

We are currently within the historical period of the Classical Age, as is represented by our military units and technological advancement.  While we don't have American-style democracy (Civ3 democracy tech) democracy was an existing principle at this time in history.  On top of that, I was basing the intro on the NATO charter and it sounded cool. ;)</div></div><hr />
