<br />
To the BRITISH EMPIRE:<br />
Poland wishes to sign a Non-agression pact with your country for 8 turns. What do you think?<br />
<br />
To ITALY:<br />
We urge you from one civilized nation to another to end the bloodshed. Pull out of Yugoslavia and pre-war borders will be reinstated. We should be working on a peaceful solution.<br />
<br />
To our friend, YUGOSLAVIA:<br />
Keep up the fight, help is on its way.<br />
<br />
To the proud nation of FRANCE:<br />
A very risky game you are playing there. Your actions could well lead to a another European War. You know very well how easily the alliance-systems can trigger a europe-wide disaster, just like in the last conflict. We hope you stand by your word and that you do not fight this war for conquest, maybe peace can still be reached.<br />
 <br />
To SPAIN:<br />
Poland urges your nation to keep out of the Franco-Italian War, otherwise things would escalate. Maybe we can find a peaceful solution.<br />
<br />
To our neighbour GERMANY:<br />
Poland urges your nation to keep out of the Franco-Italian War, otherwise things would escalate. Maybe we can find a peaceful solution.<br />
Regarding Czechoslovakia, your agression was unprovoked. Although you said you would leave them alone as long as Germans were treated properly, you did not keep your word. We would just like to know what happened.<br />
<br />
To TURKEY:<br />
Poland would like to know if you are interested in an Alliance, maybe even joining the EEDP, what do you think?<br />
<br />
To our ally, ROMANIA:<br />
You have Poland's support in this, although we don't want to wage a war yet. Maybe a peaceful solution can still be reached.<br />
<br />
To our neighbor SWEDEN:<br />
Poland would like to offer you a Non-aggression pact for 8 turns. What do you think?<br />
<br />
To our ally, GREECE:<br />
Albania will soon fall into your hands and the Balkan will be more stable. The EEDP will need your support in the current crisis.<br />
<br />
To our neighbor, CZECHOSLOVAKIA:<br />
We hope you can fight off the Teutonic hordes, but as of now Poland cannot help you. You should have considered Poland's offer while Germany was still busy with &quot;liberating&quot; Austria.<br />
<br />
To our ally, RUSSIA:<br />
Your generals did good work. Latvia will soon be yours. Don't forget that the EEDP will need your support in the current crisis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We will sign an NAP for 5 turns, however in the event of war between Poland and any county allied to Britain you can be assured of the fact that Britain will stand by its other alliances ( and the NAP if nothing happens) if such an event happens the  NAP will be considered void</div></div><hr />

to Poland:<br />
We will stay out of the Italian Yuguslavian war IF everyone else will butt of. But seems like our NAP won't last, you are going to atttack my allies in Italy, just like France have did and Rummania is planning to. This is a very big mistake. Don't think we will let you aggresivly attack our allies in Rome while you ask of us to stay out. Any of your allies or you that will attack Italian forces will be considered as he killed a German general and it will bring a war. France made their mistake and attacked our strong ally aggreisvly with no reason, now they will be destoried or atleast leveled. All of our allies will join against that act of aggresion, and belive us we have many allies that some you don't even know. Beware with your talks.<br />
<br />
About Czechoslovakia we didn't attacked them for the German people, the Slovakians asked are for help and we this time saw what others have to say. Slovakians and Germans in Slovakia are treated like slaves, maybe in Czechia they aren't but Slovakian germans are just as any other German, far above the others.<br />
<br />
to Italy:<br />
Don't worry, we will aid Italy in land and water, fire and ice even if Germany will fall!<br />
<br />
to allies:<br />
Seems like the French and Rummanians choosed to aggresivly attack us. It's time to show them where aggresion leads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Poland never had the intention to attack Italian forces anywhere. We just want that the bloody war in Croatia comes to an end and that pre-war borders are reestablished, a noble goal, don't you think?<br />
Neither did we plan to have our NAP cancelled. Poland stands by its words, we do not backstab. But if our allies get attacked we are obliged to aid them.<br />
Therefore Poland urges you not to intervene as this could easily lead to an even greater war.<br />
<br />
Furthermore we don't find your intervention in Slovakia justified. Only the League of Nations has the power to do so. That is exactly the kind of situation it was created for and we all should be discussing the Slovakian situation to avoid too much bloodshed. What saddens me is that Germany didn't even give the government of Czechoslovakia time to issue a statement.<br />
<br />
To ITALY:<br />
Now you have the chance to show if you are peace-loving after all. If your forces leave Croatia and return to Italy I am sure that the French army will retreat to French soil. Make peace now and put an end to all the killing.<br />
<br />
To the LEAGUE OF NATIONS:<br />
We propose economic sanctions against Italy if they continue their war against Yugoslavia. Hopefully then they will come to their senses and peace and order can be restored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erez87</div><div class="date">Jan 07, 2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">to the world:<br />
and we propose economic sanctions on France for suprise attacking Italy. where was the LON when Poland invaded Lithuinia? No coutnry is allowed to make aggresive war and say others are agresive! inclduing the Polish country!<br />
<br />
Italian image was made dirty by Yuguslavia.<br />
Yuguslavia made lies that Italy is invading Albania! Italy's image was being destoried by Yuguslavia. Italy had all reasons to attack Yuguslavia.<br />
<br />
It's not like Yuguslavia is all white, they almost have a civil war there with Croatians wanting their own country under the protection of Italy.<br />
<br />
Germany will hapilly help peace between Italy and it's evil enemies come. But italy will gain control over Croatia for the sake of the poor Croation people!<br />
But we again say, If france does not remove it's forces from Italy Germany will HAVE to aid it's allies. And we know Poland had no alliance with France that Poland will have the idea of attacking Germany. If Rummania will attack Italy on the other hand, all we have to say that the thing we are all scared from will come. so...<br />
<br />
to Poland:<br />
We suggest you to stop Rummania from attacking Italy or it WILL make a war. They had no alliance to Yuguslavia and attackign Italy will be ONLY considered like aggresion. Just like the invasions of Lithuinia, Albania and Hunagry. So don't tell us to not attack countries while you go and annex them!</div></div><hr />

To Poland:<br />
Bite your tongue when talking about imposing sanctions upon aggressor nations, because you are an aggressor against Lithuania just as we are aggressor against Latvia, just as Germany is aggressor against Czechoslovakia! We're living in a cruel world, full of aggressors. If the LoN would come in imposing sancitons on aggressors, then all of Europe would be cut off from not only itself but from the rest of the world!<br />
<br />
To Romania:<br />
While we will not send troops to fight a war somewhere in the Balkans, as an ally of yours we are obliged to diplomatically support you.<br />
<br />
To Germany:<br />
If even one of your troops so much as sets foot on Poland's territory, we will be forced to act on their behalf. We do not wish for war with you either but if worse comes to worst then there is no other way.<br />
<br />
Orders:<br />
Have the 1st and 8th Red Army continue attacking Latvia and eliminate whatever Latvian resistance remains.<br />
Spread propaganda across Latvia to ease the country's infusion into the Soviet Union and decrease amount of potential resistance.<br />
Train all army (30c)<br />
Get 2 Armored Brigades and join them with the 1st Red Army. (14c)<br />

Any country that have a NAP with Germany and attacks one of it's allies will have peace with Germany. But if they attack another ally they will be at war.<br />
If a country that have a NAP with Germany join an aggresive war of their allies against a German ally will not be at war with Germany.<br />
<br />
We only have NAP's with Sweden, Poland and Britian. The NAP with France has been cacneled as they anyway attacked Italy under a NAP and NAP's doesn't matters with them, it doesn't &quot;count&quot; in their eyes.</div></div><hr />

We have never had any diplomatic talks between our two country, but in this times of war we want to talk with you. Are you willing to sign a NAP for 5-10 Turns? You already stated that you are not going to attack us (A wise decision), but Italy has been betrayed and currently we are cautious with words spoken by foreign leaders.

Fine NAP for 5 turns. However, your message to us sounded a bit like you think you are completely militarily superior to us and that you could whoop us any time any day (unless I'm just being paranoid - I am, after all, Stalin here). Don't be so cocky because we dislike arrogance, especially when it comes to military.</div></div><hr />

We suggest that you not go to war with Italy. It would cause the entire alliance to go to war, and Russia, for one, does not feel like going to war right now, and the Italians' alliance, in turn, would also go to war and the entire continent would be ignited. Don't let a petty rivalry throw the European continent into another war. Remember the Great War? When an entire generation was lost to the fighting?<br />

You make such strange assumptions. You say you cant let go of Yugoslavia because italian soldiers have already died fighting. What you didnt say is that it was YOU that made them die.

<br />
Korean Tribune<br />
<br />
Latvia Has Fallen!<br />
With the full assault of the remaining Russian armies, the Latvians have finally fallen, the first victim of the Soviet army that seems to be on the move to unite Eastern Europe. Little casualties have been reported, though considerable infantry regiments are still not heard of from the First Red Army. They have been marked to be presumably dead. <br />
<br />
Germany To Spearhead War Efforts in Europe<br />
German forces continue the invasion of Slovakia, despite the huge diplomatic resistance by the Eastern Europe alliance. The Slovakians are pushed back, almost to the far eastern border. In the Battle of Prosev, the Slovakians are able to repel a German force thrice their size, but are nearly destroyed in the process. The small resistance is all that is left, and is expect to easily be crushed next month. The Slovakian air force continues to harass the Germans, but no casualties due to the enability to effectively attack ground. They have been relocated to the Czech part. <br />
<br />
Germany to make TWO major headlines!<br />
German forces easily penetrate the small border forces of Belgium and dive deep into the rich country. Due to massive demilitarization, the Belgium is unable to mount a defense. Most of the men that were still in the army are in Denmark. With the German ingenuity of air combat and blitzkrieg understandings, Belgium falls in one month. The German 8th Korps gains considerable training in this operation, as does the air force. <br />
<br />
England to Annex Ireland<br />
English troops land in the southern Ireland region, the second most populated region in Ireland, and took it all without the use of much force. Meanwhile the north is fully incorporated into the empire and the Irish surrender. With the boost of moral throughout the country with the nation’s most valiant rival now under control, huge amounts of men from overseas colonies join the Home Guard, and a grant from the Australian Interim government of 40c has been sent to London. <br />
<br />
Denmark Close to Falling<br />
With Danish resistance greatening, and Belgium forces arriving, another Swedish paratrooper regiment has fallen. The lines hold, and Denmark is able to slowly regain its standings. But with the Belgium forces being demoralized, many wanting to return to their occupied country, there is still hope for the Swedish movement. <br />
<br />
Albania has Fallen<br />
Albanian forces are smashed as the two Greek forces begin to sandwich them in the center of the country. Fighting a two front war, the sparse Albanians are not able to withhold. The country fell sometime near the 9th of the month. Great celebrations are held throughout Greece in this fantastic movement that has once again brought Greece into the spotlight of world politics and military. <br />
<br />
Poland Continues To Invade<br />
Polish troops persist to advance in Lithuania, where city after city falls to the Polish army. The air cover is adequate, and the force begins to achieve air superiority, though, mind you, the Lithuanians still withhold a superb anti-aircraft weaponry system in their bases and cities that continue to shoot down Polish planes. The first battle of this month expresses the want of the Lithuanians for independence, destroying a few infantry regiments of Poland. However, the Polish continue to push, and despite being gunned down, increases training among the troops. <br />
<br />
Italy Gears Up For War<br />
The last of the Italian force in Croatia, together with the Germans who have landed in support of them, push out the last of the Yugoslavians and take the country despite Romanian superb artillery bombardment. The Yugoslavian fleets in the Adriatic have also been destroyed. Little to no casualties are taken on behalf of the Italian and German forces. Meanwhile, the forces throughout Italy muster to defend the nation. <br />
<br />
World War Two Begins<br />
With the attacks on France by Spain, and the French attacks on Germany and Italy, it is safe to say that the second World War has begun. <br />
<br />
---French Navies At War<br />
The French and Germany first fleets engage in combat after the French begin with a bombardment from a distance. The large German force began to encircle the transport while returning fire. The huge battleship was the main target for the two French destroyers, but they were outclassed. The Germany battleship sunk the fist destroyer, while a combination of the battleship and the other two Germany destroyers sent the second one limping home. After evaluating the fleet, one German destroyer was scuttled as it was unable to keep up with the fleet. <br />
<br />
---French African Campaigns<br />
The French 4th Army Mechanized Infantries are able to wipe out the Italian paratroopers in the first battles of the campaign. They then rush to the north to aid the fifth army, which is under heavy stress from the strong Italian Colonial Army. They are able to push the Italians back, with slight casualties. <br />
<br />
---French Forces Invade Palestine<br />
Combined with the aerial support, the French attack British posts in Palestine from their colony in Syria. Unfortunately for the French, the English must have known about this and have created an army and moved an army to Palestine from Egypt. The English are more then a match for the French forces, and hold them as soon as they invade. At the battle of Tel-Aviv, the British show their willingness to protect their colony and push the French all the way back almost to the border. <br />
<br />
---Austria Under Attack<br />
French forces dive into the empty province of Austria, and are able to fully capture the German Fourth Squadron on the ground. The force is destroyed, and the province is taken. <br />
<br />
---French Attacks Tus<br />
The province is guarded by the Italian home guard, newly created. However, it is quite small. They are pushed back and almost destroyed by the huge French force; taking refuge in the city that is left. The French army take losses as well. <br />
<br />
---French Attacks against Tri<br />
The French hopelessly try to invade the Italian province, but are met with huge forces that are nearly double it’s size, and much more able to fight. The paratroopers are reduced by almost half as they are sandwiched in. <br />
 <br />
---Spain Counterattacks<br />
On behalf of Italy, Spain launches an attack itself into the undefended southern borders of France. They are able to capture the province without a problem, and the large Spanish force is well adapted to the area that they are fighting in. <br />

To the free world (everyone but Spain, England, Italy and Germany):<br />
<br />
Regarding the German invasion of Beglium and continued invasion of Czechoslovakia, it appears that the Germans have continued their war against the free nations of the world.  I call upon all nations for aid against the German nation.<br />
Regarding the continued occupancy of the Italians in Croatia, Italian forces have yet to retreat from Croatia, therefore French soldiers will still fight on to remove the current Italian regime. We call upon all nations interested in removing these wrong-doers from the world join us in a crusade against the evil in this world.<br />
<br />
To Spain:<br />
<br />
Dont make it come to this.  Remove your forces and you will not be hurt, I would gladly give you some north african territory to end this fight.  This is not your fight.<br />

The battle of Belgium ended. German forces used speicel Armor tactics and defeated the tiny army of Belgium.<br />
In Czechoslovakia not much was diffrent when The German army crashed the annoying Czech armies.<br />
<br />
In Croatia the Germans were send to aid Italy and did it perfectly. They toghter with Italian forces crashed the pathetic army of Yuguslavia.<br />
<br />
But in Austria there were diffrent news.<br />
The French, even without Germany official war decleration upon them invaded German homelands of Austria and annexed them. They German people in the province tried with all they could to stop the French advance but the German trained armies just killed thousands of German civilians just to conquer Austria.<br />
10,000 civilians were lost because of that attack. The German Fihrer sweared the French will pay a great debt for this evil attack.<br />
<br />
Jason<br />
Where is air-force D? Will you put it in Tri instead of Aus?<br />
Austria only give +10 gold! not 15! France should only have 80 economy not 85!!!<br />
Also France attacked my second navy not first ;) The on in MAO no?<br />
<br />
to Italy:<br />
Good fighting in Croatia, I belive that now that we freed the Croatian people from evil Yuguslavia it's time to offer peace.<br />
<br />
to Czechoslovakia:<br />
Peace? Ok that is a welcome thing.<br />
Slo will become a German protectorat and under German miliatery control. Your country name ill be changed to Czechia and you will only control Pra province. Ofcourse you are welcome to sign DPP with us as only the evil French can attack you now.<br />
<br />
to Holland:<br />
Want to declear war on me for your allies in Belgium? It will be the honorable thing to do...<br />
<br />
to Yuguslavia:<br />
Your armies have been defeated and you allies aid did nothing. We suggest you sign peace befor we call another ally of us. You will give up Croatia to Italy, and if you wish, to not be ganged by others Germany will sign a DPP with you.<br />
<br />

France it seems is even more of a Warmonger than was feared. Not only have they invaded the peoples of Italy and Germany. As if that were not enough! But then the bloody hand of France stretched across the lands of the British empire and left an ugly smear only a frenchman could've. Even after the Great War they instigate the fires of european war! The people of France should be ashamed and anxious for no good can come of this war not for France. However we and our allies shall fight on! We shall fight for the freedom and the rights of every nation, we shall fight for teh pride and power of King and country we shall do our duty!</div></div><hr />

- Jason, I think the orders you have are from the last turn as i can't remember sending any. By the way Poland lost 13 inf divisions against Lithuania, is that correct? (I had 22 in Army Group E bu now there are just 9). Just want to make sure that the resistance in Lithuania is as fierce as I think it is.<br />
<br />
To the World:<br />
Once again the tensions between the nations have led to a continental conflict. Poland hopes that the great nations, like France, Germany, Italy and England come to their senses and stop all their aggressions once and for all. Many lives will be lost in the future if the war doesn't come to an end now.</div></div><hr />
