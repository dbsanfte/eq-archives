to calm down our people, i would like all nations in our world to accept fanatican rule. this would mean that the nations could keep their sovereign status, but have to accept that all newly conquered lands will be automatically assigned to fanatica.<br />
<br />
the price fanatica will be willing to pay for this will be peace. nothing more. will you accept?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 22, 2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in addition to the above, i will grant you the 3 tiles to the NW of your current ownings. which will be the lake, the tile NE of the lake and the tile 2NE of the lake. please post this at the land-office</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 23, 2003, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the request is definitely declined. this unreasonable demand for land will not be met by us. as such, you will have to stand your fate. you will stay with your 3 tiles. no more. and no peace treaty. we will attack any tiles you want to annex or claim in the future. you will be isolated and alone.<br />
we gave you a generous offer. any you tried to push for even more. this was a very risky game, which did not pay out for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 23, 2003, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">helena:<br />
dear father... i am not happy about this situation. i hope you know that we have forces ready (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=998784#post998784) near your border which could crush you to the ground. we will not tolerate any defections which will not meet our demands. this will be an example of how we deal with those.<br />
<br />
the last offer we will give is:<br />
1) you can live and be a souvereign state<br />
2) you keep your title, caste and land<br />
3) you accept that all new tiles go to fanatica<br />
4) unlimited usage of the roads in your lands will be allowed to fanatica<br />
you will nevertheless get the 3 tiles bellona announced if you comply. this is the absolute final warning before we force you to comply to our demands. give in or stand your fate!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plexus</div><div class="date">May 23, 2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And the last I will give:<br />
1. I will be a soverign state.<br />
2. I will keep my land, title and castle.<br />
3. We will decide to whom the tiles go to according to current treaties and armistices.<br />
4. We will grant you access to the roads we hold whenever we do and don't want.<br />
5. I will not claim any tiles at present, but I reserve the right to in the future.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
You say one thing and do another, you have no honor. Subdujation your own family to your rule while I could have very eaisily usurped the throne back in diutius's time. You would not have been treated this way if the tables were turned. I reject your offer, as all it is is an annexation of Atrouia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
quote:<br />
&quot;3. We will decide to whom the tiles go to according to current treaties and armistices.&quot;<br />
you mean your tiles with that?<br />
<br />
it will not be an annexion of atrouia if you comply to our needs... <br />
<br />
if the above is true, we can live with it for now. we will though have to have bilateral talks about the new tiles in the future.<br />
<br />
i am happy we finally solved this in a peaceful manner.</div></div><hr />

i proposed a contract to the despot of fanatica. maybe you want to post comments. it wont be ratified until he explicitly states so, and as such you wont have usage of the barracs for upgrades until both the fanatican despot and the representants of atrouia sign it :-)<br />

we will also stop the delivery of iron if you dont sign it, so this will also be a good reason ;-)<br />

OOC: At the command of CG, Antonio is to have his 6 legions and 1 horse archer, which is for chariot-counter-measures, to make Atrouia come back to the Motherland. Atrouia has 1 spearman, 1 legion, and 1 chariot. It also has a chose to come peacefully...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 03, 2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OOC: no, i think the bad point is <br />
a) having too many characters per person<br />
b) rl-lifespan is too short, so all only try to keep their families alive for long enough to do something...<br />
c) slow management respons. if you need a ruling on a matter it just takes too long for the mangement to respond.<br />
d) undefined or ill defined rules. some rules are not there at all and thus are implemented after the issue already had been used. this unnecessarily disturbs the flow of events as storylines get interrupted. also the rules are not strictly enforced by deleting ill-posts which are not conform with the ruleset.</div></div><hr />
