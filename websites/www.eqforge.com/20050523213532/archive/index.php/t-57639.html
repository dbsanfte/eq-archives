I will have my own personal opinion on this matter.  I believe that donsig completely violated his function as President by essentially declaring himself dictator and attacking Aztecs.  He violated the will of the citizens, who were not polled, and he did not wait for an FA decision on this, and furthermore he moved military units without the approval of the Military department.  He has turned this into a game of dictatorship, and I will not tolerate it.<br />
<br />
Donsig has unilaterally plunged us into a war that has spread to be continent-wide.  This has the potential to utterly devastate our nation, though I certainly hope it doesn't.  Donsig should be impeached at the very least.</div></div><hr />

[22:37] &lt;cyc&gt; we'll get screwed<br />
[22:37] &lt;Noldodan&gt; lol<br />
[22:37] &lt;cyc&gt; that sounds good<br />
[22:37] &lt;cyc&gt; an ally for 3gpt<br />
[22:38] &lt;Noldodan&gt; well, seeing as you're doing everything ELSE without hitting the forums, why not this?  Full steam ahead!<br />
[22:38] &lt;donsig&gt; Zarn, would you care to rubber stamp this treaty?<br />
[22:38] &lt;Bootstoots&gt; how many turns are we playing?<br />
[22:38] &lt;Zarn&gt; donsig I won't sign. I want to discuss it in the forums.<br />
[22:39] &lt;Fionn696&gt; fine by me<br />
[22:39] &lt;Fionn696&gt; cheap cannon fodder hehe<br />
[22:39] &lt;Fionn696&gt; assuming we had cannons<br />
[22:39] &lt;Fionn696&gt; but since we dont spear and sword fodder<br />
[22:39] &lt;donsig&gt; silence from FA<br />
[22:39] &lt;cyc&gt; it's a good deal Zarn<br />
[22:39] &lt;donsig&gt; treaty will be signed<br />
[22:39] &lt;donsig&gt; Greece has declared war on America<br />
<br />
He is running the game by himself with little say of the citizenry. We can not let this happen in multiple TC's. He must be impeached.</div></div><hr />

UPDATE:  We are now in anarchy, and donsig still refuses to stop the turnchat!</div></div><hr />

I noticed, and said that in #debates.  But thanks anyway!</div></div><hr />

This violates the Fabric of what I respect, the Consitution :(. The FA is the one and only one to authorize a Treaty signing.</div></div><hr />

Just think of as, a Nuclear Deturant or something. I dont know, I just started reading up on the Cold war.<br />

Anyway. Back on topic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He violated several laws but worst is he was warned that if he'd continue the TC he would make matters worse and he did continue. To me it seems his plan to play 8 turns outweighed, for him, the will of the people. That is not Democracy, that is Despotism. If he wants the game to be played that way he should get the save, leave the Demogame and play the game by himself. If he wants to play the Demogame, the principals of Democracy should be upheld.</div></div><hr />

DZ, this thread was opened to keep people from displaying their opinion in the Judicial thread and cluttering it up.  I think we should continue in here, given that people need some place to vent and it's better that they do so here than in the Judicial thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eklektikos</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2003, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure the people can cope with keeping quiet on the issue for a mere couple of days. It'll give them time to think things through individually rather than engage in the kind of group kneejerk I can see starting at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, we will have to keep the poll open for two days so, we weioll have to wait at least that long.</div></div><hr />

the poll's only going to be open one day because our need for a JA before the next t/c</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. Thanks to you all for not spamming up the Judicial thread on this issue. You have all had the opportunity to vent any feelings you may have. However now I must respectfully insist that all further discussion on this cease. I have asked the mods to close this thread because to leave it open would be contrary to the interests of good justice. Any further recrimination would also only damage the demogame.<br />
I hope you can all support me in this. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say we disregard the last turn chat and any of Donsig's future actions, and replay the last turn chat. Nothing in the Constitution says anything about that, so it is Legal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Venting is going to get people in trouble.  If you have some actual evidence to present, feel free, but venting serves no purpose.  If you want to vent, do it in the chat room.</div></div><hr />
