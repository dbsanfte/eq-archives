Please found the first city in the location based on this poll (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=52413). So far, the hill to the NE is winning.<br />
<br />
I also suggest mining, then roading the plains with wines first. This will take about 10 turns. Then another 10 turns for the one to the north.<br />
<br />
I have not seen any indication on where to explore, so I suggest head out west when we get a warrior, and let our culture border expand over the goody hut.<br />
<br />
As there's no build queues shown: (unless eyrei does not post them), do this:<br />
<br />
Warrior, Warrior, Settler<br />
<br />
Also, since we're going for Bronze Working, we might as well try to beat the AI to it. The AI's first tech that they research is Bronze Working. Personally, I feel that we have a leg up on Writing. Perhaps a spot council vote?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 04, 2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the build queue should be warriors until the city will grow to size 3 by the time a settler is finished.  This might end up being 3.<br />
<br />
Oh, just as a sidenote to everyone...I did not post a poll because there was absolutely no disagreement with this approach in the discussion thread.</div></div><hr />

We now have 3 warriors and have exposed a great amount of territory thanks to the very friendly Sarmatians (who also taught us Pottery). We will have a settler in 8 turns.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alamo</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">perri- is it sensible to run the game save from friday and shadow the moves made by Shaitan?<br />
CT- no<br />
Sha- Probably won't be much screenshooting. We won't have a mobile unit for several turns and will need to keep that one close to home in case that goody hut pops   barbs.<br />
perri- ah right. of course<br />
CT- I think we might be able to have 2 warriors before that<br />
Sha- No, please do not run actions in any save, even shadowing exactly what I do. The PRNG on your PC will generate different numbers than the one on my PC.<br />
perri- thanks for the warning<br />
CT- and when the wines are mined, they will generate the extra shield for the warrior<br />
Sha- I think we will too. We should have a minimum of 2 shields to start. More likely 3.<br />
Sha- And, we're off!<br />
Sha- Welcome to the second chat of the Civ3 DG3.<br />
Sha- Moving settler to hill.<br />
Sha- 4000BC. Preturn complete. Saving and uploading.<br />
Peri- its too early in the morning for much participation<br />
+Tae- but not in europe<br />
Sha- Save uploaded.<br />
Peri- that was quick<br />
Sha- 4000 BC, 5/5/0, 10g, +0<br />
Sha- Pressing the big red candy-like button...<br />
Peri- Boots, did you play the DSG turn yet?<br />
CT- Well, we don't have 2 dozen provinces to deal with<br />
Sha- Founding Capital city. Name will be Noshuret.<br />
Peri- &quot;not sure yet&quot;<br />
boots- how many turns are we planning on playing here?<br />
Sha- There has been no decision on names so I'm placing my choice. If there <br />
  is uproar or some kind of actual decision on the forums it can be changed later.<br />
Peri- 2<br />
boots- two turns?<br />
Sha- Nominally 10 turns. Maybe more if nothing is happening, Maybe less if <br />
  loads happen.<br />
Sha- Queue set warrior/warrior/settler. <br />
Peri- you know, you're right about that...<br />
+Tae- I think Noshuret is a good name<br />
boots- how many turns for a warrior?<br />
Sha- Worker moving to grapes.<br />
Sha- 5 turns to worker. Only one shield produced in the city.<br />
Sha- Worker movement exposes another hill northwest. Directly in line with <br />
  the hill already seen there.<br />
boots- how many people participate in those 4AM turnchats?<br />
CT- nick<br />
Sha- Science queue set bronze/iron<br />
CT- about 2-3<br />
CT- go with minimum research<br />
Sha- Research set at 20% (minimum for 40 turn research)<br />
boots- what would happen if nobody participated in a turnchat?<br />
Sha- I would be lonely but productive.<br />
CT- With 0-0 overrides if nessecary. ; )<br />
Peri- lol<br />
Sha- Turn 1 end. 3050 BC, 8/2/0, 10g, +3<br />
Peri- so it WOULD be a dictatorship...<br />
boots- you would be the dictator of the turnchat<br />
CT- yeah<br />
Sha- Oops. Bronze in 40.<br />
Peri- !<br />
Sha- Pressing the big red candy-like button.<br />
Peri- oops on the third turn!<br />
Peri- err, second<br />
Sha- Worker starts on a road. 3 turns to complete.<br />
CT- 3050BC?<br />
Sha- We're on the second turn right now<br />
boots- 3950 bc<br />
+Tae- whoohooo<br />
Sha- 3950. Edit that later. ; )<br />
Sha- Turn 2 end. 3900 BC. 8/2/0, 13g, +3, bronze in 39<br />
Sha- Pressing the button.<br />
Sha- Absolutely nothing<br />
+Tae- go on<br />
Sha- Turn 3 end. 3850 BC. 8/2/0, 16g, +3, bronze in 38<br />
Sha- pressing the button<br />
Sha- Absolutely nothing, redux.<br />
Peri- this is going quickly, I'm not used to this<br />
CT- From 12 hours to 12 minutes!<br />
Peri- yep<br />
Sha- Turn 4 end. 3800 BC. 8/2/0, 19g, +3, bronze in 37<br />
Sha- Button is being mashed.<br />
boots- anything interesting<br />
Sha- Our workers have completed a road to bring wines into Noshuret. This <br />
  will make the people happy. Good work!<br />
CT- road? I wanted mines first to get the warrior out quicker<br />
CT- : (<br />
Sha- Decreasing science slider to 10%.<br />
boots- what happens if an enemy warrior comes up and takes our undefended <br />
  city in 3750 BC?<br />
Peri- YAY!<br />
Sha- We lose<br />
boots- how embarrasing would that be?<br />
Peri- very<br />
* !CT thinks of that road vs. irragation poll in Civ3Gen<br />
Sha- I am moving the worker directly south to irrigate the plains by the lake. <br />
  Or...we can mine the grapes. Thoughts?<br />
boots- demogame III would last five turns<br />
+Tae- mine<br />
boots- eat the grapes!<br />
perri- mine<br />
CT- no, mine the grapes<br />
boots- mine<br />
Sha- Mining the grapes...<br />
CT- more shields!<br />
Peri- mine!<br />
CT- Why split the wines?<br />
Sha- 6 turns to complete the mines.<br />
boots- wine!<br />
* !CT would have mined first, but oh well...<br />
+Tae- is it red or white wine ; )<br />
perri- how long to warrior?<br />
CT- would've been a turn less had we mined<br />
Sha- Turn 5 end. 3750 BC, 9/1/0, 23g, +4, bronze in 36.<br />
Sha- Warrior is next turn.<br />
perri- thanks<br />
boots- are we going to explore with the warrior?<br />
Sha- Pressing the button<br />
CT- yeah.<br />
+Tae- yes<br />
CT- Let our culture borders take that one hut<br />
boots- that's what i thought<br />
Sha- Noshuret builds warrior. Yay!<br />
boots- YAY!!!<br />
CT- Head west, young warrior!<br />
+Tae- use the road<br />
perri- may fortune go with you<br />
Sha- The borders will expand and pop that hut on turn 10. The warrior needs <br />
  to be in range to protect the city in case barbs come out.<br />
boots- meet the Noble Barbarians<br />
Sha- I will explore the nearby hills.<br />
Peri- like Perianoldo!<br />
CT- had we mined... we could have had a warrior before turn 10<br />
CT- This stalled exploration is making me cringe a bit..<br />
Sha- Turn 6 end. 3700 BC. 9/1/0, 27g, +4, bronze in 35<br />
CT- Mine, then road...<br />
+Tae- where is the warrior?<br />
CT- how long until the next warrior?<br />
Sha- Warrior has moved onto the plains between the capital and the line of <br />
  hills, next to the lake.<br />
+Tae- using the road?<br />
+Tae- or just going west?<br />
Sha- It would have been the same, CT. 2 warriors at 10 turns.<br />
CT- at 10?<br />
Sha- The road is on the wine. The warrior moved southwest<br />
CT- -_ I wanted the worked tile on the wines..<br />
CT- still 2 food...<br />
CT- plus 1 shield<br />
CT- 2 with a mine<br />
Sha- pressing the button<br />
+Tae- southwest is the lake<br />
+Tae- the warrior can´t be in the lake<br />
Sha- Warrior clims the hill. Nice territory exposed. River, grass, plains. Bonus <br />
  grass.<br />
+Tae- Screen?<br />
perri- thats a plus then<br />
Sha- The lake is south of the capital<br />
Peri- YAY!<br />
Sha- Shooting...<br />
Sha- Uploading<br />
Sha- Uploaded and linked<br />
Sha- Turn 7 end. 3650 BC, 9/1/0, 31g, +4, bronze in 34<br />
* Goonie wants his old chat rooms back : (<br />
Sha- Pressing the button<br />
theGreyFox- not the red button!!!<br />
CT- We could have had 2 warriors and a settler by turn 20.. but it seems the <br />
  worked tile is on the lake!<br />
Sha- The same!<br />
CT- since you said in 10 turns<br />
CT- and that's 1 shield<br />
Sha- No, the worked tile is not on the lake<br />
CT- I guess you confused me up there<br />
Sha- The worked tile is on the grapes<br />
+Tae- good<br />
Sha- Border expansion is 10 turns from founding. Worker construction is 5 <br />
  turns each<br />
Sha- Smoke em if you got em. Have to wipe a butt.<br />
boots- work like a worker<br />
+Tae- i don´t think we need a second worker now<br />
CT- Do we have mines?<br />
perri- so why noshuret?<br />
perri- yes<br />
Peri- that bonus grassland looks like a REALLY good place for a city<br />
+Tae- noshuret=not sure yet<br />
perri- good one<br />
CT- bonus grassland?<br />
theGreyFox- a humane capitalist!? is it possible!?<br />
Sha- That was the baby saying &quot;my daddy should never leave the keyboard <br />
  unattended&quot;<br />
CT- hehe<br />
boots- doesn't eyrei have the ability to rename noshuret as he pleases, as long <br />
  as he gets a poll passed?<br />
Peri- i thought so<br />
Sha- Where were we...<br />
Peri- yes, he does<br />
Sha- @bootstoots - No more than any other citizen.<br />
boots- he's the governor<br />
boots- doesn't that give him the right to rename the city? <br />
Sha- Warrior to the south hill or to the northwest hill? both will allow him to come back to the city when the hut pops<br />
boots- flip a coin<br />
Sha- No it doesn't.<br />
CT- northwest<br />
CT- atleast it's movement west<br />
CT- and north<br />
CT- it's somewhere<br />
Sha- Northwest and then north<br />
+Tae- yep<br />
Sha- Heading northwest.<br />
Sha- Exposed a mountain<br />
* !CT is still thinking, had we mined first, we'd have 2 warriors on expansion..<br />
+Tae- where?<br />
CT- to the northwest I guess<br />
Sha- No we would not. We would still have one warrior right now<br />
Sha- @Tae - Farthest west<br />
Sha- Turn 8 end. 3600 BC, 9/1/0, 35g, +4, bronze in 33<br />
CT- ack<br />
Sha- pressing the button<br />
Sha- Moving the warrior north<br />
Sha- Another hut!<br />
perri- excellent<br />
Sha- It is two tiles north of the warriors current position<br />
Sha- The line of hills continues northwesterly<br />
Sha- North terrain is more plains<br />
perri- pop the hut?<br />
Sha- Not yet. That warrior will return home in case the local hut is dangerous<br />
Sha- Turn 9 end. 3550 BC, 9/1/0, 39g, +4, bronze in 32<br />
+Tae- i have NEVER seen a dangerous hut from border expansion<br />
Sha- I have. : (<br />
Peri- i have<br />
Sha- Pressing the button<br />
cyc- I haven't either<br />
CT- I haven't <br />
CT- just bad luck. : p<br />
CT- I always get techs, warriors, an empty hut, even a settler once<br />
Sha- Warrior moves back to the worker and grapes.<br />
Sha- @CT - We're not expansionist<br />
CT- I know..<br />
Sha- Turn 10 end. 3500 BC. 9/1/0, 43g, +4g, bronze in 31<br />

Sha- Warrior complete<br />
CT- Then it would be the Scythians<br />
Nold- then they WOULDN'T be good<br />
Sha- This warrior will stay home. The other fellow will hit the north hut?<br />
perri- yes<br />
Nold- DO IT!<br />
CT- it could roam around a bit<br />
CT- I almost said rome around. : )<br />
Sha- Changed the queue to slip in another warrior. Wouldn't have enough pop by the time the settler was complete.<br />
Sha- Mine is complete<br />
boots- YAY<br />
Sha- We now have 4 shield production<br />
Nold- WOOT!<br />

Nold- IRRIGATE!<br />
perri- mine grape<br />
boots- have him mine, i'd say<br />
Nold- Citizen spot vote!<br />
+Tae- road to the other grapes?<br />

Nold- is say we vote<br />
Sha- @boots - Just finished #10<br />

+Tae- sure<br />
CT- we're mining the 2nd wines... But, we roaded the first then mined<br />

Sha- End turn 11, 3450 BC, 9/1/0, 47g, +5, bronze in 30<br />
Sirp- CT: roading before mining really isn't that big a deal....<br />
CT- I usually mine - it gets the extra shield<br />
Sha- Road gets the extra gold<br />
Sha- And is done in half the time<br />
CT- I guess that could have been a thread in the forums .: )<br />
Sha- Pressing the button<br />
Sirp- there is a thread in General Discussions in which it was covered in detail : )<br />
Sha- Roading the grape. Mine won't be a benefit for more than a turn or two since we're going to build a settler. Will mine after road is complete.<br />
perri- ok<br />
Sha- Warrior moves along the hills. Expose more hills, plains to northwest<br />
CT- what about the other hut? - or is it moving towards it?<br />
Sha- 2 turns to the other hut<br />
Sha- I took a one turn detour to get more terrain exposure<br />
Sha- End turn 12, 3400 BC, 9/1/0, 52g, +5, bronze in 29<br />
Sha- Pressing the button<br />
perri- sorry. how long till settler?<br />
Sha- Warrior moves north along the hills. Exposes more hills due north.<br />
Sha- And coast line! That's not a lake north of the capital. It's a bay of an ocean<br />
Nold- i think we have a 4-Billion year old planet<br />
Nold- YAY!<br />
Sha- Nuts. : (<br />
CT- Lots of hills though.. could be 3 billion.. especially if there's mountains<br />
CT- what?<br />
Sha- I just realized I forgot to upload interim saves. Feel free to remind me if I forget those.<br />

CT- hehe<br />
Nold- YAY!<br />
CT- try arcing south now<br />
CT- towards those mountains<br />
perri- we must send them a saturnalia present<br />
CT- that's the scouting pattern I usually use<br />

  the moment but exposure could be.<br />
+Tae- go north<br />
+Tae- the whole world lies in the north<br />
CT- Go east<br />

boots- ok<br />
Cheet- yup<br />
+Tae- yep<br />
perri- ok<br />
Cheet- we realy should have four available warriors - one to go west, one to go east, one to go north and one to go south : p<br />
