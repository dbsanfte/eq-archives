I know a very good book I read about the 2nd WW. But that one is in Dutch. It was written by, eeeh. I don't remember. I'll search for ya. Hope I know it tomorrow. It has a lot of statistics, and about half of what I know of the strategic and statistic things of WW II (and that is a lot, I must say) came from that book.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah. I must say that the German had a few very bad tanks, too. The Panzerkampfwagen II, III, and IV were already outdated in the Russian campaign. They were wiped out by the T-34's. The original plan was to use the Panther in Russia, but the production started to late and got messed up, by  allied bombs I think, later.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alcibiaties of Athenae</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2001, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as kills go, you must understand that Luftwaffe pilots were never given desk jobs, or withdrawn for combat, as were allied pilots. Hartman, for example, had only three furloughs the whole war. By contrast, most allied pilots where withdrawn for long streches of the war. Bong, for example, was withdrawn for six months or more on three occasions. Also, the German scores where for the most part, gained on the Russian front. As for the better planes, it depends on the time in the war, and even on the altitude that a engagement was fought. For example, the Battle of Britain was fought at 10,000 ft or lower for the most part, and the Spitfire MkI had an advantage at these heights in both Bank and turn radius, but the BF-109E could outdive the SpitfireMkI (The German fighter had fuel injection, the British fighter did not, and therefore for a few critical seconds the engine had no power), and it (The 109)performed better at higher altitudes then the British fighters. As the war progressed, the tech lead went back and forth. The American Lightning, for example, had severe problems that were not eliminated until the P-38J variant, not introduced until 1944. The three main problems were that the Turbo-supercharges leaked at altitude, and didn't work right, unheated cockpit leading to frostbite(This is not an exaggeration), and compressibility problems in diving, which were the most serious of the three. A P-38 in a dive could(and often did), have it's tail rip off the airframe, dooming the pilot, who couldn't escape do to G-force pressure. These problems were corrected by the P-38J, but as that point in the war, it was withdrawn from Europe in favor of the P-47 and P-51. In the air war, the FW-190A-8 was inferior in performance to both the P-47C and the P-51B, but did carry more weapons. German training also sharply declined as the war went on, leaving a handful of &quot;Experten&quot;, anda large flock of pilots who had no chance in the air. The ME262 came to late (Feb 45) to change anything. The date is when the first operational unit was formed. Most Russian aircraft were inferior above 5,000 ft, but the Russians did most of their airfighting was below this level. Interesting that you mentioned Kozahebub, Kob, he flew Lavochkins exclusively! &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif&quot; border=0&gt; Now on to armor. We needed concern ourselves with US or British armor Vs German, because allied armor was clearly inferior to German designs, so only a comparison of soviet vs german are necessary. In 1941, during the invasion of Russia, the German MBT was the Pzkw IIIE with a short 50mm main battery. The Soviet main MBT was the T-3476B. The German vehicle's only advantages where radios(which most soviet tanks lacked for most of the war), and better training. The late war Panther design suffered from excessive mechanical problems. When it worked, it was quite dangerous, but it was overly complex, and could not be produced in numbers to match the nearly  equal T-34/85. The Tiger series had good guns and heavy armor, but it was poorly sloped as compared to Soviet armor. Yet through superior tactics and ability, the Germans where able to inflict enormous losses on the Soviets. The late war JS-2 could destroy a Panther from a distance that the German vehicle could not match. The Super-heavy Royal Tiger(AKA Tiger II) was slow and constantly broke down, do to transmition problems. But when it worked, it was invincible. Your approach has some merit, but it has flaws also. Better use of available resources might have changed the war's outcome. Despite what many people think, Nazi Germany was one of the most inefficient states in history. The Germans wasted time and effort on wasteful projects, and often duplicated research in senseless compition with it's self.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreadnought</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2001, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My two cents:<br />
<br />
-If Hitler had not decided to run the stategic part of the war after 1941 like he did, the war would have gone on for many more years.<br />
<br />
-The war was going to end in a allied victory either way you look at it.<br />
<br />
-Hitler made many important blunders during the war.<br />
  1) Didn't have the army eliminate BEF (britsh expiditionay force) at dunkirk; instead gave the task to the over-confident Goring.<br />
<br />
  2) Hitler should have focused his bombing of britain on the ariplane factories and airfields; instead he jumped around on targets giving british chances to rebuild there facilities.<br />
<br />
  3) Hitler should have never attack russia; or at least till he had better equipment.<br />
<br />
  4) Underestimated Russia campaign length. Didn't provide winter clothing for his troops.(happend with bonapart too...so sad)<br />
<br />
  5) Should have made certain that Africa was conquered; Suez should have been top priority.<br />
<br />
  6) The Battle of Kursk was delayed much too long; gave russians time to rally reinforcements and dig-in. (If Hitler had left it up to his generals, like i said, that would have never happened.)<br />
<br />
  7) Battle of the bulge was a valiant attempt, but thorughly stupid in all regards; what did he think was going to happen when the skies cleared up? (He got caught with his pants down) 200 king tiger tanks wasted (what a shame)<br />
<br />
That pretty much somes it up.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work with that scenario!<br />

*****<br />
<br />
Stats show that the kill ratios were ranging from 1:5 to 1:8 up till the end of 42. Then they dropped to about 1:1.3 when the T-34s started appearing. To the Russian's credit, the idea of sloped armor was first introduced by them. As an interim measure, in the second quarter of 43 the following were intoduced by the Werhmacht:<br />
<br />
the Tigers with 88mm L/56<br />
and Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf G with the L/48 75mm gun(This gun was superior to the T35/76 gun)<br />
Huge numbers of Sturmgeschutz IV tank destroyers with the same L/48 75mm gun<br />
<br />
And I quote from &quot;Achtung Panzer&quot;:<br />
<br />
*****<br />
Another Sturmgeschutz ace Hauptmann Peter Franz also the Knights Cross holder and the commander of Stug.Abt. &quot;Grossdeutschland&quot; destroyed some 43 Soviet T-34/76 tanks during the Battle for Borissovka on March 14th of 1943. <br />
*****<br />
<br />
These measures stabilised the front and the kill ratios returned to aout 1:5. At no point in time during the entire war did the kill ratio ever drop below 1.<br />
<br />
In late 43 the ratios dropped again as the Russians introduced the T35-85 and SU series tank killers but the situation was again stabilised when the Panthers and jagdpanthers began appearing in greater numbers.<br />
<br />
I will plan the scenario along these lines but if the german player researches ahead and waits for the Panthers before Babarossa, well who knows?</div></div><hr />

First the planes:<br />
I agree that the germans essentially did not have a lead in fighter design vs the British and Americans and they lagged behind sorely in bombers. Interesting that you mentioned the problems about the flying coffin (as you nneded to invert the plane before ejecting) before they were solved. I cannot agree about the russian planes as most of the german aces made their kills on the eastern front. The Russians simply made 10x more planes.<br />

I've touched upon this in the post just before this. To add to that,<br />

Yet through superior tactics and ability, the Germans where able to inflict enormous losses on the Soviets. <br />
*****<br />
The Germans made only about 8500 Pz IV all variants, 6000 Panthers and 1400 Tigers. Amen, quality vs quantity. Don't know how many tanks the Russians made but the Americans built 50,000 Shermans just to give you an idea.<br />

We all agree that the Germans would have lost no matter what because of Hitler (you didn't mention that he delayed the Me262 project by two years beacuse he insisted it be made into a dive bomber) and because the german A-bomb effort focused on heavy water. I guess this thread is more about the validity of the quality verses quantity scheme.<br />
<br />
These two elements will be 'excised' from my scenario. Hitler will die of a heart attack at the start and Rudolf Hess will not defect to Britain in his ME 110 but take over the war effort. Second, the German's will focus on Uranium for the A-bomb. That will balance the game for the Axis.</div></div><hr />

This will be the theme in my scenario: quality verses quantity. This is quite a contreversial thing so I thought I'd make my research public before doing the scenario.<br />
<br />
I suppose we could go into a long process of comparing stats of comparable equipment but I though that looking at the kills would have been much easier. Here are the top 10 Luftwaffe aces:<br />
<br />
Erich Hartmann 352 kills<br />
Gerhard Barkhorn 301 kills<br />
Gunther Rall 275 kills<br />
Otto Kittel 267 kills<br />
Walter Nowothy 258 kills<br />
Willhelm Batz 237 kills<br />
Erich Rudorffer 222 kills<br />
Heinz Bar 220 kills<br />
Hermann Graf 212 kills<br />
Heinrich Ehrler 209 kills<br />
<br />
and many DOZENSs of aces with over 100 kills<br />
<br />
in contrast, the top Allied aces<br />
<br />
Russian Ivan N Kozahebub 62 kills<br />
British James Johnson 38 kills<br />
American Richard Bong 40 kills<br />
<br />
Then I began to look at the tanks, without bothering to look for equivalent Allied kills.<br />
<br />
Hans Ulrich Rudel, the top Ju-87 ace destroyed 519 tanks, 150 artillery pieces, 800 other vehicles, 70 landing craft and a battleship single handedly.<br />
<br />
The German tank ace Michael Wittmann destroyed 144 tanks over the course of the war before being killed by accident (friendly fire).<br />
<br />
In 1944, Panzer Regiment Bake destoyed 267 Russian tanks in the Balabononaka pocket for the loss of 5 in five days<br />
<br />
In July 1944, Ernst Bortmann destroyed 16 Shermans with a single panther<br />
<br />
Karl Korner destroyed over 100 russian tanks in April of 1945, mostly JS-2s, in his King Tiger during the defence of Berlin. (He basically ran out of ammo).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those numbers are from an armor survey done in 1970. I just rechecked it from two different sources, and both confirm a number of WWII production of about 29,000 T-34s. This does not include assault gun variants, which I listed separately. Maybe the source your using includes post war vehicles? I could be wrong here, but I did check three different sources. Maybe your source is listing all soviet armor, not just T-34s? I will try to dig a little more into this.<br />

The Russians really started off as part of the facist pact which is often something forgotten. Not only that they attack Poland together with Germany, they also annexed several nations like Finland and Latvia, Estonia..... In fact the Allies doomed the world to half a decade of confrontation by getting into bed with the Russians. If they had fought a three cornered war instead, with Germany squeezed in the middle, Germany would still have lost and the Russians would have been bombed to shit eventually.

I just did some research, i checked a JANES refernce, they report that there were 40,000+ T-34's of all models(all hastily built) they went on to add. This is where i remeber seeing it, maybe the &quot;of all models&quot; is what is causing the conflict in numbers. Janes is a fairly reliable sorce though...I check some more resources too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BeBro</div><div class="date">Mar 10, 2001, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi kobayashi, just some thoughts to your general idea &quot;quality (Germans) verses quantity (Allies)&quot;.<br />
<br />
There were similar discussions earlier at Apolyton, and I´m always surprised about that many people think the Wehrmacht was far superior in every field, nearly unbeatable and had only lost due to Hitler´s mistakes or the lack of fuel and ammo.<br />
<br />
I don´t think that this is true (no offense of course, just my opinion http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif). The examples you have given are of course very impressive, but I think they can´t go for the entire German army, especially not later in the war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 10, 2001, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strange that you should think so, being from Germany an all. Anyway, some other stats about casualties that I found:<br />
<br />
Germans lost about 3.5 million men, 90% on the Eastern Front. The Soviets lost 13.5 million men on the eastern front. <br />
<br />
As to the quality and quantity arguement, there are many dimensions to this.<br />
<br />
The Germans had quality in training and tactics at the beginning and quality overall in the middle. Towards the end, production problems and new untrained soldiers (due to the fact that a lot of them died) reduced overall proficiency.<br />
<br />
The British had quality in some areas, like in the air but always lacked quantity. The Americans had the same quality profile but enormous production capacity. They also gave/lent billions to the British and Russians. In terms of the quality of fighter aircraft, I would say the Axis and Allies were roughly neck to neck. The Allies main quality advantage was in bombers and their main quantity advantage was in capital ships and carriers.<br />
<br />
The Russians depended on quantity for most and for a brief period the T-34 did give them a slight lead but that was all. Even exchanging tanks at 5:1 they could still field more and more units. They were the main attrition factor that doomed Germany. Even through the heaviest period of Allied bombing, German production was still increasing.</div></div><hr />

And I agree that the Germans were superior in some fields, I´m only in doubt that this was the case generally over the whole war.http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif <br />
<br />
Of course the Sherman was no match for a Panther or Tiger, but since allied Air Forces ruled the skies over western europe, the Allies could balance out this easily.<br />
Or take a look on the Battle in the Atlantic, first the German UBoats inflicted heavy losses on Allied convoys, but later the Allied antisubmarine warfare abilities were superior.<br />
<br />
For the Soviet forces, I think the T34 is one of the best tanks of the war, a great combination of armor, speed, and weapons, and also not too difficult to produce, like some of the German models. I´m not sure, but I think the Panther was the German reaction to the superiority of the T34.<br />
But the T34 wasn´t the only excellent Soviet weapon, think on the Il2 Sturmovik, or the tank hunters Su100 or Su152.<br />
<br />
I think the high Soviet losses are also related to Stalin´s politics to throw his own soldiers in the fights at any risk, without thinking of the losses (I´ve read about Soviet orders to start counteroffensives even in the first days of the war, when this was suicide).<br />

<br />
The T-34 was the best tank when it was introduced. It was also easier to produce as you mentioned. It was not the best tank after the Panther appeared (yes it was a German reaction to the T-34). In fact, all the so called heavy tanks of the Allies, including the JS-2, were in the low 40 tonnes range of the Panther. The JS-2 also had roughly the same thickness of armour. i.e., the Allies did not even have a single heavy tank.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the road from Bollersdorf to Strausberg stood a further 11 Stalin (JS2) tanks, and away on the egde of the village itself were around 120-150 enemy tanks in the process of being refuelled and re-armed. I opened fire (in a Tiger II) and destroyed the first and last of the 11 Stalin tanks on the road.... My own personal score of enemy tanks destroyed in this action was 39.&quot;<br />
SS-Haupstscharführer Karl Körner, schwere SS Panzer Abteilung (103) 503 / III SS Panzer Corps, East Germany, April of 1945. <br />
<br />
&quot;One day a Tiger Royal tank got within 150 yards of my tank and knocked me out. Five of our tanks opened up on him from ranges of 200 to 600 yards and got five or six hits on the front of the Tiger. They all just glanced off and the Tiger backed off and got away. If we had a tank like Tiger, we would all be home today.&quot; - Report by tank commander Sergeant Clyde D. Brunson from 2nd Armored Division, 1945. <br />
<br />
I guess the quotes say it all. Less than 500 Tiger IIs were made. On solid ground they reigned supreme. (but there was frequent need for maintenance and they were underpowered).<br />
<br />
*****<br />
But the T34 wasn´t the only excellent Soviet weapon, think on the Il2 Sturmovik, or the tank hunters Su100 or Su152.<br />
*****<br />
<br />
The russians concentrated on increasing the diameter of their guns withour realising that the length of the barrels were more important. That's why the King Tiger only used an 88mm (71 calibres or 6.3m long). The gun could penetrate 190mm of armour sloped at 30 degrees at 1000m. <br />
<br />
The premier tank destroyer of the War was the the Jagdpanther (of which also less than 500 manufactured) armed with the same long barreled 88mm gun as the King Tiger. As a tank destroyer, it was more than a match for the SU-122 (43 calibres) which incidently couldn't even penetrate the frontal armor of the King Tiger (180mm sloped). <br />
<br />
other points:<br />
<br />
The SU-152 was self-propelled artillery not a tank destroyer<br />
<br />
Il2 Sturmovik - Agree that they were immensely robust with good armour for pilot protection and high survivability. But were their 20mm cannons effective against ground targets? (actually I don't know the answer to this)</div></div><hr />

I personally think that germany focused on too many versions and designs than it should have. One reason it did this was because there were so many different manufactours. But still they focused on creating about ten tanks at a time and producing three or four.<br />
<br />
They should have used all avialble technolgy and started from scratch everytime to build one new tank every year.  What we saw in German develpoment was small improvements on flawed desgnes. Such as the pz-III and pz-IV<br />
Pz-III had too small of a turret ring to be effective after 42' so that tank should have been scatched and Pz-III was too slow and under armoured after 43' it should have been stopped also.  Germany should have stopped production on these series of tanks and begin immediatly and pz-V and Pz-VI series as soon as they were developed. If they would have done that they would have had a perfectly good heavy tank(tiger) and perfectly good medium tank(panther).<br />
<br />
All the diffent verions also lead to horrible supply problems and logistical mahem. you would often find that tank battalions could be mad up of mixes of all kinds of tanks. these tanks all had deffernet ranges and speeds. Refuled and movement was horribly complex.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, i disagree on the JS-2, it was about as powerful as a tigerII. It had a larger caliber gun(w/ adequet length). Its armor was, heavier than a tiger I for sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marko</div><div class="date">Mar 11, 2001, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some technical data:<br />
<br />
Until September 1, 1939 Soviet Union had produced more than 24 000 tanks:<br />
<br />
T-18 - 950<br />
T-24 - 24<br />
T-26 - 9000<br />
T-27 - 3300<br />
T-28 - 503<br />
T-35 - 60<br />
T-37 - 2627<br />
T-38 - 1375<br />
BT-2 - 600<br />
BT-5 - 1900<br />
BT-7 - 4600 <br />
<br />
About 20 000 of them were still working. (Germany has 01.09.1939 3195 tanks)<br />
More than 5000 tanks were used during Soviet offensive against Poland in the end <br />
of September 1939. <br />
<br />
During the period 1939-45 Soviet tank production was quite constantly about <br />
10 times bigger than Germany's. <br />
<br />
T-34/76:<br />
1940 - 115<br />
1941 - 2800<br />
1942 - 12 553<br />
1943 - 15 812<br />
1944 - 3500<br />
Total - 34 780<br />
<br />
T-34/85:<br />
1944 - 10 663<br />
1945 - 12 551<br />
Total (1944-45) - 23 214 <br />
<br />
Plus production of T-26, T-28, BT-7, T-40, T-50, T-60, KV-1, KV-1s, KV-2, <br />
KV-8s, KV-85, T-44, IS-2 and some other types.   <br />
<br />
Also it is not true that all Soviet tanks were without radio. <br />
Tanks T-26, BT-5, BT-7, T-50, T-28, T-35, T-34, KV and<br />
IS series had radio (models 71TK-1, 71TK-3, 9R or 10R). <br />
For example most of T-26 which were produced since 1937 had 71TK-1 <br />
or 71TK-3 type radio.  <br />
<br />
Until 1990s the real production numbers were state secret in Soviet Union. <br />
This is the reason why there are so big differences in numbers and other data <br />
in different sources. Only during last years when Russian archives are opened, <br />
more reliable information has been published. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marko</div><div class="date">Mar 11, 2001, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Dreadnought already said IS-2 tank was very good. It has equal weight with Panther but exceeded Panther in armor penetration and protection abilities (IS-2 could penetrate the Panther's frontal armor from 1100-1200 metres, while the Panther could penetrate the IS-2's armor from only 600-700 metres).<br />
Only drewback was that heavy armoring constrained by low weight let less internal space for the IS-2's crew and ammo - IS-2 had only 28 shells (the Panther had 81).<br />
<br />
Compared with the Tiger, the IS-2 was slightly better protected even though it was ten tons lighter. Both tanks could penetrate each other's frontal armor from ~1000 metres. The IS-2 had thicker armor, thus it had a better chance at distances over 1500 metres. On the other hand, the Tiger had better optics and thus had a better chance of hitting the IS-2. <br />
<br />
King Tiger was only German tank superior to IS-2. It had thicker armor and its 88 KwK gun has better AP ability. The IS-2 could only successfully fight against the King Tiger at short distances, where the difference in AP ability was not so big. <br />
But it is also important to note that the IS-2 was much more reliable and cheaper than the King Tiger. Also it was better against anti-tank guns and infantry than German tanks were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Point taken about the tanks. For everyone's info, the german tank tech tree will split into two branches after the Pz4. They can build either the Tiger or Panther first but the Panther can only be researched after the first T-34 is destroyed. Then the two branched will merge to build the King Tiger. Tiger and King Tiger will be different from all other tanks in that they will have the movement allowance of infantry. The JS2 will be more powerful than the Panther in attack so it will be the most powerful tank that can move double.<br />
<br />
For my info, were the baltic states conquered by the Soviets before or after the invasion of Poland? And was there any pretext for attacking? Also, can you confirm that Vilnius was not the capital of Lithuania in the 1940s.<br />

They had been part of Imperial Russia, and the Soviets wanted them. They had no other pretex as such, but they were in a secret protocol in the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact, so Hitler was fully aware that that the Russians intened in take them. Also included in the protocol was strip of Romania called Bessarabia, with the same reasoning(Part of Imperial Russia), as well as parts of Finland. Hitler was angry that he could not contest the Baltic states, but he knew he would attack in the west soon, and needed a peaceful border with the Soviets. He also intended to attack Russia eventually, so they would be placed under German control. One other thing Kob, you asked about Bulgaria and Rumania, and I forgot to respond. Rumania was an Axis ally untill mid 1944, then switched sides to try to preserve their country from the advancing Soviets. Bulgaria refused to declare war on the USSR, saying that they were fellow slavs, and only declared on the western allies. The Soviets ignored such fine destintions and occupied Bulgaria anyway in late 1944. I'll have to look up info on the capital question(this is off the top of my head), and I will get back to you.<br />

The exception was Britain. Armor from Poland, the low countries, and Italy usualy didn't have a radios at all. The French system was for the Companie commander only to have a radio. The Soviets usual practice was for only the Regimental commander to have it(In 1939-41). The Soviets increased this as the war went on. Also, the Soviets used AM band radios, as opposed to FM that was used by the other combatants.<br />

 Was it in Belgium or in France?France only        <br />
 The other fortifications I know of are Monte Casino and Eben whatever??? in Belgium. What other are fortresses were there in Western Europe?Eben Emal. It was considered a modern fortress in Belgium. A handful of German glider-born troops took it in a few hours, so it wasn't much. Even the Maginot line was overrated. There were gaps in the coverage. After the Germans broke through at Sedan, they also attacked the line in June of 1940, and easily broke through, but it must be remembered that the French were totally demorilzed at this time.<br />
 Were there any in North Africa?At the start of the war, there were French fortifacations along the border of Tunisa/Libya. They ended up being used by the Germans in 1943 against the British. All others in North Africa were built after the start of hostlities. The Italians built some when they advanced into Eygpt at Sidi Barani, but the British broke them easily. The Brits built them around Tobruk, and they held in 1941, but fell in 1942. The British also had a line in Eygpt at El Alamein, but all of these were field forts, not pre-war affairs.<br />
 Supposedly the giant rail cannons firing 1 meter AP shells were used to smash the fortifications at Sevastapol. Were there other Russian fortresses (like Leningrad which was under seige)?The rail guns were also used at Leningrad, but not for long. Both leningrad and Sevastapol built their defenses after the german attack began.<br />

Hitler did not think too highly about the US capability (a la Flatlander Fox's post) and he was more interested in getting the Japanese to attack Russia from the East.<br />

<br />
<br />
Having a jet bomber was not a bad idea. The Arado 234 was a good and almost unstoppable jet bomber (carrying over 4000lbs of bombs) of the time. The ME-262 program was stalled because Hitler wanted it to be a DIVE bomber. (Actually his preoccupation with dive bombing also screwedup the HE 177 program.)<br />

<br />
Amen to that. Was it also because they were concentrating on using the Heavy Water approach? Anyway in my scenario, Hitler is dead and the Jews are left alone so the scientist won't have any reason to sabotage the A-bomb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alcibiaties of Athenae</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2001, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty close kob, but a few details are off. Der Furer wanted the 262 to be an attack bomber, not a dive bomber. The idea was to strap to 500lb bombs under the nose, near the front wheel area. The wind resistance from this as well as the added weight of the bombs slowed the aircraft below the 400MPH mark, and that meant interception by allied aircraft. He refused to let it be used in it's designed role as an interceptor until february of 1945. The main problem with the HE-177 was it's engines, with caused contiuous overheating. Despite how the plane looks, it really has four engines, two attached to each propeller. The arado 234 never got beyond the proto-type stage, although a hand full where used to attack the bridge on the Rhine at Ramagan. The persecution of Jewish scientists that I had mentioned was specifically Enrico Fermi, who's wife was Jewish. This was the key man in the Manhatten project (the a-bomb research project). Without him, the US bomb would have been delayed by years. The Nazi scientists were nowhere close to building an a-bomb. In fact, there where only a handful of scientists who understood the concept, such as Neils Bohr and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Without all these brilliant men, no a-bomb was really possible. The Soviets only got it through spying efforts. They could never have produced it on their own. Germany's wartime research was extremly uncordinated, researching this and that, and changing at Hitler's whims.<br />

Maybehttp://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif.  The bombing damage that the Americans and Brits did is still to this day questionable in terms of military readiness.  The synthetic fuel industry was the main target, along with the ball bearing factories.  Adolf Galland said in his biography that the German workers (Mostly women at that time) would be able to repair the damage done by a raid quite quickly.  The synthetic fuel plants in Schweinfurt and Regensburg were targeted weekly but never knocked out of operation.  A jet fighter (or Bomber for that matter) probably couldn't have stopped the raids, but could have at least slowed them down for civilian morale purposes.  As for the Russians, their close assault aircraft (The name escapes me!!!) were among the best in the world at the time.  My doubts that Germany was even close to an atom bomb have always been strong, but I love to be enlightened so maybe I'll drop you a line Sun Tzu if you don't mind.  What about surface ships???

<br />
The U.S.Navy picked up on this after WWII. They first tried it with a modified V-1. Did you guys know that the Germans built one AMERIKA bomber prototype that had inter-continental range. The one that was built actually flew from France to New York and back again! It was lost in an accident and never rebuilt. Tell us the tale of Nazi a-bombs, Sun. <br />

<br />
Respect to Marko for the good history lesson on pre-war soviet activity in our region, coz i think that not many people have ever really heard about that, and the Baltic States are as much &quot;red&quot; as is siberia as far as they're concerned.<br />
I wanted to say a little about zee german tanx vs the soviet, but so much has been said with so many facts to back it up that my words would probably sound a little shaky so i'll keep them to myself. One thing i'd like to say is that not long ago this defected russian writer Suvorov (marko, maybe you've read his stuff..) is going around writting books about how strongly were the soviets prepared for a full-scale-assault on Europe themselves and that only Hitler &quot;saved&quot; democracy by attacking. He states that it was o no-win situation for Adolf, you understood what Stalin was up to only spring 41. Some of the facts given in this book are un****ingbelievable, like the amount of forces at the borders with germany, the paratroopers with speak-spanish-easy and speak-italian-easy books, so i gave this book to my grandpa (who was actually a soviet soldier in the eastern front) and he said that as much as he checked out the facts are true (he has a huge ww2 library).<br />
<br />
OK, so there, i've said it all.<br />

That's were i found out about the 'NAZI A-bomb'<br />
That german scientist could've had a working A-bomb by 1944-45 but they knew the power of the a-bomb and knew what would happen if Hitler got his hands on that power, can you say Bye Bye London, Moscow, Leningrad, and Stalingrad. So the scientist risked their lives by lying to Hitler, and they kept on sabotaging the project until hitler finally canceled the project in 1943.<br />
And just think it Hitlers U-boats could've hit New York with numerous V-2's. All of the skyscrapers would be no more<br />

<br />
There's not to much for me to add right now I'm into the land tactics and armaments.<br />
<br />
I will comment that there we NO meter calibere rail guns though, I believe the largest one was like 20 inches. THe largest was used at Sevastopol.<br />
<br />
Man 20 inches...you gotta think, the Yamato's largest guns were 18.5 in. <br />
<br />
Note to those who don't know, Yamato class battleships were the largest battleships every created, true Dreadnaughts (yeah my names spelled wrong).<br />

<br />
<br />
I was not refering to the diameter but the length of the shells. <br />
<br />
Actually there were bigger rail guns in northwestern Europe (a different type of rail gun in that they were not built on a railway carraige but fixed. The rail in this case refers to the magnetic propulsion mechanism that they used. The complex was supposedly inpregnable to all bombing but fortunately, a tallboy bomb fell through a shaft and demolished the complex before the first shot could be fired at London.</div></div><hr />

I mean everyone agrees that a battalion of 150mm guns can do more damage per hour than one large rail gun.<br />
<br />
Germany used most of those guns as prototypes or terror weapons. Like the Paris gun.  THey had very little impact on the war, where as the V1's and 2's were far more common and cheaper.<br />
<br />
Thats some interstinf news Kob. Magnetic propusion duhicky.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 23, 2001, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, my mistake. I got confused betwen the magnetic rail guns and the german V3 which works on a similar incremental propulsion principal but does not use electricity. Luckily nobody pointed this out yet. They were not really magnetic. Here's a bit I cut out from another site.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
A piece of artillery which would heave been worth the effort and the money evolved was the V3 ‘Hochdruckpumpe’ (high-pressure pump). This canon, situated near Mimoyecques on the French coast, was designed to fire a 68-kilogram weighing winged grenade onto London. It was very unusual because the gunpowder, which had to provide the thrust, was separated into different shunts. As the grenade was propelled in the barrel each shunt was fired as the grenade passed by. This would increase the speed substantially. This was not only economical in terms of used powder but it would also less wear out.   <br />
           <br />
According to the original plan about 25 of these canons were to be build along the French coast and they could fire a grenade every 12 seconds. In Mimoyecques much progress was made to build the canons. Thirty meters into the limestone rocks the Germans build a labyrinth of galleries and tunnels all connected by a railway track.<br />
*****<br />
<br />
As opposed to the Gustav type rail guns, I don't think that these V3 ‘Hochdruckpumpe’ were really gradiose. The bombs would not be interceptable and could be fired economically at a high rate at London.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alcibiaties of Athenae</div><div class="date">Mar 23, 2001, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen photos of this weapon, and it would not have been economical to operate, and the Germans never worked out the problems of it. The whole V weapons program was a waste of resources. Outside of killing civillians in London and Anders, they accomplished a big fat Zero. It just another example of the foolishness of the Nazi regime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squirrel2004</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2001, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't matter the number of men, tanks, or aircraft you have, or how many kills were made. Here are the four major reasons why Germany lost World War II:<br />
1) They had little or no moral from 1943- 1945, compared to the Allies.<br />
2) We cracked there secret message codes. Just like in the Pacific, we used the Navajo language for some messages, and we had brilliant code breakers, with the help of some devices, like the JN machines, used from 1941 to 1945 to crack Japanese Naval codes. We always knew where they were and when, so we could suprise them and inflict heavy damage with little of our own lost.<br />
3) Once you expand your borders, you need more men to guard your homeland. Lack of recruits and civilian militias.<br />
4) They couldn't take England. They had no landing crafts and only 2 battleships, 4 cruisers, and 3 destroyers in their navy after Norway, plus smaller gunboats.<br />
<br />
Overall, Germany spent too much time fighting and conquering, rather than think &quot;Let's change our codes, they might know them&quot; or &quot;Hey, that guy looks American and speaks English. He might be a spy, but, what are the chances of that?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squirrel2004</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2001, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to add, on the Germans side, that they developed many cool thinsg.<br />
1) The rocket. V-1 and V-2<br />
2) ME262. A jet fighter<br />
3) the helicopter<br />
4) even more amazing, they started developing a stealth, long range bomber. The project was terminated in early 1945 (low $$). It's plans were lost until recently, and, amazingly, it looked almost 75% just like the modern B-2 bomber. Weird coincidance. *Note* when I say stealth, I don't me to the radar of that time, I mean modern radar. Makes it even better.<br />
<br />
If they war lasted another year, they could have been bombing the US with the B-2 look-a-likes, landed on England with transport helicopters, and also shot down thousands of Allied bombers with the fast Me262. Scary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marko</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2001, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You forgot one very important reason why Germany lost the WW2: oil.<br />
<br />
In order to manage a war you need fuel for your planes and vehicles.<br />
<br />
Germany possessed only a few oilfields during a war with very limited output. They had created big oil reserves before the war and got much oil from Soviet Union until 1941 but already in 1942 most reserves were spent. <br />
<br />
In terminal stages of the war Germany had tanks which couldn't move and planes which didn't take off because of no fuel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squirrel2004</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2001, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, Marko, I forgot that. The Allies blew the oil supply in August 1943 at the Ploiesti, Romania, from North Africa. That's another thing. The Allies had long ranged bombers. Germany had none that could make a round trip like from North Africa to Romania. Oil got so low, they had to abandon tanks in the muddy Ardennes because they were stuck and couldn't tow them.<br />
