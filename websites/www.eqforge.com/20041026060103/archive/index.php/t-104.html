You always have these silly rules:<br />
-no nuclears allowed in MP games<br />
-no sabotage with diplos<br />
-no bribing<br />
-no more than 4 (?) cities<br />
-no battleships<br />
-etc.<br />
<br />
What's next? No irrigation and roads allowed? Or &quot;don't use riflemen for defense&quot;?<br />
You can't win without bending the rules to your advantage!!</div></div><hr />

Since I don't think there is any way to prove whether you have saved and restarted, it is just on your honor whether you use this to cheat, or just to go to sleep.  Making a rule  to ban saving seems silly (what if your machine locks up? or your 5 year old wants to use the computer??!?) when there is no way to enforce it.<br />
<br />
When you've got people explaining how to use the cheat menu without it showing up on your game (Vlad you should be ashamed!), I realize that few people in this game value their &quot;reputation&quot; if something suits their machiavellian schemes http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif, but you really just have to rely on people's word.<br />

<br />
What i think about the HOF:<br />
<br />
I think Kolumbuses game is THE best, and that he is a much better player than the guy who got 2000%. The guy who got 2000 made a ideal map for himself. I think ideal maps should not be allowed, liket he guy who got 2400%. He made the other civ start on a island with mountains! and he painted the entire map with plains and rivers, and plus, he used the airfield cheat. Ideal maps suck! Custom maps should be maps that recreate an area of the world, or something that contains a variety of terrains.</div></div><hr />

Pre-made maps should be considered quite separately. I too don't consider it a real game unless it's on a random map. I'm glad the HOF has been changed to reflect this.<br />
<br />
Kolumbusus's game is good. I agree. Have you noticed he played with the barbarians set real low and got penalised 50 points as a result? But as this is only a 6% penalty on his final score, who cares. I do similar in that I set the barbarians to Restless Tribes and get 0 penalty but 0 bonus. This really high game is a justification of that.<br />
<br />
I can't understand those people who insist on playing Raging Hordes. The few extra points are not worth the irritation as far as I can see. I guess some people must simply enjoy it. (Or perhaps they feel the need to be macho. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif )<br />

<br />
I think earth maps don't offer a tremendous advantage. True, everyone knows the map, but with random maps, you can create worlds that have better terrain and fewer oceans, and more(and better) land could lead a higher score. It's very possible for random map games to have a higher score than earth map games, but it's impossible for a random/earch map game to have a higher score than 2400%. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

You can't just defend a border and leave your unexposed or isolated cities poorly defended.  If you do, Barbie will eventually sail up and dump a dozen dragoons on your shores and cause a little havoc for a few turns.  Or if you're running up the score, you can't get the AI down to one city, put a bunch of Mechs in fortresses around it, then disband every other unit in your empire.  <br />
<br />
I can see if you are going ONLY for high score, it might make sense to tone them down, but if you're playing for enjoyment, Ragin' seems like the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.<br />

<br />
If you choose the &quot;Custom World&quot; option from the main menu of the game (that allows you to choose the land mass size, continents/islands, age of world etc) is that a custom map or is it still considered &quot;random&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Naturally, honest&amp;respectable players like me won't do that, but there might be some people out there craving such possibilities.<br />
<br />
One the other hand, if we allow people to play on customized maps and have one, all-in HOF, the game changes a lot (everyone is gonna place the rivals on an island.<br />
<br />
Anyone any ideas how to determine who is the best single-game-player of all, without these cheating options and without changing the very nature of the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowdale</div><div class="date">Feb 13, 2001, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure I can think of two solutions, but I don't think that either will ever be used.<br />
<br />
1. When you play a game for the Hall of Fame, you have to save at the end of every turn and make a short note of what happened during that turn. The good thing is that everybody with the patients to check 400-600 savegames can make sure if a person cheated or not. The bad thing is that it's going to take even longer to play a game and just as long to check if the player cheated.<br />
<br />
2. The second option is very costly but also very fair. We fly every Civkie on earth to some deserted place with a huge building and shut ourselves of from the rest of the world while we all play a game of Civ2 - that way there will always be other players around to check if someone cheats, but as I said it is very costly.<br />

I have seen saved games range from 44 to 399KB. Multiply that by the amount of turns in a Diety game and you have way too much information to transfer and way to much for anyone to check. Unfortunately as long as you have ppl saving the information to their computers you will have cheating. The only way to get around this is to have a server type enviroment like Diablo 2, but even then you do have cheaters. <br />

The reason I wrote it was to underline the fact, that there seems to be so many ways to cheat in Civ2, that there is simply no way you can be sure that a guy didn't cheat!!!<br />
If only they had made the &quot;ironman&quot; option that SMAC has then the number of cheaters would be very small. But lets face it the game was made to be fun and easy to play and that equals easy to cheat in.<br />
We can only hope that everybody has the same moral standards of most Civfanatics have and if there comes a game that looks suspicious then post it under a thread that lets the majority of us decide wether or not the guy &quot;probably&quot; cheated.<br />

<br />
To beat a game like Kolumbus, I only need two things, and that is LUCK and PATIENTS.<br />
I have already shown that I can get more points, now I just have to go up one level, and therefor I have to be lucky in the beginning and have lots of patients to complete the game.<br />

I have just begun what is probably my best game ever!<br />
A few week ago I embarked on a quest to beat the Deity high score and started a new game. I was going pretty well and all was good. Then I returned to my friend (I was playing on a  friends computer) and wanted to get on with it - but as I clicked the &quot;load a saved game&quot; button catastrophe struck!!! There was no save game....<br />
I was speechless and after drooling and speaking incoherently for a few minutes I finally asked him where my savegame was. He then told me that he had &quot;cleaned up&quot; his computer in the weekend and has thought that I had a copy of the game on disk!!!!!!<br />
Well there wasn't much to do so I began a new game, and that is the one I was referring to in the beginning.<br />
Of my first seven huts, two where empty but the remaining five where all new cities!!!!! I was amazing - I feel like Alice in Wonderland!! Of cause four of those five cities had to be &quot;moved&quot;. I love this game!!<br />
