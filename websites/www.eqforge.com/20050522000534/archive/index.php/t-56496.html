We need settlers soon to claim the land and start turning Esquiline into what I promissed it to be; our safe backyard and spring-board for ships (a naval base). We aren't technologically ready to forfill my promiss of the financial heartland as we don't know what marketplaces are.<br />
<br />
I've drawn a map where our next 4 cities should be. Take a look and comment on it. <br />

If you happen to place that city one tile NW you get another grassland. It would essentially be like trading Modern era production for extra $ due to increased coastal activity.  And people, what have I said before?  We're gonna have the best beaches in the world.<br />

But we should move Site 2 SE one square to make room for another city(Site 5?) SE of the gold mountain.<br />
<br />
Also, in the are around proposed Site 1, what do you think of making a canal by putting a city on the Wheat and another one just north of the lake.  This will allow our ships a bypass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say that we move site 2 one tile SE as DZ said. I also mean that we should move site 1 one tile NW and place a city one tile SE of the gold. I also think site 4 should be moved one tile but Ill have to look at this closer to find the best spot for it. Right now I would say that one tile S would be ok...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mr President.<br />
<br />
I think your computations contain some errors and overlook some factors. <br />
<br />
@ site 2. If we move it SE, it will not be on a river. 1 tile NE will have both the river and the coast, that might be better. But the proposed site is also both on the river and the coast. <br />
<br />
@ site 1. There is no way we can make a canal there; there is a lake SW of site 1. We cannot sail in lakes. You have to believe me in this; the Dutch are well-known for the canals. <br />
We can move site 1 S 1 tile or N 1 tile to be on the coast there. It can then forefill it's destiny as a coastal city for commerce, trade and ships. Especially with a harbor and a marketplace. <br />
<br />
My setup, or the adapted setup, all focus on several goals simultaniously. <br />
1) Grab land and claim it. I don't want foreign cities in Esquiline.<br />
2) Be on the coast in order to be able to build harbors and marketplaces. <br />
3) Seal of the corridor if we are too late and there are foreigners living in the Province. <br />
<br />
The most important part of this plan is the order in which to build the cities. The exact location is not yet fixxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rik: Altough some of your proposals are quite ok, they give a much bigger overlap. WIth my proposal you would get as much effiecny as possible with as little overlap as possible. The river is goo but we cant afford the river for 3 tiles in overlap I wasnt thinking of making a canal as I know that It doesnt work like that. I was simply think that it would give less overlap and we would use those tiles at far north there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know what DZ was saying about the canals. If we settle a city one tile N of the lake, and 1 tile SE or SW, we can pass from north to south, because ships can pass thru cities as if they were canals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The optimum placement looks like<br />
<br />
Option 1<br />
Site 1 is OK.<br />
Site 2 is OK<br />
Site 3 move 1 NW<br />
Site 4 move 2 SE (hill SE of horse)<br />
<br />
Advantage: eliminate space between 2 and 4 from foreign civ occupation<br />
eliminate space between 3 and 2, same reason<br />
reduce overlap between 3 and Nafstac<br />
<br />
Disadvantage:  Space to NW of 1 is available for foreign occupation.  Counter<br />
this by building a min production town on the N shor<br />
<br />
Option 2<br />
Site 1 OK<br />
Site 2 move S-SE to SE point of land<br />
Site 3 move 1 NW<br />
Site 4 move 2 SE<br />
Site 5 additional town 1 SE of gold<br />
Site 6 additional town on N point 4N of original site 2<br />
<br />
Advantage: same as above, plus squeeze in an additional town to get the gold.<br />
Fills in even more of the spaces.<br />
<br />
Disadvantage: two small, low production towns as fillers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would slightly disagree here. I would say thay the best placement would be this:<br />
<br />
Site 1: One tile NW<br />
Site 2: One Tile SE and one tile S<br />
Site 3: OK<br />
Site 4: OK<br />
Site 5: 1 tile S of the original site 1.<br />
Site 6: 1 tile Sw of the gold<br />
<br />
This would give us somewhat overlapping but we would get:<br />
*A canal between sout and north.<br />
*No tiles for wich another nation to settle on.<br />
<br />
This is the best way to do it. That canal is a really usefull thing and it is very good tacticly against other nations.</div></div><hr />

I know what DZ was saying about the canals. If we settle a city one tile N of the lake, and 1 tile SE or SW, we can pass from north to south, because ships can pass thru cities as if they were canals. <br />
<br />
If that works it will be excellent. I'll find an old save of one of my games and try it ou. Results posted later.<br />
<br />
It works. I like the idea of a sea-city-lake-city-sea canal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, since both sites around that lake can build harbors, I don't see a reason why we wouldn't be allowed to pass thru that water square.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This canal does work and therefore we need to build it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So for the canal, do we red and blue or red and purple ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">puprle, We need to think of the other city placements as well. According to my idea just up there the purple site would be best..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go with Red and Purple. Hmm, though my main consern would be wasting settlers on building cities close to each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SJ: I think the canal is a good idea, but I can't yet determine that we &quot;need&quot; it. We can only know that when we know the locations of other Civs and the map. <br />
<br />
I definetely like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With this channel the citys on the southern coast would be much better coastal citys and we would have a startegic advance on the opponents. The blue is faster but it will give is even more overlap.. and we dont need that...</div></div><hr />

Several scenarios of Citizen placement. If there was water where the Blue and/or Purple areas, then it would be no problem but we would be wasting a settler. But since we do need the Cannal to cut travel time significantly and thus would have a stratigic significanse.<br />
To Counter the Effects of having 2 cities close to each other, we should make sure that both cities get equal number of tiles to work with, or keep it regulated to size 2. I wish to thank Sir John for convincing me that we should go ahead (@John - You would get an A from the Proffesor of Political Science ;) ).<br />
<br />
Is a risk we must take to waste a settler. IMO, the Benifit, should out-weigh the risk. This Cannal shoud be and will be built.</div></div><hr />

I'll suggest 'The Northwest Passage' (geee cannon, can't you think of anything original?) <br />
<br />
BTW I think that there should be a poll that looks something like this:<br />
<br />
Do you think we should have a canal?<br />
<br />
1. Yes, Red and Purple sites look good.<br />
<br />
2. Yes, Red and Blue sites look good.<br />
<br />
3. No, Rik's #1 site looks like settler factory.<br />
<br />
4. (insert if needed)       <br />
<br />
  just a few thoughts....<br />
<br />
EDIT: OK, now I'm gonna go out on a limb and I may get blasted here BUT WHAT IF we use Rik's #1 site at first soley as a settler factory (to fill the backyard up.) When the backyard is full, two more settlers will be completed for the Canal Positions.  The Settler Factory is Abandoned and we claim our Canal Towns.<br />
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking of a poll. We do need some time for discussions still. <br />
<br />
At present the Poll would be something like.<br />
How do we settle Esquiline ?<br />
1) Build the canal by building red and blue<br />
2) Build the canal by building red and purple\<br />
3) The first dotmap<br />
4) other; please specify<br />
5) Don't fill Esquiline (yet)<br />
6) Abstain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to agree with the small chances of the other civs nearby, but I can see the advantages of a canal there clearly even if there is no-one close. <br />
- It will cut down time for our fleet from our southern and Eastern coastal cities to the ocean by multiple turns. <br />
- It will make an excellent lock on our backdoor in case our backyard has campers<br />
- It allows 1 more market + harbour close to our Capital in a low-corruption area. <br />
<br />
I would ask you Octavian to keep the possibility of this canal open in the design of your city-placement map. Don't spoil the canal based on lack of maps, &quot;I doubt&quot; 's  and &quot;I don't believe&quot; 's. Build 1 of them so that we can always build the second in case there are civs near.<br />
<br />
{Edit} This reply was created After D8575's map and Octavian's comment. Some strange time-warping event put this before their messages. {/Edit}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI here is a minimap with the location of the proposed canal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO, This  canal is really unneeded.  I doubt that a continent exists near that peninsula - it's all likely ocean. <br />
 Also, I can't take the time at the moment to comment on the individual plans.  I can only suggest that we need to pack the cities in, albeit lightly - ideally 5 tiles overlapping with the nearest town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jul 06, 2003, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the Persians have landed in Equiline province and a Babylonian galley was sighted near the spot where the Persians disembarked.<br />
<br />
While Esquiline province has grown from two to six cities there is still much land to be settled.  We need a plan and we need settlers ASAP.  Some may need to be rushed...</div></div><hr />
