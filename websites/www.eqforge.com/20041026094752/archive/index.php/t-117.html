Mine is the mustketeers. They are cheap and are good for both attack and defense IF you discover gunpowder before everyone else. Explorers are not very useful IMO.

Marines can be useful.A few on a transport can carry out coastal barrages against stray units enroute to cities allowing escort vessels to remain at max strength and movement.Very good at capturing  fortresses the ai loves to build.They too expensive to build many though.<br />

The Mech. Inf. because it's great for both attacking and defending plus it has good move.<br />
The Crusader because you can get it so fast and it has more attack than almost everything els and two move!!<br />

The Engineer &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; a military unit! Just because it has no attack strength, it can still take over a city. And having a large squadron of them available to build a railroad from your infrastructure to your enemy's front doors &lt;u&gt;all in a single turn&lt;/u&gt; (over most normal terrain), to allow your spies and heavy artillery in with no movement loss, makes them an offensive unit par excellence!<br />

I always play as the Americans so when I use the Marine units I imagine them as being the USMC (United States marine Corps) and all the glory and history that goes along with that.<br />
They're some of the most capable and feared conventional troops in the world with a long proud history behind them: Belleau Wood, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Khe Sahn. They're the &quot;first to fight&quot; usually the first troops INTO a hot zone and the last troops to LEAVE. Something about that legend makes them fun for me to use.<br />

In game terms though i find the marines to be excellent defenders... if I don't have mech infantry yet.. they're better than Rifleman. Plus they're good for attacking if units (or barbians) slip into your teritory. their movement is limited but I usually have railroad everywhere anyway.</div></div><hr />

There is no defense against these (unlike bombers, which can be shot down)except to kill them first. And if the enemy has a rail network, (which any smart player has to connect his empire), then it's even better. I use a couple tanks and mechanized infantry for attack(tanks also to attack outside units). <br />
<br />
As for worst unit, I would defintely go with Marine's. They are slow, and alpine troops can be used for defense. Helicopters are pathetic too, but I can use these to attack far off weak cities and occupy them. <br />
<br />
By the way, my favorite naval battle formation is a battleship, stacked with an aegeis cruiser for defense on missiles. Destroyers are the worst (only good for speed.) I might have a carrier for missiles, fighter scouts (especially stealth), and a bomber srtike force. I can use sub's for missiles, but usually don't. <br />
BTW, navy is only time I stack.</div></div><hr />

The reason for this is apart from looking different there is only one movement point, or one or two attack points differents between most of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like to have units in combinations. There must be a defensive unit (preferably pikeman and up), and one 1 movement unit (such as a catapault) and a 2 movement unit (such as an elephant or cruisader) for all the inland cities (about 2/3 of my empire are inland cities), and in the coastal cities I have a good ship in place of the 1 movement unit (to keep happyness up I always have 3 units minimum)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have found that not many people have success attacking me, because with roads they'll only wind up with a horde of vengeful units an their ***  within on turn and the rest on their way to withstand an attack for many turns to come, and that is 'IF' their ship gets to my shoreline.<br />
<br />
<br />
 because of the costs of supporting and bulding and updating such an army, i tend to lack a little science/production and size over someone that doesn't build much of an army exept for a few ships and warriors and possible a phalanx scattered here and there, but here is the good bit...<br />
<br />
<br />
I can be on their shore with ALL my 2 movement units and 4 pikemen to keep the cities I take  very quickly, because there is no problem with naval power, building units or anything. I have a unit for every problem, I can attack and defend just as well as each other. While my units are on the way to take an opponents cities, I just consider them lost and start building replacements immedieately (usually I have restocked in 5 turns) and the camacazi units on their mission of destruction do not turn back, they are gone until they are dead, and believe me, they are stubborn http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif. I usually get 3-4 good attacks out of each game, and there aren't many people that don't lose a steck of huge cities to me, if not, their entire popluation in 10-20 turns!<br />
<br />
<br />
So my point is, I don't think any one unit is really powerful unless you combine them with something else, and if you can master that, it doesn't matter who's favourite units are lurking around the nearest corner, coz they will be DEAD soon *hehe* http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Oh yeah what's up wtih the settler howitzer combo..? That doesn't make any sense to me? how does that work? there both sooo vulnerable to air attack?<br />
Explain Explian Explain!!!!!1<br />
<br />
<br />
Ha ha! Air attack is never a problem. That's because you use the howitzer in conjunction with the engineer, not as a 'combo'. And note engineer, not settler. An example with illustrate.<br />
<br />
Scenario: You've got a nice large base civ, say 70 cities mostly on one land mass all interconnected by rail. And you've got a big neighbour on the same straggly land mass, powerful and advanced, and you're about to declare war on them on them.<br />
<br />
You checked out the land before you go this. You set your cities to build howitzers and engineers so that in two or three turns you have a large army of each. And you've still got some veteran artillery hanging around anyway... Then you declare war.<br />
<br />
Send in the engineers! Starting from the end of your railroad infrastructure, send 'em out in threes. The first chooses acceptable terrain (grass, plains, desert, tundra) moves onto it and builds a raod in the same turn. The next two engineers move onto the now roaded square and between them build a railroad in the same turn. Then the next three engineers go forward and railroad another square, and the next three etc. (Of course you've planned the route for terrain beforehand.)<br />
<br />
If you reach a fortress, bring up the big guns on the railroad, and then continue. When you reach a city with roads around, it only takes two engineers of course. If they already have rail there're no effort. If you meet enemy troops you can either kill them or shepherd them past the zones of control with a spy. You only have to do this once as there'll be a trail of engineers along the road!<br />
<br />
This will take you to the doors of your first enemy city in one turn. Bring in the veteran howies along the railroad and they'll get two shots each. (No howies? Send the spies in first to take out the city walls.) This will give you your first city ALL IN THE SAME TURN. Then move on using the same technique, again in the same turn, and take the next city. Stop only when either you run out of cities, or you've run out of howies and engineers, or you reach a zone excluded by air units, or there is no way round terrain that you can't railroad in a single turn.<br />
<br />
Why is air attack never a problem? Because you hit the enemy so fast and so deep that you only get minor retaliation casualties.<br />
<br />
This is such a mindboggling simple, effective and low risk tactic, that I wish someone had told me about it when I first started playing Civ.<br />
<br />
Howitzers and Engineers together rock!<br />

<br />
Quite an early tech which gives a unit that will probably be the most powerful in 90% of the battles.<br />
<br />
I will have magnetism by the time people have just invented gunpowder...different prioritisation. I will hopefully have got magellans voyage (in MP this can be a problem, except that the religion wonders are most peoples idea of fun).<br />
Most cities won't have yet got musketeers by the time my frigates with their vital 2 hp and attack 4 - 6, my frigates can bombard wonder cities and capitals and carry the landing troopers. Thus victories that opposing navies will probably not be up to defending.<br />
<br />
ALTERNATIVELY the exploration of the seas is facilitated and colonisation and war on far off continents are possible. PLUS quite often sea travel -esp with Mag voyage- will be faster than land travel thus speeding colonists to new lands.<br />

Apart from agreeing with Shadowdale about the engineer, yes there is something better than the spy... the VETERAN spy! She is one cool mother. She is worth the switch to Communism just to build an army like her.<br />
<br />
Vlad, you missed out the &quot;See 2&quot; capability and &quot;Ignore ZOC&quot;. I always have a whole load of veteran spies in the vanguard of an assault (together with the engineers of course!). A single spy can reveal the whole of an enemy's territory in one move if that civ has even only a partial railroad infrastructure. She is awesome. And she costs next to nothing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kev</div><div class="date">Feb 26, 2001, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In general terms, My favorite units:<br />
<br />
1. Spies - bribes, nukes, poison, sabotage, etc.  Who could ask for more<br />
2. Stealth Fighter - 14 movement gives it multiple attacks and can get those pesky uprising partisans before they get anywhere.<br />
3.  Battleships - I'm usually the first to Automobile and the first few battleships can set a serious tone.<br />
<br />
I realize that any unit you get that is technologically ahead of your rivals (Crusaders, ironclads, dragoons, musketeers, etc) can give an advantage for a period of time.  I know that I try to take advantage when I can.<br />
<br />
Units I rarely build:<br />
<br />
1. Carriers - I don't usually build regular fighters and stealth fighters can move pretty far so mobility is not a huge concern.  I get nervous because the AI delights in building cruise missles, and I'd hate to lose so many units at once.  I know I can stack with an Aegis cruiser, but the effort is usually too much.<br />
2.  Helicopters - They can at times be helpful for that isolated rival city.  Battleships and Stealth Fighters are great, but they can't take over cities.  Helicopters can help reduce the need of having units transported or having to build paratroopers.<br />
3.  Nukes - If I've got 'em I know the AI will get 'em soon enough and they are never shy to use them and they NEVER clean up.  They can be nice to bomb AI ships, however.  Nice because the AI stacks them so often and no pollution if used over water.<br />

Since every game is different, I have tended to rely on different units with few exceptions.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I've never really used any of the following very much: <br />
<br />
Beginning of the game: Warriors (I just build phalanxes from the start, Horsemen (unless I get one from a hut right at the beginning to use as scout), Legion (what are they good for exactly?) I try to hold off going to war until I've got Elephants.<br />
<br />
Later on: Ironclad, Destroyer, Carrier, Cannon, Fanatics, Marines, Cruise Missiles.<br />

<br />
Back on page 1, Redwolf mentioned that the US Marines are often the first ones in and the last ones out: TELL ME ABOUT IT! I live in Okinawa and they're still here...<br />
<br />
Usually happens in my CIV wars too: I'll bribe a city that has a couple, and then I never have a reason to move them out. They just sit there, presumably harassing my virtual population and picking fights with the locals.<br />

The best, most useful unit in the game, I think, is Armor. It can attack really great, better than an AEGIS Cruiser, defend about the same as a Mech. Inf., and movement is 3, but with the added effect of roads and RR, it's even better. It does have a high price, but it's worth it.<br />

Spies...Because they offer such a wide range of utility, high movement rate (mobility is my #1 priority when building an army), they ignore ZOC &amp; lastly they can see two spaces away.<br />
<br />

<br />
totallly agree with you. And they're also the most terrible weapon (more than nukes) and my favourite units. They can buy enemy cities...<br />

They're cheap to bribe though - even the AI ones coming out from a captured city that aren't from a democracy - and then you can save your tanks for better stuff.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but when one of your cities gets taken out by barbs in raging horde, you can use you partisans to take it right back--and presto!--you also have a few extra NON defense units to play with...</div></div><hr />

I find it more useful to &quot;leave&quot; one (or even more) city to barbs. They'll constantly build units to span their empire, so you can buy them for a cheaper price than if you bribed another &quot;normal&quot; civ. That's my strategy. I give 2 of my medium size town to barbarians. Of course I surround them with fortress and defence units and as soon as somebody try to go out, my diplomats are there to buy.

My favorite unit is clearly the Engineer but, if it's military units we are talking about...<br />
<br />
The Engineer &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; a military unit! Just because it has no attack strength, it can still take over a city. And having a large squadron of them available to build a railroad from your infrastructure to your enemy's front doors &lt;u&gt;all in a single turn&lt;/u&gt; (over most normal terrain), to allow your spies and heavy artillery in with no movement loss, makes them an offensive unit par excellence!<br />

I totally agree. In a PBEM game of Nemo's 2194 Days of War awhile back I (germany) was aliied with XinYu(japan). Before I know it, I have Imperial Marines greeting me at &lt;u&gt;both&lt;/u&gt; Stalingrad and Leningrad!!!<br />
He attacked along the Trans Siberian Railroad and used waves of engineers to rebuild it (when cities were placed along the tracks, and destroyed for lack of walls)<br />
He acomplished all this while my forces were engaged in the fights for Moscow and London. I was sucessful in Operation Sealion though, because XinYu took care of pretty much the entirety of the Russian threat. <br />
