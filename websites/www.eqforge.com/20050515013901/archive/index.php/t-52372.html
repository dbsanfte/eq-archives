At any rate, we need to find a better settler producing city with our first settler, as this one is just not going to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 03, 2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. Warriors are the first priority. Explore the land, find a bountiful location and settle it. We need 2 or three warriors before we can pop the goody hut.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amirsan</div><div class="date">May 03, 2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. We should build warriors untill settler and build more settlers before the next settlers. This will produce like 10 or more Warriors that can be uprgraded to our Legions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 04, 2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, warriors until we can get a settler. As amirsan said, it is good in this game because we can upgrade our warriors to legions, our UU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 04, 2003, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are grasslands and a river to the SW. I'd like (even would have wanted) to explore there next. Have the warrior in the city head over in that direction.<br />
<br />
Noshuret will grow in 7 turns, and can build a settler in 8. To the east looks like more coast, or maybe a lake, and more desert/plains. I say our best best is SW and W of here. for an immediate settler factory. We should still build a granary next in Noshuret though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 04, 2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a warrior waiting for exploration orders in Noshuret. Unless the Military Dept wants them to garrison, of course. That will make a norther explorer, the new explorer and a warrior garrison in the capital. Growth in 7, settler in 8. 7 turns should be plenty for the new explorer to reveal that tempting territory to the west.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">May 04, 2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. We really need to expose that river area and seriously consider that as a site for our next city.<br />
One warrior to garrison, one to explore NW and t'other to explore SW. Now that we have pottery we should also give serious consideration to a granary after this settler is produced as mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">May 04, 2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, if we can create another Warrior, we can use it for Exploration.

Lets just continue with the que we have now and when we have like two more cities we can start our granary. At this rate of settlers, it seem we wont have a pretty much setler factory from here. Our Granarys should be funded in our fertile cities.</div></div><hr />

There are two warriors in the capital and one exploring to the north.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">May 04, 2003, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should we not do a multi choice poll for our plans for the next half dozen turns or so?<br />
<br />
Do we build granary after settler or more warriors?<br />
Do we create new capital in the sw?<br />
etc etc.<br />
There seem to be one or 2 threads discussing our next moves but surely we should try to get some sort of citizen consensus before Wednesday?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors seem more important at the moment, imho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A granary will be most helpful once we actually start trying to increase the population beyond what we need for a settler.  However, right now, I do think warriors are more important.  I will post a poll in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to see us finish the current settler and then go:<br />
<br />
warrior, barracks, settler, warrior, spearman.<br />
<br />
The capital would not be producing settlers after this second queued one. That responsibility would pass to our second city.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this que, except I think a couple more warriors can be fitted before the Spearman. <br />
<br />
So it would be like this;<br />
<br />
warrior, warrior, barracks, settler, warrior, warrior, spearmen, settler, warrior, warrior, settler until we get our third settler for when we could change our capitol. Switching our capitol too soon can realy hurt us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first settler will be complete in 8 turns.  Since the capital will grow just before that it will basically take 20 turns to produce a second settler because that's how long it will take for the capital to grow back to size 3.  If a granary is queued up right after the first settler it will take 16 turns to build and settler number 2 would take 6 more turns.  Building a granary between the two settlers merely delays the second settler by 2 turns.<br />
Which is more useful, an early granary or 3 more warriors or a warrior and a barracks?  Well, once the granary is in place the capital could crank out a warrior and settler pair every ten turns.  Even if the settler producing responsibility is diverted away from the capital the early granary would allow the capital to produce many more shields for warriors, barracks, spearmen, workers, etc.  Assuming the plains could be irrigated fast enough and no entertainers would be needed, allowing the capital to grow unhindered to size 7 without a granary would take 60 turns.  During that time the capital would produce 380 shields.  On the other hand, if the capital had a granary at size 1 it would grow to size 9 in 60 turns and would produce 540 shields along the way.  That's 160 more shields, a production boost of over 40%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless we find a really god settler factory</div></div><hr />

(city location coming)</div></div><hr />

btw Donsig I have recommended your argument in the build polls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siegmund</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see the first settler coming out early to get the SW fertile land going... after that... looks like the capitol is going to be emphasizing shields over food. I can take or leave a granary in the capital. I do want to see a barracks put up before the 2nd settler or a 2nd crowd of warriors comes up - I'd much rather those legions all be veterans later.<br />
<br />
I guess that means I want to see either settler-granary-barracks or settler-barracks-warrior for the immediate future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amirsan</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we should wait untill we find a better loc. for our Granary. We should get our next city and worry about getting settlers from there and military from our capitol. If we save up, before 1000AD we can get 15 legonaries upgraded for an early war. <br />
<br />
OR, we keep the Granary but put in this que;<br />
<br />
Granary, settler, Barracks, warrior, spearmen, settler, warrior, warrior, warrior, settler, warrior, warrior, warrior, settler, warrior, settler. <br />
<br />
At this rate, by our sixth city we should have about 15  Warriors ready for upgrading.<br />
<br />
If money is a problem then we should stop at the fourth city and pre-build for GL, (by starting the pyramids untill we have Literature) and save up money. <br />
<br />
I have tried this strategy with the Persians on Emperor and it worked quite well. We will need 600 gold to upgrade 15 warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rebelplayer6</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like Amirsan's &quot;Granary, settler, Barracks, warrior, spearmen, settler, warrior, warrior, warrior, settler, warrior, warrior, warrior, settler, warrior, settler&quot; idea.  But I also forsee the money being a problem and possibly stunting our growth.  We just have to make sure that we are financially stable before entering an early war, which i am all for.  Also, all of this planning is in a perfect world with no unexpected occurences.<br />
But I don't know.  I'm new and just trying to give a liytle input, but of course its 100% up to you guys.  I'm here to learn a little more about the game - if I'm horribly off the target PLEASE let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, we haven't even played 20 turns and you're talking about an early war. We haven't met anyone yet. It's better to see how far/near they are, and which civ it is. The key at the start is settlers and expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rebelplayer6</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes but I always like to be prepared to become the dominant civ, and building our military is certainly the way to dominate.  I'm a war monger and like to show my strength whenever possible.  Of course, we musn't get TOO bigheaded...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An early war would benefit us immensely, as we have a good chance of getting a Great Leader, and will almost certainly start a golden age.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the build queue will need to be revisited often.</div></div><hr />
