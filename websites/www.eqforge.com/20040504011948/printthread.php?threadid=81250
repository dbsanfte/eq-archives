Yeah, we can almost certainly expect that everyone is going to be at war with everyone else, there might be one or two alliance's made that are not broken between AI's, but for the most part, were likely to see alot of fighting. <br />
<br />
What were going to most likely see, is the Civs with the early UU's becoming the powerhouse's, and the civs with the later one's being wiped off the map.<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I always wanted to try maximal aggression in C3C and never had an opportunity. Is it possible to sign me in also? But only if cultural conversions are on.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to play some militaristic civ with early and effective UU. Aztec?<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I wouldn't recommend the Aztecs, there UU is only useful in the VERY early game, before any of the hard fight starts up. We want a UU that can last when the swordsmen/horseman/spearman fights pop-up.<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>

We don't HAVE to be militaristic, I was thinking industrial as almost certainly one of our traits, allow us to get our civilization to it's full potential faster.<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">__________________<br>
