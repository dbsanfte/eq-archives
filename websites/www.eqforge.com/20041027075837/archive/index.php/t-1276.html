I'm working on a modpack: a dutch modpack. I can'really tell much about it, yet. I do that first when I finish the scenario(s) that come with it (about the so called 80-year war, 1568-1648. You can call it the Dutch Independence War too, because they wanted to be independent from the Spanish.) For this scenario I used the (very good and detailed) map of an other scenario with the same subject that can be downloaded from th Apolyton site (FW only). My modpack and scenario are and will be build with Civ II Classic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Feb 14, 2001, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And if I am not mistaken that would be the around the time that Phillip II who was king of Spain with his quest to spread Catholicism throughout the world. Elizabeth I was queen of England I think; but I do know that the English successfully defeated the Spanish navy keeping them from reaching their destination and trashing Ghent. Was it Antwerp that was one of the richest cities in the Netherlands...that Spain needed to maintain control for its economy at the time? I can't remember...<br />
<br />
Spain, if I remember right had a lot of political control throughout Europe including a personal alliance between King Phillip II and French Royalty...(Catherine de Medici?...hm...)<br />
<br />
I just can't remember as much as I used to ....<br />
<br />
Sounds like a good time period for a scenario...a lot of exciting events...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Feb 14, 2001, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Antwerp was a great and very rich city at the time, because of its large seaport that was very imortant. Later, when the Dutch revolutionists (geuzen) took control of Zeeland and blocked the Schelde (the river that is between Antwerp and the Northsea), no ship could reach Antwerp. The rich traders went away, mainly to Amsterdam, together with all the banks that couldn't make any profit when there were no traders. Also the Jewish and few Moslims flet away from the anish Nertherlands because of the Spanish that wanted to destroy all non-catholic population.<br />
<br />
In my Dutch Modpack, there are just 4 changes in the city improvements, all wonders have been edited, the icons are new (except for the improvements that weren't changed), there are new units (mainly new ships, and a unit called poldership that can change water into land) and units are replaced (new unit is the UN Soldier coming with the advance of Communism, together with United Nations. It came for the partisan.) I'm working on a new advice.txt. Ofcourse the terrains are edited and I'm thinking of making the cities.gif a little bit different. There are a few new advances (shipbuilding, sailing, polders), and also a few new civs (Dutch, Belgian and I'm working on Surinamese and Indonesian because they are heavily related to Dutch history as colonies)<br />
<br />
For the scenario, there comes a new units.gif, rules.txt in comparison to the Dutch Modpack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Feb 15, 2001, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This Dutch Modpack is my first modpack. The scenario I'm going to create, will be my third. For the Dutch modpack, everything is ready. I'm only having trouble with the pedia.txt. I changed it, but it won't appear in the game. I even tried editing the .pde-files, but that didn't work either.<br />
<br />
I decided to split my scenario in 3 or 4 parts of the 80-year war. Informartion will be added soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stormerne</div><div class="date">Feb 15, 2001, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope that either the scenario finishes in 1648, or that you can introduce some kind of &quot;urban decay&quot; that affects the city of Antwerp. Modern Antwerp is horrible! When I visited last year, I realised why Belgians brew such good beer - it's a form of escapism so they don't have to face up to how ugly some of their cities have become.<br />
<br />
Now Zeeland... that's a beautiful place...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Feb 15, 2001, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario 1: &quot;The Revolution&quot; <br />
starts in 1566 with the &quot;Beeldenstorm&quot;. People attack catholic churches and destroy all the windows and statues (=beelden). The Duch (have to) conquer a few cities, while other cities join the &quot;Geuzen&quot; because they want. The scenario ends in 1576.<br />
<br />
Scenario2: &quot;The Rift&quot;<br />
starts in 1577, the Dutch get extra armies from foreigners (also calvinists) and almost whole Holland (the province, not the country) is with the &quot;Prince of Orange&quot; (Willem van Oranje). Don Jan is the Spanish &quot;governor&quot; of the Netherlands. The Union of Atrecht is formed, consisting of parts of Belgium (that was considered Spanish Netherlands too). The Dutch form the Union of Utrecht, 7 proinces binf=d together to eliminate a common enemy. The scenario ends in 1588. Willem van Oranje is murdered in Delft (nice objective for the Spanish).<br />
<br />
Scenario3: &quot;Military Succes&quot;<br />
starts in 1589. The Armada is on its way to England and the Netherlands. The fleet of Parma wants to join the Armada, but will be attacked by rebellion ships near Sluis (Zeeland) and near the French coast. All fotreses of the Spanish in Holland, Friesland and Zeeland have to be conquered with the first well trained land troops of the Dutch, lead by Van Oldenbarneveldt and Prince Maurits (the son of Willem van Oranje). The <br />
Dutch have to try to conquer Dunqurque and the Armada should be crushed by the combined forces of the British and Dutch. The scenario ends in 1609 with the 12-year peace.<br />
<br />
Scenario4: &quot;Consolidation and Victory&quot;<br />
starts in 1621. The Spanish try once agian to defeat the new Republic. Frederik-Hendrik (also an Orange-Nassau) starts a conquest in the East and South of the Netherlands. The Spanish must try to conquer Breda and Gulik. <br />
The second Armada will arrive to defeat the Dutch fleet.<br />
<br />
Until now, the scenarios are historical correct. The second objective of the Dutch is to conquer Brussels, and the third to kick the Spanish ***  out of the Netherlands. The Spanish second objective is to conquer Amsterdam and the third to conquer all Dutch cities. <br />
The scenario ends in 1648 with the peace of Munster, or earlier when you defeated your oponent and didn't start a new war.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2001, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've finished the ctiies.txt, units.gif and I am almost ready placing all the cities on the map. Next is the rules.txt. Science will be obsolete in my scenario, and the Dutch and Spanish will have different units. The scenario in Asia will take a time, since I haven't finished the first scenario of the 80-year war yet.<br />
<br />
By the way, does anyone know if it's possible to create an event file with the clasic version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pedro</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2001, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think so.<br />
You can only set certain standards for the rest of the game. I guess you want the AI to declare war on the human player in a specific year? You just have to write a real good scenario I guess...<br />
<br />
Remember, in a WWII scenario theoretically the Nazi's can win if their strategy is really good!</div></div><hr />

Als je FW niet hebt, weet ik wel waar je 't kunt downloaden.</div></div><hr />

Ik vind het al zwaar *** dat ik FW niet heb. Ik heb geprobeerd om hem te krijgen (de afgelopen 6 maanden) maar ik kon het nergens vinden. Zelfs niet illegaal. Ik had het een paar jaare geleden moeten kopen, toen dacht ik er wel over, maar civ II was toen een jaar lang niks voor mij.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips and the help, John. I already added two new &quot;Dutch&quot; units and I'm making the Dunes a little better (they have relief now. The Dutch dunes have heights to 50m (sorry, don't know what that is in feet. When Jordan ws about 7 feet, 1.93m, then it would be abou 170 feet?))<br />

I just came up with another unit idea, and I've changed two wonders too. John, I've used the terrain files you sent me already (for the swamp and clay). Thanks!<br />

Somehow (and I'm suspicious) all .scn files have been deleted. I haven't got a single scenario anymore. Lucky me I've saved all the zip files seperatly, so most of them can be restored, but not my own scenarios. I was working on the first of the 80-year war. Now I can start over again. I'm glad I wasn't that far yet. All the .txt and .gifs are still intact.</div></div><hr />
