Remember: Keep your character interests within the constraints of our current in-game technology. Additionaly, when you create a character that's of high gentry or better, write how they achieved that. (i.e., storyline, by birth, promotion, and include the link to the storyline). Also include the year which they were born.<br />
<br />
Character Birth Note:<br />
<br />
When your character is about to have children, PLEASE PM ME THE FOLLOWING THINGS:<br />
<br />
Character Names<br />
Character Stats (the agility, discipline, etc.)<br />
Character Traits<br />
<br />
I do NOT need their caste, ages, status). My RNG also decides how many children your character will have, and if it was a successful delivery. That means you CAN NOT pick and choose until genetics.<br />
<br />
Also, please recycle your character threads when adding new characters.<br />
<br />
This is the character thread, where you will list your characters. List this in this manner:<br />
<br />
Character Stats Traits<br />
<br />
These are things that are required: Sidenote:If your character gives birth, please pm the Character Manager so that they can create the stats. Also, please include their parents.<br />
<br />
Character Name - Name of the character.<br />
<br />
Character Gender - The gender of the character (male/female)<br />
<br />
Character Status - Alive/Dead. This is for record keeping. When your character dies,<br />
<br />
Character's Health - Good, Crippled, Plague This is another record keeping stat which could effect the character or other characters.<br />
<br />
Character's Age - The age of your character. This must be at, or less than the max age shown in the latest demogame save. The age limit will be posted in the Game Manager Thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=51996).<br />
<br />
Caste - the starting caste of the character. (Imperial, Royal, High Noble, Noble, Upper Gentry, Lower Gentry, Common)<br />
<br />
These castes add the following to your character's lifespan to reflect the living conditions: (The effects end after hospitals)<br />
<br />
Common: +0<br />
Lower Gentry: +5<br />
Upper Gentry: +10<br />
Noble: +15<br />
High Noble: +20<br />
Royal: +25<br />
Imperial: +30<br />
<br />
Stats<br />

<br />
Traits<br />
<br />
Any character can have up to 3 of these traits that can be passed on from generation to generation. These traits are generic abilities that the character is geared towards. A descendant of will get random traits from their parents.<br />
<br />

Josephus Strummerus was born the son of a Fanatici diplomat in the capital of an outlying tribe known as the Turkmen.  When he turned 8, his parents decided to move back to Noshuret so that their son would have a better life.  He grew up in the lower class, but was not exactly poor.  At the age of 12 he began to play music, using a home-made instrument consisting of a wooden body and strings of varied length that produced different notes.  He became a skilled musician, often playing for his friends and relatives.  As he got older, he began to put a message in his music.  His angry yet poetic lyrics, combined with his inovative instrumentation, created songs that railed against society and the establishment.  He called it &quot;musica del rebellia.&quot;  It was his hope that when other young men heard the music, they too would realize what was wrong with society, and would fight to fix it.</div></div><hr />

He can think up brilliant strategies to fend off Barbarians, but is unfit to weild an axe or spear.  He often has discussions with others, like SaaMuel.  <br />

Monicias was brought up by drunken nomads. At the age of eight she was set off in a boat when her parents were in a drunken rage, She found herself on the shore, near a desert village, where the villager's houses looked like mushrooms. Ever since then she has been looking for a normal person to help her out. She came across Geraldus, and thought he was normal enough. Now she is helping him bake an army to rule the world.<br />

I hope these are good characters, I tried to base them on the terrain we can see so far.</div></div><hr />

Mariner I was brought up to strict and displinarian parents, who forced their revoloutionary ways upon their young son. Although very intelligent, especially in the fields of business, combat and religion, his years of isolation from the outside world have perverted his young mind, and have made him angry and resentful of the human kind, which can somewhat explain his aggressive, conservative like personae. Although coming off and arrogant and thoughtless, he cares deeply for his young nation, and hopes to bring his idea's to the residents of this local tribe, and bring organisation and greatness to it. He is willing to die for his land, which garners great respect from his fellow colleagues, and may, someday in the not so distant future, come to love his fellow man.</div></div><hr />
