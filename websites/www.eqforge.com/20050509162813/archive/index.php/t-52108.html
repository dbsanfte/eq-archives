<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Apr 30, 2003, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basic Ruleset<br />
<br />
1. Each character may raise a certain number of units per chat. This is based on their caste level and modified by their statistics and abilities.<br />
<br />
2. Each character also has a maximum number of units that they can maintain command over. This is based on their territory controlled and modified by their statistics and abilities. (Note that with the proper statistics and abilities a character can raise and maintain troops regardless of their caste level.)<br />
<br />
3. Each unit costs one shield and one food per chat to be maintained in fighting order. A unit without this support becomes a half strength unit. After 2 chats at half strength the unit will disperse.<br />
<br />
4. Each unit costs a number of shields to raise that is equal to 1/10 of the number of shields to build it in the Civ3 game.<br />
<br />
5. Mercenary units must be supported with gold and cost gold equivalent to their unit raising cost each chat. (Example: It costs 3 shields to raise a swordsman. It would cost 3g per chat to maintain a mercenary swordsman.)<br />
<br />
6. Units are stationed in a territory and can be assumed to be located anywhere inside that territory. A unit can move into (through) one territory per chat for each of its Civ3 movement points. If movement is not contested and is along roads a unit can move into (through) 3 territories per chat for each of its Civ3 movement points. A unit must always stop movement when it enters a contested territory.<br />
<br />
7. Units in a contested area will fight using their unit attack/defense values from the Civ3 game modified by character warfare skills, terrain, defenses, etc. Forces may be destroyed, rebuffed, routed, etc.<br />
<br />
8. The Conflict Manager has overall authority over all units and is responsible for tracking the units for each character, their location, movement, upkeep, status and all conflicts resulting from actions in contested territories.<br />
<br />
Octavian's In-House Rules<br />
<br />
1. In the event of a battle between batallions of units, it will be possible (by random event) that leaders of those units may be hurt.  As technology gets better where leaders are less and less needed at the front, this risk diminishes.<br />
<br />
2.  The Conflict Manager reserves the right to create/alter units available for use by players to fill in upgrade lines in the Civ3 game.<br />
<br />
3. Each invidividual real-life player may create one unique unit.  That individual can create all stats (subject to approval by the manager), and must assign it to one of his characters.  When a character with a UU dies, the UU dies along with him, becoming an equivilant unit available to all.  Each individual may only create one UU for one character throughout the game.<br />
<br />
4.  The Conflict Manager reserves the right to create NPC armies to invade Fanatica.<br />
<br />
5.  All units that would regularly require a special resource will require that resource. The resource may only be used if it is inside your territory, or if you have agreements with another character to use the resource. The resources need not be connected by road in-game.  This goes for barracks as well: You must control a city with in-game barracks to upgrade troops.<br />
<br />
6. You may only command a number of units equivilant to your character's charisma statistic. You may raise more units than that number, but those units should be placed under the command of another character. I will allow you to command more troops than your charisma score, but be warned, as those additional troops may rebel.<br />
<br />
7.  Please remember that all decimals should be rounded down, be it .1111 or .9999.<br />
<br />
8.  Upgrade costs are one-half the difference of the costs of the old and new unit.<br />
<br />
Thread Rules<br />
<br />
1. Please keep all unnecesary discussion out of this thread. It is only reserved for orders, or notifications of conflict.<br />
<br />
2.  Clearly label each post (Troop Raising, Troop Orders, Character Conflict, etc.). Unclearly labelled posts will be skimmed through and disregarded as spam.</div></div><hr />

Please note that I am looking for an assitant for the job. <br />
<br />
I am interested in the Job :). I can create some sourt of Manfest for each Citizen (Or groups) that are in the RPG :). I have MS Excel that would alow me to do this :).<br />
<br />
Edit: I discovered that Zarn has applied also, would it be possible to divide the work between the two of us :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those are good ideas, Octavian. You don't need to alter the base rules for them though - they can go in your Conflict Rules subset.<br />
<br />
The idea with the base rules and subset rules is to create a basic and constant framework with the basics and then have subset rules that expand and define them. The basics stay the same for the whole game. The subset can change based on how the game is flowing and the particular flavor brought to the office by the current managers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, that sounds good.  I just thought of another possible addition: Create NPCs that lead foreign armies intent on destroying Fanatica.<br />
Remeber in DG2 how the game got so tied up in alliances that little conflict actually occured?  I think it would work great if, every once in a while, foreigners threatened our lands.  Even the armies were lead by NPCs the manager controlls, then bribes could be offer for alliances with Fanaticans.  That way, loyalties would have to be proved, etc.<br />
<br />
Zarn, CG: Thanks for appling.  I'll keep you in mind when I get a workload.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, that's what the Game Manager should be doing. Creating and running NPC's to keep the stories flowing and the game vivid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">some more ideas:<br />
characters should be able to form units... not only buy and support them. the disadvantage of this is that the character will be deeply effected by a fight :-)<br />
<br />
the units created will be character based units. each unit being defined by the abilities and items the character owns. for example a character with only a club would be a warrior. if the techs allow a character with more than average horsemenship could be a horsemen, and as soon as the techs allow and he owns mail and an appropriate horse, he could be a knight (for some unit types special prerequisites, like having being &quot;sworn in on the crown&quot; or having passed special trainings could be set up by the conflict manager).<br />
the character based units may command themselves under controll of another character (&quot;leader&quot;), but may leave this controll at any time. they can even disband themselves under controll of their player. as such, they will not cost any defined maintenance unless otherwise defined between the characters.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
player A, characters: ca1,ca2,ca3<br />
player B, characters: cb1,cb2<br />
<br />
ca1 decides to run his own army. he baught units, but thinks he needs more people. as ca2,ca3 and cb1+cb2 live in the area he controlls, he asks them to join.<br />
ca2+ca3 only have clubs and join the army for free, cb1 and cb2 are equipped with spears and want 10g/tc from ca1. ca1 complies.<br />
the army of ca1 would consist of 2 warriors and 2 spearmen + any additional units he baught for money.<br />
if he wants to &quot;lead his troops into the fight&quot;, then he can equip himself and add himself to the army. lets say he buys a horse, then the army will have an additional horseman.<br />
<br />
now he goes into a fight. he builds 2 troops:<br />
(character units are marked with a *)<br />
troop1: spearman*, spearman, warrior*, warrior*<br />
troop2: spearman*, spearman, horseman*<br />
<br />
during a fight with others, the baught units will be automatically &quot;used up&quot; first if not otherwise defined in the instruction thread.<br />
so if ca1 only moves his troops and looses a warrior in troop1, it can be either ca2 or ca3. which one would be defined by random or instruction, the effect (death or injury) can also be defined by random.<br />
troop2 also receives losses during the attack. the baught spearman gets killed. this scares cb2 so much that he defects with his spearman, so it vanishes out of the troops. in troop2, the horseman of ca1 is now undefended.<br />
during the next attack of the enemy, the horseman gets beaten down. the randomizer will define if ca1 survives, and if he is held captive by the attacking army :-)<br />
<br />
if he has a decessor defined, that one will immediately take over military controll. the units will nevertheless stay stalled for one TC because of the change in command.<br />
if no decessor can be found, than the baught troops defect completely. it is up to the player of a character to define whether his troop also defects.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and our main problem will be: we wont be able to have units under the current ruleset until currency!</div></div><hr />

With the game picking up, I need a few people who are on when I'm not to decide the various bouts that occur during the day.  All you'd have to do is determine winners, losers, and injuries incurred when a battle takes place somewhere, all based upon a character's stats.<br />
The only restirctions would be that you couldn't judge battles you fought in (duh!) and that all decisions would be reviewed by myself, with the possibiliy of the overturn of another decision.<br />

Sorry, Bootstoots. That kind of attack would have worked 2500 years ago, when you could have lit some bushes on fire and shook our grass hut. But those days are long gone. The architecture and layout of the Palace has evolved over the years, plus there are quite a few troops in the area. It would be very hard to have a suprise attack anywhere close to a dining hall. Nice try though.</div></div><hr />

If you can get your tile irrigated or developed in some othe way, there will be extra resources for you personally to use. In this way, the tile I have given you is self- sufficient, and only requires that you protect it. You also have a title and some elbow room.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if i'm wrong, Oct, but isn't 1 gold equal to 1/2 food or shields?  Therefore, Diutitus' 127 gold converts to 63.5 shields or food.  Also, do people have to pay upkeep on the turnchat they raised a unit?  Also, where are these units stationed?</div></div><hr />

Due to Fanatica's relative unorganization, low productivity, and population in this day and age, I'm not going to let anyone take in the full income possible from all tiles at the moment.  For a preliminary figure, multiple all figures by 1/9.  I will review the save more in depth, and have a more exact figure tomorrow.  I also can't remember if we have connected iron or not, so even the legions may be iffy.<br />

BTW, multiplying by 1/9 is far too low, IMO.  Perhaps you should instead have an upper limit of 16 units per character, but keep the same resource rules.  Plexus especially should be able to raise a force of units, as he currently owns a tiny defenceless nation.  Also, though the legions owned by each noble have presumably been raised, does that mean that they only produce 1/9 shield and 1/9 food and are incapable of supporting them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 20, 2003, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, you can't place restrictions on the amount of resources gained by a citizen owning/using land.  This is set in the rules approved by the citizenry.  Here is rule 7, which states resource rules: <br />
7. Land provides a number of gold, shields and food that it would generate if worked in a city. If no city controlled by the tile owner can access the tile it never makes more than what is shown when right clicking on the tile in the game. Gold can be converted to food or shields with one gold making 1/2 of either. If currency hasn’t been discovered yet all gold produced must be taken as shields or food.<br />
<br />
I think that you can and should place an upper limit on troops raised (16 is a good number for this) but not a limit on resources.  This is not even the right office to be limiting resources.</div></div><hr />

<br />
@Shaitan - There is one rule to that effect and that is the Despot owns all land. He can also do what he wants with it (within reason). Lesser Lords, no. There is no ruling on them.<br />
<br />
@boots - I believe you're right about the resource restrictions. But the Despot has to control and protect a large area (the entire nation). So the despot needs to be able to muster as many troops as they need to do this. True, it would be wise to allocate these troops out to the nobles, which I have tried to do, but it should go beyond that so more Nobles can be brought on and so that the Despot has a little leeway in contol of the nation.</div></div><hr />

And now I have to keep an eye on Tasius ;). 16 units isn't very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 20, 2003, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also, we maybe can introduce something completely different:<br />
no fixed limitation of resources or troops, but a good limitation of the land income you can get ;-)<br />
<br />
how can that work:<br />
we could use the tilecount for each character to define the limits.<br />
example:<br />
&gt;10 tiles: cutdown of tile-income by 25%<br />
&gt;15 tiles: cutdown of tile-income by 50%<br />
&gt;20 tiles: cutdown of tile-income by 75%<br />
&gt;25 tiles: cutdown of tile-income by 100%(!!!)<br />
<br />
so how will it work?<br />
if the despot owns 90 tiles:<br />
the first 10 will receive full output<br />
the next 5 will receive 75% of full output<br />
the next 5 will receive 50% of full output<br />
the next 5 will receive 25% of full output<br />
and the rest (65 tiles) will receive no output at all<br />
<br />
it would be nicest to priorize the tiles from their &quot;administrative distance&quot; for getting output (so the tiles near the capitol, for example, would receive more output than the others), but randomized or stated by the despot would also do. maybe even &quot;best tiles first&quot; or &quot;worst tiles first&quot;.<br />
<br />
together with the user/owner rules for land this could drastically enforce &quot;small territories&quot; of  maximum 25 tiles ;-)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
an alternative could be to just apply to %-age to the full income &gt;-)<br />
so as soon as someone own more than 25 tiles, he gets no income at all from all of his tiles (but i think this is too drastic).</div></div><hr />

As we do not have iron yet connected or in our controll, the following troops will be raised:<br />
4 spearmen, 5 warriors<br />
<br />
together with the warrior we got from the former despot (as posted far before may 15th), we now should have 4 spearmen and 6 warriors garrisoned at gorina to protect the royal family.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw:<br />
you should urgently post how the upgrade of units goes...(for example wether barracs are needed in a city controlled by the upgrader etc.)... not that we have the same chaos again!</div></div><hr />

Anyway, good luck against 3 Warriors and a Spearman. Also since Antony is in Nar Shadda land, Bootstoots will have to help. And I'm sure Nero's troops will help too. That makes around 8 units you have to fight in Nar Shaddaaland. <br />

i think this value for the amount of units to controll is good, but should be modulated by either aera or government form.<br />

i still think we should give the commerce of land a sense. what about if we could use it for support of the troops? in civ3, the units are afaik also not supported by shields but by commerce.<br />

you also need the needed resource (for example horses) inside your area to build a unit (or trade for the resource).<br />
<br />
the support of any unit costs one food and one shield each TC.<br />
<br />
so for example a warrior will cost you 1 shield for creation and 1shield+1food each tc for support<br />
<br />
a legionarry would cost you 3 shield for creation + you need iron in your territory (or trade for it). the support will also be 1s 1f</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 4 warriors, and If i upgrade to swordsmen, it would cost:<br />
1/2 for each warrior, which gets rounded down to 0<br />
<br />
1 1/2 for swordsman, which gets rounded down to 1 shield. This equals 4 shields to upgrade?<br />

<br />
to the math:<br />
a warrior costs ingame 10, a swordman 30<br />
so the rpg prices would be:<br />
warrior: 1 shield<br />
swordman: 3 shield (iron needed)<br />
legion: 4 shield (iron needed)<br />
<br />
so the upgrade prices are:<br />
warrior-&gt;swordman: 1 shield<br />
warrior-&gt;legion: 1.5 shield<br />
<br />
i suppose the value for the legion is rounded up, not down.<br />
so if i for example upgrade 3 warriors, this would cost me 3*1.5=4.5 rounded up=5 shield<br />

the only question open will be how many shield a disbanded unit brings into my pocket.</div></div><hr />

how do i loose 55 shield 28 food and 116 commerce?<br />
<br />
i onw 20 units, so 80 gold should be enough for maintenance for them... (20shield+20food=40resource=80gold)<br />
the values after maintenance should so be:<br />
61,41,84<br />
i upgraded 3 warriors to legions for 9 shield<br />
i baught 6 legions for 24 shields<br />
so my values after upgrades/buying should be:<br />
28s,41f,84c<br />
<br />
how is the caluclations of your values?<br />
also, i think you got the controlling characters wrong or did not yet update them. i posted above a change so please check again.<br />
<br />
i also need ruling of the disbanding of my archers. how many shields do i get from them?<br />
<br />
just a note:<br />
for the future i would like to convert all commere to shield+food for the maintenance of the troops. so for each unit i pay 4 commerce as maintenance (atm this should so be enough for up to 41 units).</div></div><hr />

according to this and the above shield calculation of me, i would like to raise 6 more legions with the leftover shields+ the leftover gold converted to shields.<br />
this would cost me 24 shields.<br />
i should have enough according to your or my values, whichever are correct.<br />

OK, dis, your numbers were refigured.  I don't know what happened to my files.  You have 41s/21f/164c<br />
Perhaps I should explain in detail how I determine if you have the resources necessary.  Sheilds are never actually subtracted when you raise a unit.  Let's say a person has 30s.  He orders 10 swordsmen.  This order costs 30s exactly.  I then record the maintinence costs, giving him 20s left for any raising he wishes to do next TC.  This is mainly why I only allow one troop raising each TC (a rule I need to start enforcing better).  Everything gets complicated after awhile, which is why this system is as simple as possible.<br />
<br />
As for disbanding, seeing as sheilds don't accumulate at the moment and looking at how I raise troops, I'm gonna say disbanding only frees up maintience sheilds.<br />
<br />
The last orders have been processed.<br />

I know, I took over 2 countries but it is moving the game along, unfortunately. And CG is part of it. I took Plainia and Neronia over because he agreed that Fanatica should be united. He is behind me too, so don't blame the whole thing on me.<br />
<br />
Also, All the Nero Characters will be at High Nobility at Lord ranking. Julia Peesea will recieve Duchess(Duke) at High Nobility. Anyone related to the Nero's will recieve Marquis and Marquessa. They can accept if they promise not to attack Fanatica.<br />
<br />
Another- 5 legions and 1 horse archer units abroad will be changed from going to Atrouia to Attacking Egypt. the remaining legion will be called home.<br />
<br />
The Nero's swordsman unit will be supported by DePaololand Province until they can support it themselves.</div></div><hr />

also as show in the above post, i role 6 more legions ;-)<br />

now to the controlling: <br />
<br />
i will change this now... following are the regiments and their commanders:<br />
<br />
the palace guard<br />

1st helenatican regiment<br />
commander: helena, to be replaced by a new commander soon<br />
units: 12 legions, 3 spearmen<br />
location: mobile field encampment near gorina.<br />
<br />
notice: the 1st helenatican regiment will be assigned to a new commander (as soon as someone applies for it) and be placed to defend fanatica in the war on the egyptians<br />
<br />
<br />
ooc@conflictmgmt:<br />
so it doesnt matter where my units are? what if someone attacks one of my cities. will all of my units on my territory be used to defend the city?<br />
<br />
also, i posted a request to find a leader for the 1st regiment. if i find noone, i will use secundus becchino (char. 16) as leader and primus becchino (char. 14) as his deputy (and the replacement if secundus dies). i will post in here before the next tc if i find a new leader or not.</div></div><hr />

Also, dis, so long as the units are present in the territory, they are everywhere (scary thought.  :p) in that territory.  Theoretically, then, all unit would be used to fend off one attack.  If you'd rather not risk some of those troops, I'd be glad to mark them as non-defenders.</div></div><hr />

ooc: i just wanted to make sure i understand it right. so i will skip troop assignments to cities now. what happens if my units go &quot;out of territory&quot;, for example over fanatican mainland soil with allowance? will that be treated like inside my territory? or will we calculate per tile then? or per &quot;territory tresspass&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i will split up the 1st helenatican regiment:<br />
<br />
the future helenatican military organization<br />
the helenatican army is controlled by a general.<br />
<br />
it is subdivided into corps which are lead by lt. generals.<br />
those are subdivided into divisions lead by major generals.<br />
<br />
<br />
current organization:<br />
general of the helenatican army: general rubinia lifespania<br />
<br />
the army is divided into the following corps:<br />
The Palace Guard<br />
controlled by the general himself<br />
The 1st Helenatican mobile Corps<br />
controlled by a Lieutenant General<br />
which consists of:<br />
--the 1st Helenatican Mobile Division<br />
--the 2nd Helenatican Mobile Division<br />
each controlled by a Major General<br />
<br />
the Positions and exact unit numbers will follow... this was a pre-announcement!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your territory is A, and you want to attack D.  Over one turn chat, units with movement one could move (but not attack from) territory B.  Units with movement 2 could move to territory C, but not attack, or move to territory B and attack.  Only a movement 4 unit could attack D during that one time period.<br />

You need other's permission to move through their territory, though.<br />

as helenatica is only a province of fanatica, does this enable the helenatican corps to moove inside the fanatican territory like in own territory? or what happens if i &quot;lent&quot; units to the despot as i do, can they then moove as in own territory? will roads be used like in civ?

2 horsemen and 4 horse-archers.<br />
<br />
2 horsemen go to a own squadron with a new commander<br />
2 of the horsmen go to each of our HMC-divisions<br />
<br />
we should have far enough shield+gold+food for those units.<br />
<br />
our army now looks like this:<br />
ORGANIZAION OF THE HELENATICAN ARMY<br />
<br />
HELENATICAN ARMY<br />
commander: general vendetta lifespania<br />
 contains: I  Corps (&quot;the palace guard&quot;)<br />
           II Corps (&quot;helenatican mobile corps&quot;)<br />
           <br />
I Corps (&quot;the palace guard&quot;<br />
commander: general vendetta lifespania<br />
    units: 3 legions, 8 spearmen<br />
 function: defense of helenatica<br />
<br />
II Corps (&quot;the helenatican mobile corps&quot;)<br />
commander: lieutenant general Arlena Gorinia<br />
    units: II-a support Squadron<br />
           II-b reconnaissance Squadron<br />

    units: 6 legions, 2 horse archers<br />
    <br />
II.2 armored division<br />
commander: major general Scrobius Pantonius<br />
    units: 6 legions, 2 horse archers<br />
<br />
<br />
this means we have 32 units.<br />
so we need to pay 32 food and 64 gold for support.<br />
<br />
the commanders and the unit count:<br />
general Vendetta Lifespania: 11 units<br />
lt. general Arlena Gorinia: 11 units<br />
mj. general Scrobius Pantonius: 8 units<br />
mj. Julius Aquarius: 2 units<br />
<br />
<br />
the I Corps will stay in defensive positions in helenatica.<br />
<br />
the II Corps will propably moove to the war against egypt, but from now on the commands of the II Corps will be posted by SJ=Arlena. So wait for his orders...<br />

<br />
The Blue is the second divison.<br />
The Red is the First Divison.<br />
The Green is the headquearters<br />
The Yellow is where the archers will stand when providing firecover...<br />
The Dark green is the spy divisions spot<br />
The White arrows are the attacking lines of the Jade Commandos<br />
<br />
The backer red and blue are their camps while the fron one are theire attack positions..<br />
<br />
A brief explanation to the picture: <br />
<br />
Both divisons will move forwards to theri attack positions when the attack is launched. The together 4 horse archers (and maby some more to come) will split up from the divsions and provide artillery cover at the yellow point. The battle will be commanded from the HQ at the green point. There will be 3 spears protecting the HQ. The Dark green is where the horsemen Julius command will be spread out. They are to take all who trie to escape the backway... The Jade commandos will engage their attack from the sides... They will squise them with brute force :)<br />
