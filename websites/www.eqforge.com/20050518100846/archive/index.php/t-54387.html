EDIT: Found the problem. Discussion/polling on debate revamp faded and nothing was decided on time for this election cycle. We'll hopefully have it for the next one.</div></div><hr />

That's what I thought too, but I guess CT had other ideas...</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. I believe it is good for new players to hold deputy and chat rep positions before jumping into Council positions. The lower Judiciary (JA, PD) positions and governor positions are great for newer players to get started out on.<br />
<br />
As for my views, I feel that city growth and estalishment is key early in this game so we should build, improve and connect as many cities as possible, and I feel I can be the one to do that. <br />
<br />
For Chief Justice, I feel I can bring fairness to Fanatica and I will be available for any questions about laws and such.<br />
<br />
Finally, if anyone wants to ask me any questions relating to my views, feel free to contact me in any way you feel is necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will post the same statement that I made in the noms thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
As President, I plan to:<br />
<br />
1. Involve everyone in the game as much as possible.  Newcomers to the DemoGame can always expect a response from me.  Also, I will encourage debate on all of our issues.<br />
<br />
2. Hold all leaders accountable for the office they hold.  Gaining office is more than just the prestige of having it; there is work involved as well.<br />
<br />
3. Stay involved in every aspect of the game.  Look at the Citizens Forum during term 1 and you see that I have participated in almost every thread.  This will only increase if I am elected President.<br />
<br />
There are aspects of the actual game as well, so as DP look for me to:<br />
<br />
4. Found more cities. We are trailing all of our rivals in cities founded, and have only one settler in our queues!  That is not a good sign.<br />
<br />
5. Quickly claim our borders against Egypt and America.  If we don't get the hills that separate us from Egypt, we are missing a great strategic opportunity.<br />
<br />
6. Connect the Iron now! We are a nation of warriors and it shows, because that is all we have militarily.  We should not wait 15 turns for Gorina to build a Temple.  We should colonize the Iron just outside its borders now.<br />
<br />
<br />
That should do for starters.  If anyone has any questions, please feel free to address them here and I will answer them.<br />
<br />
A special note to those just visiting(and casting votes) from other forums, including the RPG:<br />
<br />
You may have been invited here by someone, but please think about your vote and consider supporting a candidate that has proven his dedication to Fanatica's future.  Just as in RL, an uninformed vote undermines everything a democracy strives to achieve.<br />
<br />
Donovan Zoi for President<br />
<br />
Please give me voice so that all shall be heard.</div></div><hr />

(http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=1009317#post1009317)<br />
I am running for Trade (as well as CJ and PD)  Here is a trade specific speech:<br />
I would like to run for Trade Leader.  I believe that being Trade Leader will be a good experience for me, as it is probably one of the less active departments, especially at this point, but I think it will be good for someone with my experience level.  I can handle the job well, and would certainly do as well as the other candidates.  I have no Trade Department experience yet, but I will certainly work to build it.  I have served one term as the Culture Deputy, and I am a PSC board nominee.  I also have two terms of Public Defender experience.  In short, vote bootstoots for Trade Leader, I promise to do the best possible job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) I am running for only FA.<br />
<br />
2) The new players are our future. I was once a new player, like them. I found someone, though. Someone who took my ideas and made them grow (and refined them due to my lack of a PC). This helped my prosper in the DG and allowed me to become a &quot;veteran&quot; in DG2 (That and the Penguin PI). This person was Almightyjosh. I want to be an AJ to someone. Helping the new players is helping the future of our nation, because you never know who the next new player may end up.<br />
<br />
My Plans for Next Term:<br />
1) Expansion, Expansion, Expansion! I know this isnt my field, but its best to reiterate it.<br />
2) Gearing up for a war: We will be busy expanding, so we wont have time to go out and fight. We just need to gear up, and MABEY take up a war later in the term.<br />
Eventually:<br />
Kill Cleo<br />
<br />
Vote SaaM for FA</div></div><hr />

Well, just two: My beloved Trade Dept, and Culture Dept.<br />
<br />
2. Do you believe that established players should help newer players to get involved and get into office?<br />
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!  The more this happens in Fanatica, the better for our nation!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, Shluks SAaM  :blush: <br />
<br />
I am running for the position of Domestic Leader,  as well as that of Governor of Capitoline, roles, you will agree, that follow a certain pattern.  I believe that nation-building is the most important role for the Domestic Leader.  This may seem self-explanitory, but what it really means is two things. <br />
<br />
Firstly, the obvious, making sure everything runs smoothly in terms of the physical development of our nation, the workers, the cities, the provinces.  It requires both attention to detail and a whollistic 'vision' of progress.  I believe I have these.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the domestic department is in an exellent position to inolve new members.  It is the department with the most obvious, immediate control over the game.  It is in the auspices of the Domestic department that new players can most easily and immediately contribute, all it requires it good knowledge of how our world works, not nessisarialy of our government and laws.  I think the Dom Department should play a very active role in encouraging contribution from all citizens.  Some of the most comprahensive domestic proposals this term have come from very new players, and yet they don't get the airplay they should.<br />
<br />
I think the Domestic leader should be attentive to no only their own thread, but the provincial, and even city based, threads so as to gain the widest possible range of ideas and opinions.<br />
<br />
AJ</div></div><hr />

<br />
2, Im running for the Domestic Department and Judge Advocate. I have ast experience with the domestic department being part of it for a good portion of DG2. I think the direction of the domestic department ond the nation should be passive-agressive, by expanding our borders by culture yet also by war when it is deemed necessary. Domestic Department should work closely with the governors, science and military departments.<br />
<br />
2. Do you believe that established players should help newer players to get involved and get into office?<br />
<br />
Yes, for they are our near future leaders of the nation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">May 28, 2003, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am running for one office, Science Advisor.  My platform:<br />
<br />
 Learn stuff -- the faster the better<br />
 Advocate building libraries and universities<br />
 Don't make a clown to avoid disorder, if a scientist will do<br />
 Target research in paths away from the AI, and trade for the difference<br />
 Involve new citizens in the game<br />
 <br />
<br />
To answer the 2nd question, yes the seasoned citizens of Fanatica should do all in their power to help newcomers feel that they can contribute.  In a few terms I hope to be able to follow my own advice.  For now, if you're concerned about this issue choose me, for I am a newcomer!  :D</div></div><hr />
