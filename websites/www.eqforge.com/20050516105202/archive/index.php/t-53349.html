<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted this in the Capitoline provincial thread, but I wanted to post it here for discussion, as well.<br />
<br />
I wish to set forth a plan to determine classifications for each of our cities so that it is not necessary to poll build queues all the time.<br />
<br />
The current classifications are:<br />
<br />
Settler/worker factory<br />
<br />
This category will build nothing but settlers and units to escort them.  When needed it will also build workers.  These should be low production/high growth cities, and in some cases may need to construct a granary before being set on their 'path'.<br />
<br />
Metropolis<br />
<br />
The primary purpose of these cities will be to generate income, culture and science.  They may also be used to construct wonders, and in times of need, units.  This category will normally contain cities with good growth potential and good production.  They will also generally receive the most attention from our workers.<br />
<br />
Citadel<br />
<br />
The primary purpose of these cities will be to produce trained military units.  A barracks will be one of the first things constructed, and then just enough other buildings to maintain order.  After that, they will almost exclusively produce troops.  Ideal candidates will be cities with mediocre to low growth potential but the ability to produce a good number of shields with only a small population.<br />
<br />
Port<br />
<br />
The purpose of these cities will be to generate trade and science income, allow foreign trade via a harbor, and produce whatever naval vessels we need.  They should build a harbor relatively early on, and then focus on markets and libraries while building enough happiness improvements to maintain order.  These cities will obviously be coastal, with decent production capabilities and growth.  They should be optimized to have as many citizens as possible working the coastal squares, as these produce extra income.<br />
<br />
Border town<br />
<br />
These cities are those resting on a border with another civilization.  They will normally produce several cultural buildings early on, city walls, a barracks, and then can be switched to the Settler/worker factory classification.  They will serve mainly as upgrade points rather than troop production centers due to the fact that they will often experience high corruption.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good, eyrei.  :)  I think if we can determine a city's role early on, it will make build queues much less daunting than they need to be.<br />
<br />
My only addition would be that we require an approval poll for initial classification and change in classification of a city by that city's governor.  Also, it wouldn't hurt to have these classifications posted somewhere for reference.<br />
<br />
As for our cities, I believe that Noshuret is a definite Citadel, while Gorina should start as a Settler/worker factory and ease into Metropolis when the time comes.  Our upcoming city to the Southeast looks like it could be any one of those three classes, at any given time.  I also see at least two nice S/w factory sites to the south and southwest of Gorina.</div></div><hr />

Well, this is intended to be a tool for governors, nothing more.  I do intend to post classification polls for our cities soon, but I don't see any reason to require governors to do it this way.<br />
<br />
As far as classifying our current cities, I think we need to make either Gorina or Noshuret a metropolis, and start prebuilding for a wonder.  The other should serve as a settler factory for a while, and then switch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason I thought of Noshuret for a Citadel is because it is the capital and unfortunately cannot take part in a Palace pre-build.  Also, I don't think Noshuret's plains are bountiful enough to merit the loss of population for Settlers/workers.  Let's build our military here as it slowly gains population.  And once Gorina helps spawn our 4th and 5th cities(settler/worker factories), I would be glad to bump it up to Metropolis.<br />
<br />
As far as the classification polls, maybe I should have said preferred instead of required.  As a member of the Conservative Association and the Polling Standards Commission, I should know better.  ;)  As long as there is adequate discussion, it's fine by me.</div></div><hr />

/me wants a port for his city!</div></div><hr />

It will improve both the speed of the game and it will be more fun since we dont need to argue so much about building queues...</div></div><hr />

I'm also making an updated city map with other suggestions as well.</div></div><hr />

Ahh yes the Sword Gambit, I remembered the Good Old days :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would favor Noshuret as a metropolis because it already has a Palace to boost culture ratings. Gorina would do well as a Citadel, and our other two cities as a settler/worker factory and citadel or metropolis.</div></div><hr />

We should seriously consider this as a metropolis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many of our cities will become 100spt+ metropolises, but that's in some 200-300 turns from now. Stuck, remember what I told you about the size 12 thing? Any 20spt city at size 12 is pretty good. <br />
<br />
Gorina and Noshuret have a source of fresh water, so they can go up to size 12 (Noshuret won't grow as quickly though).</div></div><hr />
