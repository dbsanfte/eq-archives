people of fanatika! the revolution of italshuret was braught down!<br />
<br />
not by force, but by the mere power of the people. the counter-revolution showed that those illegal despots,<br />
Sergei Vissarus and his family (Royal/Co-Despot)<br />
Achilles DePaolo and his family (Royal/ Co-Despot)<br />
and their familes tried to rob and kill the fanatikan population by their cruel regime.<br />
<br />
The families were driven out of our nation, but we need more.<br />
As our former despot left the nation out of frustration about this revolution, i, his daughter, took over temporary controll to restore order.<br />
<br />
And i now need you, the fanatican people, to help us:<br />
Track Down, Hunt and destroy all of those false despots who try to govern you.<br />
<br />
Capture those illegal despots and bring them to the dungeons of Gorina for execution.<br />
<br />
Yours<br />
Despotess Bellona Lifespania</div></div><hr />
