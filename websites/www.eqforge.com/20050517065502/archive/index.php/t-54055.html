<br />
People of Fanatica!<br />
<br />
I herewith announce the long planned marriage between Caesar Jade and me, Bellona Lifespania.<br />
<br />
The Marriage will result in Caesar being the despot of fanatika and under full administrative controll of the nation... but under some preconditions he must met:<br />
<br />
1) All land claimings which are defined at the moment of the marriage must not be declined by the despot nor changed in any matter<br />
2) No additional fanatican soil shall be given to foreign nations in addition to the claims already proclaimed. The only exception is Atrousia.<br />
3) The ownings of the lifespania family line, called &quot;Hellenatica&quot; and be defined as province of fanatica, will remain in the family. The Jade Family will not be part of this heritage line.<br />
4) Only the direct descendants of Bellona and Caesar will be called Imperial. Not their further relatives.<br />
5) The Lifespania Family will be called Royal.<br />
6) Which of the descendants of this marriage belong to the Lifespanian Family Line will be defined by Bellona or Helena.<br />
7) Ceasar will adopt the name &quot;Flavinius Jadius Lifespanius Caeser&quot;<br />
8) Bellona will adopt the name &quot;Diutia Jadius Lifespanius Bellona&quot;<br />
9) The descendants of this marriage which belong to the lifespanian line will be called &quot;Jadius Lifespanius&quot;, the others will be called &quot;Jadius&quot; only.<br />
10) all units under controll of Helena and Bellona will remain under their controll. The despot has to raise new troops.<br />
<br />
<br />
OOC:<br />
this means in short: The lifespanian line will take all lands marked yellow. They will not be owned by the despot. The despot has full controll of the red marked areas as soon as we gain controll of them. He is also allowed to give them to other people (not nations!)<br />
All already defined &quot;claims&quot; remain intact.<br />
<br />
BELLONA:<br />
Caesar, will you comply to those conditions?</div></div><hr />

Hail, Caeser. I bring to you today my son and my daughter, both ripe for marrying. Is their anyone in your or Belonna's family that is in need of a mate? Both of my children are quick, smart and witty. Smith is a very persuasive person, but he has a problem with rules. Fortuna is loud and annoying at times, but she is a wonderful girl. It would please me greatly if either of my children were to marry into either family.<br />
Also, while I am here, I wish to gain ownership of the Horses of Noshuret. I have an idea to begin having them carry palace officials in carriages to speed up response time for a new wonder I have developed, Paperwork.<br />

<br />
Josephus: M'lord, I approach you this day with a proposition for the betterment of Fanatica.  As I'm sure you know, Great One, the populace is suffering from poverty and inequality.  They are poor and starving, abandoned by the high nobles who rule over them.  They have nothing to call their own, and are beginning to resent Your Majesty's Government for it.  But I believe I have a solution.  Allow me a parcel of land, small, perhaps 3 tiles.  I will allow the impoverished peasantry to live and work there, with the fruits of their labor of course going to the Government.  I will give them equality, which is what they desire most.  I will see to it that they are not poor and starving as they are now.  I am sure this will avert any peasant uprising that is sure to come with these miserable conditions.  Of course my land would answer to the Despot of Fanatica, and would in no way move to harm Fanatica like the other rogue states have.  What do you say, my liege?</div></div><hr />

Caesar Jade: I will do that, Josephus Strummerus.  Also, perhaps you would like to teach the court minstrels this new style of music you play?  And perhaps give the plans for the instrument to the court woodworkers?<br />

Dearest Caeser, i would like to suppose signing a major contract with our neighbors:<br />
<br />
1) our neighbors give us any resource they will have in their territory in the future for free<br />
2) our neighbors allow us free usage of their roads to pass through their ownings<br />
3) our neighbors pledge not to attack fanatican soil<br />
<br />
on the fanatican side:<br />
1) we allow our neighbors to use the barracs in fanatica<br />
2) we allow our neighbors to use our iron resource near gorina for troop upgrades<br />
<br />
what will not be included from the fanatican side:<br />
1) we will not include iron for private or business usage. the iron MUST be used for troop upgrades and nothing else<br />
2) we will only allow tresspassing of our soil on a case by case descission<br />
<br />
i think you should officially write this down and go to negotiations with our neighbors.<br />
<br />
if they dont comply, we should immediately stop delivery of the resource (in case of atrouia) or not deliver at all (in case of the ONSS).<br />

U shouldnt trust them and dont give them land. U should take all of civs land away from him as he just said this: &quot; I have been taking down countries left and right&quot;<br />
<br />
I say that u should take him down before he gets bigger and attacks u. About the tiles, I would like to have the tiles surounding the doughnautia thingy city. (maby its expansion as well.) It would be a region of fanatica as U are the only guy I can trust that u wont attack me. Plexus probably wont neither but anyway. I would be very glad if u did this for me as we have cooparated so many times before. As I have no land in the moment Im only lower gentry (AFAIK. Or am I still imperial? Not sure about this). If Im lower gentry as I belive I am it would be nice to get an upgrade to high noble or royal. U know that I would do this for u. :D <br />

the regiment consists atm of 12 legions, 3 spearmen. the number of units may be increased later on if the charisma of the leader will be higher. but as we did not yet decide on the character leading the forces, i need to wait.</div></div><hr />
