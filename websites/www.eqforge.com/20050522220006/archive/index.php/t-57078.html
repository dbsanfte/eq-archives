President<br />
Domestic Leader<br />
Military Leader<br />

<br />
It is also an opportunity for you the citizens to ask them questions and in general make them work hard for your vote.  <br />
<br />
The election office has a number of questions it would like the candidates to answer in order to help the citizens decide who is the most worthy.<br />
<br />
<br />
1). Why are you standing for this position?<br />
2). Why are you standing for other positions too?<br />
3). What are your objectives for the first 7 days of office?<br />
4). What qualities can you bring to this position that your fellow candidates cant?<br />
5). How will you get more people involved in the game?<br />
6). If you have held office before, what was your greatest triumph and worst disaster?<br />
7). Which method of victory do you want to pursue and why?<br />
8). How have you contributed to this game?<br />
<br />
Please take the time to answer these and have fun debating. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I come before you, the people of Fanatica, seeking the office of Domestic Leader.  I'm not a great speaker, and anyway think that actions and accomplishments are the true measure of a leader, above flowery speech.  Not to mention I'm nowhere near as creative as those who frequent the RPG...  ;)<br />
<br />
So here is my platform, without adornment, or as little as I can get away with. :)<br />
<br />
1). Why are you standing for this position?<br />
<br />
This office has stood empty for much of the current term, and our nation has suffered from indecision.  I think the key role of the DL is to coordinate the strategic use of resources, and we have sadly been lacking in coordination.  By contrast, the President's role (other than as DP) seems more like being the visionary, weighing in with an opinion and providing thought leadership, and the other leaders are tightly focused on their respective areas.<br />
<br />
2). Why are you standing for other positions too?<br />
<br />
I stongly believe that there should be at least two candidates for each elective office, so that a deputy will be available in the case of a leader's absense.  The other position (Governor of Capitolene) had only one candidate at the time I volunteered for it.  And it doesn't hurt to have a backup plan... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
3). What are your objectives for the first 7 days of office?<br />
<br />
We are at a critical juncture, where the immediate strategic decisions will determine whether we can proceed with the victory condition the people want, or if we are forced into some other objective.  It is also a time of tremendous growth.  We start this term with three times as many provinces as last term.<br />
<br />
My immediate objectives are to lead the decisions on immediate strategy (Education vs. Gunpowder, and Monarchy vs. Republic) if they have not already been made, and then position us to implement those strategies in the most efficient way possible.  In particular, coordinating the build queues of the various provinces to get an overall strategic mix needs to be a top priority.<br />
<br />
4). What qualities can you bring to this position that your fellow candidates cant?<br />
<br />
Let's leave it at the qualities I'll bring to the position, at least for now.  :)<br />
<br />
This is my 3rd term in the Demogame, (browsed the DG2 forums, saw that the game was nearly over, and waited until DG3 to sign up).  As such, I'm still fresh and in no danger of burning out by doing the same thing over again.  For me it is the first time, and thus I put my best into it.<br />
<br />
5). How will you get more people involved in the game?<br />
<br />
One somewhat random idea would be to seek out applicants for a &quot;projections&quot; office, to look at our growth potential and forecast what population cities will max out at, how many shields / commerce they will produce, and maybe corruption levels.  This would be producing highly valuable information about where cultural improvements are needed.<br />
<br />
6). If you have held office before, what was your greatest triumph and worst disaster?<br />
<br />
I hold the Science Leader position now.  My greatest triumph has to be getting elected in the first place, as I never expected to even come in 2nd.  :D  Worst disaster is not having any scientific buildings constructed yet, due to the war effort.<br />
<br />
7). Which method of victory do you want to pursue and why?<br />
<br />
I haven't won culturally yet on Monarch, so that would be cool.<br />
<br />
8). How have you contributed to this game?<br />
<br />
Science Leader, member of PSC poll review board, attend some (but not all) chats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am pleased to Anounce that the Science Debate in the #debates room whent realy well :).<br />
<br />
We had 2 Special Guests from Apolyton sitting in and asking our Canidates questions.<br />
<br />
May I present to you. The Science Debate Chat Log<br />
<br />
Note: Mara_Jade is actualy CG, think of Shaitan_indesguise ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I ran through these questions in the Debate, I didn't have much time to consider them. I thought I'd give more detailed answers here.<br />
<br />
1). Why are you standing for this position? <br />
<br />
In the Debates I claimed we needed a new course of action. I was actually referring to Demogame 1 and 2 when I said this. We are currently technologically advanced and I feel our current Science leader, d8575 is doing fine, and I believe his current goals parallel mine.<br />
<br />
2). Why are you standing for other positions too?<br />
N/A<br />
<br />
3). What are your objectives for the first 7 days of office?<br />
Polling the citizens. I believe the current administration will determine that our next short term goal will be Education. Our long term goal is a Spaceship Victory. I will set Education a our default path along the Tech Tree and try to determine through polling if that course should change throughout the length of the Term.<br />
<br />
4). What qualities can you bring to this position that your fellow candidates cant?<br />
As I said in the Debates, a fresh approach to the way our Science Department is run. Again, I'm referring to the methods used previously by my fellow candidates in other Demogames. I can remeber when they ran this Department without actually having a copy of Civ3. :) Those were the days.<br />
<br />
5). How will you get more people involved in the game?<br />
I'm not sure this question is related to the Science Department. We are technologically advanced. Perhaps experienced leadership would bring in a couple of people, but that's a long shot.<br />
<br />
6). If you have held office before, what was your greatest triumph and worst disaster? <br />
In the Debates, I talked about my stint as Domestic Leader in DG1, but now that I think about it, my greatest triumph (IMHO) is the training and help that I have been able to bring new players in the DG experience. This list would include Octavian X, EA, Fionn, Zarn, CG, and Rik Meleet. There are others, but I can't think of them right now. Oh, yeah, Almightyjosh and Justice II. I feel that in helping new players learn the Demogame, I am participating the best way I can. I answered the Failure part in the Debate.<br />
<br />
7). Which method of victory do you want to pursue and why?<br />
I would go for Spaceship because that's the will of the people. Unofficially, I'm a Culture guy, so that's what I always go for.<br />
<br />
8). How have you contributed to this game?<br />
I gave a fairly lenghty answer in the Debates, so I'll just say that beyond being a very vocal citizen on issues I am concerned with (just ask Stuck), I am currently the Mayor of Gorina, the best city in the world (IMHO). :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falcon02</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1). Why are you standing for this position?<br />
<br />
I'm best at Military matters, and most of my Demogame Experience has been in Military matters.<br />
<br />
2.) Why are you standing for other positions too?<br />
<br />
N/A<br />
<br />
3). What are your objectives for the first 7 days of office?<br />
<br />
To Ensure that our Troops are properly Distrubuted and to Fight the odds to ensure that Memphis and Elephantine won't Flip.<br />
<br />

<br />
Experience, I was Military Leader DG1 for every term except for Term 1.  and several terms (2-3) in DG2<br />
<br />
5). How will you get more people involved in the game?<br />
<br />
By Ensuring that I follow the people's will with polls and various discussion threads, and attempt to foster creative stories among the citizens.<br />
<br />
6). If you have held office before, what was your greatest triumph and worst disaster?<br />
<br />
Greatest Triumph - DG1 the Domino War, finishing off the Egyptians and Americans.<br />
<br />
Worst Disaster - 5 Legions dieing to a Sword on a Hill while going against the Egyptians during this Demogame.<br />
<br />
7). Which method of victory do you want to pursue and why?<br />
<br />
Space, maybe Culture.  While I'm a Military guy I'm not a fan of just rampaging across the countryside.  I feel a Spaceship Victory is the &quot;coolest&quot; and most fit Victory for an intellectual Civilization such as our own.<br />
<br />
8). How have you contributed to this game?<br />
<br />
Military leader during this passing term, waging the war against the Egyptians and Fighting to try to make sure Memphis doesn't flip back to the Egyptians after we lost so many lives taking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1). Why are you standing for this position?<br />

<br />
Currently I am running for PD and Military Leader, Mostly I am consentrating on winning the Presidency<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />

The only Greatest Triump was actualy winning an office ;). Seriously, my greatest achivement was in the last DG, I have helped brought down several civs.<br />
<br />
7). Which method of victory do you want to pursue and why?<br />
<br />
I am more of a &quot;Supprise me&quot; kind of persion. I am hoping for a spaceship victory, just to go in a different track<br />
<br />
8). How have you contributed to this game?<br />
<br />
I have made Several maps. I am currently part of the Election and the Chat Office. I have contributed my Military Skills in the past to ensure victory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FionnMcCumhall</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1). Why are you standing for this position?<br />
<br />
I am running for president and Domestic Leader. Ive only run for president once and lost badly but i feel that id like to try my hand at being president for once and see if i've got what it takes to be the commander-in-chief.<br />
<br />
2). Why are you standing for other positions too?<br />
<br />
Im standing for Domestic Leader because this past term has been left to wither and die with one domestic leader resigning and the other not on that much. Even tho i couldve stepped in to run the office it was too late by the time i found out we were leaderless and i was domestic deputy ( No PM was sent and i was studying for finals :))<br />
<br />
3). What are your objectives for the first 7 days of office?<br />
<br />
Run polls on what to change in the nation of Fanatica domesticly. Open up the new cartographic office and hire map-makers. Aggrassive expansion to the west of the nation to claim wheat, gold, and horses, also the possibilities of Rubber, coal, and uranima in those maountains. Expand west to claim the iron, horse, cattle and dye. And finally expand Northwest to claim the last iron giving us a huge surplus and reserves just in case we lose one source of iron. Domestic will also work closely with Culture and the Military to get a mix ofinfrastructure and defense (and offense;))As president i would try to work with the leaders to establish some order among the ranks.<br />
<br />
4). What qualities can you bring to this position that your fellow candidates cant?<br />
<br />
I've been domestic leader before, along with deputy, been the chat representative and am now currently iterim domestic deputy.<br />
5). How will you get more people involved in the game?<br />
<br />
Open up the Cartographic Office, and appoint 3 map-makers for the country to map out the world<br />
6). If you have held office before, what was your greatest triumph and worst disaster?<br />
<br />
i dont think ive had a triumph yet, but my worst disaster was the whole plan a nonsense from DG2<br />
7). Which method of victory do you want to pursue and why?<br />
<br />
I prefer spaceship or conquest this game<br />
<br />
8). How have you contributed to this game?<br />
<br />
As of yet ive only made a flag for the game and am now interim domestic deputy. I was Judge Advocate for term 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1). Why are you standing for this position?<br />
<br />
At this stage I believe our country needs an experienced leader as President.<br />
<br />
2). Why are you standing for other positions too?<br />
<br />
I am only running for President.  :)<br />
<br />
3). What are your objectives for the first 7 days of office?<br />
<br />
Two turn chats.  :D<br />
<br />
4). What qualities can you bring to this position that your fellow candidates cant?<br />
<br />
Experience.  I was president for one term in DG1.  I've run quite a few chats including the victory chat in DG1.  I've also been quite heavily involved in the fine tuning of our constitution and have served two terms as Chief Justice in DG3   My opponents lack both presidential and judicial experience.<br />
<br />
5). How will you get more people involved in the game?<br />
<br />
By bringing the focus of the demogame back to the forums.<br />
<br />
6). If you have held office before, what was your greatest triumph and worst disaster?<br />
<br />
My greatest triumph?  That's a toss up.  It was either building the National Railway System in DG1 or surviving PI#6 in DG1.  :D<br />
<br />
My greatest disaster was bungling the turn chat which led to PI#6!<br />
<br />
7). Which method of victory do you want to pursue and why?<br />
<br />
Personally I'd be happy with anything other than conquest or domination.  I'd like to play a peaceful game, once we get a good sized base established.<br />
<br />
8). How have you contributed to this game?<br />
<br />
My main contribution to DG3 has been realized through my seat on the judiciary.  My colleagues and I have consistanly upheld our citizens right to elect leaders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1). Why are you standing for this position?<br />
I believe that in the late-war days and the new area of peace attention should shift to our long-term goals. The Esquiline Province can play a key part in this. But we are surrounded by enemies and settlers. I know I can be the one who can 'fill esquiline province' and turn it into the cultural and financial heartland. <br />
2). Why are you standing for other positions too?<br />
To enhance the spirit of the game that for every office there should be at least 2 and preferably 3 candidates.<br />
3). What are your objectives for the first 7 days of office?<br />
To build the Great Esquiline Canal and claim land deep to the west. Also build roads to the peninsula to speed up our settlers. <br />
4). What qualities can you bring to this position that your fellow candidates cant?<br />
I keep my promisess, I allowed provincial politics so everyone has a say in how things are run. I can quickly view the possibilities and threats and I present my points-of-view with humor.<br />
5). How will you get more people involved in the game?<br />
I have a link to Esquiline province in my signature. I post on other parts of the CFC forum. I have nominated people (Beware of gnomes) who have registered in the citizens reg, have proven their skills and post regurarly on CFC.  <br />
6). If you have held office before, what was your greatest triumph and worst disaster?<br />
The 2 weeks of Esquiline are too short for real successes and disasters. A success is the election percentage. Another is the awareness I created to see the urgency in which we have to fill Esquiline Province to secure a safe backyard. <br />
7). Which method of victory do you want to pursue and why? I want the victory voted for earlier; Space race. This is a victory I hardly see in my own games. I usually win on culture.<br />
8). How have you contributed to this game?<br />
I have assisted the Mayor of Gorina; Cyc, to make the city of Gorina a pearl in the crown of our Fanatikan nation. I have posted my points-of-view on a wide area of topics. I join the TC whenever I can, I have made plans and posted them. I have voted in nearly every poll. I have nominated several people for offices including our (soon to be ex-) President. I've made clear that we should stop the Egytian war on sveral occasions and only now, perhaps too late, my countrymen are realising we've stopped too late. <br />
<br />
Rik Meleet<br />
Governor of Esquiline province term 2<br />
Governor of Esquiline province term 3 if you want it !<br />
<br />
sorry, I only saw after I posted that Governors weren't supposed to be included</div></div><hr />
