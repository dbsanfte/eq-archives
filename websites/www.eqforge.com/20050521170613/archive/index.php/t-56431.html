<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome. I am Grand Master Anthony, and I bring you Romanate. It is a skill of self-defence and fighting, and is very useful. Come, I will show you what you ned to know.<br />
<br />
When you start, you will begin with a White Belt. To advance, you need to master your Kata's and Fighting. Each time you succeed, you gain a stripe. You need to accumulate stripes to advance in Ranking. As a matter of fact, here are the rankings:<br />
<br />
White (Beginner) [6 stripes to advance]<br />
Yellow (Novice) [6 stripes to advance]<br />
Green (Intermediate) [6 tripes to advance]<br />
Brown (Advanced) [6 stripes to advance]<br />
Black (Expert) [10 stripes to advance]<br />
Red &amp; White (Master) [10 stripes to advance]<br />
Blood Red (Grand Master) [Final Belt {Very hard to achieve}]<br />
<br />
As you can see, you need stripes to advance. When you advance you do not throw away your previous belt. You must keep it, so when you go to achieve Black Belt, you need all previous belts.<br />
<br />
Romanate also exhibits self-control, and discipline to your superiors. If you disobey, you may lose a stripe. Also, if you fail to remember your Kata in 7 days, your belt is revoked for 7 days, and you cannot gain any status. To retrieve your belt, you must perform a Boonka, a Kata with 2 people, and some fighting. If you pass, you receive your belt. If you fail, you receive your belt with 1 less stripe.<br />
<br />
About weapons: Once you achieve Advnaced Ranking, you start work with the hand sickle. At Advanced [4 stripes] you learn to use the Escrima. At Expert you start learning how to use The bow properly. At Black Belt [2 stripes] you learn to use the sai (thre pronged knife). AT Black Belt [4 tripes] you learn to use the katana (samurai sword), a most deadly and powerful weapon. It is light, but not easy to handle correctly. At Black Belt [6 stripes] you learn to use the Dai-Katana.<br />
<br />
Blocking and Evading: In Romanate, you are to fight without anger. Anger blinds you, and a blind fighter is a dead fighter.<br />
In order not to anger yourself, you must concentrate. Concentrate your energy to muscles all your muscles. With this energy, you can move quickly. But, this requires practice, and alot of it. This skill is called Budakai. Meditation every day is required to master it, and only Masters and Grand Masters can acheive this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Master Alia: Ok. To get your third stripe, you must correctly present your Kata, and then you must Fight an opponent. If you fight worthy enough, you will get a stripe. If you present your Kata correctly, you will get another stripe. Is this clear?<br />
<br />
Another thing:<br />
When fighting, you will get points. you must get 5-10 points, depending on the match. here is the Point Sheet:<br />
<br />
Kicks<br />
Kick to torso: 2 points<br />
Kick to back: 1 point<br />
Kick to head: No points. Matched stopped to check if everyone is ok.<br />
Kick to shoulder: 0 points<br />
<br />
All punches are 1 point each.<br />
<br />
Honor<br />
If the opponent is injured, you must face your corner on your knees until a judge taps your shoulder to resume the fight.<br />
<br />
Remember to fight to the full extent of your skills...</div></div><hr />
