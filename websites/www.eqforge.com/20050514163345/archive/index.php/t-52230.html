:nono: for history you have to wait for writting, at least. For a &quot;proper school&quot; you'll need education, unless of course you want something like the academy in ancient Greece, for that, wait for math and writting. Natural history? until Railroad (Darwin)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 03, 2003, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, you CAN have history. Just use symbols. We have the Alphabet.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/DG3RPG_BC4000.jpg<br />
<br />
The first symbol is a despot, or ruler (the object represents the object that the despot is known by - a valued possession for example).<br />
The 2nd is land, which is shown as 3 green bars. There's 3 sets of them.<br />
The 3rd is a lake (1 line is a river).<br />
4th is a hand = a possesion.<br />
<br />
Translated: The ruler owns 3 pieces of land.<br />
<br />
The 4th is a new sentence - for a commoner, or peasent. (villager)<br />
the triangle (5th) is a promotion symbol, and the line in the middle means by 1.<br />
<br />
Translated: The villager was promoted a rank.<br />
<br />
(had it been a gentry, then the gentry was promoted to high gentry).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 03, 2003, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">History = His story. History went all the way back to cave paintings and drawings. If someone talked about his painting to his family and friends, he was teaching them. Philosophical discussions always existed. when two cavemen got together to split roasted rabbit, and pointed to the sky when lightening struck close by, they where having a philosophical discussion. Verbal recollection of the past and things that are present or might be in the future have always been around.<br />
<br />
First you people say you want less rules, then you slam things that others want to do claiming newly made up and bogus rules. <br />
<br />
How do you think any form of higher government came to be before someone stood up and said &quot;this is philosophy&quot;? People sat down and examine the past and the present and set up a philosophical structure to suppose what might be in the future, no matter how brief that time lapse may be.<br />
<br />
Quit making rules.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Ah, Sage Briefus, thank you&quot; says Atrous. &quot;I guess you've heard the news of being granted the title of Baron. You've done very well for yourself in the short term I've known you. I trust the welfare of my children to you and your beautiful wife, Katra. Their future lies in your hands, as well as those of their new teacher, Izcoatl. I will also seek recommendations from you when called for, please be available. Give my best to your wife...&quot;<br />
<br />
Baron Briefus looks up at his Leader, &quot;Thank you, Sage Atrous.&quot; He then rises and turn to leave. What a great day, he thinks to himself, plans must be made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diutius led the grand procession to the door of Atrous to receive his bride. Flower petals lie at the feet of citizens from all castes as the lined the streets and filled the plaza to watch the ceremony. <br />
<br />
All had gone well and after the agreements were stamped, Diutius displayed the ring. Everyone had expected a ring of intricately woven hemp, but knowing the wisemen of Fanatica, Diutius kept up with modern technology. This was a ring of bronze, the first ever to be used in a marraige ceremony. In it were carved the letters representing the words of &quot;sempiterna amor&quot;. All eyes were on the ring.<br />
<br />
Diutius looked at Helena and with a humble voice says &quot;Without beginning, without end...&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowds erupted with a cheer that was heard for miles. The ceremony had ended and it was time for the feast. Sage Atrous gave his blessing and transferred authority of Helena to Diutius. Briefus and Katra look on with pride. Helena looks to the skies in search of her mothers eyes. All is well in Noshuret. <br />
<br />
Diutius and Helena are wisked away by the royal guards in the guise of the procession. Most of the royal family has left the feast for private gatherings, leaving the feast to the citizens.</div></div><hr />

Before his death he burdened my life with a mission, to come here, to you and join your council, to continue the work he had begun. He and I are one now...

Diutius then again seeks an audiance with Sage Atrous. &quot;I come to you now with all due respect as the father of my bride, chief council of the Rouge Sage, and Despot of Fanatika. As you well know, Helena and I will be moving to Gorina, the great city to the Southwest, in which we as a couple share future holdings. I am here to seek your approval of my proclamation as Proconsul of Gorina. We wish to govern the city in your name, to help bring your rule to new lands. To place your doctrine on the new Settler groups that will leave Gorina for the creation of new cities, yet unkown. Please, Sage Atrous, allow me to be your Proconsul in Gorina. I will serve you well.<br />
<br />
Also, even though I have felt as an honorary member all my life, I wish to join the ranks of the Nacarat Order in the Rouge Sage. I would be honored to have this Order of Sages represented in the government of Gorina, again in your name. That is all, my liege. I seek your favor in these two areas. Please take your time as I shall await your response.&quot; He then rises, bows slightly and leaves. On his way out, he nods at his father, who smiles back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must go now, for I am to arrange for a statue made of bronze to be made of your image. We will take it to Gorina with us, and place it before our Palace, so that each day we will be reminded of your glory.&quot;<br />

She takes off her moccasins and is delighted to see a large boquet of flowers from Helena and Diutius. She is glad that the odd language which seems to have been conved to her through the trees has brought sunshine to the hearts of the newlyweds. She is also glad that she dosent have to wear this friggin Tiara unless she is at any and all court functions. She goes to the next hut over to see her sons and their children and considers herself lucky to have lived so long. With that, she takes Kate with her and begins teaching her how to maniplulate men and speak with a proper Roman accent.<br />

(OCC- I know this had nothing to do with anything, but it hadnt been since 2AM EST that there had been a post here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 12, 2003, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Briefus enters the chambers of Sage Atrous and asks to speak with him privately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sage Atrous, I have troubling news. It seems we may have opposing forces on the far SW horizon, beyond the mountains. These forces are lead by an enemy that Fanatica has seen before, an enemy which may only be known to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage Atrous is very elderly, yet remains competant. He sits up in his throne and thinks a moment, a finger held against his chin. &quot;Hmmm, only known to me you say...it must be a very old aquaintance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Briefus moves closer to the Despot. &quot;I have just received word from my son, Prince Diutius, that some of his men have been approached while stationed in Gorina. The message says these agents of the enemy say that an attack is eminent and that his men were asks to aboandon their oaths to you and join forces with the enemy. These agents are looking for traitors, who will swear loyalty to our foes.&quot; Briefus checks the room visually... &quot;We must send covert agents into the Gorina lands to weed out these solicitors of evil. We must also do that here in Noshuret. We must also put together strong armies of Warriors, Archers, and Spearmen to send to Gorina to stop the attack before it reaches the Capital.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage Atrous grows impatient. Yes, yes, yes. I agree, contact Gontskius Maximillian II. He's Leader of the Jade Commandos. He will muster our forces, and our land owners must raise troops also....but tell me now, who is this enemy?<br />
<br />
Briefus moves closer still, &quot;The message says it is none other than Nero Viviano, cousin of the previos Despot, Markus Viviano. I fear only you know him well enough to anticipate his moves. Word has it he is still in command of his facilities but is over-come by his hatred of our Empire because his did not fare as well. I've heard tales of when his father broke away from the rest of our tribe and swore to start his own Empire. Obviously his plans did not come to fruition.<br />
<br />
I realize you are tired my liege, and do not want a war. But it will be coming our way soon. We need you to tell us about him and use your wisdom to foresee his motives and military plans. We need you to grant us armies, so that we may defend your honor. The people await you Sage Atrous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once again, Briefus approaches Sage Atrous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sage Atrous, I come to you now as student and friend, as a servant and comrade, as a peer and as family. You have ruled this land mercifully, and with vision. You have listened as well as you have spoken. Your people support you and adore you. I am proud to be one of your citizens. <br />
<br />
We both grow old now.Our days are soon to pass. I come to you now, for the first time, to ask for land. I see that you have given Diutius and Helena the 12 lots of land in and around Gorina. I ask that you grant me the rights to the three hills that separate their lands and Noshuret. In my last remaining days, I shall raise troops to combat Nero Viviano. After I pass, I would like to leave control of the hills to Marcus, my second son. This will not only solidify their place in History, but also help to bring them together as they would own lands adjacent to one another. Grant me these rights, Sage Atrous, and you shall have both Diutius and Marcus fighting for you against the Viviano clan. I too, will join the battle&quot; says Briefus as he lowers his head.</div></div><hr />

There is to be a double wedding for my twins, Marcus and Mellita.<br />
Marcus will be marrying Ribeena, daughter of Maximillian Gontskius II. Mellita will be marrying Walter, son of Lauren.<br />

The wedding will be held immediately, so as to get on with the conflict. May they all be happy...</div></div><hr />

Arrangements were made, preparations were done, and the logistics of the Double Wedding started to come together.<br />
<br />
All of the Sages from all of the different Orders were in attendance. Any Nobles still in town were sure to be there. It was a great event, even if it was in the shadow of the threat of a barbarian attack. Briefus Lifespanius and his wife Katra were brought in to the ceremony, although their state of mind since Atrous had passed on was one of non-involvement.<br />
<br />
The ceremony went as planned, without a hitch. Brass rings were now commonplace among the Nobility, and were handed (pun intended) out appropriately. Flowers were strewn everywhere as Mellita along with her new husband Walter Roberts, and Marcus along with his new bride Ribeena strode off to the customary gathering after a wedding. A small feast was held for those who attended.<br />
<br />
The next day, Katie and Gontskius Maximillian II left for Gorina. The newlyweds took a brief vacation.</div></div><hr />
