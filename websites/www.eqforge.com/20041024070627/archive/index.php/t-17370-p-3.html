Instead, this month the Empire has started to mass produce the Korriban Gunship, a new model of Frigate based on the blueprints of the Corellian Gunship kindly provided by our Republican friends. Given the fact that they are superior in every aspect to our proposed carracks, it wasn't hard to make the decision. Long live the Alliance!</div></div><hr />

Our dark Jedi are so skilled with the force they &quot;willed&quot; entire armies to be torn apart limb from limb.

Byebye, Correlian sector. <br />
<br />
I don't know, Koby might be able to save your ass down there.  I hope at least by now he'll realize that all this talk about Byss was a complete bluff.  I must have used battlefield deception at least four times in this game and you two still haven't figured out my style.  Judging by the defenses you had in Sienar and Tralus (and your lack of a counterattack from Corellia), you must have bought it hook line and sinker.  My thanks! :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had suspected you weren't really going to attack him but I hadn't prepared for your attack on me.<br />
<br />
Aw damn.  Well I just expected more forces if you didn't fall for it.  Actually I was planning on going for Byss just after Spira battles, but it just didn't seem worth it.  Plus I only knew I could beat the minefields, I was to damn lazy to take a minute and see if I could beat the planet itself.  When I finally did I moved my fleet south.<br />
<br />

<br />
According to SP wargames the forces I have are more than enough to destroy several Ion Cannon (if I'm willing to accept losses, which I am with that double-digit number of ISD's) and you can't have more than two there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can confirm that we concluded you'd never attack Byss more than a year ago (and wouldn't have succeeded beyond destroying the mine fields even if you had tried ) but I really didn't expect the Corelian sector to be so lightly defended. <br />
<br />
I haven't read any reports of Republic capital ships being destroyed (unlike the poor Empire) since the game started so I assume the main Republic fleet is still intact, probably located too far from Corellia to help immediately.</div></div><hr />

As I said before, you don't have the tech level to take byss. Even if you jumped a dozen jedi over to by pass the minefields, they would just get slaughtered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
I had originally planned to use Tralus and Selonia as buffer zones, lightly defended.  Corellia was my main central defense station.  I had just gotten around to scrapping this plan in favor of a better plan, when Darius attacked.  Silly me.  It won't be like this in the other game, you'd better belive me! ;) <br />
<br />
I'll probably liberate it anyway unless you completely take it, including Alderaan.  I deem that to be impossible as my mobile fleet is expected to arrive soon.</div></div><hr />

:lol: You're kidding right?  They're two out of a dozen.  Furthermore I deliberately put them there to take the brunt of any attacks from your southern cities.  Then you'd make your ship(s) visible and I'd attack them.  Spectacular.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I'm not kidding.  I killed 2 Imperators with one gunship.  That's 2 out of maybe SIX at the most from my recon with a unit that you killed a turn or two ago.  You would have needed them, to capture the Correlian sector.  Too late now, though.  <br />

Hey Einstein, you can't see inside Tralus. ;)  Not to mention the ships still in transit to the battle from Spira and New Alsakan.  <br />
<br />
Accept it, I WILL take the Corellian sector.  I'm pretty sure I won't be able to hold it sandwiched between the two of you, but I certainly will at least take it, and you'll get it back but only find rubble.</div></div><hr />

A TIE bomber sqaudron discovered while our attack squadrons were forming up was also dispatched to Hades.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, infuriated by the inappropriate naming of an Imperium settlement in the Core Worlds, the Emperor has finally sanctioned the use of lowly hit and run tactics and one enemy terraforming unit has been destroyed. To quote our suicide Jedi &quot;Insignificant compared with to power of the FORCE&quot;.<br />
<br />
This month, the Empire has also developed VERY LARGE SCALE SHIELDING to protect ourselves against the extra-galactic invaders and TIE BOMBER to replace our aging (but effective) Y-wing squadrons. The Emperor invities our Republic Allies to 'share' in the fruits of our discoveries.<br />

<br />
Anyways:<br />
<br />
- Only one y-wing shot down near Corellia.  My major mistake was that I ordered the attack on Tralus before my fleet was completely assembled.  I have twenty air squadrons of various types on their way in three carriers, but I had the Jedi and Imperators lying around so I moved forward before I was mobilized. :o  Anyhow, I don't see how you two are virtually celebrating.  You've shot out a few meaningless meat ships (hardly worth calling the &quot;Battle of Corellia&quot; :rolleyes: ), and act like you've won?  All losses in the Corellian sector have already been absorbed, and then some.  Don't underestimate the Imperium! :nono: :nono: :nono: <br />
<br />
- Chamble's heavier defenses destroyed; only a few infantry batallions remain there.<br />
<br />
- While I didn't care to announce it (and Ohwell apparently didn't consult Yoda about it), I've had VLS shielding for several turns.  :p   As a result, even if I lose at the gates of Corellia I'll still have Tralus permanently.</div></div><hr />

You need X-wings (which I have) or frigates (which I have) to kill them. Coral Skippers will do the job too if you can get your hands on some. TIEs by definition are not atmospheric craft.<br />

As it is, I have been unable to get pass your sixth sense and have had setbacks everytime I got near to your major planets. Didn't wan't to let you in on the secret needlessly but now that you are going for frigates, there's no reason not to use the tactic now before it becomes useless.<br />

But I'm not studying frigates and I have no intent to; I just said that it would take seven turns, or perhaps more if I have to wait for another research to finish before beginning to study frigates. <br />

The ability to bombard heavy defenses. ;)  That's why my focus has been on Imperators and strike craft; my focus is on beating Ion Cannon and Turbo Lasers, not on destroying enemy ships.  You're never going to get anywhere just destroying ships.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, from SP I find them really weak.  Unless there's something wrong with my rules file, they almost never defeat a veteran Imperator (and all of mine are veterans) when they aren't veteran.  For that matter that's why I was surprised Ohwell killed two vet ISD's with one gunship.</div></div><hr />

We're on the defensive cause of our smaller territory and lower industrial capacity. So what we need are cost-effective ships. The CG is sort of a poor man's combo capitalship-carrier.<br />
<br />
Koba-BOS says that the CG will kill an Imperator 60% of the time (not adjusting for veterancy) and have half its hit points left. Probability that it kills a second imperator is about 25%.<br />
<br />
Looks like I made a boo boo and forgot to set the Aegis flag for CGship. Or did I for some reason purposely not give it Aegis? Its not called XYZ frigate but its got the white F letter and (Fg) next to its name so it should . :mad: now I'll have to research carrack and lancer as well.<br />

Maybe I should release a patch after this game is over.</div></div><hr />

I told you again and again, quit assuming about me, but no!  Well, now the galaxy is rejoicing as it hears the first reports, the glorious armies of the Imperium have marched into CORELLIA!!! :evil:<br />
<br />
- After numerous suicidal attacks by our veteran Jedi and ATT Battletanks, one of the lawless Rebels' finest jewels is now finally put under control by our troops.  Many of our finest tank crews and evil Jedi are now firmly defending the planet.  As usual, our ambitious generals pressed the attack earlier than planned, and therefore our fleet is still far behind, trying to catch up.  If Corellia really was to be the sector's linchpin as you touched on, then we can assume taking Talus and Drall will just involve getting there.<br />
<br />
- Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, Imperial storm troops marched for the third time into Bacrana, finally sealing the fate of the Chamble sector. <br />
<br />
- Our domestic advisers are proud to report that the systems under our jurisdiction are experiencing a population boost unprecedented in the galaxy's history, as hundreds of thousands of terraformers rejoin their home planets as all of their projects are complete.<br />
<br />
- And finally, the bad news:</div></div><hr />

    Correlia is re-captured by a cute little artoo-detoo!  All FOUR of the Imperium Dark Jedi are subverted back to the good side of the force.  Republic Imperators destroy a Imperium Imperator and an unknown unit nearby.  <br />

Taking advantage of continued Allied underestimation, the grand fleet carrier I.S.S. Revenge was given the order to launch from Tralus.  Just a turn earlier, a full eight fighter squadrons had arrived simultaneously on the planet, fresh out of their factories.  Once Revenge reached a position near the ruins of the Rebels' Central Pt Station construction zone, they repeated the 2nd Battle of Spira's devastating tactic of launching planes in every direction.  <br />
<br />
What resulted was the greatest air battle in the history of warfare!  After repeated kamikaze attacks our brave pilots destroyed much (or all, I can only see 6 squares out) of the Empire's Corellian Fleet, with their casualties reported as 1 X-wing squadron, some ship that was underneath it, 1 Imperator destroyer, 1 CC-7700 frigate, and three unknown squadrons on that frigate.  This tactic is really working well for me; these fighters only cost 40 shields so I can use them as missiles!  Here and at Spira I managed to wipe out entire fleets this way, so you guys really should build more airpower.<br />
<br />
Our remaining fighters awaited recon-bot coordinates and subsequently destroyed three Rebel gunships that were found in range, two of which were damaged all the way to a red sliver.  These horridly overrated &quot;gunships&quot; are absolute meat to my planes; I don't know why you bother building them. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Of 14 times I tried, a C-gunship killed two imperators 4 times, and there were 3 time it couldn't kill even one. In one of the double kills, the C gunship's damage was still yellow so my guess is with a lot of luck, a C-gunship could kill 3 ISDs. Koba BOS seems relatively accurate to me.<br />

<br />
If only we had one more land unit left we could have destroyed the planet itself, along with any stack of units that would have been revealed.  Regardless, we can rest assured that this was a great victory, as a republic ISD, two divisions of armor, numerous militia regiments, and one resubverted Dark Jedi were annihilated on the vulnerable planet.

First off, your first test is flawed because ALL of my ISD's are veteran, so there is no use testing with non-vet ISD's.  <br />
<br />
I did tests that resulted as follows, considering this fact:<br />
<br />
CR-Gunship vs. veteran Imperator: 0% probability of double kill<br />
<br />
Veteran Cr-Gunship vs. veteran Imperator: 12% probability of double kill<br />

The proud planet of Corellia is no more, and the fiercest battle in the galaxy's history is drawing to a somber close.  We must admit that the Rebel rustics have given us a run for our money, and our battered forces have returned to Selonia to lick their wounds.  <br />

On the outskirts, AT-ST walkers have destroyed a minor Rebel outpost juse east of Chamble, but not after stealing a very important tech. :D <br />

<br />
Zaarin breathed a sigh of relief at Coruscant at this news, just before transmissions came from the former CSA sector about another battle against the Yuuzhan Vong.  A worldship had predictably attacked the planet of Gaurick, and it was damaged to low yellow by our Turbo Lasers there.  Therefore the squadron of bombers we rushed production of this month were able to destroy it on their own, without the help of an Imperator we kept nearby just in case the bombers would have had to be used as Kamikazes.<br />
<br />
While our brave pilots and ship crews nobly sacrificed themselves against this surrealistic enemy throughout the galaxy, our fight against Republicanism continues.  This month the cities of Drall, Talus, and Kashyyk have fallen.  Also bombers from Revenge flew themselves into a Republic ISD east of Alsakan and destroyed it.  <br />

I think 'spare' was quite an accurate word. Things would be greatly different if they weren't recalled to deall with a YZV attack. If only I hadn't lost that stack of ISDs earlier on. In anycase, I suspect I have a considerably bigger fleet that you do but much less strikecraft.<br />

So you killed the worldship with one TIE Bomber and 2 veteran ISD1s. Agree now that they were too weak pre-patch?<br />

BTW, that sounds as unlikely as one gunship killing two ISDs. A non-veteran TIE Bomber shouldn't even knock a pebble off a worldship.</div></div><hr />

Nothing happened in the turn, except a squadron of TIE-Advanced fighters spotted your fleet at Gaurick.  You know they only can go out three squares on recon missions and see two; if you thought about it and put your ships one square back I wouldn't have even seen them.  Anyway, I moved what I could, but you'll probably win this time.  The CSA is too far from my core cities to reinforce. :(</div></div><hr />

Also a worldship has emptied Myrkyr, but there's no production in the region for 3+ bombers or ISD's, so it's going to do what it wants I guess. :cry:</div></div><hr />

A Lightning assault takes Gaurrick AND Ammund (thanks to their wonderful yellow brick road) even though Imperium forces were in a high state of preparedness. Our recon discovered some strikecraft and an ISD lurking nearby ready for an ambush and they were quickly dispatched. Imperium losses planetside due to mostly to bombardment were severe, two batteries of guns and several units of troopers and a bomber squadron. We did not even have to use half of our massive fleet of ISDs. <br />
<br />
So far no losses but I'm sure that will change. There are probably more Imperium forces lurking around but we are confident of killing any that show their heads.<br />

An attack on Yavin went badly but one enemy trooper division was destroyed and another damaged.</div></div><hr />

When I read your turn post I was planning out a speech to surrender the region, but then I remembered the R2 unit I built in Etti 4. :evil:<br />
<br />
In a repeat of the Republic's devastating operation against Corellia, an Imperium R2 unit was built to incite a revolt in Gaurick, which would have given us their entire fleet.  When we found that they had unexpectedly captured Ammuud as well, and that there was no road around it, we had to settle for less and incite a revolt there, for 360 credits.  All I got was two units, but they were more than enough to retake Gaurick.  Our Dark Jedi unit destroyed the weak assault shuttle there, and our AT-AT walker now gives it a tough garrison.<br />
<br />
Prior to the ground attack however, pre-positioned strike craft destroyed a recon bot on the road to Gaurick and 4 ships to the southwest of the planet.  Two of our planes were low on fuel and resorted to suicidal attacks, but they knew an entire sector was at risk.  The New CSA seems safe for now, depending on the actions of the remaining gunships and the ISDs our recon reports to the north.<br />
<br />
In other news, a squadron of bombers rammed itself into the Myrkyr worldship and didnt even leave a scratch.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, and you have to take this into account when you consider strategy with diplomats.  Like when Ohwell bribed Corellia, he got three dark Jedi and I think one or two tank divisions outside the city.  I couldn't even see it coming, and then he practically got my whole army down there.  :(  Or in the second GNB game when I bribed Liege (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=321533#post321533).  I didn't just get the city, but damn near all of the Prussian Army as well!  Shame we still lost though. :sad: <br />
<br />
Anyway, no news this turn.  Our recon bot near Gaurick was almost out of fuel so we could not be sure of the Empire's claims of retreat.  Next turn we can confirm it.  <br />
<br />
Also, 10+ offensive units have surrounded a worldship near Vladet.  We still expect to lose against it. :(</div></div><hr />

then how did you kill the healthy ISD stacked under the VSD? You kamied one against the probe droid and then kamied the second one against the ISD VSD stack. (The damaged ISD was killed by the one coming from the planet above)</div></div><hr />

The TIE got the first hit (explosion on the ship) which brought the ship into the red, then was hit once and went to 25% or so, and then it smashed the ship again.  The TIE ended with 15% or so and then it died because it was out of fuel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The techs come from you - I think the only stuff I researched independently is Hyperspace, AT-AT and ISD2. I got Dark-Jedi from you, I got TIE Advanced from you, I got Fleet Carrier from you, I got TIE Bomber from you and I can't remember whatelse plus all the stuff from the Rebels. Many a time, a seemingly disasterous attack was just a ruse to steal tech. You will notice that I have none of my own unique units. I also exchanged a lot of tech with the unalligned and CSA insead of attacking them in the early to mid game.<br />
<br />
As for my unit count, I don't loose any except when fighting you and I spent the early part of the game building up to Ind level 3 since I don't have Shadow Academy. I also don't have to waste time building conscription or orbital shipyards - in fact I sold all my existing ones, plus no operating costs for them.</div></div><hr />

On average, 3.1 because the high disease rate (33%) causes mutations in the fourth child, causing it to be only a tenth of the normal human size.  No problem though, we draft them into service and make them tail gunners in our airspeeders. ;)</div></div><hr />

I thought you knew me better by now; if you did you would have checked the space behind Kashyyk. ;)<br />
<br />
- Obsolete veteran units from our early conquests suicidally attack the tough Imperial units on Kashyyk and recapture the city, only to abandon it again.  The destruction of two of Imperial Western Command's ground units should buy Chamble some time to continue its defensive buildup.<br />

As far as I know no single (or even a few) obsolete units can kill a veteran AT-AT, let alone with a veteran Jedi.  Did you lose an ISD or two - come on, be honest.</div></div><hr />

At 1100 hours Byss time, Imperial forces finally conducted their assault on the core worlds with Grand Admiral Kobayashi taking command of the combined 6th and 1st Fleets.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darius</div><div class="date">Oct 25, 2002, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earlier this month, while Admiral Zaarin was writing his resignation and surrender speech at his desk in Coruscant, an intern burst into his office and brought him the first news from our shoestring counter-attacks.  It was realized by our commanders that after poorly defended Loronar was captured by our Jedi, the treasonous carrier and all of its air units completely vanished off the map!  Technicians theorize that the destruction of their command and control infrastructure in the city caused electric surges in their computers, causing them to all go into permanent hyperspace until they were outside the galaxy completely, marooned and never to be heard from again.  Their maddening deaths of starvation and/or freezing will be a fitting punishment for their wicked treason.<br />
<br />
After hearing of this complete disaster for the Imperial invasion, he rose from his desk, wiped a single tear from his face, and returned to Central Command to micromanage the remaining elements of our detailed counteroffensive strategy, which was down but not out as tanks and Jedi poured out of Vladet and Coruscant.  As alluded to earlier, Jedi were able to land on a planet just east of the TIE-fighter squadrons who were impeding the HS beacons to Loronar.  Loronar's garrison was foolishly nothing but meat infantry and it was a complete rollover.  <br />
<br />
Originally Phase 2 was going to consist of an assault on Rendili, but Zaarin grabbed the phone out of a subordinate's hand and ordered the offensive halted.  There was hope that the recapture of Balmorra could cause the same carnage as what happened to Loronar's carrier.  This would inevitably destroy the Balmorran battletanks that were impeding the road to Rendili, and thus eliminate the necessity of destroying them.  Therefore, armored divisons out of Vladet and dark lords from Coruscant and from a roadblock northwest of Vladet all marched on the traitors of Balmorra.  The garrison of relatively weak units was destroyed and the city was captured, and then it was abandoned again as it could not possibly hold against the Empire's still intact ISD fleet.  The attack on Balmorra was such a rollover, in fact, that even the units that attacked it could retreat back to Vladet.  After the city's capture the battletanks at Rendili disappeared, and it was also occupied.<br />
<br />
Make no mistakes.  The Imperial agressors have been pushed back, but they have razed our cities, slaughtered our troops, and dishonorably forced us to slaughter many of our own troops.  Also they still have a fleet more massive than any the galaxy has ever known, even if they have been trashed on land.  The First Battle of the Core Worlds is nowhere from over, and we still expect a victory for Palpatine. :sad:<br />
<br />
Here are the casualties from our counterattack, but they should be taken lightly since all but one of them were once our units and not even what they came with.<br />

Escourt Carrier 1<br />
VSD 1<br />

<br />
- Palpatine has proven far too audacious to move at Coruscant itself without clearing nearby cities or even the space nearby.  This month, the Imperium was forced to adopt the pathetic, underhanded tactics of subversion that the Empire had displayed at Balmorra by bribing two Imperial Imperator II's.  These ships, with assistance from several TIE-Phantoms launched from the carrier ISS Repulse, were able to slaughter nearly all of first and sixth fleets.  The veteran capital ships first destroyed the three weak frigates behind the enemy's forward line, and then they moved back to destroy the enemy's main ISD's.  The grand tally of enemy casualties from our ship and phantom attacks (including the units which were bribed) were the following:<br />
<br />
7 Imperator II's<br />
2 Corellian Gunships<br />
1 CC-7700 Frigate<br />
7 air units inside the frigates<br />
<br />
All that survived, as far as we can see, is a recon bot, a squadron of TIE-Advanced which will have nowhere to land, and an Imperator I that was left alone as we ran out of strike craft.<br />
<br />
Not that you would have gotten Coruscant anyway, like a handful of Imperators can beat 5 veteran armor divisions under VLS shielding. :rolleyes: Did you even consider that part?<br />
<br />
- Tanks from Vladet burn Balmorra (defended only by fighters) and return to base.<br />
<br />
- The only action in the Corellian sector was an attack on their fleet by a lone Imperator, destroying a gunship with some strike craft on it and a Rebel Imperator.  Our ship will surely be destroyed though.<br />
<br />
- Meanwhile, the explanation for our lack of capital ships at the core worlds will soon be discovered when Ohwell makes a recon run in his turn in the most unexpected of places. ;)</div></div><hr />

BTW I would like to propose a ban on using the diplomat units for bribing of units and cities.  Traditionally in PBEM games they haven't been allowed precisely because military power no longer means anything if it can just be bribed.  If you defend a city poorly, they'll attack it, and if you defend a city to impregnability, they'll just bribe it, so it's lose-lose.  For the sake of a more realistic and fun game they should be banned, and this would not give anyone an advantage or disadvantage since all three of us have benefited from them.</div></div><hr />

I won't buy this for a second until you post a screenshot proving it.  There are so many bluffs in this game that I feel like going skiing. ;) <br />
<br />
If indeed that is true it doesn't worry me; it's probably because I'm putting more focus on massive heavy land forces and, as sixth fleet will soon learn the hard way if they are stupid enough to attack me, enormous amounts of strike craft.  You seem to be building almost nothing but capital ships and walkers, from what I can see.  For instance, every single ship attacking Hoth (except for the one I left alone as bait) had air cover, and I had numerous extra craft on top of those.  Meanwhile, I saw that none of your ships at Coruscant had air cover.  If you had more aircraft you almost certainly would have won, since I couldn't have bribed the ship/craft stacks and I only had a few phantoms.</div></div><hr />

I don't want my most heavily defended cities in the Correlian Sector and the core worlds to just be captured with no bloodshed; its unrealistic to the point of absurdity.  Since all of us can use R2's and/or suffer from them, no one in particular would benefit from a ban.  PBEM games with constant bribing simply aren't fun for me, but I'll play on if you two really want to use it. <br />

And two, while you two can use it to save your butts, I can use them too, making me even more powerful than I already am.  That's why I think nobody benefits in particular. <br />
<br />
Also, in another game I was an underdog and still agreed to the ban simply because the game wasn't fun when you work so hard to defend cities and it's all in vain.  I could have been against the ban for my personal benefit, but it's the principle of the thing.</div></div><hr />

- The Empire's sixth fleet has been dealt a rather heavy blow.  Two carriers undertook our patented clean-sweep tactic and destroyed several stacks of units, but many enemy ships remain.  After two TIE-Advanced squadrons rammed into an Imperial gunship and still didn't destroy it, our air commanders were ordered to halt the assault.  No exclamation points in this paragraph, our losses were high and many enemy ships remain. :undecide:<br />

Put away the champagne gentlemen, there was only one strike craft on each. :rolleyes:  Did I hear the word unlaunched?  All but those two were launched against your fleet!  <br />
<br />
BTW, I know from other games that carriers are considered stacks, but for some reason when you kill one carrier and one unit, there is no report.  Probably because if there's a stack indicated by the shields, and no report, you can deduce that there were only two units.<br />
<br />

Ehrm, no, it got burned along with its planet.  All I have is free city walls, which are easily beaten when you use those stupid R2's, so I have no advantage.  Not to mention the fact that I earned those free city walls, I didn't just stumble upon them.  You could have had them instead if you took some initiative early in the game.</div></div><hr />

No I didn't, the only time I used an R2 was against some individual units (which I'm not against) and against Ammuud, getting two lousy units for 400 gold. :rolleyes:  Absolutely nothing like the scenario I proposed, not to mention that you didn't answer my actual question: is that fun?  My answer is no, and you can't talk to me about how it's your last resort because if I was in your position, I would support the ban as well.
