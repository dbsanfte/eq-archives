With about 50 replies and 100 views each, I must thank everyone who made a contribution.<br />
<br />
I have sent the scenario to thunderfall who should be posting it soon. I hope everyone enjoys it. (If you play as a single player, be the Axis)<br />
<br />
Willem, I will make a special scaled down version for you and send it to you tomorrow (after you have retrieved the KobaBos) as the main zip is over 1 Meg.<br />

I guess part of the reason its fast is because it does not try to mimic how the war turned out or have Artificial AI (is that an oxymoron?)via the events to augment the single player game like Red Front.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 31, 2001, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm already making changes that were suggested and some other adjustments to improve the gameplay. So far..<br />
<br />
VERSION 1.1 CHANGES<br />
-------------------<br />
a. War Heroes entry was orginally omitted in the Pedia. This has been added and various other entires were adjusted.<br />
<br />
b. The Axis now get free torpedoes at regular intervals.<br />
<br />
c. Titles for Soviet and the minor race leaders are now appropriate.<br />
<br />
d. Amended various messages related to paradrop, scramble and land convoy.<br />
<br />
e. Soviet research rate has been increased slightly. Also increased the starting size of Soviet Asia Cities to 3.<br />
<br />
f. Empire colour schemes have been adjusted so they are more distinct. Corrected spelling for/changed completely some city names. <br />
<br />
g. Pollution icon removed from the city screen.<br />
<br />
h. Got rid of the dots on Hitler's face in the title picture and corrected the spelling mistake (Kreig to Krieg).<br />
<br />
i. One turn is now two weeks instead of one week.<br />
<br />
j. More details to the readme. A few more 'notes in history' in the events file.<br />
<br />
k. Fixed the unwanted background from the A-bomb pollution.<br />
<br />
l. Corrected spelling for/changed completely some city names. <br />
<br />
m. Added a null fire.wav<br />
<br />
n. Made techs like Axis fighter, Allied Bomber more attractive to AI.<br />
<br />
o. Later bombers are more poweful now.<br />
<br />
p. Tank destroyers and 75mm AT had stats adjusted so that the AI would keep building them for a longer period.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll be away for about ten days so I won't be able to reply for a while.  Just post here or continue to send comments to me by e-mail as some of you have done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WW2 is the only war which I know well enough to make a decent scenario. The thing about making scenarios is that you can make them exactly the way you want to. In this case, I wanted to make a multi-player friendly WW2 scenario that didn't play like a Panzer General type game so that I could play it with my friends.</div></div><hr />

There was a little trick there, I don't know if you caught it. One of the BGs was sunk by a nazi BG that was inside the city, and then a Bf-109 was sent as top cover for it. It took a destroyed He-111 and a Stuka for another, and the for the last one, a heavily damaged Stuka. This aspect is quite realistic. The Royal Navy very much feared that they would lose ships without aircover, just as those in the game suffered. <br />

The Minor Axis attacked because I paid them (a lot) to do so. That's allowed in a multi-player game you know - since we are not trying to duplicate the War and it has to diverge from the timeline eventually.

Yup.<br />
<br />
You have to choose 'end player turn' (Cntrl-N, I believe) or else when the next person in line loads up the savegame, the AI will take over your Civ and move any units with movement value left(read: any fortified units!). <br />
<br />
What to do:<br />
1)When you are done moving your turn, select a fortified unit somewhere that you haven't moved all turn.  <br />
<br />
2)Activate it, then go to the Orders Menu--&gt; 'end player turn' or hit Cntrl-N. <br />
<br />
The AI will not be able to activate any of your units and screw with your strategy.<br />

The way you designed the scenario, I can't negociate with the axis minor allies, so I can't end a war with them. They are a hindrence, anyway, so I don't miss them at all.

This was a big issue in the 2194DaysOfWar PBEMS we had going down at Apolyton.  In the first game, the Soviet player forgot to Ctrl-N on turn 1 and Viola! Xin Yu, playing as the Japanese was at the gates of Leningrad by turn 2!!! I had to rush my attack (as the Germans) upon Moscow for fear of Xin swiping it from me!<br />
<br />
The poor Soviet had all his weak, back-door defensive units scattered about by the computer for the Imperial Marines to come a' riding down the Trans Siberian Rails right at 'em! It was a slaughter!<br />
<br />
Next game was severely different with Nemo behind thew wheel of the Soviets in that one.<br />
Xin took the reigns of the Germans, and I the Japanese. Nemo gave Xin a big whallop and crushed most of his attack force. I took 29 cities as the Japanese on turn 1 and was preparing to take america with scores of units. That game was never finished though.<br />

<br />
Hi allies!<br />
<br />
We have a hard task of stopping one of the most brilliant Civ tactician Xin Yu. <br />
<br />
In this scenario both Axis states have low production but huge and well developed armies at the beginning. We have good economies with powerful production and on the long run Axis is doomed. Their only hope is to go for all-out offensive and win early. <br />
<br />
Current Axis war plan as I understand is:<br />
1. conquest of Soviet Union with combined assault from west and east; <br />
2. conquest of British Isles, Egypt and Middle-East by Germany and China and India by Japan;<br />
3. conquest of America with simultaneous descents by both Axis powers;<br />
4. conquest of rest of the World.<br />
<br />
European Theatre: I think that Germany's decision to start operation Sealion so early is very risky. It takes many good units from Eastern front and gives Soviet Union a chance to survive.  <br />
<br />
Pacific Theatre: Japan uses her main land forces against Soviet Union, not China. Also it is possible that she try to occupy quickly India and Australia before Great Britain can build up her forces there. As my flight reconnaissance shows, Japanese fleet which attacked Pearl Harbour moves toward American coast. They try apparently make some shore bombardment with battleships.<br />
<br />
For Soviet Union: on square 137,39 there is a Japanese submarine. If you can, destroy it.<br />
For Great Britain: on square 118,82 is Japanese bomber and 119,83 destroyer.<br />
I committed cruiser and destroyer for defence of Australia but they ran to Japanese submarine on square 143,99. Nearby must be another submarine also. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you sink them with your fighters. <br />
  <br />
I mobilized all the might of United States for science and have now 1 technology per turn and shall get nuclear bombs after 7 turns. After that I put them into mass production and go on offensive. So if we manage to hold out next 10 turns then the victory is ours! <br />
<br />
Hold me updated.  <br />
<br />

Marko Jan 42:<br />

Hi allies!<br />
<br />
Seems that war is lost. But we must fight until the end!<br />
<br />
North American Theatre: I concentrate on defence of Washington, no forces available for counterattack yet. <br />
<br />
Pacific Theatre: My relativly strong fleet (2 battleships plus smaller ships) just entered to Pacific and heads toward Pearl Harbor. I plan to engage Japanese fleet there and disturb Xin Yu from setting up chain transportation between Japan and America.  <br />
<br />
Nobody tells about North African/Middle East front. What is going on there? Dizepam?<br />
<br />
Japan must been overextend herself in all fronts. Every counteroffensive can be successful against her now.<br />

Marko, Feb 42:<br />
<br />
Hi allies,<br />
<br />
Here are the last news from fronts:<br />
<br />
North American Theatre: Washington is still holding. In order to get money for rushbuild units I liberated lightly defended cities along all Atlantic coast but I have no forces to garrison them. As it is likely that Washington and maybe Alaska will fall in March-April I concentrate my efforts to Middle American region. <br />
<br />
Pacific Theatre: my Pacific fleet ran into Japanese fleet which headed toward Panama. There is a naval battle going on and both sides have lost several ships.    <br />
<br />
Marko<br />
<br />
Marko, Mar 42:<br />
<br />
Hi allies,<br />
<br />
Congratulations to heroic British for their recent victories!<br />
<br />
News from fronts:<br />
<br />
Middle American Theatre: Naval battle in front of Panama is still going on. I'm down to 2 battleships and 1 destroyer but managed to sink Japanese transport ship with Imperial Marines. It must slow them down as likely they don't have other ground troops nearby. <br />
<br />
Alaska: Japanese tanks are approaching to the city. Defence forces are weak, so the battle here will not last long. <br />
<br />
Greenland: I have relativly strong air force here but the base is very vulnerable to naval bombardment.<br />
<br />
Neutrals and Germans are in war with each other!<br />
<br />
Marko<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Marko, Apr 42:<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
News from fronts:<br />
<br />
Middle American Theatre: I'm not able to hold Japanese ships away from Panama anymore. Their numerical superiority is overhelming. Also Japanese super battleship appeared near Florida. Total collapse is unavoidable and I retreated remaining ships from direct battle: damaged battleship to Southern Pacific for repairing and destroyer to guard San Juan city. <br />
<br />
Greenland: Preparing my forces for battle against advancing germans from South Greenland. <br />
<br />
Marko<br />
<br />
Marko, May 42:<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
The war is concluding fast. Panama will fall next turn as Japanese battleships reached to it. <br />
<br />
Greenland still fighting: destroyed there Panzer IV tank and submarine. But it is size 1 city with no production. <br />

 What happened to battle of britain? Where are all you planes and ships?Goering reports that we must have air superiority before launching an invasion. Sea power is extremly slow. A warship traveling at 10knots could cross the Atlantic in less then two weeks. Navel units in the game would take months to do it. It might be better to increase their speed, and go back to your original concept of them being sub flagged for navel combat only. On this scale, shore bombardment should not be this effective. <br />

I have played SPI's War In Europe quite a few times (the board game, with division level units for most, 35 km per hex) and found it to be a very good simulation, in that if you followed historical decisions that the game flowed in an historical way.<br />
<br />
Something this game had which I haven't seen mentioned here is the effect of economies being on a war footing or not (and no I haven't had time to play the scenario yet).  Not of relevance to the Germans, British or French who start at war, but in 1939 the Russians and US are not at war and do not have a war time level of production.  The production for the US and Russia is considerably lower during peacetime than it is once they have declared war (or had it declared upon them).  Same thing happens in another board game simulation .World In Flames. I was curious if this is reflected in the scenario in some way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The things you mentioned are reflected in the game. <br />
<br />
For the case of the Allies, the US is all but crippled by corruption until the correct tech  are researched and the correct city improvements are built. This simulates the period when they were giving half hearted support and hadn't declared war yet. <br />
<br />
Secondly, there are also wonders to be built which would enable the economies - to a war footing like you suggested. These include Rosie the Riviter, Atlantic Charter etc.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, most cities do not have more than the basic city improvements so they too will have industrial capacity built up during the game.<br />
<br />
One point you are mistaken about is the German production. The Germans did not reach war-time production until maybe late 1942 because they didn't see any need to. That is why maximum production of all types of equipment was reached in 43/44 in spite of the fact that Allied bombing was at its peak during the same period.<br />
<br />

Operation Sealion<br />
<br />
Student's elite Paratroopers making a daring para assault on Dover. After capturing the city, elements of the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe pour into the bridgehead.....only to be decimated by a British trap set up by Montgomery (who conveniently didn't need to go to Africa since the Afrika Korps didn't go to the aid of the Italians)<br />
This is a serious design flaw. Please read my two e-mails on this situation.<br />

<br />
For other people, the point of contention is whether commandoes(diplomats) units should be allowed to capture(bribe) units and cities.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 23, 2001, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could be right. These could be the cities taken by the Soviets in 1939 (and conveniently kept) after the war.<br />
<br />
On one map of Poland from the period, Vilna is given as Wilno and Lvov is shown as Lwow on the map of the period. Don't know about Rivne, unless it is the Rowne right on the eastern border.<br />
<br />
However, all the other WW2 maps I have (which have Russia in them) show them as part of Russia. But then you are from Poland so you're probably right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2001, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I am going to let the battleships have the ability to attack aircraft. This will solve the invulnerable battleship problem as describe below:<br />
<br />
Currently, when a Spitfire is stacked with on a capital ship, the game will only allow other fighters, like ME109 to attack. But when the ME109s attack, the battleship defends, not the spitfire. As it would take twenty ME109s sequentially to kill a capital ship, the renders the capital ship invulnerable.<br />
<br />
I suppose a battleship in real life would be escourted by Flak Light Cruisers as well as the usual destroyers so the ability to shoot down a nearby fighter squadron is not too far off the mark. In the end, ships are too slow to really chase after any planes, so any kills would be incidental. <br />
<br />
The plus is that capital ships would be able to fire on enemy capital ships even if the have fighter cover. And a ship with fighter cover is still protected from subs and bombers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2001, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to everyone who has sent in comments. Seems that version 1.1 still has some difficiencies. I am making version 1.2 now. The changes to be implemented so far (as taken from the readme) are: <br />
<br />
9.02 VERSION 1.2 CHANGES<br />
------------------------<br />
a. Gave the Polish back the cities of Vilna and Lwow.<br />
<br />
b. Disabled city capture (bribing) by Commandoes and enabled the Informant network (embassy) option. <br />
<br />
c. Added a ADSIC/Sonar message to replace the Railway message. Added a Mustang Message to replace the Transform message.<br />
<br />
d. Withdrew suggestion that single player play as Axis.<br />
<br />
e. Allies now begin researching War Adjustment so the Allied AI will have AA guns earlier.<br />
<br />
f. Soviets and Minor Allies (i.e. Poland) at at war at the start.<br />
<br />
g. Capital ships can now attack aircraft to solve the problem of the invulnerable battleship.<br />
<br />
h. Facist government city corruption is now equivalent to 10 spaces from the capital, previously 4. This will reduce the overall Axis advantage.<br />
<br />
If there are any more suggestions for other adjustments, NOW would be a good time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">burak</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2001, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rovne was polish city to.<br />
<br />
Soviet Union attacked Poland in 17 september, so maybe they should have cease fire with minor allies at the start of the game.<br />
<br />
Add some city in eastern Poland because it is quite empty now ( even emptier than Russia).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2001, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I have it now, the Axis start owning one small polish city in the west and the Soviets start owning one small polish city in the east - i.e. Rovne. Its not entirely accurate as the Germans attacked slightly earlier but given the time span of one turn, it is acceptable. This is the best way to replicate the simultaneous attack from both sides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alcibiaties of Athenae</div><div class="date">Apr 27, 2001, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For everyone following our playtest game, what happened was that Kob had allowed Commandoes to bribe units and cities, and was baseing his strategy on the Germans landing in England, then bribing the whole force. This worked to perfection, as I took Dover with airborne and poured in Veteran airunits and a Battleship and a sub, which he promptly bribed! I was not aware that the Commandoes had this capability, as it was only in the readme, not the civilpedia. If I had been aware of this, my strategy would have been completly different, and since both our strategys were based on a flawed conception, we have scrapped that game and started another. With the new revisions, Commandos can no longer bribe units. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frunobulax</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2001, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing ZWK all weekend and took Dover with massive V-1 attack, plus bombers - just got my Panthers going off to fight around Kiev - which i took last thing last night before I expired from exhaustion ! Only bug I find is with AA units wandering around Eastern Europe acting like tanks - surely they should stay put more ! Especially have this problem around Zurich with the neutrals, as it seems that this is the only unit Zurich is making... weird. Aside from that, I've enjoyed it immensely - determined to get to Moscow tonight, though the Russian tanks are often decimating my panzer iVs - the Tiger's are SO SLOW getting east - as the Russians keep destroying railway lines as they retreat - unusually clever AI ! Finally, have just started building the Manhattan project - the Allies seem to have ignored this; since they have V-1s I thought I'd have an A-bomb.... but have qualms about nuking Moscow - anyone else have ethical woes about this ? or am I being to considerate !!? Commandoes are great btw - managed to 'steal' a P-38, which is great for recon over the Atlantic... my subs don't seem to have had much to do... but there are an awful lot of Independant's battleships clogging up the Baltic ! OK, over and out....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I say don't nuke anyone unless the AI uses the first nuke. Makes it more challenging. I don't use a nuke to accelerate the end game but if I am desperate I use it.<br />
<br />
By the way, I have submitted a ZWK version 2.0 to thunderfall for ages. I think I am going to remind him in the feedback thread where he'll notice it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2001, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and improvements to the latest version are:<br />
<br />
9.04 VERSION 1.3 CHANGES<br />
------------------------<br />
a. AA Battery role changed from Air-superiority to Defend.<br />
<br />
b. Gave city fortification to Kiel and Brest as there is where the free torpedoes appear. Changed the mechanism for giving the Axis free torpedoes to make it more random.<br />
<br />
c. Neutrality Wonder expires with War Adjustment.<br />
<br />
d. Allies must now have Lightning (Twin Fusulage) before they can research Mustang(Advanced Piston).<br />
<br />
e. Added Industrial Estates to Vologda, Kirov and Dnepropetrovsk.<br />
<br />
f. Added a new Allied city, Inverness, in northern Great Britain and added a transport corridor to the North.<br />
<br />
g. Axis free support for units reduced from 5 to 4.<br />
<br />
h. Fixed 'farmland' message you get when you discover Large Airframe.<br />
<br />
i. Changed winning condition for Axis to capturing both London and Moscow.<br />
<br />
j. Reduced the defense factors of the heavier tanks and increased the attack factors of the more advanced bombers to increase the pace of the game in the second half. <br />
<br />
<br />
9.05 VERSION 2.0 CHANGES<br />
------------------------<br />
a. I have moved some of the terrain and added two new terrain types, grove and beach.<br />
<br />
b. Most of the terrain bonuses have been changed so that they are more appropriate. <br />
<br />
c. Trade items have been changed to different basic minerals and elements.<br />
<br />
d. The look of the transport corridor (road) has also been adjusted so it will not be mistaken for railroad.<br />
   <br />
e. Tanks over forty tons (Panther, Tiger, Tiger II, Stalin and Pershing) can now ignore city fortifications.<br />
<br />
f. Created advice files so that the advisors are more effective and explain what units and improvements are for.<br />
<br />
g. Both Soviet and Axis AI are more likely to attack each other as the scenario progresses. Soviets and Axis can no longer negotiate.<br />
<br />
h. The game doesn't say that Hess was planning to defect any more.<br />
<br />
i. Free Axis torpeodes now replace lost ones on a one for one basis.<br />
<br />
j. Renamed Dorset and Norfolk (both county names) to Southampton and Yarmouth. Bratislavia now belongs to the Axis.<br />
<br />
k. Added more German units to the Lowlands area to make sure the AI can blitzkrieg all the way to France. Added a few more Italian and British units in North Africa.<br />
<br />
l. The war heroes pedia entry was slightly too long for the MGE window so it was shortened. Added that the wonders expire with the loss of secondary objectives in the Guderain's Academy and After Depression pedia entries.<br />
<br />
m. Made Pz IV icon smaller so it does not look like a heavy tank. Also made minor adjustments to other unit icons.<br />
<br />
n. Added new event messages for P-51, Lancaster and V1. Enhanced other existing event messages. The events file now exceeds 20k.<br />
<br />
o. Fixed bugs in the tech tree. Axis Bomber and not Axis allows the building of HE 111. Prerequisite of the Atomic Bomb tech is now Large Airframe and Nuclear Fission. The Snorchel wonder requires Radar Detector not Acoustic Torpedo. <br />
<br />
p. the Axis/Allied tech-tree picture is available in gif format.<br />
<br />
