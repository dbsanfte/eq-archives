<br />
Iberia, AKA Spain, AKA Andalusia. 1195 AD, AKA 591 AH. Which geographic name and calendar will be used here is, sortof, what will be decided today. Well, okay, maybe not, but it sounds like a nice thing to say.<br />
<br />
Iberia is divided into five Christian kingdoms and one Muslim caliphate - that caliphate was the Almohad one, which controlled half of Iberia as well as Morocco, Algiers and Tunis. The Almohads (AlmostHads? AlmostHadThems?) were, theoretically at least, larger and more powerful then any kingdom taken alone, but the Christians were often allied to each other. Not all of them, ofcourse.<br />
<br />
Okay, so here we have year 1195. So what? Why is it such a good POD? You don't know Spanish history very well, do you? Well, neither do I, but anyway. June 18, 1195. The day that will live in fame. If you happen to be a Muslim. The united Spanish Christian forces, united and determined to avenge the minor setback in the incursions of 1190, chose to attack the Almohad province of Seville a year ago. Now, in 1195, the Almohad caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub left Marrakesh, his Moroccan capital, and moved to fight them. The avangard was crushed by the Castilleans led by Alfonso VIII, but the main force overwhelmed and crushed the Christian coalition, especially as it was betrayed by one knight Pedro Fernandez de Castro. Ouch. That was, btw, called the battle of al-Arak, or Alarcos.<br />
<br />
Now let us suppose Alfonso VIII died in the fighting. This is not just a crushing defeat of the Christian forces as it was in OTL - no, its a total rout. Yusuf, who now proclaimed himself al-Mansur Biallah (&quot;Made Victorious by Allah&quot;), realizes this and rather then go back to Marrakesh with the feeling of a job well done, decides to take back Toledo.<br />
<br />
He could not have chosen a better time to do that, neither. In OTL, just after the defeat at Alarcos, Castilleans got attacked by Leon and Navarre. Aragonese backed the Castilleans. Christian unity in Spain flew out of the window. With a weaker and leaderless Castille, Aragon is soon forced to fight this war all by itself. Meanwhile, al-Mansur quite easily besieges and captured Toledo, on the other front his forces threaten Lisbon and the Aragonese are unable to do anything against them. Nevertheless, the Aragonese manage to crush the tiny Navarre and entered a de facto union with Castille. Peter of Aragon is cellebrating this victory, but knows that it doesn't mean too much right now - the Almohads, by the time of al-Mansur's death in 1199, control Portugal, Leon and half of Castille as well as their previous territory. Peter II of Aragon does now control the remaining Christian Spain... but is too weak to continue a reconquista. The rest of Europe doesn't care, apart from a few half-hearted crusades by small groups of knights. Europe already had a major crusade not too long ago, the Third Crusade, and besides, England and France are fighting each other and are too consumed by it to react.<br />
<br />
During early 13th Century, Caliph an-Nasir (due to the greater Iberian Campaign, more capable a commander) was forced to fight the Banu Ghaniya in eastern Algeria and Tunisia (the Banu Ghaniya do not have as heavy an Arab tribal support as in OTL, due the Almohads being viewed as de facto &quot;defenders of faith&quot; as well as de jure). This time around, it took just one campaign with the high-morale, experienced Almohad troops to send the Ghaniya running back into the desert. The Almohads didn't lose de facto authority in Tunisia as in OTL.<br />
<br />
With all that accomplished, 1206/602 is the right year for the attack on Aragon/Spain. An-Nasir takes his army, and in the first series of battles and skirmishes (to the Aragonese credit, with mixed results - in part due to the influx of volunteers to the Aragonese) pushes the &quot;Spaniards&quot; all the way to Ebro. In 1207, the Arabs cross the river and crush the Aragonese at Tortosa. Peter II was taken hostage, and would die in captivity.<br />
<br />
The Andalusian Jihad was almost over. Christianity still did hold out in Navarre until 1239, but... it just wasn't enough. The French under St. Louis would send many crusades into Andalusia across the Pyrenees and by the sea during mid-13th Century, but ultimately, failed to achieve any long-term success - indeed, the recapture of Lisbon in 1240 was as good as those crusades got. But Lisbon was lost again soon...<br />
<br />
By now the effects are many. Andalusia is united, there is a powerful Almohad Caliphate in the west. The French crusaders under St. Louis concentrate on Andalusia rather then North Africa. Louis IX, thus, lived longer. Slightly.<br />
<br />
In the overall, what we get is a slightly stronger France, a significantly stronger Almohad Caliphate and significantly unexisting Spanish Christian kingdoms. One might be interested to know that the Crusader kingdoms in the Holy Land are even weaker then in OTL. We also get an early renewal of significant Berber raids. This hurts Genoa especially. That, in turn, make Venice stronger. Fear da Most Serene Republic! Muwhahahahaha! <br />
<br />
But I get distracted. Back to our muttons, the Almohads exist in a naval war with Genoa and a cold war with France in late 13th Century. Nothing much seems to change elsewhere in Europe so far. England still tries to conquer Scotland, Mongols still pillage Hungary and Poland and then run away, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
But, ofcourse, we have some butterflies. Some huge butterflies. Fredrick II-lives-much-longer sized butterflies that exist to add some flavor and to make a mod's life easier without all those silly Lippe-Detmold-Saxe-Goteburg-Palatinate-of-Rhine-Franconia thingies instead of a huge Holy Roman Empire, from Holstein to Sicily includingly and with a tiny bit of land left for the Pope. If any at all - a more succesful Fredrick II probably would have done like Charles V would have done in OTL, and burned down Rome claiming it to be &quot;friendly fire&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sure it was.<br />
<br />
Another little big butterfly involved the Mongols winning at Ain-Jalut and extending the Il-Khanate to the Mediterranean Sea. Not further, though, as the Mongols are rather tired out by that battle. It did make for some refugees to Andalusia for future usage...<br />
<br />
Oh, and I forgot to add. Andalusians did pretty well assimilating northern Spain. Almohads were predominantly Berber, so they weren't as touchy as Arabs about killing &quot;People of the Book&quot; who persisted in annoying them. Oh, sure, religious tolerance is a good thing, but enough is enough.<br />
<br />
So here we reach 1300 AD/699AH. And then... we get to the next year. And it turns out that nothing much has changed. From the previous year, that is. So anyway, the Christians learned to live with the uberAlmohads to their south, as they had more important things to do - as in, fight each other. Holy Roman Emperor Wilhelm I is fighting in Fifty Years War - a massive on-off conflict in which Holy Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire (remnants of), England and the Kalmar Union fight the (Christian Catholic) WorldTM. Essentially, this war follows the formula of &quot;attacker loses&quot; - most offensives so far failed for both sides. Hungary and Poland managed to unite during this war, first dynastically and then politically. The Kalmar Union reinforced itself well, establishing lasting control over Sweden. England is losing ground in France to France, though Normandy and Gascogne are still theirs. Novgorod, de facto an independant state, occasionally enters the war on different sides, though most often siding with HRE against the land-hungry Poles who conquered the (tiny) Lithuania and grabbed the Teutonic territories in circa 1290. The Novgorodians, as of 1301 AD, conquered all the way to Riga includingly, but just couldn't push further. The Golden Horde nominally is Novgorod's overlord, and really does profit from trade and occasional tribute, and as such took the liberty of decimating a Polish army once when it accidentally advanced too close to Novgorod. So the Poles decided not to bother and to concentrate on the Western Front (from the Polish viewpoint). The war drags on until 1313. Peace treaty pretty much confirms what few gains actually happened during the war and were held on to.<br />
<br />
Next obligatory part of this timeline is Almohad discovery of America. In early 14th century, Almohads slightly stagnated, and had to fight off numerous attacks from the southern direction in Sahara. Towards 1333, though, Caliph Omar ibn-Abdul took over, ruled justly and stuff, and got Almohad Caliphate back on track. He happened to be slightly eccentric, and thus sent forth numerous expeditions - to the Omar Cape (OTL Cape of Good Hope) and, more interestingly, to the Azores. From there, a Muslim explorer named Yusuf ibn-Battuta set forth, inspired by tales of the sailors and the belief that if he sails west he will reach Soccotra and discovered what he called &quot;Java&quot;. The name stuck, and so the islands in the Karib Sea are to this day called &quot;Western Javas&quot; (OTL Western Indies). Another common name for those was Karibistan.<br />
<br />
Karibistan remained a backwards western possession with little populatin until 1369/770, though. In 1369, Caliph Amin ibn-Mamun personally visited Karibistan. By then, most Caribs died out or were assimilated, and most of the local population were Berbers - fishermen and farmers. Amin, however, had many problems back at home concerning Arab Bedouins in Northern Africa, and came up with an idea to turn Karibistan into a sort of penal colony (similar to Australia, but not quite). Long story cut short, meddling Arab tribesmen were departed to Karibistan, raising local population significantly and persuading the Berbers to seek other occupations. Up until this moment, a few Berbers traded and/or raided some Mayan settlements in Yucatan. Now, however, an adventurist Berber called Zeyad ibn-Khalid chose to lead a group of a few Berbers - equipped with iron weapons of which Mayans knew but did not learn to use yet - to seize and pillage Chichen Itza itself. Long story cut short, they succeeded, and claimed northern Yucatan as Zeyadastan in the name of the Caliph. Zeyad did not stop here, though. With Caliph's blessing and assistance, he plunged into the confusing world of Mexico Valley in 1374. A thousand Berbers versus millions even of Tlaxcallans, Mixtecs, Chichimecs, Tarascans and Aztecs. Berbers, naturally, won - in part due to technologic superiority, in part due to better training, determination and command, in part due to supreme organizational talents of Zeyad, but, most importantly, due to diplomacy. Tarascans were, at the time, in way with many other tribes. Zeyad allied with the Tarascans, brought down Mixtecs and Aztecs, and then proceeded to use the chaos in Tarasco (caused by the European diseases) to take over his former allies as well.<br />
<br />
Mekhikostan appeared. Interestingly, much as Zeyadastan and perhaps Karibistan, it was de facto autonomous from the Almohads. The Caliph seemed happy with that situation - Islam was being spread, he received large parts of the loot and the fame, while not having to manage and defend the western possessions. Caliphs have better things to do, you know.<br />
<br />
Back in the Old World, all was going well. There were a few minor conflicts that, say, allowed England to hold on to Aquitaine and Picardy but lose Normandy, that confirmed Bohemia as Holy Roman, that finished off the &quot;worldly papacy&quot; while actually sending the Pope to Avignon, etc, etc. Burgundy was prevented from appearing. Holy Roman Emperor's central authority was confirmed. Byzantines pushed their frontier in Europe back up to Danube. Venice defended its independance from Friedrick III. Novgorod defeated the crumbling Golden Horde at Moskva, and united large parts of Rus under its democratic rule. The Il-Khan in the Middle East smiled as he looked at Bursa, the latest jewel in his empire. Silly Turks... thought they could taunt the Mongols and get away with it. Besides, the Byzantines offered large amount of money for the Mongols to conquer Turkish realms, and Il-Khan Timur didn't complain about that sort of a deal.<br />
<br />
Then in 1380, a Scottsman (on a horse) named Malcolm Macbriney discovered the land he heard so much about from merchants and which king Macbeth ordered to find (spies at the Almohad court ARE useful). The trek to Macbrinea (OTL North America) was a hard one, but the reward was good. Soon after, a Scottish colony was found in Macbrinea. It was to be followed up in the next two decades by England, France, HRE, Kalmar, Novgorod, Venice, Byzantine Empire and the Templars (who ITTL didn't get purged as badly). The latter, who were out of favor, moved their organization altogether to Macbrinea. This started years of bitter struggle, as the Arab merchants by then leaked many Old World secrets, such as iron weapons and horses to the natives, and as the natives got over the initial shock of European diseases. Incited by the Arabs to fight the Christians, these natives (such as Appalachee, Creek and Cherokee) created military-based societies after the diseases, and possessed numbers of heavy armored cavalry amongst other things. The Battle for Macbrinea is on.<br />
<br />
The Year is 1400 AD or 802 AH. The time is now. Take a nation - whether Muslim or Christian, European or American, Asian or African. And lead it to battle now that most of the world is more or less known, and world wars can take place. Now is the time when empires that are forged can outlive their creators by many centuries. Will you colonize Macbrinea or resist that colonization? Will you attack the HRE or defend it? Will you defy the Il-Khanate or assist it? Will you Crusade for the Holy Land, or will you Jihad in its protection? Or perhaps... you would do something else? The fate of your nation is in your hands. Prepare to forge the destiny of the world!</div>

Rules from stAzNesIV: Alvarez-Communeros 1711, passed down from NES2 I<br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
<br />
NES2 I was a good NES, and my only hope is that this will be at least half as good. Pick a nation, and begin to plot evil plans. As always.<br />
<br />
TEMPLATE<br />
Nation Name<br />
Capital:<br />
Ruler:<br />
Government:<br />
Tech. Level:<br />
Army:<br />
Navy:<br />
Economy:<br />
Education:<br />
Culture:<br />
Confidence:<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background:<br />
<br />
Players, Stories, and Government.<br />
<br />
Players - no limit. Anybody can join.<br />
<br />
Stories - not necessary, but very encouraged. Good story-writers would get bonuses based on their stories. In the immortal words of stalin006, “storywriters get random events!”. Or something like that.<br />
<br />
Government - is your form of government. Now note that I DON’T want the “Sheep2’s Oceania” syndrome in this NES. You are free to change your government, and explain it how ever do you want, but that can piss off followers of the previous governments, and might lead to nation-wide riots. Or a civil war, depending on what mood I am in. In other words – change governments at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Technology Level<br />
<br />
Will use the age system. It is the same as in other NESes of other people, of course the ages are not identical. You can always try to invent something that was invented later in OTL, or you can, if giving me a good reason why this should work within your current techno-capabilities, invent something which was never invented. This begins in the Mid Colonial Age for most nations. A lot of the Colonial tech was similar, they just upgrade <br />
<br />
There are some technological ages. Not many, but you’ll need to know them:<br />
<br />
Pre-Colonial Age<br />
Early Colonial Age<br />
Mid-Colonial Age<br />
Late-Colonial Age<br />
<br />
I will describe the Ages later.<br />
<br />
Military<br />
<br />
That will, as of now, consist of army, navy and air wings. These will be number-based as it gives more versatility. These will be represented in divisions, ships and air wings respectively. In the future you can get <br />
<br />
What will you have in it? Anything that is allowed by your tech. level! Infantry, cavalry, - you name it. Each “stat-growth” will increase soldiers by 500, ships by 10.<br />
<br />
Using advanced tactics and strategy is advised. If you just order “attack enemy on the border with 10 divisions”, I will think that you order me to launch a mere charge at the enemy. That might work, but rarely.<br />
<br />
Mercenaries - if you pay an economy level, you will get 10 divisions of well-trained fighting men. They will be separated from your own battalions in the stats, and will leave after two turns, unless you pay them another economy level. Yes, they are expensive, but they are quite worth the price. Btw, you can also hire “mercenary” ships that can also act as privateers.<br />
<br />
UUs - one per nation, but can be changed at any point (though the newly-“demoted” UU units will not be happy). I will keep a list of them, somewhere. Could be land, sea, or air at a later point. They will be separated from other battalions/ships in the stats. They are grown as normal units. Remember to keep them REALISTIC.<br />
<br />
Economy<br />
<br />
This is the most original part, I think. It will be in word-levels. Unlike in the other NESes, you don’t have to pay economy levels to do anything (my reasoning is that no matter what some people say, national economy is not as unstable and absurd as to rise and drop in turns as the years go). You will have a number of spend points for every turn (depending on your economy level), to be spent on increasing any stat save for economy. To grow economy, you mustn’t spend on anything else.<br />
<br />
If you want to hurry up a project by two turns, you can sacrifice an economy level, please note that you can do it only once during a project. Otherwise you can sacrifice an economy level (two per turn only, although compatible with the project being hurried up) to receive six extra spending points for a turn. When economy goes above Monopoly, you get “Monopoly +x”, where x is a number of levels you have beyond Monopoly. Also note that the value of “x” is added to your spend points by definition, so beyond Monopoly really does make you a über-power.<br />
<br />
Know that random events WILL damage your economy here and there, unless I forget about it for the third time.<br />
<br />
You can send spend points or economy levels to other players for some reason. If you gain negative economy points, you will get a one-level decrease in a random stat.<br />
<br />
Depression (-1)-Bankrupt (-1)-Recession (-1)-Poor (0)-Normal (+1)-Good Enough (+1)-Rich (+2)-Very Rich (+2)-Richest (+3)-Economic Powerhouse (+3)-Monopoly (+4)<br />
<br />
Education<br />
<br />
This is just how your people are... educated, I guess. Obvious enough. With a good education, you have better chances of receiving a “miraculous invention”. It also affects just how advanced are your weapons, and thus the success of your army in a battlefield.<br />
<br />
Once someone reaches Enlightenment education, he becomes able to randomly to get the next age at any following turn. When he does, he loses two education levels.<br />
<br />
None-Dumb-Illiterate-Tolerable-Literate-Educated-Well Educated-Academic-Enlightenment<br />
<br />
Culture<br />
<br />
This is how culturally strong, patriotic and unified your nation is. A nation with a strong culture is less likely to fall into a civil war, and it’s people would resist most invaders and otherwise help their government. This also influences army morale. A weak culture is unlikely to be as resistant to outside threats, there are often rebellions and defections.

People can be fiercely unified and patriotic, but they will not necessarily like their ruler - in fact, a strongly cultured nation with little confidence in its leaders can, in its cultural unity, lynch the rulers and fire their remains from cannons. Into the huge pot filled with boiled sharks. Not that the rulers will care by then... You can grow confidence by economy (propaganda), but wouldn’t it be easier to write a speech or persuade the people that you are the leader they need?<br />

Local equivalent of wonders (that name is inappropriate in most NESes, as these are often modernization programs, national revival and other PROJECTS, not just huge and magnificent buildings). You tell me what it does, I tell you how long do you build it. You don’t have to mention it is being worked on every turn. You can sacrifice an econ. level once for a project to speed it up by two turns.<br />

Education: ALiterate<br />
Culture: Strongly Cultured<br />
Confidence: Nation Personified<br />
Projects: The Grande Armade (5/5), Rashid's Last Ambition (2/5)<br />
Nation Background: The major colonial power. Under the wise tutelage of the Almohad Khalifah, the Almohad Caliphate has grown very powerful. Although now the Christians have landed in the New World, and it may prove difficult to expand.<br />

Capital: Paris<br />

Tech. Level: Early Colonial Age<br />

Navy: 15 Ships<br />
Economy: Rich (+2)<br />
Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Hyperpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Loving<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: Vive le France! After years of Crusades into the Iberian peninsula, and having chosen to protect the pope from the land-grabbing &quot;Holy Roman Emperor&quot; (not to mention war with those pig-headed English), France's military has become like a well-oiled machine, and the people are quite patriotic due to constant war. Although, constant war means the economy suffers, and this nation's economy has recovered only in recent years. France is at a crossroads. Guide it.<br />
<br />
England<br />
Capital: London<br />
Ruler:<br />
Government: Absolute Monarchy<br />
Tech. Level: Early Colonial Age<br />
Army: 13000 Infantry, 6600 Cavalry<br />
Navy: 37 Ships<br />
Economy: Economic Powerhouse (+3)<br />
Education: Educated<br />
Culture: Patriotic<br />
Confidence: Admiring<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: God save the King! England has been at peace rarely with many of the nations of Europe. Seemingly unending war in France, and war in other regions has also made England a powerful force. England is also at a crossroads. Shall it fall, its fair shores conquered by its many rivals? Or shall it rise, and create the empire upon which the sun never sets?<br />
<br />
Scotland<br />
Capital: Edinburgh<br />
Ruler:<br />

Navy: 37 Ships<br />
Economy: Rich (+2)<br />
Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Hyperpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Admiring<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: Fre-eeeedo-oooom! Scotland has every right to be proud! First to discover the new world (let's ignore Leif Erikson, shall we?), able to beat back the English horde, life is good. Although this has inspired confidence in the Scottish kingship, and a great access to resources, it has taken away some of the focus from the land armies and put more focus on the navy. This has resulted in an army that has grown somewhat lax, but don't get me wrong. These Scotsmen can still put up a fight. Take control of the Scots, and show that England (and Almohads) a REAL empire upon which the sun never sets!<br />

Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Uberpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Respecting<br />
Projects: Kalmar Manifest Destiny (+40 Ships +1 Culture) 4/4<br />
Nation Background: The Northmen have reason to be proud. Having wreaked absolute havoc throughout Europe for hundreds of years, united Scandinavia, and a small-time colony in the New World to boot. But watch your back. If a Holy Roman Emperor decides to &quot;get a little more Romanesque glory&quot;, you might find yourself near the top of that hit list... <br />

Education: Academic<br />
Culture: Uberpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Admiring<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: YOU are the true ruler of Rome. Not some damned Italian functioning as the servile ruler to the legacy of Barbarossa! The Papacy is protected by France, and even has raised a small, well-trained army. Will you ever retake Rome?<br />
<br />
Holy Roman Empire<br />

Economy: Economic Powerhouse (+4)<br />
Education: Well-Educated<br />
Culture: Strongly Cultured<br />
Confidence: Loving<br />
Projects: Professional Army (Changes all Infantry to UU) 7/8<br />
Nation Background: The Holy Roman Empire deserves to be proud. They deposed that corrupt Papacy and established a true Papacy, one which ensures the glory of Rome! Although you are one of the most powerful nations of Europe, in conquering all the land that you did, you have stepped on a lot of toes. Tread carefully, lest the nations of Europe bum-rush you…<br />
<br />
Jaigellon Empire<br />
Capital: Budapest (Hungarian Dynasty) and Warsaw (Polish Dynasty)<br />
Ruler:<br />
Government: Dual-Monarchy<br />

Education: Well-Educated<br />
Culture: Hyperpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Respecting<br />
Projects: 'Secrettown' (+2 Economy Levels) (4/4) 'Feudality Town' (1/4)<br />
Nation Background: Out of the fires of war, the two nations of Hungary and Poland have unified as one Empire under two monarchs. They missed-out on the first wave of colonization, although they can still gain a foothold if they put their mind to it. <br />
<br />
Novgorod<br />

Confidence: Nation Personified +<br />
Projects: Onega Sobor (+2 Culture, +1 Confidence) (Complete!)<br />
Narva Haven (+2 Economy, trade routes to England, HRE and France: fur trade)(3/4)<br />
Nation Background: The Novgorodian people should be proud. Much of Russia is unified, and they’ve a strong military, backed with a powerful navy. They even own some holdings in Macbrinea. And the best part of it all is, is that Novgorod has many lands in Finland and Russia left to conquer! Free land! Go forth, mighty Novgorod, and unify the motherland!<br />
<br />
Byzantine Empire<br />
Capital: Constantinople<br />
Ruler: Empress Irene II Palaeologus/Cuivienen<br />

Economy: Very Rich (+3)<br />
Education: Academic<br />
Culture: Nation Personified<br />
Confidence: Admiring<br />
Projects: Revival of Rome (COMPLETE!)<br />
Nation Background: Byzantium is once again on the rise! Not only have the Balkans been reconquered, and the military boosted because of said conquests, but the exploits of the kingship has instilled confidence and patriotism throughout the empire. More and more people call themselves “Byzantine”, and the Byzantines even have a colony in Macbrinea! Bring some Roman civilization to the savages of Macbrinea. <br />
<br />
Il-Khanate<br />
Capital: Baghdad<br />
Ruler: Timur Khan<br />
Government: Khanate<br />
Tech Level: Middle Colonial Age<br />
Army: 8000 Infantry, 4000 Conscript Infantry, 7000 Cavalry, 23 Cannons, 3400 Janissary Mangudai (UU)<br />
Navy: 27 Ships<br />
Economy: Rich (+5)<br />
Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Uberpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Nation Personified<br />
Projects: Islamic Horde (+2 Culture, +2 Confidence, +2 Education) (COMPLETE!)<br />
Great Horde (1/5)<br />
Nation Background: Out of the ashes of Genghis Khan’s conquests, the Il-Khanate has emerged. Although powerful, the land is still somewhat impoverished due to the Mongol sackings and rampages, etc. The navy is also weak, and there is little hope for getting colonies in the new world. Although, play your cards right, and you still might get to witness the Indian chieftains of Macbrinea bow down before the Khan…<br />

Economy: Monopoly (+8)<br />
Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Patriotic<br />
Confidence: Respecting<br />
Projects: Halls of Knowledge (+3 Education, +3 Economy, Cyprus the educational capital of world) (COMPLETE!)<br />
Nation Background: Cyprus, being the island that it is, has a very small army. But, as England, has a well-sized navy to mitigate that. Perhaps there is hope for a “Cypriot Empire”, should you play your cards right…<br />
<br />
Tibet<br />
Capital: Lhasa<br />
Ruler:<br />
Government: Theocratic Monarchy<br />
Tech Level: Middle Colonial Age<br />

Economy: Monopoly (+5)<br />
Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Patriotic<br />
Confidence: Respecting<br />
Projects: Jewel Mines of Mount Kalish (+2 Econ Levels) (COMPLETE!)<br />
Nation Background: Never a very populous nation, Tibet can still be very powerful. You can use your mountain hideaway to your advantage, being able to defend yourself easily, and knowing the terrain like the back of your hand. Watch yourself, however. The mighty Ming-Dynasty Emperors of China may yet seek out a western jewel for their crown.<br />
<br />
Oirat Khanate<br />

Navy: N/A<br />
Economy: Rich (+2)<br />
Education: Educated<br />
Culture: Hyperpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Loving<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: The Mongols once ruled the world, and the Oirat Khanate, home of the Mongol motherland, never forgets it. Although only a shadow of it’s former glorious self, the Mongol horde may very well rise again, if the Oirat Khanate can adapt to this ever-changing world.<br />
<br />
China<br />
Capital: Nanjing<br />
Ruler:<br />
Government: Monarchy<br />
Tech Level: Middle Colonial Age<br />

Navy: 90 Ships<br />
Economy: Monopoly (+4)<br />
Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Uberpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Admiring<br />
Projects: Hong Wu (COMPLETE!)<br />
Nation Background: Under the wise and divine tutelage of the Ming-dynasty sons of heaven, China has reached its zenith. The treasure fleet grows ever-larger, while the army is the most powerful in all of East Asia. Nations from across the world are paying tribute to the mighty emperor of China. Traders all the way from western Europe can be seen in Nanjing’s markets, and representatives from most every nation now kowtow before the emperor in the Forbidden City. But now the Son of Heaven seeks land in this new “Macbrinea”. Will China create a Pacific Empire? Or shall the concubines depose the emperor, just as they did in our world..?<br />
<br />
Japan<br />

Navy: 34 Ships<br />
Economy: Rich (+2)<br />
Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Hyperpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Tolerating<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: Japan is holding on by a thread. The daimyos squabble over who shall be the next Shogun, and the people have little confidence that peaceful times are ahead. With the Ming Dynasty emperors looking on Japan, there may be no more Japan to speak of in the coming years! However, if Sengoku Jidai can be averted, perhaps Japan can also lay claim to land in Macbrinea..<br />

Confidence: Loving<br />
Projects:Empire of the Elephant, +100,000 Infantry, +50,000 Cavalry, +2 Education (3/7)<br />
Nation Background: Siam packs a good deal of diplomatic punch, however it is no match for China should the Ming Dynasty emperors choose to add it to their burgeoning empire. However, if you can gain access to more manpower and resources, Siam may very well become a grand nation…<br />

Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Patriotic<br />
Confidence: Respecting<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: You’re in exactly the same boat as Arakan. Basically, this nation will not likely rise to prominence. It will take a great deal of political skill in order to ensure Cambodia’s survival, much less glory…<br />

Education: Well-Educated<br />
Culture: Patriotic<br />
Confidence: Respecting<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: As Mali, you are in a good position. Not only do you have access to vast tracks of usable land, but you’ve a well-sized army to boot! And, perhaps, Mali can turn itself into a colonial empire, no?<br />
<br />
Benin<br />

Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Hyperpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Admiring<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: Benin has grown VERY rich off of gold, slaves, and commerce. And you have one advantage that few other have: LAND! You can expand in all directions, building an empire spanning the African coast.<br />
<br />
Majapahit<br />
Capital:<br />
Ruler:<br />

Confidence: Loving<br />
Projects: Great Navy of Java (+30 Ships) (COMPLETE!)<br />
Empire of Majapahit-(+50000 infantry, +10000 cavalry) (1/4) <br />
Nation Background: You are on the eastern fringes of Islam, and the fate of Majapahit and all of these hallowed isles is in your hands. Adopt Islam? Resist Islam? And what of the lands beyond the seas..?<br />
<br />

Education: Well-Educated<br />
Culture: Uberpatriotic<br />
Confidence: Admiring<br />
Projects: Templar Macbrinean Trading Company (Creates Templar Trade Dominance in much of Macbrinea) (COMPLETE!)<br />
Nation Background: Having been forced from Europe, the Knights Templar, who had once crusaded across the Holy Lands (although ITTL, much moreso in Iberia), now seek to begin a new life in Macbrinea. Their warriors are dedicated, their people are loving of their king, and already things look promising for the Knights of the Holy Order. Who knows? Perhaps a reconquest of Iberia isn't all as impossible as it seems...<br />

Navy: 3 Ships<br />
Economy: Rich (+2)<br />
Education: Literate<br />
Culture: Patriotic<br />
Confidence: Loving<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: The Karankawa, being among the closest of the American tribes to Arab traders, has grown rich and powerful. Although, as with most Native American tribes, their population is low, a far cry from the days of the Mississippian mound-builders or the Anasazi peoples. However, this may all change as your mighty empire grows. Shall you adopt Islam? Or shall the Great Spirit still be worshipped among the Karankawa?<br />

Education: Illiterate<br />
Culture: Patriotic<br />
Confidence: Loving<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: Although not what it used to be, the Messipa people still are powerful, and due to the fertility of her lands, have a greater army than those of the surrounding nations. However, they must work very hard if they are to keep up technologically.<br />

Culture: Patriotic<br />
Confidence: Loving<br />
Projects:<br />
Nation Background: In order to succeed, the Apalachee must deal both with the foreign threats of a Venetian land-based invasion and an Almohad invasion by way of the sea, along with low population and horrible education, which at this point is still not any more than by word-of-mouth.<br />

We would like to strike a deal. We ask that you do not claim any territories across the Rio Grande. In fact, perhaps all lands in Texas are best left untouched by you, noble Khalifah. In return, we will ally with you and assist you in your various conquests in these lands, your Highness.<br />

The Dalai Lama asks for a Pact of Non-Agression from the Khan, and asks perhaps for a lucrative exchange of goods. A trade route?</div>

Nation Background: Cyprus, being the island that it is, has a very small army. But, as England, has a well-sized navy to mitigate that. Perhaps there is hope for a “Cypriot Empire”, should you play your cards right…<br />
<br />
Question: Is Cyprus mostly Muslim or mostly Christian? What type of government is it? Who is the ruling class, Muslims or Christians? What religion does the government adhere to? <br />
<br />
Is there anyway I could be a secular government?  ;) <br />
<b>To All Nations Surrounding Us:</b><br />
From Cyprus<br />
<br />
We request an NAP. We are a peaceful nation who wishes to remain that way.<br />
<br />
<i>Orders:</i><br />

Grow economy.</div>
