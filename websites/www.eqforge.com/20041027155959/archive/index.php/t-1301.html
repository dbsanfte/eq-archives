I'm working on a diverging tech tree with 5 branches.  So I will try to help you.....do you have ICQ???  I have ideas but putting them into action is tough.  <br />
<br />
Also....EVERYONE is doing a star trek scenario!!!  Although mine is still unique from any I've played so far but again....mine is mainly and idea with only a few parts completed.  But it will be unique.....as I have heard nothing like it so far!!<br />
<br />
Now...I only know of 4 quadrants, so I guess this is a creative extension of the Star Trek universe http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif?  And in ST: Voyager the star date is 53000 + (Starts at around 47000-48000 to 53000 now, I think)<br />
<br />
So just ICQ me or post questions here and I'll try to help!<br />

WELL IF WE HAD A CHAT ROOM TF!!!!! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif we wouldn't have this problem.  But I'll be working tomorrow between 9 AM to 7:30 PM (EST) So I'll talk to you after that I guess.<br />
<br />
Are you planing to do a diverging tech tree???  Or a branching tech tree.<br />
My Star Trek scenario has 5 branches.  I have the Borg one completed.  The Romulan, Klingon, and Federation are going to be tougher.  And Species 8472 will be simple, one tech http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif  I'm going to have Warp Tech....a tech the Feds get it first 2nd or 3rd, the klingons get it about the same time (2nd or 3rd) but the Romulans will get it later (like they did in the show) 5th or 6th.  This is my toughest challange!!!  I could just make 3 warp techs for each race but that's too easy.  I need to challange myself!!!  I'm also doing the same thing with Cloak.  Romulans get is around 3rd or 4th while the Klingos get it later 7th or 8th.  But this one will be easier.  Anyway....<br />

So I came up with the Kappa Quadrant. It's stardate 60000 +, Voyager has returned home (they found the other Caretaker), Janeway is Admiral. A higher being has taken a part of the Federation, Romulan, Klingon, Borg, Cardassian and Dominion to the Kappa Quadrant and made it impossible for everyone to reach. It's some kind of experiment. <br />
<br />
That's the story of my next scenario (I started working on this one a long time ago, but I left it for a while). I've copied a few units from Kabyashi (with his acknowledgement, and I 've made similar units (Griffin-class, Assimilator, Assembler, Jach'Eng and many more) the same way he did.<br />
<br />
I have just one problem:<br />
The tech tree. Does anyone want to help me with this one? It's a bit complicated, because the techs are already the same as in Voyager or ST: Insrrection. So there have to be a few new techs (Time Travel) and techs that are very new and that enable Starships (Corbomile Reflector ---&gt; Sovereign-class, Phase-cloaking ---&gt; Shadow-class (R),)<br />
<br />
Hope to get reactions soon!<br />

That structure would be ideal to manipulate the tech for Cornmaster's purposes. Just start the Roms further away in the loop from Warp drive etc.<br />
<br />
Techs beyond the Voyager era are tough. Let be get back to you on that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2001, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's very hard to think of good techs that are very new or are almost discovered. I've used the ST:Armada techs already.<br />
<br />
About species 8472. What are they exactly. I know they can not be assimilated and are very dangerous to the Borg and stuff, but what are they? Some kind of insects? <br />
<br />
In my scenario, there will be a few weapons like the Nuke. The Romulan have the Phoenix-class, the Klingon the Jach'Eng (Shockwave), the Federation the Premenition-class and they all wilol be able to build the Omega Particle Weapon when they have the right technology.<br />
<br />
But still. Explain specxies 9472 to me, please.<br />

It is an interdimension place and not part of our normal universe. <br />
<br />
The only known way to kill them is to use modified nano probes which are an amalgation of Borg and Federation technology. These probe thingies can be loaded onto photon torpedoes.<br />
<br />
They are are not insects. The closest way I can describe them is as space aged centaurs. Also just touching them will cause some virus thing to go into your body and that will kill you after severe painful disfigurement.</div></div><hr />

And the Cloak won't work the same either.  Is the tech tree &quot;Hard coded&quot; with the cost of the techs???  If I were to put one in the place of Alphabet and one next to recycling.....the recycling will cost way more right??  Even though they could be the same for 2 races!!!  This could get tough.  Anyway....anyone have the stats for how the techs work???  How much each one costs in relation to each other???  Doing 5 seperate branches will be tough!!<br />
<br />
Also does anyone know if you can have more of the same improvment???  Like each race have a different type of marketplace (Borg and 8472 has none of course http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif)  Basically 3 improvements with the same effect.  (I think I just answered my own question (Marketplace/bank/stock market, all equal +50% trade))<br />
<br />
Anyway...got to go.<br />

I want them all to have techs for their own and for techs that everyone has. Others are just for three species, etc. It's very hard. Today I reduced my &quot;Station Guardian&quot; units to seven (one for each civ), and the free spots are taken by other Spaceships. This scenario will be a real Spaceship scenario. <br />
<br />
Another thing, what do you think is better? A start like in the Antarctic scenario of JV, with just one, two or three cities, or with already a little empire of about ten cities?<br />

<br />
Federation:   Premenition-class, comes with  the Time Travel advance. Ofcourse you can't timetravbel in the game, but it's a really strong unit (25a, 15d). I'm thinking of creating it with an event in pre-timetravel time.<br />
<br />
Romulan: Phoenix-class, comes with Time-Rift creation. It creates a rift in the Space-Time-Continuüm in which itself is destroyed, just like everything it attackes. (99a,3d)<br />
<br />
Klingon: Jach'Eng-class, comes with Shockwave Technology. It creates a large shockwave and destroys everything (including himself). 99a 3d.<br />
<br />
Others: Omega Weapon. Comes with Omega Particle Control and with the wonder Omega Weapon Project. 99a 0d.<br />

Scotty tells Kirk that the Enterprise can overtake a Romulan ship because &quot;Their power is simple Impulse&quot;. Ever since that time (in 1966) the Romulan tech has been locked into no Warp drive untill after the Federation and Klingons have it. <br />

By the way. I thaught the Romulans had Warp capability long before the humans had. Did they leave Vulcan 2000 years ago with ships without warp?<br />

I've always wanted to make a scenario on a large map where the tribes have cities clustered together so that they are all far apart from other tribes...for instance, 5 cities, close together and the next closest tribe is at one of the adjacent corners...<br />

<br />
If you really want to thank me, you can consider doing a review of STBAQ on S-League when you are done with STKappaQ. Someone gave me a lowly 20/30 score for some reason or other.<br />
<br />
p.s. did you read the long winded stuff at the bottom of the STDW readme? I put it there for other designers to have some ideas.</div></div><hr />

I must really thank you. You are a real inspiration, I must say. I studied your events files (Of BAQ and Dominion) for hours before I started creating the ST: Kappa Quadrant scenario. I'm almost finished with that one, by the way. I just have to add two more sounds and I have to replace two unit graphics. I already have another idea for another scenario. But that one 'll have to wait, until I've finished this one. (sorry for all the guys who like to play 16th-17th century games, 'cause I'm gonna wait a bit longer with creating the next episode, I just want to know more and have better experience with making scenarios: my first scenario wasn't very good, I think)<br />

But I have to finish ST:KQ first (as you wrote). I'm pretty far, units are done now. The only things to do are the icons, and just a few things i the scenbario itself. Ofcourse John Valdez was a great inspiration, too. His two ST modpacks were the first Civ II ST mods I played. But right from the beginning, I wanted to play a ST modpack that is only in space. Then, I played your scenarios (after a while, because I hadn't got FW for a while: I just got it 3 weeks ago. I downloaded them earlier, though). Those were just great. I don't know why. I especially liked the chapter thing around it. And I must say, you are really a ST expert. You must have watched every episode of every ST about five times! <br />

But so far it looks pretty cool!!!!  Are the ships, Land Units???  Or Sea Units???  Mine are going to be sea units so that they can all carry torpedos, missiles, etc....<br />
<br />
The ships will be VERY STRONG.  The strongest weapon is the Federation Quantum Torpedo at (10-0-8--1-4), The strongest Klingon weapon is Ion Torpedo at (7-0-5--1-3) and the Romulans have the Plasma-A at (9-0-5--1-4).  The Klingons look disadvantaged but their weapons are cheaper.  Also all races have access to the Tri-Cobalt Device at a whopping (15-0-3--1-5).  So the ships and shields are going to have to be very strong.  The hardest part will be balancing the game.  And adding improvements.  Ugghhh!!  I hate adding improvments!<br />

Why did I use the Ferengi Marauder? Hmm. I think I'm going to replace it with something, but I don't know what, yet. I wanted to include the Ferengi at first, too, but it didn't seem very logical a whole quadrant was inhabited, so I replaced the Ferengi for the Kev'Sor.<br />

I enjoy the wonders, but the improveents.... Most of my improvements came from Kobayashi, I believe I forgot giving him credit for that, sorry kobayashi. I'll change that soon. Cm, do you think 400 turns is too long for this? <br />

I don't know who will be able to build it or what I will call it....but I got one there.  All that babbling I was doing in the second paragraph of my first post was what my scenario is like right now.<br />
 Yes. I think your question is very good....<br />
Well?  You didn't answer it.  But I will assume from the roads you build that it's land units.<br />
<br />
Anyway.....I forgot what I was going to say next.....so....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 16, 2001, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I want to play. Send to me (sound too and music if possible) at <br />
<br />

<br />
NO I only watched a handful of episodes five times although I think I have watched every episode of every sereies atleast once. Its more important to have the ST encyclopedia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Mar 16, 2001, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh....I forgot....Why do you have a Frengi Maurder as a ship for everyone???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Mar 17, 2001, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, they are land units. The Marauders take the place of the partisans. They were they only acceptable unit I could find for partisans. If a city is taken, Marauders will show up, and a message will pop up:<br />
<br />
Ferengi Marauders, paid by the %STRING0%, show up around %STRING1% to reconquer it from the %STRING2%.<br />
<br />
And Kobayashi, the sound and music files are very large. Sorry, I don't think my father agrees with me on this. You'll have to download it in the download collection, as soon as its available there. That encyclopedia is a good idea, I wanted to buy it months ago, but I couldn't find it elsewhere tham in Germany.<br />

Of course, I'm always moving in about 10 different directions, depending on the time I have...hehe<br />

<br />
It sounds really good...we need more Star Trek scenarios with good ideas like this...<br />
<br />
I'd like to see something about the &quot;Q&quot;...we need a scenario about that...<br />

I'm waiting if they found out anything. Until I hear something, I'll go on with my next project, the war between species 8472 and the Borg......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Mar 22, 2001, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. And thanks for the things you wrote in your mail. I'm going to use some of them. How can I make Voyager 'unkillable', by giving them a 99d? <br />
About the scenario, I thought this:<br />
<br />
The Borg get the chance to assimilate one or two species in the Delta Quadrant first, for say 50 turns, that way they'll have a acceptable defence. Then, they receive &quot;Interdimensional Travel&quot;, two gates open and Bioships appear and attack the Borg, destroying large ammounts of their ships. Then after a few turns, the gates close, and Voyager comes into contact with the Borg. Nothing happens. The gate opens again, bioships attack, gate closes after 20 turns. When Voyager comes into contact with Species 8472, the Borg receive the technology that is able to kill Species 8472 as soon as they talk to the Federation again. <br />
<br />
How does that sound?<br />

The sounds will stay the same, though. There will also be a few new events.<br />
