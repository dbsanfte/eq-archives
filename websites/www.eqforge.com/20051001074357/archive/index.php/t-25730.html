<br />
Both of these exploits can technically be hidden by smart play and both exploits have an overpowering effect on the final score in a game.<br />
<br />
The first major exploit is the &quot;Soylent Green&quot; or &quot;Worker Dogpile&quot; exploit that has been discussed in the GOTM8 spolier thread which lets you add 1000's of extra workers as specialists in one of your cities.<br />
<br />
The second major exploit is posted in separate thread and lets you double count your shields as wealth and production in every turn:<br />
<br />
Gold Miner's Exploit (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=25728) <br />
<br />
AT least if these exploits are accurately declared on the GOTM rules page, then every player will have access to their use in future games even if the use is technically forbidden but undetectible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway I can't see gold as ever being a huge problem. Who puts their cities on wealth. I only do it at the end of the game.</div></div><hr />

If your taking a poll, include my vote for &quot;yes&quot;, to ban these &quot;bugs&quot; from GOTM.  If they are not, people who would not normally use them will feel inclined to do so, in order to stay competitive (myself included :( ). <br />
<br />
In a related matter, these &quot;bugs&quot; should also be banned from the tournament.</div></div><hr />

Could you summarize the first bug you mention? I don't wanna search through the whole spoiler thread... :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bamspeedy</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you summarize the first bug you mention? I don't wanna search through the whole spoiler thread...  <br />
<br />
Basically, there is no limit on city size.  Just build a hospital (in your capital for example), then dump your extra workers all into your capital.  You only lose one citizen per turn to starvation.  Then every city that has a specialist you have it build a worker.  This worker goes to the capital.  The city that built the worker now has more food to produce yet another worker.  So you are continually making more specialists.  you can have a population higher than normally could be possible on a map.<br />
<br />
In my current HoF game I have over 9,000 citizens in my capital and only lose 1/turn to starvation.  i can continually add 150-200 per turn to this city.  Every specialist is worth 1 point * difficulty level, so since I am playing Regent, my capital is worth 27,000+ pts.</div></div><hr />

The workpile bug would show up in a integrity test.  If you request say 1850 year and compare with the 2050 year ?  The increase in the pop score through piling would be way out of normal parameters <br />

Some players after they finish their game, they delete all the saves except the 10 A.D. and the last save, as to free up space on their computer.  Some people after they know for sure, that Matrix has received their saves, will delete these 2 saves also.  You can't then just assume they are guilty, because they don't have the save(s) you want.<br />
<br />
It depends how much of an extreme they take this too, when you look at the final score.  The histograph screen breaks the score down and shows the average # of happy/content/specialists.  If their average is alot higher than their final population, something is wrong.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, if we watched the replay, we would be wondering why the heck they destroyed a city with only a few turns remaining.</div></div><hr />

Why destroy the city just add enough workers so that they all stave to make a proper looking city at 2050AD?<br />
<br />
For example, city has a size 20 at 1750AD add 200 workers. Don't add any more workers and in the year 2050AD the city is size 20 and no need to destroy a city.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't dogpile for points, the routine can allow you to quickly fill all your cities to their theoretical limit. Who is to say what is too many points for a map and who did and who did not use a slimy tactic?<br />

I was not aware of just what could be done with this exploit until this month, but I do like to put all of my workers into cities the next to last turn.  I usually scatter them around though, so I can get an extra point or two.  (It really does not affect the score much this late in the game)<br />
<br />
Would this be disallowed as well?  Or what if I want to use the Palace junp routing and I use the workers to build up a city further from my capital to make it attractive for the jump?  Is that allowed or disallowed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't consider using workers to get say, a city from size 6 to size 25 is unethical at all, provided the city has enough food for the 25.  I'm sure that has been done by lots of people when they have all their terrain improved and they have a bunch of workers left over.  I'm sure that has gone on for a long time.  If they use this tactic, it would be impossible to judge based on the score whether or not they used it.<br />
<br />
What I was saying is, if you look at their 2049 A.D. save and it shows in thier score that they had an average of say 1200  citizens, but if you add up all their cities' pop and it only amounts to 900-1000, something is seriously wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always clean up my game files.  I can't stand having that many to look at.  It also gets confusing between GOTM files, Tournament files, personal games, and mayby a HOF game that you are trying to do.  By cleaning up the save files it is easier to manage and less scrolling to do.  So it is not always a matter of Hard drive space but number of files.  The civ names overlap sometimes too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the top cities is fine even if it is a bit unrealistic to learn of a city two continents away at 4000 BC.  The other one though, of using the rename should be disallowed.  It would only be a minor help, but it can immediately let you know who is close (culturally linked starting positions) and what starting techs there are.<br />
<br />
Still, this is a small one in comparison to the others.</div></div><hr />

I have the same problem with different saves etc, just create more folders and drag them into there, so your main folder is not cluttered up. Seperate them in GOTM,HOF,PERSONAL ETC &amp; JUNK.<br />
It really doesnt take much time at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2002, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the Specialist city exploit, did we reach a consensus on the resolution (eg. Spinner in the editor on starvation or max size etc).<br />
<br />
I think that the most elegent resolution is that starvation remains at 1 per turn (to prevent seige starvation), but you can only add workers to a city if there is sufficient excess food.  Ie- can't even artificially raise max pop by one.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to give another savegame besides of the last turn, but some might appreciate it if you give a savegame of around 1 AD or so. :)</div></div><hr />

I thought of another one based on your point. Knowing the names and order of cities for each civ and the existing civs (using the Renaming Exploit), we can find out the number of cities each civ has during any turn.</div></div><hr />

Well, I wrote this in the HoF thread, but I'll post it here to explain what it is:<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
BTW, Bamspeedy... and all of the other high scoring players... How do you get so many cities SO QUICKLY!?!? (like in Bamspeedy's post for the 500 AD game...)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I'm using a variation of Aeson's settler flood. You can read his article here: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showt...&amp;threadid=20422 <br />
<br />
JuicycivNewbie also wrote an article explaining some more details and a slightly different variation of it: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showt...&amp;threadid=25817 <br />
<br />
And in case you didn't see it, you can see a screenshot of the settler flood in action on this page: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showt...=&amp;pagenumber=19 <br />
(towards the bottom of that page, my response after God's)<br />
<br />
Works best on huge pangea maps. Expansionists, so you get a huge tech lead, and either industrious (fast workers), or Religious (cheap temples). Build cities real close right at the start. It seems like your territory starts off small, but it will quickly expand like crazy. All cities basically just build settlers or workers, build chariots/horseman (for later upgrade to knights) in between the production of settlers when possible. On a huge map, you should have 50-100 chariots built by the time you get chivalry.  The hard part is deciding how many workers to build, because the more workers you build the fewer settlers you are building. But if you don't have enough workers laying down roads, that will slow your expansion alot (wandering settlers). <br />
<br />
You first of course want to pump out about 20 scouts as soon as you can, to grab all the goody huts.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the game check with your opponents EVERY turn, to sell maps and to check if they have any workers for sale. On the lower levels there is less of a chance of getting workers. In the first 100 turns or so, I only had the chance to buy 2 workers.<br />
<br />
At the start basically all you want workers to do is mine grassland (around your productive region only, irrigate everything in your high-corrupt areas) and build roads, roads being the most important. The longer a settler is wandering around, the longer it takes for it/the future city to build another settler. When done properly, you nearly double your territory every 15-20 turns or so. I had 141 cities at 10 A.D. and 331 at 500 A.D.<br />
<br />
Normally after you have a big power lead on the AI you can start demanding cities from them and have those cities building you more cities. But in the game I'm playing now I had those cities just build me more workers, to lay roads to help my future expansion. But, the downside to this was that the roads also help the AI expand:o .<br />
<br />
Give your neighbor Masonry ASAP, so he can build the Pyramids for you (take him out with swordsmen/horsemen/or knights depending on what you have). You might have a bunch of warriors built before you hooked up your horses, so all those warriors you can upgrade (you only need 1 barracks for this).<br />
<br />
Gotm notes: This should work well, since this month it is a large map with few civs.  I'm not playing the game so I don't know the landmass, but pangea is best for this, but continents will work.  Remember GOTM6, where we started on another continent than the rest and Aeson got domination with this (without warfare!).  You would need to build a navy to ferry all your settlers if this is the case.  Emperor level will be alot harder to pull this off.  Egyptians are industrious so that will help ALOT with laying down roads, but they are not expansionists so you won't get the huge early tech lead from goody huts.<br />
<br />
This tactic is best if you can use the scout blocking of iron (NOT ALLOWED IN GOTM), but it will still work.  This tactic is basically using ICS, which is unregulated by the rules.  ICS is a little more complex than just putting cities two tiles away in every direction, read JuicyCivNewbie's article for details of city placement.</div></div><hr />
