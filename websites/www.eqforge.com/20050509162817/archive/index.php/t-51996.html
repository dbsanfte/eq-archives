<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">one urgent question:<br />
HOW EXACTLY is is possible to down the despot? we can not support units at the moment, so is it done in personal fight?<br />
<br />
where and how as this fight being declared? will there be a &quot;general action announcement&quot; thread?<br />
<br />
this could go the following way: in the above thread, all major actions (birth of characters, death of characters, events, wars, all things effecting a character) has to be posted with a short summary and a link to the detailed roleplay.<br />
a kind of a &quot;action index&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The despot will need to appoint people to run his lands. Those people will have direct control of the assets of those lands including their troops. A general revolution will likely be required to remove the despot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyways, wont direct one-on-one fighting of characters be better in the beginning?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure that there will be direct one-on-one fighting of characters. There will probably be a period of anarchy after a despot falls where everybody pursues the throne grab. Before and after such periods there can still be as much inter-character conflict as the players wish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">URGENT:<br />
in the despot thread massive usage and posting of out of tech weaponry like long sticks and shiny blades are used. the manager should check for it.<br />
also plexu's claims for the throne seem to be unheard as bootstoots is taking over work of the dictator without workin' with the other conquestors...<br />
<br />
i may be wrong, but i also spotted &quot;character grouping&quot; of some players who let their own created characters play in groups without roleplaying which relation they have (like for example creating 7 characters to let them fight together).<br />
which is wrong imho as the characters should work as individuals (i could understand if they would be somehow related or employed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hy ct, i posted a graveyard thread for characters:<br />
http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=52619<br />
<br />
this may be used to dump dead characters into to free up space in the character thread.<br />
<br />
i also think that should be run as non-profit thread instead of a business (i first indended to run it as business). but we should charge for entries into an index of crypts in there :-) only rich families can afford to have famous graves listed in the books of the graveyard.<br />
<br />
please check the possibility and together with that also the possibility of stickyness.<br />
<br />
the idea is:<br />
we have single-person graves and family graves/crypts. each grave or crypt is represented by one post maintained by the player of the dead character. only related (family or other direct relation) characters may lie within one grave/crypt with one exception:<br />
on mass events which will not allow single graves (catastrophees where the bodies cant be divided, plagues etc) the event manager (responsible manager for the even causing the death) posts a mass-grave with all the names affected in the graveyard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
i opened a mass grave for all character which died till now here (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=962779#post962779). please feel free to post all dead characters there.<br />
<br />
if there is a tech problem until ceremonial burrial, we could extend that mass-grave for all deaths until we reach that tech.</div></div><hr />

i am pretty concerned about the recent tendency to &quot;tune&quot; the rules against the people to their disadvantage.<br />
example:<br />
octavian plans to cut down tile income (which is not his job at all) and to disallow legions as units (which he should have done after the last TC).<br />
he was requested often enough to give comment on troop raising, but a manager who is quiet for days after days and suddenly pops up and deletes everything done within those days can heavily disrupt the game.<br />
<br />
i would not comment on that if he had posted the &quot;no legions until iron connected&quot; when it was discussed in his thread. nor if stuck would have announced the &quot;income cut&quot; as soon as the first incomes were posted.<br />
but now we had several days going with people calculating income, making plans, raising troops.... the work of those people would be destroyed with one silly blow.<br />
<br />
we should stick with the principle of the previous game:<br />
all existing things which were done within the ruleset will continue to exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 20, 2003, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's stop making new rules until we get this damn thing figured out. This is getting to the point of being rediculous. Stop!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 20, 2003, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">rules would have prevented the situation which we have not in conflict-management.<br />
if the basic settings (heck, we dont even have a rule on upgrading units!) would have been thought about in advance, we would have all been clear.<br />
<br />
nothing against tuning the rules in general. but as soon as someone has used the rule the manager has to put in his veto!<br />
not wait several days until all people already used the rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 20, 2003, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd stop with the rules totally. We have once again gotten so far away from storytelling that it's getting tedious. At this point I can't even contribute. I had an excellent thing going with the Witch Doctors but I barely have time to establish a character, much less have him do something, before he dies. The rest is essentially a turbo version of &quot;The Dating (Mating?) Game&quot;.<br />

More complexity isn't needed. More stories are. To get more stories the characters need to be around long enough to care about them and for them to be recognized.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Military production is NOW being held up because Octavian X doesn't want the gold produced from land tiles to be converted into shields or food. This goes directly against the ruleset. And I quote:<br />
<br />
 7. Land provides a number of gold, shields and food that it would generate if worked in a city. If no city controlled by the tile owner can access the tile it never makes more than what is shown when right clicking on the tile in the game. Gold can be converted to food or shields with one gold making 1/2 of either. If currency hasn’t been discovered yet all gold produced must be taken as shields or food.<br />
<br />
8. Cities produce the number of gold, shields and food for the tile they reside on plus an additional gold for each population point.<br />
<br />
Addition<br />
9. A land registry may not be kept until MapMaking. <br />
<br />
9. A single contiguous land territory that has at least 5 * P (where “P” is the number of provinces in the demogame) will receive an additional gold per tile in the territory. If the territory has 10 * P receives 2 gold per tile in the territory and one that has 15 * P receives 3 gold per tile in the territory.<br />
<br />
I also included the contiguous land territory bonus rule here so there could be no fudging on that part. Gold produced is gold produced. The rules state that we can convert it. Octavian is trying to make it dificult to raise troops for the people who have gold. I do not like to be singled out like this. I sure noone does. Please rectify the situation. Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cyc - I agree with you this time.  The rules clearly state that gold is to be converted to food or shields at a rate of 1 gold=1/2 food or shields.  BTW, CT, please do not enact any rules prohibiting multiple countries.  It will be more interesting to have many nations, as it will add the aspect of foreign affairs.  If we had one nation, there would be about an eight-way struggle for one despotism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's time for me to leave the RPG world. I believe this game has far too many ill-defined rules. The important rules are so vague that we always need interpretation on the simplest move. The game is so Manager-driven that we always have to turn to them to know if our next baby step is going to be allowed. Problem is, the Managers are so sluggish in their response, that the players are left standing around with their thumb....never mind. You Managers can't have it both ways. Ignoring calls for rulings is just plain stupid (to quote a Manager). It's just to bizzare. If you want the entire game wrappedaround your little finger, then be here to determine the way things unfold. I am leaving the game. In the last RPG, the players had the most say as to what goes on. In this game it is too manager-driven. Three cheers for Shaitan and his great job of running DG2 RPG. THAT was a good RPG. Hasta la Vista, baby.</div></div><hr />
