And it HAD to be Abe... Yep, good ol' Abe of DG1 fame. So, What do we do with him? We dont know where he lives, what his cities are. All we DO know is that hes got 3 of 'em and one is building the Colloseus. Ya gotta love the AI....<br />

So, here is my first sponsored discussion:<br />
<br />
&quot;Much Ado About Abe&quot; <br />
<br />
Friend? Enemy? Thing we will roll over with our superior Legions?<br />

Discuss!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe... but I still think we should crush him like a bug.  In my experience, the americans are often one of the superpowers later in the game (not quite sure why, cos thier special unit sucks), so it would be good to cripple them early.  Plus, just seeing another civ gets my warmongering twitch going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheep</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">However think of the science boost a close relationship with themwould bring.  We could then crush them when we are more ready and would reap greater benefit from the cities they would of built by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, we could do that...<br />
But it would be more fun to crush them right now!<br />
OK, OK, I see that maybe we should hold off a little while.  But not too long or I'll have to go crush them by myself!<br />

My gut, though, says 'attack early, attack often.'  :D</div></div><hr />

We'll be able to extract tech from them that way without having to part with any of our own - provided we don't get overenthusiatic and end up wiping him out too soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheep</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">es but I feel if we let the grow a bit, not only will the spoils be bigger, but the advantages for all will be best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we should introduce Abe to our Legionaries when the time comes.  I wouldn't make a move until we are sure we can easily claim some Iron.<br />
<br />
Let's maximize ourselves now by building a few more cities.  This will give us the production we need to take him out early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eklektikos</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nowhere did I advocate making Abe our only punchbag ;)<br />
<br />
Generally I find it more advantageous to neuter the nearest civ very early on if I plan to do it at all, since it ensures that I have plenty of room to expand on my own terms and place cities exactly where I want them in relation to the capital and local resources. We'd still be able to get a bit of tech out of them, and could then go after larger, more profitable civs once we've established a decent production base later on.</div></div><hr />

It's been, probably 50-60 turns already, so the scount could have traveled quite a ways by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably not too far. I'd estimate that DC is within 20-30 tiles of Noshuret based on the time to meeting the scout. More importantly it tells us we're not on a little single civ island! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that we should try to expand our terretroy towards abe as fast as possible.. This will give him less land to expand on. In the meantime we should research a lot and try get a long away ahead of him. When we have the scientific upperhand we can build our army and chrush him..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eklektikos</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tech lead makes little or no difference militarily in the ancient era past Iron Working and Horseback Riding, and we would be foolish to wait until our Legions are superceded as an offensive unit before launching an attack. This is without taking into account the fact that even at Monarch the science race is no cakewalk, since the AI can still trade techs more cheaply than we can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did manage to take out a civ in term 1 of DG1, and then a 2nd in the first week of term 2.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We don't know that yet. We have no idea what the territory on the other side of Washington looks like. Heck, we have no concrete idea of where Washington is yet.</div></div><hr />

Even if we could limit their expansion via our own and thereby out-research them, we would most likely end up behind the other Civs in the game both in terms of research and military capability. It will be safer and more efficient to concentrate on cash generation and military prowess with an eye to tech trading and extortion in the future.</div></div><hr />

And now we should start building warriors. It seems the Abe is going to get the collosuss and if he doesn't then he will get another wonder. I suggest taking it from him before its too late... hehe</div></div><hr />

In all of my single player games, if the americans have a good start (which they probably do if they are building the Collosus) and expand good then they will e a TECH FACTORY. Probably the only way to get ahead is if we attack them for thier techs and supposedly good terrain for a FP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should settle more to the west. there is no one else there and it is our grounds. we have some great sites, as previously show. I for one would like to see a city on the 2 wheat and fish site  Penguinadua... Penguinadua  We build there, build up infastructure and then live as Rome did (prior to 400AD)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Careful, Washington could be closer than many appear to think.  The AI doesn't seem to go in straight lines when scouting, and there is that undiscovered country directly to our NE.  We need to put a priority on uncovering the uknown in our own back yard as soon as possible to avoid any nasty surprises.<br />
<br />
At least the remaining goody huts (if any) to the W should be ours for the taking unless there is another civ lurking to the S.  Of course that could be a bad thing given how often we seem to be getting barbs...  :eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am basicly against war. If we see that abe doesnt own very much terretory and that he is no threat we may &quot;keep&quot; him for a while. If we find that abe is very powerful we should sabotage for him by taking some of his land but still having him as a friend. We should however not take any action that will make him angry at us before we know his terretory better...</div></div><hr />
