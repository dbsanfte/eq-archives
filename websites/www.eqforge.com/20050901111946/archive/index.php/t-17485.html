A small map with six opponents and arid/cold/3billion years AND such a starting location (from the picture, haven't seen it yet...). <br />
<br />
This time it will really be a challange!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm disappointed that the map is a small map though - it may not make the best use of the American F15, which would be more beneficial for the larger maps. I even wonder if the game may be over before I get to the F15!</div></div><hr />

No spoiling please. That it's a small map isn't that big of a deal, F-15's (and planes in general) aren't really useful on any settings anyways.  Getting an earlier Golden Age with wonders is a good idea with the Americans.</div></div><hr />

You must be a student - only people I know who have enough time on their hands to do this sort of thing..... ;)</div></div><hr />

Aesons post gave me the impression that other spots of the map aren`t better - and that`s info i shouldn`t have had before I started! no offence, Aeson!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 01, 2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Killer.  I figured &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot; were implied with the settings, and subjective terms at that.  I've played a few games on similar settings and so am familiar with what maps of this sort look like.  Didn't mean to spoil it for you.<br />
<br />
And as for being able to play so much... insomnia is good for something I guess.</div></div><hr />

 I played for a few turns and will have to make another attempt. I had a raging war with the russians going. I did not plan properly she started to put the whipping on me. :D I play warlord level way to much! :crazyeyes <br />

<br />
And... recent college grads like myself looking for programming jobs in an economy that's &quot;crud&quot; as one person put it. :)<br />
<br />
I think I'll take a stab at it. The starting posistion doesn't look too terrible (2 luxeries, easy for irrigation, and hills and mountains provide production). I'm holding my own in a Regant SG (similar terrain, but a slightly worse starting posistion - no lakes or rivers for irragation! - so I'll try this one just for the challenge. I'll probably lose though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, the civ that beat me had 15 times the score as the 2nd place team! (4 times ahead of me, in last). Quite remarkable for having to travel a long distance... I defended well though, and one other civ gave up on conquering me. :D</div></div><hr />

 I was not under the impression that my utter defeat was a spoiler - I guess mentioning encounters was sorry again It was my medication not me :crazyeyes Seriously in the future I will refrain until after GOTM before making comments. Peace. :cool:</div></div><hr />

Or just use Matrix´ mail adresses here:<br />
just this<br />
m.c.lensink@home.nl<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!<br />
:D<br />

EDIT: I just sent both of my GOTM submission to Matrix and saw that the lower adress is now the official one! Deleting the other.</div></div><hr />

but then I just finished it in time to submit.<br />
when I saw the starting position, I searched arround and then became a major naval power.<br />
think I ended up on 6 different landmasses.<br />
<br />
Russians didn't attack me till late when I block the border I had with them and they wanted to get through to attack the french.<br />
and then I did hedgehog defense (make the cities and hills with fortified troops with arterily and aircraft and just wear them down.<br />
<br />
been spending too much time with earth and beyond testing to play and my win2000 was getting unstable so I couldn't finish one month.<br />
<br />
oh well. I never will win any awards, I tend to play the civilized, perfectionist type.</div></div><hr />
