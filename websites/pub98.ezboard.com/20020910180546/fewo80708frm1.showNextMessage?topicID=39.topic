Vincent..k....McMahon....<br><br>Vince walks out with a piece of paper and walks down to the ringside, then into the ring through the ropes, and walks the papaer over to the table and vince grabs a microphone.....<br><br>Vince: Welcome everyone to ewo and welcome to mic foleys soon to be demise....so it seems my wifes a bitch...it seems she doesnt know jack @#%$ about this company, and it also seems i can get my people to write up a contract, so mic id like you to come down to the ring right now...<br><br>Mic's music hits with foley walking out to a chorus of cheers, and makes his way down to ring side and rolls through the ropes...<br><br>Foley: Look you three i know you have a plan at the ppv and thats great but from here on till then, its my night and its my ewo, and once stampede comes...its still my show, ahahaha, so you want me to make this match official, thats great, gimme the damn papaers, id loce to sign for the caskets of both of your funerals...<br><br>Mic without looking signs the papers, then out from the crowd non other than dr death jumps out, and you can here scratching from the announers booth, and when the camera looks at the ring, death takes shane and throws him over the ropes, and then he grabs eric bischoff and slams his head to the table, then laid him on the table with yells from good ol jr who now is taking care of announcing for the night..<br><br>Death then gets to the tope rope, but shane jumps on the apron and grabs eric off the table and through the ropes, then holds him till he can stand straight , and eric grabs the paper given to shane and he signs it as well, eric then calls for a microphone while him and shane are walking up the ramp...<br><br>Eric: Thanx mic, haha you just signed the stippulation of the match next sunday, this match will now be in complete control of eWo....oh yah....HAVE A NICE DAY!<br><br>Eric and shane walk to the back with death and mic not too happy..<br><br>Hardcore Title Match....<br><br>Big show pretty much dominated this match hall got a few good shots in, but the powerfull big show was a little too much for hall, who seemed more focused on other things in his mind, and after fighting to the outside, show got hall to the entrance ramp, and he chokeslammed scott hall off of the entrance ramp through the floors located below them, and got then pinfall.....<br><br>Winner- Big Show....<br><br>After the match had ended and gone to a commerical break once they get back they see vampiro in the ring with a bloody and barley concious scott hall, with vampiro sitting in the ring with a microphone talking to scott hall....<br><br>Vamp: So hall you wanna talk trash, and you wanna shot at my united states title, well bitch if your in any kind of shape that your in now the dark warrior has no reason to say no, how bout this, you like tables, hell you just got thrown through one, how about at spring stampede it will be me and it will be you, in a table match, you bring the table ill bring the gold.....<br><br>All of a sudden Shane Mcmahon's music begins to play with shane walking down the ramp....<br><br>Shane O Mac: Woah there, hey dark warrior or whatever you call your ass theese days since when do you call the shots for a ppv me and eric created, screw that, just like at stampede we call the shots and for one me scott hall will not a shot that easy, because if you hadnt of known, that 14 man royal rumble we will be having in just a little bit will be a number one contender match for your us belt and will fight you at stampede, and as far as that table gimmic goes...i like it, yah i do so this is how it will be, the winner of the rumble faces you no matter what at the ppv but as for hall, if he beats you this monday night, in a non title match then it will be turned into a three way elimination table match, and that is as final as it will get...<br><br><br>RVD/Jeff Hardy vs Booker t and Elix Skipper...<br><br>This match was a pretty even match, rvd and jeff kept it in the air, while booker and elix kept the match to the floor as much as they could, near the end booker and jeff hardy went out to the fans, then both rvd and elix skipper just lookd at eachother for a good ten seconds before hitting eachother, this match ended when both men got chairs and kept decking eachother, when the ref called for the bell.....<br><br>Before the main event elix skipper is shown pissed off and on his cell phone demanding to be put through...<br><br>The main event saw the first ever royal rumble here in the ewo, below is a list of when ppl enterd and then when they were thrown out in order...<br><br>1.Brock Lesner<br>2. aj styles<br>3.shane helms<br>4.eddie gurerro<br>5.tommy dreamer<br>6.road dogg<br>7.goldberg<br>8.kurt angle<br>9.hulk hogan<br>10.rhyno<br>11.jericho<br>12.hhh<br>13.rikishi<br>14.under taker<br><br>as soona s aj got in, lesner saw him and kneed im in the stomache and gav him a f 5, then thrw him out moments later<br><br>shane helms then came out but slowly walked to the ring making sure time could pass by, and by the time he got inside the ring the next opponent came out and it was eddie gurerro, and eddie ran down, and eddie and shane both attacked lesner, but soon after a missed double attack lesner double clotheslined the two men, then grabbed them by the hair and threw them both out<br><br>Tommy dreamer was the next to come out but to lesners suprise didnt go from the entrance ramp, he came from the fans, with a kendo stick, and laid it ight across ther back of lesner and lesner fell the the mat, with dreamer belting in shots with kendo stick to pass by time.<br><br>road dogg was the next to come out, and dogg went after dreamer first, and hit him with a few moves, then lesner got up and soon all three were batteling...<br><br>soon after gold berg came running down, and dreamer was fighting dreamer while borck and goldberg went at it..<br><br>the olympic here kurt angle was the next to come down, and while he was getting in the ring, he pulled on the top rope, while dreamer was tossed to the ropes, and with kurts not meaning help, eliminated dreamer, kurt looked at the corwd like it was all him, and road dogg then came running to kurt and begin to punch him in the face, but kurt fought back and dis a belly to belly suplex, throwing road dogg out of the ring...<br><br>Hulk Hogans music then played, but no one ever came out....<br><br>Rhyno came out moments later, and ran to the ring, and jumped in and after a sneaky move by kurt rhyno speard goldberg but goldberg also held on and both men got eliminated leaving just kurt angle andbrock lesner...and this lead to a stare down then both men went at it...<br><br>chris jericho then came down, and slid into the ropes, and started to attack kurt angle, and brock and jericho had a few attempts of throwing kurt out, but it never happend and hhh later came out, and all four men began to hit each one of thier opponents...<br><br>rikishi then came out, and walkind in the ring and began to knock everyone down, and without getting eliminated the last person ran out, this being the undertaker...<br><br>kurt was then facing off with borck, taker with rikishi, and jericho with hhh...<br><br>the first one to get eliminated was rikishi with a powerful running ddt from the undertaker, but was then drop kicked to the floor but kurt angle leaving more men...<br><br>Kurt Angle...HHH...Jericho....Brock Lesner...<br><br>on the side of jericho and hhh jericho got kneed in the stomache and climbed through the middle rope, but triple h grabbed him on the other side, but jericho pulled the game over the top rope with the help of a flip from brock lesner....<br><br>jericho then got in the ring, the last three began to brawl, soon after hhh grabbed a chair, and went in the ring blasting all three men in the faces, and making the ring a bloddy mess, triple h left but before he did he laid jericho agaist the top rope, and when kurt got up, he saw this and pushed jericho out of the ring....<br><br>The last two men were Brock Lesner and Kurt Angle...<br><br>Both men got some upper hands and at once point brock got the f 5 on kurt, and attempted a pin but the ref made notice that there were no pin falls, and brock got mad, and grabbed the ref, then kurt got up, waiting for vrock, then angle attempted a Olympic Slam, and while doing so, he made it so brock landed on the outside of the ring to the floor, declaring Kurt Angle the winner and the Number One Contender to Vampiros Belt...<br><br>After kurt began to celebrate, he fell to his knees and and kissed the mat, then out of no where his head went into the mat along with the rest of his body....<br><br>seconds later he was thrown back out of the torn mat along with a bloddy, and angerd Vamprio and as vamp laid on the body of kurt angle he has a microphone and simply said...<br><br>In nine days...bitch your mine...welcome to my hell...<br><br>Jim Ross: Well folks thats all the time we have take it away coach, we'll seee you at nitro...<br><br>(The cameras go back to the eWo Studios in Sactown. The camera shows Jonathon Coachman standing behind the desk.) <br><br>Coach: We're back here in Sacto, and its now time for our in-studio guest. This guy has pretty much down it all. He has been world champion countless number of times, he has starred in two blockbuster movies...and he has a beautiful wife and child at home. He definitely is the most electrifying man in sports entertainment..he is..The Rock! <br><br>(The Rocks music hits, as Rock walks out wearing a Miami Hurricane's football jersey and a pair of shorts. The Rock walks up to Coach as they shake hands.) <br><br>Coach: How you doin Ro.. <br><br>(Rock stops him from talking by putting his hand in Coach's face) <br><br>Rock: FINALLY...THE ROCK...HAS COME BACK....TO EWO 2 NIGHT! <br><br>(The two laugh) <br><br>Coach: That he has, and Rock, its an honor to have you on our show. <br><br>Rock: Hey, its an honor being here Coach. The Rock..LIVE...on eWo 2 Night..with his millions and millions of fans watchin at home..can you smell it Coach? Can you smell the ratings? <br><br>Coach: Ohh yeah..I can smell it...So anyways Rock...9 days away from eWo Spring Stampede...are you excited, nervous, what? What is your game plan going into the pay per view event next sunday night? <br><br>Rock: My mind set is to kick two roody poo candy asses who are ignorant jackasses. <br><br>Coach: It should be a great match with you, Rob Van Dam, and Primetime. You have actually been in a lot of great matches, dating back to your WWE days...what match would you say sticks out the most as The Rock's favorite match? <br><br>Rock: Well Jabroni, The Rock loves the Hell In a Cell, The Rock loves it because it takes all that fire out of The Rock and that punk standing in front of The Rock can't run or hide. <br><br>Coach: Are you talking about the 6 man match in the Cell for the WWE heavyweight title back in december a few years ago? <br><br>Rock: You damn right The Rock is...greatest match of all time in the WWE <br><br>Coach: It definitely was a classic...Now onto some emails...George from St. Paul says, &quot;Hey Rock, you are the greatest wrestler in the EWO and I hope you win the word title. My question is, if you do win the title at Spring Stampede, who in the eWo would you first like to defend your title against? <br><br>Rock: If is not the question George, but when The Rock wins the title, The Rock is going to give it to the best man and right now The Rock is looking towards people like Triple H who put The Rock through hell and I think he deserves another shot. <br><br>Coach: Yeah, The Game Triple H and you have had some great matches in the past. It'd be great to see the two of you lock horns again. Now, onto another question, this from Michelle in Boston, Michelle asks &quot;Dear Rocky, I would like to know what you like to do outside of the ring when your not laying the smackdown on your ...opponents CANDY ASSES!?&quot; <br><br>Rock: (After a little bit of laughter) You're pretty good at that Coach. Anyways, mainly...Excercising, The Rock excercises day in and day out. The Rock loves to excersise. I also love spending time with my wife and my children. <br><br>Coach: The Rock..also a very sensitive man..Ok now, I'm gonna name off a few wrestlers in the eWo, and you tell me what you think of them...first off, Jeff Hardy? <br><br>Rock: The Rock likes Jeff Hardy, Jeff Hardy is an athlethe, a man who will give you  the future of the eWo. <br><br>Coach: Alot of people will agree with you there....Ok..Booker T? <br><br>Rock: Well even though Booker T is a jackass, Booker T is an amazing athlete jumping up and down even though he looks like a monkey with a hernia <br><br>Coach: One of your two opponents in just 9 days...Rob Van Dam <br><br>Rock: Well frankly, Rob Van Dam is a stubborn jackass who know how to fight. I don't like Rob and I know he don't like me but sometimes you just can't help having respect for him. <br><br>Coach: And your other opponent...Elix Skipper <br><br>Rock: Well, Elix Skipper is a two timing no good cheating jackass similar to RVD but I hate Primetime and I am going to kick his ass all over the arena come Sunday. <br><br>Coach: And finally..just for laughs...The Big Show <br><br>Rock: Well, now we got the Big Show, Big Show hate's how The Rock kicked his ass. Big Show hates how The Rock came on top and now Big Show is gonna hate when Rock becomes the world champion. Because Big Show is a slow ugly jabroni. <br><br>Coach: (Laughing) Ouch man! Anyways Rock, look..we have the phone lines PACKED tonight... <br><br>Rock: Well ofcourse they are..The Rock..thee most electrifying man in sports entertainment..the peoples champion..the jabroni beatin..pie eati..well..u get it.. <br><br>Coach: Lets go ahead and take a call.....Jessica from Dallas, Texas..your on the air <br><br>Jessica: OH MY GOD!!

You dont even know....I even dream about you at night, in the Smackdown Hotel, having a piece of my poo.. <br><br>Rock: WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH...Jessica dear...lets keep it clean now. This is a family show. <br><br>Coach: Alright well, it appears as though the producers have hung up on Jessica.. <br><br>Rock: That girl was a freak! <br><br>Coach: Ok now..lets go back to the lines..we got a no named caller from Charlotte, North Carolina..which is where eWo 2 Night's inring action is going on...Caller..are you there? <br><br>Caller: Yeah Im here... <br><br>Rock: Would you like to give The Rock your name... <br><br>Caller: No... <br><br>Coach: Uhmmmm....ok then...do you have a question for The Rock? <br><br>Caller: No... <br><br>Rock: Coach, The Rock thinks this guy is too busy masturbating or something..lets go to a diff.. <br><br>Caller: Thats very funny Rocky....I'm laughing my ass off!!

So Rock, what do you have to say about that? <br><br>Rock: The Rock says you need to shut up bitch! The Rock knows that you are in Charlotte tonight, and The Rock knows he is on the other side of the great US in California...and The Rock knows why you're calling him. Its because you're not within reach of The Rock kicking your monkey ass! <br><br>Skiper: Oh is that so Rock...well we'll just wait and see sunday night wont we Rocky....Anyways..its been fun..but I must be going.
