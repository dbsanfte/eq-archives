<br>
The day began with rain. <br>
<br>
Looking out from under the covers, in the home she and her sisters Isli and Krysta shared in Tir Na Nog, Tyl glanced out the window. <br>
<br>
Rain. <br>
<br>
Tyl seriously thought about rolling back over, pulling the sheets up, and trying to return to sleep. It's all she really did these days. Wake up, run a few errands in Tir Na Nog, wave to her acquaintances, and return home. It was the nights that haunted her. Hours spent sitting before the fireplace, watching the dance of the flames. Fatigue and sore muscles finally convincing her to retire for the night. Horrified that the next day would be just the same. <br>
<br>
And now, it was raining. <br>
<br>
Unable to fall asleep with the pouring rain beating on the roof above her head, Tyl sat up in bed. Rubbing the sleep from her eyes, she sat there, wondering how this day had arrived. THIS day. The day she swore would never come. The day she awoke without her weapons at her side. The day she found herself living a &quot;day&quot; that never changed. The &quot;day&quot; that had removed her from the harmony of life.... <br>
<br>
Such thoughts immediately sent her mind thinking to the letter. It sat there, in the corner, where it had fallen from her shaking hands that day. Hands honed to perfect balance, muscles and tendons that never flinched or moved without her explict control or reflex. Reduced to shaking... <br>
<br>
Tyl stretched out her arm, holding her hand out flat, trying to hold her hand still, to command it, to WILL it to stop.... <br>
<br>
Reduced to shaking... <br>
<br>
Tyl shook her head, trying to remove the thought from her mind, but like a moth to the light, she kept being dragged back to that moment. Even the monotony of an &quot;everyday&quot; life did not quell the memory of that day. The day the letter arrived. <br>
<br>
And now, she found herself staring at the letter. Left like a tomb by the wall, marking the end of her previous life. Everyday before (she had lost count long ago) she always walked past, with nary a glance or consicious thought. <br>
<br>
But today began with rain. <br>
<br>
Her &quot;errands&quot; would be delayed. Only the most dedicated smiths and merchants would be about this early, with pouring rain keeping their customers away. Most would remain inside, children playing games, mothers cleaning house. Warriors tending to old wounds, muscles that ached in the humidity of the downpour. Scholors reading by candlelight, mages studying or writing scrolls of spells put off for such a day as this. <br>
<br>
Tyl sat in bed, a certain dread sinking in. Tyl had no games to play, no house to clean. Her &quot;old&quot; wounds had plenty of time to heal already, her muscles actually starting to ache after a lesiurely day spent in Tir Na Nog these days. No books to read, or scrolls to study... <br>
<br>
Save one. One item, sitting across the room. A letter, resting on the floor where it was left. A tomb, the gravestone to her old life. <br>
<br>
Feeling suddenly like she was trapped, she almost bolted out of bed, and ran outside. The room had suddenly become rather sufficating. It was only rain, she told herself. It wasn't like she was UNABLE to go outside. To leave this room. To escape. <br>
<br>
Except for one problem. She had nowhere to go. <br>
<br>
As she sat there, in her bed, listening to the rain, Tyl was overcome with horror. In the silence of that moment, with her day stopped cold by a simple rain storm, she was finally made to stop. To think. To see what her life had been reduced to. <br>
<br>
Her eyes slowly followed the floor, across the room, to the letter sitting on the floor. The same place it had laid for countless days. Tyl pushed the covers of her bed aside. She walked across the room, a little more quiet than she had for the last countless days. <br>
<br>
Tyl stopped in front of the letter. Above it, on the wall, hung her blades. In the cabinet beside them rested her armor. Like a memorial, her blades glistened in the morning sunlight that had slowly peaked through the window. <br>
<br>
Tyl started to reach for the blades, hands that had been trained to intrinsically know how to hold them, suddenly unsure. Tyl stopped just inches away from the hilts, feeling the cold of the metal even at this distance. Metal grown cold like a corpse. <br>
<br>
Tyl withdrew her hand. Closing her eyes, she knelt to pick up the letter. She didn't even notice that the rain outside had stopped... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tylvillenria>Tyl Villenria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/30/03 2:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Return to Battle</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Return to Battle - Chapter 2 : A Hard Day's Work...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&quot;What am I doing here?&quot; <br>
<br>
Tyl asked this question many times, before finally falling asleep. She had forgotten how bright the stars would shine on these summer nights, how big the moon looked when out of Tir Na Nog. How ominous the dark could be, illuminated by only a campfire. <br>
<br>
The day had started like any other day. Awaking in bed, rolling over, looking outside. And now here she was, in the wild, camping, her weapons by her side... <br>
<br>
She held them now, as she slept. Even as exhaustion over took her fears, fatigue holding court to her anxiety, her hands did not leave the hilts of her blades... <br>
<br>
Her blades. How that took getting used to again. She paused only briefly this morn when preparing her hasty departure, long enough to recognize how foreign they felt in her hands, before putting them away with the rest of her supplies. She might as well have wielded a spear, or a great sword with both hands. The effect would have been the same. <br>
<br>
And the armor! It lay beside her now, having given up the thought of sleeping in it like she used to, after a few hours of restless itching. <br>
<br>
As she slept, her thoughts and dreams went back over the course of the day... <br>
<br>
Tears, falling down... <br>
on to a letter, read only twice, in her hands. <br>
<br>
Desperation led her on, quickly grabbing her old equipment, Tyl prepared her supplies and left. (The realization that she didn't leave a note for her friends, or even for her sisters almost woke her with a start...but the day's events were too much for her weakened body). Heading out of Tir Na Nog, she was approached by a woman. She seemed familiar, but with the size of Tir Na Nog, and all of the places Tyl had been during her old career, it could well be anybody. Distress was obvious on her face, and something stirred within Tyl. Sometimes the old ways don't go away altogether. <br>
<br>
&quot;Can I help you, miss?&quot; <br>
<br>
The woman's name was Bairfhionn. Her father, a well-known bard, had gone missing. Many adventures had gone looking for him. More to move on with her business for the day, Tyl agreed to &quot;keep an eye out&quot; for him. <br>
<br>
Tyl left the city that morning, not really sure of where to go. Her immediate need was for information, but only those versed in old Elven might be of help. Perhaps it was the guilt of blowing off young Bairfhionn. Perhaps it was the &quot;justification&quot; that a renowned bard might know where to start on her new quest. Regardless of reason, Tyl decided that finding this bard was now in her best interests. <br>
<br>
Heading towards Tir Urphost, Tyl came across a guard known for having information. She asked him about the missing bard, and received directions to seek out a lurikeen near Urphost. <br>
<br>
Arriving there, Tyl found the man quite insane. Although she seemed to make out a few words from his babbling, the only ones of importance seemed to involve the missing bard, and some daemon of the air, named Aiofe. <br>
<br>
For the first time this day, Tyl asked herself, &quot;What am I doing here?&quot; <br>
<br>
A daemon?! Surely not something to be taken lightly. Tyl tried to remember all of the beasts she had defeated ago, in her &quot;old&quot; life. Many adventures came to mind, though hazy with time. She tried now to call upon those adventures, the times spent hunting with her sisters and friends. Her hands drifted to the swords on her hips, still cold. Still uninviting. <br>
<br>
As she walked away from the mad lurikeen, she drew her blades. The weight was unforgiving. She recalled the time her master had made her practice underwater, to increase her strength, and improve her response to the weight of the blades during regular sparring. The swords felt like that now. Heavy, unwieldy, foreign. <br>
<br>
Lost in thought, Tyl looked up to find herself on a hill. Glancing around, she realized she had come to the place where Aiofe was known to haunt. Waves of terror and uncertainty rolled over her now as she looked to the crest of the hill. There, in a grove of trees, stood the very daemon she was to dispatch. And it was not alone. <br>
<br>
Two huge wind spirits accompanied the daemon, one to each side. Tyl prayed that they were not together. Her heart sunk even lower when the daemon turned to leave, the two wind spirits quick to follow. <br>
<br>
Tyl kept her distance, circling around and weighing her options. Certain death. Or run away. <br>
<br>
To anyone who might have happened by at that time, the scene before them did not change. But at that moment, something occurred to Tyl. <br>
<br>
Certain death, or run away? <br>
<br>
Tyl thought back over the weeks spent in Tir Na Nog, her love of life drained from her being, as one day flowed into the next, one day into a week, a week into a month. There was no telling how much time had passed in that room within their house in Tir Na Nog. <br>
<br>
Certain death, or run away? <br>
<br>
The words echoed in her mind, their meaning slowly becoming clear to her.... <br>
<br>
Certain death, or certain death? <br>
<br>
It was the same. No, it wasn't. At least with one of those choices, she would die doing what she loved.... <br>
<br>
Tyl slowly stood, her blades already in her hands, as if by magic. Suddenly, they didn't feel quite as cold, not quite so heavy. Not quite so foreign... <br>
<br>
Right now, they felt like she had come home. <br>
<br>
Sprinting across the field, Tyl bared down on the three spirits. Her approach did not go unnoticed, and the three turned to meet her rush. The wind spirits moved to stop her, but Tyl's vision was centered on one adversary, one goal. Splitting the two beasts, Tyl ran, hardly feeling as their claws ripped against her armor, hardly feeling the first attack of magic from the daemon Aiofe. <br>
<br>
A scream, feral and passionate, filled the air as Tyl cried out. Not in pain, but in pure battle rage. Unleashing her pent up feelings, those of uncertainty and distress, Tyl's spirit was a force itself against Aiofe, appearing to anyone who might have happened by at that time as a glowing sword, the swordmaiden's essence. <br>
<br>
Had Tyl been aware of what was happening around her, she would have known that she was in serious trouble. Her burst of energy was fading fast, the blades in her hands growing heavier, as blow after blow was rained down on her from behind by the two wind spirits. All of this went unnoticed to Tyl, though, fully taken over by the flow of the battle. With her last bit of strength, Tyl thrust forward with both blades, stealing the last bit of essence from the daemon Aiofe. The daemon was banished back to its plane, leaving behind a small vial containing the essence of its corporal form. Tyl reached forward, grabbing the vial and pulling it close to her body as the last blow landed on her beaten body. <br>
<br>
Mercifully, Tyl passed out. She didn't even feel the wind spirits continue their onslaught, finally leaving her when it seemed she was finally dead. <br>
<br>
To anyone who might have happened by at that time, they would be witness to a rare thing. Something that hadn't happened in countless months... <br>
<br>
Tyl smiled. <br>

<br>
Connla was a small town. Although it had grown since the founding of Howth, and the new activity farther south in Innis Carthaig, Connla continued to have the flavor of a border town. Many adventurers grew up in Connla these days, fed countless stories as children by the men and women who stopped in town for supplies. Children who dreamed of adventure beyond the hills of Connla. <br>
<br>
With all of the coming and going everyday by the adventurers of the realm, it should come as no surprise that no one marked the day when he arrived. <br>
<br>
It was also not a coincidence that the stranger blended in. His hair, although bright red, was styled in the fashionable celtic manner, with short little spikes. His clothes were non-descript, with just a light blue cloak to contrast his drab leather jerkin. He took special care not to glance about too much. Enough to be mistaken for a traveler's first visit to Connla, but not enough to stand out from the others. His voice was deep and rich, befitting his cover as a wandering bard, but he kept his words short, and to the point. Although he hardly noticed, his accent was still faintly there, enough for the first few people he encountered from the surrounding area to take an interest in where he had come from... <br>
<br>
Questions he was not ready to answer just yet. <br>
<br>
The stranger smiled as he walked into Connla that day. Such a simple town, full of life. Children ran by, off to the nearby forest. He faintly heard one of them proclaim the day's game to be tree-climbing. A good-natured smirk found it's way on the stranger's face, as he neared the center of town. <br>
<br>
However, it did not stay. Hibernia was a large country, with many forests, both deep and foreboding. Finding the right one would be a challenge for the stranger. With no friends, no money, and only a vague memory of the place he sought, the task seemed impossible. <br>
<br>
But then, his family said the same thing back home about him actually getting to Hibernia. And here he was. <br>
<br>
Connla, the home of adventurers. <br>
<br>
The stranger gathered with the other travelers that night, by the bonfire near the river. He slipped out of most questions about his own travels, his ability to get people to talk honed sharp from years of diplomatic meetings in his homeland. Soon enough, everyone had told their story in turn, before finally retiring for the night. He listened intently to each one, hoping to hear some clue, hoping to hear the name. The name of the one he desperately seeked. <br>
<br>
Finally alone by the fire that first night in Connla, the stranger whispered into the night: <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll find you Vencklayne, no matter where you hide. You have quite a bit of explaining to do, old friend...&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tylvillenria>Tyl Villenria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/30/03 2:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Return to Battle</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Return to Battle - Chapter 4 : The Good Ole Days...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The young girl bent down, picking up yet another wayward arrow. This made the eighteenth one. She only needed to find the last two, then it would be time for dinner. Plenty of time in fact. Today most of the arrows actually went in the same general direction, and she had found many of them stuck into this or that tree. Still, she had a lot to learn. The last arrow she found was sixty yards behind the target. <br>
<br>
She began to wonder again why the master was so particular about finding all of the arrows. She had seen him make them from old twigs, found all over the forest where they lived. Certainly it was not for fear of running out. Was it for the sake of secrecy? She had never seen another person near their forest. The only people she ever saw were from a distance, on the few trips the master had taken her out of the forest. Those trips, like everything else, centered around learning. The master would point out this or that shape across a wide field, usually on horseback on a dusty dirt road. The words &quot;Celt&quot;, &quot;Firbolg&quot;, and &quot;Lurikeen&quot; were taught to her at an early age. She always wondered why they never came across any &quot;Elves&quot;. Elves were her favorite. The master had many books on Elven Lore, and after learning to read and write, she begged him to allow her to read them all. He smiled at her then, knowing that at her young age, she could not imagine the sheer number of books he owned about that topic. <br>
<br>
But then again, when you live to be several hundred years old, you tend to collect a few classics. <br>
<br>
Still, even he was impressed with her tenacity. Every few days, she would return to his study, trying to balance the tomb on her back, taking care not to drag the heavy book across the ground. He jokingly asked her one night if she could possibly show this much enthusiasm towards her archery lessons. With the sincerity of a child, she replied that the arrows were there every day. The bow, the target, the trees; all of these things never changed. But the stories of Elven Lore were unique. Each one a lesson in itself. Even after untold centuries, mysteries were still being found, places unexplored, creatures never seen by mortal man continued to live, to reproduce, to thrive...untouched for eons. Smiling at her innocence in taking his comment seriously, he handed her a new book. This one was rather threadbare, as if it had been studied numerous times, cross-referenced with other documents, marked and eared for particular chapters of interest. <br>
<br>
On it's cover read the words: <br>
<br>
&quot;Beyond the veil, an anthology of the known information about the lands outside our home.&quot; <br>
<br>
The girl ran off eagerly, ready to dive into this new story. As she left, the master paused in his own studies, wondering if he was doing the right thing. Wondering if he hadn't just planted the seeds to a horrible future, a fate his student might not be ready to handle.... <br>
<br>
The girl shook her head, remembering that she still had to find two more arrows before supper. Still taking her time, picking through the underbrush, she spotted number nineteen. At this rate, she may have just enough time to read another chapter before dinner. With this thought in mind, she eagerly set to the task at hand....</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;That was a fasicnating story. Truely you do your profession justice. Might I ask your name?&quot; <br>
<br>
The bard smiled, &quot;Of course young man. I am Amargein, a bard of little fame. And you?&quot; <br>
<br>
The stranger smirked, though it was difficult to see this night. His light blue cloak wrapped close from the cool night, and the shadows from the fire thrown strategically across his face hid much from Amargein. <br>
<br>
&quot;A fellow bard, of no repute. But before I forget, I couldn't help but notice that you did not use any names in your story. Was this purposeful, by chance, or have the names faded with the telling?&quot; <br>
<br>
Amargein the bard paused. The stranger tried to remain calm, but even he could tell that this man was suddenly on his guard, quietly trying to see beyond the shadows covering the strangers face. The bards eyes, old but intense, bore holes through the stranger's dark shroud. A flicker, just now! Recognition? <br>
<br>
Impossible, thought the stranger. No one on this land knew of him. Or perhaps the old bard suddenly recognized that this was no simple telling of a tale to a hapless young country bard... <br>
<br>
The stranger smiled slyly as the old bard began to speak again, &quot;Well, that was many years ago, decades even. I barely remember the tale, actually. I'm afraid I can not recall anything more about it.&quot; <br>
<br>
Finality. It dripped off his words to the stranger, one who had made a living by reading his opponents words, or more importantly, the way they said them. He would gather no more information from this one. <br>
<br>
The stranger stretched, letting a yawn out to distract the bard as his hand flexed next to his dagger, hidden underneath his cloak. There was a chance that this old bard might now know too much. Bards were rather tricky to deal with anyway, and having one as old as this, who clearly had been rattled by the strangers questions...this bard might not easily &quot;forget&quot; the strangers passing. <br>
<br>
The stranger smiled again. No. There was no need at the moment. He glanced over at the bard's makeshift hut. This man was not going anywhere soon. And the stranger had tapped this locale dry for rumors and stories. It was time to move on, farther north. <br>
<br>
It was time to find more adventurers, more people that were still connected with the everyday events of this realm. <br>
<br>
It was time to visit Tir Na Nog.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tylvillenria>Tyl Villenria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/30/03 3:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Return to Battle</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chapter 5: Renewal, a vow kept</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The master opened the door, beckoning for her to go inside. The young woman paused just long enough, showing the respect for this day. Nothing was announced between them, but she knew something different was happening today. This room had remained closed ever since she could remember. It had been nine years since she began her lessons with the bow. It had not been going well. <br>
<br>
She had improved, to be sure. Just yesterday, she had only missed one shot. Four had been direct bull’s-eyes. However, she could tell in the way the master looked on, even this was not good enough. Not good enough for him. She had no idea what he thought of that night of her improvement. She arrived at her spot for morning practice, only to find the master already there. This in itself was strange, as he normally allowed her to practice alone, only coming by for the days challenges. But not today. <br>
<br>
He merely told her to practice, to gather her arrows when finished, and to meet him here, during their normally planned archery time. <br>
<br>
From within the room, a soft light flowed out. The young woman was momentarily surprised, sensing correctly that this room had been closed for years, at least as long as she could remember. There was no telling when someone had last stepped through the door... <br>
<br>
And now she stepped through, to find a small room. From either side, doorways led off to small alcoves. The master beckoned her to go inside. <br>
<br>
The weapons lined the walls. The alcove was covered in them, of all shapes and sizes. And not one had a bit of dust. Sensing that something was very strange here, the young woman barely heard the noise coming from the main room. <br>
<br>
Standing in the middle of the room, the master held two blades, looking right at the young woman. <br>
<br>
&quot;You reached your full potential with the bow I'm afraid&quot;, he said. &quot;It's time now to see if blades are more to your liking.&quot; <br>
<br>
The young girl grabbed two weapons, the closest she found. They seemed cold, unwieldy, foreign. <br>
<br>
The master smiled briefly, sheathing one of his swords, and placing it to the side. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't we start with the basics? Two blades can be very difficult to wield, even for dexteritous elves like myself. We will have plenty of time to work up to two.&quot; <br>
<br>
The master chuckled, trying his best to hide the slight cough that had overcome him. He honestly wondered if there would be enough time. He honestly hoped there would. He had a vow to keep. He looked back to his student. <br>
<br>
His last student. <br>
<br>
The master began his lesson. &quot;In sword fighting, there are only five main styles...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Tyl awoke, shaking the remaining thoughts from her morning daze. Her body ached all over. She looked down to find blood caked on her armor. Her blood. The images of her battle with the wind spirits flooded back to her, while her body seemed to take advantage of this to remind her just how badly it was beaten. Tyl felt dizzy, but knew it was best to stand, to fight her way to focusing again. Waves of nausea rolled through her head as she came to her feet. She looked about, trying to place where she was. <br>
<br>
The hill. It appeared she had rolled down the hill, and had been left for dead. She glanced down, to the object still in her grasp. The vial appeared to be safe. It was time to return to the mad little lurikeen. <br>
<br>
It was only after the day’s travels, first to the lurikeen who helpfully directed her to find the hometown of the missing bard, and then to the south, and the little hut where the bard Amargein now lived, that Tyl began to wonder just what had happened. Here she was, in her armor, with her blades, riding across the countryside. Being an adventurer. It seemed so natural. But perhaps it was only because Tyl did not know what else to do. She still needed to ask this bard about the old Elven Lore. She hoped he might know the answer she seeked, or at least, where she might find someone who did. <br>
<br>
Amargein appeared a little troubled today, taken by surprise at having her as a visitor. He calmed noticeable when Tyl showed him the essence of Aiofe, and gave him the note from his daughter in Tir Na Nog. He hastily wrote a note in reply, asking if Tyl might be headed that way. The bard had a lot of work to do, to collect his things and leave the hut. <br>
<br>
Tyl agreed, asking only if she may ask the bard a question in return. She wondered how to phrase her question, not really sure herself what it was. In the end, she simply asked, &quot;I'm looking for someone that might know about very old Elven Lore. A book, to be precise.&quot; <br>
<br>
Amargein paused briefly, a strange look crossing his face for an instant, too fast for Tyl to take notice, as he quickly began to speak. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid I don't, milady. But for matters of old, your best bet might be to try the city of Caille. It is quite close to the Empyreans own home. Both them and the inhabitants of Caille are known for their magical roots, and many scholars go there to study such things.&quot;, Amargein said. <br>
<br>
Tyl thanked the bard, returning to Tir Na Nog long enough to give his note to his daughter. Gathering some more supplies, she headed out to Caille, hoping that there someone might have heard about the book. <br>
<br>
Tyl was sure the book would have the information she seeked. Information to help make sense out of that damn letter. Information to help her decide her course of action, hopefully before it was too late. <br>
<br>
Tyl knew of only two people to have read that book. One was an old elven teacher, who passed away many years ago. The other was lost to her now, gone in the haze of distant pasts, who only read the book for the storytelling itself anyway. She only remembered the title: <br>

<br>
Tyl rode into Caille, and immediately noticed the silence. Most towns in Hibernia were border towns, on the outskirts of the capital, and surrounded by danger. Because of this, they were usually busy with guards patrolling, adventurers purchasing their supplies, hunting parties coming in and preparing to leave. Caille was not like the other towns of Hibernia, although it was not located at any safer region within the realm. <br>
<br>
Tyl dismounted her horse, and noticed that there were no stables in town. She sent her horse onward to Druim Cain, knowing that it was familiar enough with the route to safely traverse the danger. Turning about and facing the town itself, she immediately saw that this was not going to be easy. <br>
<br>
Doors closed just beyond her sight as she turned around, people running from the open road to safety inside unmarked buildings. Those townsfolk that did remain outside and in view stared quietly at Tyl, watching every move she made. These were the merchants, the ones that tolerated the unannounced visits of strangers, knowing a profit was to be made. A few were not even from this strange town, but had come here to make their fortune. <br>
<br>
This was not Tyl’s first visit to Caille, but every time she stopped here it unnerved her just the same. She felt as if she had just walked into someone else’s wedding party. A wedding party, or a funeral. It did not matter, the feeling was the same. Unwanted, unknown, unwelcome. <br>
<br>
There was one man still in town that she did know, a young merchant that she had helped many months ago. She looked for him now, amongst the other shopkeepers. Spotting him, she noticed a brief flash of recognition from him. Without a word, he turned and walked towards the edge of town. <br>
<br>
Tyl followed the young man, quietly, respecting the ways of this small town, even if she did not understand them. Having moved away from the others, the young man finally turned about. <br>
<br>
“What is it?” <br>
<br>
Tyl looked on dumbfounded, and a little taken aback. The tone was obviously one of impatience, with a hint of resignation. <br>
<br>
“I…I need information”, Tyl stammered. <br>
<br>
“I’m afraid you’ve come to the wrong town then. We keep to ourselves. We don’t keep track of what’s going on in that world out there, and frankly, we like it that way,” the young man quickly replied. <br>
<br>
“I need to know about the elves. The elves of old”, Tyl said, desperation seeping into her voice. <br>
<br>
The young man paused, appearing to be lost in thought. Finally, he spoke, turning to leave. <br>
<br>
“I can’t help you. No one in this town can. You’re only hope would be to speak with the Watchers, outside of town. They are the empyreans that live nearby. You should find them easily enough.” <br>
<br>
And with that, the young man left, returning to town, and refusing to even look at Tyl again. <br>
<br>
Tyl left Caille, knowing exactly where these Watchers lived. She had previously dealt with them on one occasion, involving a man from her own hometown…. from Connla. He had been a watcher as well, though his actions had banished him from living in Bri Leith with the other Watchers. <br>
<br>
Tyl hoped that they remembered her. <br>
<br>
The blademaiden walked through the valley, leading to the home of the Watchers. She looked about the valley, seeing that more and more of the watchers were marking her passage, but none moved to stop her. As she approached the chieftess, Tyl began to wonder exactly what she could say, how she could explain to these beings, these ghosts, that she needed their help. And why would they even bother to help one not of their race, when Tyl herself had seen the consequences in the form of the man who now resided in Connla? <br>
<br>
These thoughts were quickly brushed from her mind, completely surprised, and a little scared, when the chieftess spoke first: <br>
<br>
“Tyl Villenria. I’ve been waiting for you.”<br>

<br>
The stranger entered the city, taken aback by its size. Carved within a mountain, the bard expected to see the inside created by the hands like that of a dirty dwarf, or a kobold. However, once he passed the capital’s gates, he saw that he was mistaken. <br>
<br>
Carved would not seem to be the right word for the magic of this place. Torn asunder would be more appropriate. The stranger looked about, seeing the inside of the mountain itself had been ripped apart from the base, almost as if a god had reached down and touched the very core. The stranger knew that this realm was full of magic, but even he was not prepared for such a mighty show of force. For the first time, the stranger did feel a little uncomfortable; hoping beyond hope that those responsible for this feat of ability had long ago passed away, and had taken the secrets of this lands magic with them. <br>
<br>
Not wanting to waste any more time in this city then he needed to, the bard made haste to the castle itself. Barely having time to take in the sights, the sounds, the people, he entered the courtyard to the capital, and hoped to find someone who could get him an audience with the king. It wasn’t until he realized that people weren’t paying any attention to him (or at least, the amount of attention that he was hoping for), that he recognized a rather peculiar situation. The king’s outer chambers were all guarded by elves. The place was surrounded with them! The stranger had never seen one up close…. well, only one so long ago…and had very limited knowledge of their abilities and demeanors. Save for one fact that he remembered quite well from his past. They were not susceptible to charms. <br>
<br>
Quietly leaving the castle walls, the stranger found a small tavern, and weighed his options. As he brought his first drink to his lips, he gazed across the room, suddenly sensing an opportunity he could not pass up. <br>
<br>
Just as he was well versed in the innate abilities of elves to ward against charms, the bard also knew how to recognize when someone not only lacked these defenses, but also was more naturally susceptible. That someone sat across the room to him now. <br>
<br>
She was a young Celt, with long dark hair. Her face had the blue ink markings that were popular with the warriors of the day, and she carried an assortment of weapons with her. Even as she sat in the tavern, quietly sipping her drink, the stranger could sense that she did not feel comfortable. Her interactions with the staff, along with her desire not to make eye contact with any of those sitting near her table led the bard to recognize this one’s most immediate traits. Shy, unsure, wanting to be accepted by her peers. <br>
<br>
A slow smile found its way to the strangers face. <br>
<br>
Later that day, as he was counting his full coin purse and polishing his new armor and weapons, he wondered if perhaps there was more opportunity to be had with this young girl. Looking over his new magical trinkets, he thought surely someone who had acquired such powerful items belonged to a guild that was quite powerful, and willing to help any who called one of them friend. A network of travelers such as that might be useful in his search for Vencklayne. Or at least, make his stay in Hibernia a little more comfortable. <br>
<br>
Yes, this band of travelers, this Fellowship of Dihn, could prove quite useful…and with the word of the heroine Shaenon as introduction, should not pose much trouble to infiltrate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tylvillenria>Tyl Villenria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/30/03 3:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Return to Battle</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chapter 8: Adventure awaits!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
The stranger awoke in his room in Tir Na Nog. Though staying inside the city had its distinct troubles, he enjoyed being in touch with what was going on. It was also his chance to find out more information on Vencklayne, and possibly his whereabouts. <br>
<br>
Before the bard could prepare to leave for the day’s visit to the merchants’ center, he received word from the young Shaenon. It appeared that two young members of her guild were out hunting, and would not turn away another of their season. She wondered if the stranger would be able to assist them. <br>
<br>
Seeing no time like the present to familiarize himself with the members of this guild, he decided to accept the invitation. Leaving the gates of Tir na Nog behind, he came across a young elven lass. Though young in appearance, it was apparent to the shrewd bard that this one had wisdom beyond even her elven years, and should not be trifled with. As he approached, he sensed that even now, she was on her guard. No word from a young Celt heroine would simply dissuade her from her suspicions. With a smile, he greeted her, hoping to keep the mood light, and distract her from any of the numerous questions he believed to be running around in her head. <br>
<br>
“Greetings m’lord”, the elven lady said. “I hear you know Shaenon.” <br>
<br>
The stranger took pause. A tone in her voice….distrust, curiosity, disdain, relief? These elves were ever a problem to deal with. <br>
<br>
“Aye, m’lady” <br>
<br>
“Well then, I am Lysaria. It will be a pleasure to hunt with you, being a friend of Shaenon. And your name, m’lord?” <br>
<br>
<br>
“Brendyn. Just, Brendyn,” he replied. <br>
<br>
“Well, m’lord Brendyn, there are a few friends meeting us here, and then we will be off.” <br>
<br>
A soft chuckle escaped the air nearby, as a short lurikeen came into view. Brendyn sighed quietly, beginning to wonder just how this situation could get any worse. Though his knowledge of elves was limited, he only knew a little more about lurikeens. And what he did know, he didn’t like. The size of a small child, and just as mischievous, lurikeens had about half the resistance to magic as elves, but twice the suspicion of being tricked. Tricksters were always the hardest to dupe, always looking for their own chance to take advantage of a situation. This made most of Brendyn’s charms practically impossible to use. <br>
<br>
As the two ladies greeted each other, Brendyn weighed his options. Just as he felt like he had control of the situation before him, he saw him. A huge, towering creature approached from the east. Brendyn’s hand hovered near his blade, though he relaxed a little when his companions waved and smiled to the giant. As he approached, Brendyn could not help but groan audibly, his hand moving to his head instead. A Firbolg. Creatures more attune to nature than even the elves, and this one a druid no less. One in harmony with his surroundings would know immediately if something was amiss with his companions, striking down every last hope Brendyn had of using the situation to his advantage today. He finally decided that he would just have to rely on his natural charisma, and hope that he was able to at least win over a few of them this day. <br>
<br>
The young Lurikeen was Lynna, a ranger. One who happened to enjoy hiding in shadows almost as much as a rogue. The giant Firbolg was introduced as Sleiyn, a gentle druid, who offered his blessings to the group as they prepared to move out to hunt. Although Sleiyn would not be joining them today, Brendyn was taken aback by his power, and thought it wise not to do anything too brash while traveling with the ladies. He did not like his chances alone against this druid standing before him, and had a feeling he would immediately figure out any enchantments the bard might try on the young women. <br>
<br>
The three set out, hunting the wildlife around a few of the merchant towns south of Tir na Nog. While most of their time was spent quietly stalking their prey, Brendyn did manage to engage them in a limited discussion. He also studied their tactics carefully, in the event that one day he found himself on the battleground against these formidable foes. And formidable they were. The ranger Lynna was deadly with her bow, choosing a few targets that she felled before they arrived to her, before Brendyn could even lend a hand to the combat. And the nightshade Lysaria, always hiding in shadows, awaiting the prey to walk into their trap. Both Lysaria and Lynna spent more time hiding then in plain sight, leaving Brendyn feeling alone more and more during the course of their time together. <br>
<br>
As their hunt came to a close, Brendyn took his leave, returning to his room in Tir na Nog. He had much to think about. He was impressed with the members of Dihn he had come across today. Though they ranged in race, profession, and season, they seemed to have built a bond beyond those simple labels. He thought that their guild was more like a family to many of them, and not just a collection of travelers following the same path. Something about that called out to Brendyn, so far away from home and loved ones. He almost felt sorry about using them strictly for finding Vencklayne…. <br>
<br>
Vencklayne, the name jarring him from his contemplation… <br>
<br>
He almost felt sorry for them…. <br>
<br>
Almost.<br>

<br>
“Tyl Villenria, I’ve been waiting for you.” <br>
<br>
The chieftess stood before Tyl, unmoving. Tyl could only look back, stunned by the recognition being bestowed to her by the empyrean leader. <br>
<br>
“We haven’t much time. I’ve been asked to direct you towards your goal, to the book you seek. Your answers do indeed lie within its cover. <br>
<br>
“The book you seek lies deep within the tomb of the Muire family. Although many raiders have pillaged the tomb over the decades since it’s placement there, the book itself is old and non-descript, a threadbare collection of old stories. It is quite possible that it has been untouched all these years. <br>
<br>
“However, you are not the only one who seeks the knowledge held within. As we speak, another approaches the tomb of Muire. You must make haste there, and acquire the book first.” <br>
<br>
As she finished, the chieftess pointed towards the west. Tyl took her cue, jogging off towards Druim Cain. Towards the horse that would return her to Muire Tomb. <br>
<br>
Muire Tomb. <br>
<br>
As Tyl ran up the hill leading to the tomb entrance, she recalled the times she had spent there as a young warrior. That place was filled with memories, many of them before she met her friends, Anam na Eireann and the Fellowship of Dihn. Before she had met her sisters. <br>
<br>
Save one memory, the one that came to mind now as she stood there, at the stairway leading down into the tomb. Her hand brushed the stone wall, recalling her last expedition into the tomb, one she has shared with her sisters. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“I vow never to return to this tomb. My journeys here are finished for all time.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Tyl paused at the entrance, conflicted with emotions. A vow was not something to be taken lightly. And yet, here lies the resting place of the tomb she seeked. <br>
<br>
Tyl was drawn out of her internal debate by the sounds of someone approaching through the forest behind her. Quickly, she found some underbrush, and looked on. <br>
<br>
Something about this seemed too familiar. Suddenly, she remembered: <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A human! The little girl had nearly dropped her bow. She had never seen one before in the master’s forest. Hiding beneath the underbrush, she watched as this brave soul wandered deeper into the foreboding forest. No one had ever made it this deep, with the forest magically darkened to prevent intruders. She watched as the man stumbled around, obviously lost. Then, she saw it. <br>
<br>
A wolf, possibly the largest she had ever seen, stalking the human. It was clear that the wolf had followed him in, perhaps even forcing him to find shelter within the forest. <br>
<br>
The girl was at a loss. The master had taught her the sanctity of life, never to attack the animals, teaching her the ways of avoidance, of recognition. He told her that fighting the animals of the land was not a challenge with her skills, not even sport. <br>
<br>
But it was also apparent that the human, although unwanted and unwelcome in their forest, would not make it out alive. The wolf had already found the human, and was setting up for its strike. <br>
<br>
The little girl closed her eyes, not wanting to see the gruesome demise of the human. <br>
<br>
To the human in the forest, nothing had changed, only the sound like that of an insect buzzing by, barely breaking the threshold of his senses. <br>
<br>
The little girl opened her eyes, familiar with the sound of her master’s arrow flying through the air. There, where the beast was about to make its leap, lay the dead wolf. It’s life ended swiftly with a perfectly aimed arrow. <br>
<br>
They trailed the human, master and student, making sure he found his way out without incident. The little girl wanted desperately to question her master about today’s activities, but knew she would not learn anything until they arrived back at their home. <br>
<br>
As the day ended, she finally asked, “Master, why did you kill the wolf? I thought you took a vow never to kill the animals of the forest?” <br>
<br>
The master looked at his student, a bit surprised by her thoughtfulness. “My child, vows are important things, not to be broken lightly. However, we are not bound to one vow alone. There are some vows that are more important than others, and when two vows conflict, it is best to be sure not to break the more important vow by keeping the lesser. Had I not killed the wolf, I would have kept that vow. Yet there is a vow more important that I have made: To protect the weak, those who cannot fight for themselves. My actions today do not speak of the worthlessness of my vow to not kill the animals. They speak of the worth of my vow to protect the weak, even at the expense of my word.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tyl, her concerns set to rest, smiled as she entered the tomb. Not from any joy in breaking her vow to never return to the crypt, but from the assurance brought to her of the importance of this task. The lesser of two vows would be broken, offered as sacrifice to secure the more important vow. A personal vow, one that must be accomplished at all cost. For Tyl’s sake. For the memory of her Master. <br>
<br>
The sounds of battle flowed from the bottom of the stairs, a cry for help above the tumultuous collection of combat. Pulling her blades free, Tyl ran the rest of the way down, any thought of her vow gone with the call for help in her ears.<br>

Tyl entered the intersection, moving her torch left and right. It had been many seasons since she had last been within the tomb of Muire, yet the layout came back to her quickly. Many months had been spent searching for treasure and fighting the beasts that had come to call the dank corridors home. Ghosts and ghouls remained to protect the sacred halls, rising even now to guard the tombs from being spoiled. Having no need to search for the lost weapons and armors of such a long ago past, Tyl moved on. She had only one item in mind, a book from her past. One that promised to hold the answers she seeked. <br>
<br>
Tyl turned to leave, seeking the lower room with the spirit of Beare Muire, the family’s sworn protector, and unofficial queen of the tomb. However, before she moved on, Tyl felt a cold wind blow through behind her. It came from a room Tyl had known well. That room was a favorite hunting ground, with many spirits rising up to fight off the multitude of young heroes who sought the riches of the upper floors. <br>
<br>
Something didn’t seem right though, for Tyl had never encountered a breeze from that side of the tomb. In fact, there was only one exit from the tomb, and that hall alone had been the only home to such breezes, however weak. In every other room, the air hung thick with decay and mold. Yet here, a floor below and a hall away, a breeze did flow….and it flowed out of the room she now turned to look into. <br>
<br>
Tyl approached, for the first time in a long time, trepidation entering her steps. <br>
<br>
As she rounded the corner, Tyl saw the broken wall. And beyond, spiraling stairs lead down, guarded by three skeleton warriors. The bones looked brittle and old, yet the bodies moved up and down, as if still trying to draw in breath. Their skinny hands held weapons glowing with magic, as each of the three heads turned to look at her. <br>
<br>
Tyl waited, as each side gauged the strength of the other. With no approach, Tyl breathed a little easier. Perhaps these guardians of the tomb knew she was only here for one thing, and that item did not belong to the Muire family. Perhaps they were equally intimidated by Tyl’s warrior spirit as she was of their dedication to protect what was theirs. Perhaps it was something completely beyond her perception. In any case, Tyl walked past, shivering as she felt their empty eye sockets focusing on her every move. <br>
<br>
Reaching the bottom of the stairs, Tyl felt the breeze continue past her and up the stairs. A little stronger, a little cleaner. There must be another entrance near by. Tyl continued down the hall, passing numerous skeleton warriors, a few wearing the tattered armor signifying them as champions in the order. Tyl shivered again, thinking of the magical prowess within the spirits of the undead champions required to bring them back to serve their family, years, decades even, after their death. <br>
<br>
Ahead Tyl found another set of stairs spiraling down, yet the hallway continued forward. A slight breeze came from ahead. Pulling her cloak around her, she followed the clean air, and walked forward through the doorway ahead. <br>
<br>
Tyl entered a huge, circular room. Looking around, she saw that she was actually on the second floor of the room, standing on a small ledge that circled the dais below. Glancing down, Tyl felt the energy before she even saw her. <br>
<br>
Tyl was wrong. Beare Muire was not the queen of the tomb. She didn’t even belong to the royal family, compared to the strength, the hatred, that emanated from below. <br>
<br>
The true Queen had awaked, and she was not pleased with the state of her tomb. <br>
<br>
Finally tearing her eyes away from the majesty of the queen, Tyl saw the immediate source of her ire. Near a set of stairs going up, a young warrior, his black cloak tight about his body, appeared to be deciding whether making the trip this deep was worth the anger of the royal family. As the warrior stood, transfixed, the queen’s mummified handmaidens began their approach, somehow pushing words from their decayed bodies, their wrapped hands forming magical symbols. They would not allow this fool to desecrate their queen’s resting place. <br>
<br>
Tyl jumped down from the ledge, landing between the handmaidens and the unlucky warrior, and unsheathed her blades before thought had formed action. <br>
<br>
“Run away, and run fast…or they will overcome you!”, Tyl shouted…hoping the young warrior still had time to escape. <br>
<br>
The young warrior slowly smiled, giving a slight bow to this brave warrior maiden, before deftly throwing his cloak over his shoulders. There, under his arm, was a book. Old and threadbare, it would be undistinguishable to any who did not specifically seek it out. <br>
<br>
Tyl stood perfectly still, completely shocked. <br>
<br>
The young warrior, a grin from ear to ear now on his face, raised a hand to his brow. With a quick salute and a wink, the man turned and ran up the stairs…stairs where a gust of fresh air freely flowed. The source of the fresh air throughout this side of the tomb. <br>
<br>
The exit to the outside world. <br>
<br>
Tyl didn’t even feel the first spell shock her body, staring as she was at the exit of the cloaked rogue. The blast from the second spell was still harder to notice, matched with the sound of a cave in from atop the stairs. <br>
<br>
A scream filled the room, overpowering even the queen who was in the throws of her own spell casting. The four of them, handmaidens and queen, stared at Tyl. Her eyes closed, face set in a grimace, she turned back to face the undead before her. <br>
<br>
“I guess you’re not going to let me just walk out of here, huh? At least your bodies will not feel the pain of my blades. Rest in peace, Lady Muire” <br>
<br>
Tyl joined the battle with a rush, her mind completely focused on an image. The image of the rogue, with her book under his arm…. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tylvillenria>Tyl Villenria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/30/03 3:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Return to Battle</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Return to Battle - Chapter 11: Hunter…</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
The vase shattered against the wall, frightening the few birds that had gathered at the inn’s window. Brendyn sat down on the bed in disgust. Months had passed since his arrival to Hibernia, and he was no closer to finding Vencklayne. The days began to drag by, each as disappointing as the last. No record of his name, no record of his coming and going, no family or friends. It seemed that Vencklayne had disappeared off the face of the realm. <br>
<br>
Brendyn worried, and not for the first time, that something more insidious might have happened to Vencklayne. He shook his head, clearing such thoughts. Vencklayne was a crafty one, to be sure. Brendyn doubted anything, or anyone, could overtake the old warrior. He tried not to think about it, but this thought included him as well. <br>
<br>
He had found little information from the Fellowship as well. Though powerful and learned travelers each, their priorities seemed to rest more in the enjoyment of each other’s company, and the pursuit of personal goals that drew them together. Theirs was not a guild of knowledge. <br>
<br>
Brendyn decided to spend one more day in the alleys, pumping the vagabonds for information. With nothing else to go on, his prospects looked dim, but there was nowhere else to go. This was Tir na Nog, a small capital compared to his homeland, but a capital nonetheless. <br>
<br>
The day passed with little accomplished. As evening approached, Brendyn had given up. Turning to leave, he noticed a young boy studying him, though he tried his best not to appear to be doing that very thing. Knowing the trick all too well from the streets he grew up on, Brendyn began to leave, heading directly towards the boy. <br>
<br>
The bard flexed his hands, looking forward to blowing off some frustration by teaching this young thief a lesson. However, instead of moving toward his mark, the young buy turned down a nearby alley, giving Brendyn a slight glance as he did. Brendyn had utilized the services of street informants in the past, and knew this game as well. Slowing down his stride, he walked around the corner, keeping the boy, who was already half way down the alley, just in his sights. <br>
<br>
After following him around twists and turns for nearly half an hour, Brendyn finally came around a corner, to see the young boy standing before him. <br>
<br>
The boy was dirty. This fact was the first thing to strike any observer, and was a difficult thing to get past. Having dealt with all types of people from all walks of life, Brendyn continued to study him. His clothes were ripped, soiled from the garbage he probably slept in. His hair was uncut, tucked underneath a filthy cloth hat, one he probably either stole or found discarded. He wore a thick cloak, but upon closer examination, it was found to be a tablecloth, “found” at one of the many taverns within the city no doubt. The boy was young, and small in stature. Thin, but not famished, his slight build seemed weighed down by his clothes, but could just as easily be the mantle of poverty worn about his shoulders for countless months, if not years. <br>
<br>
“What do you have for me?” Brendyn said, hoping to get this business over with. <br>
<br>
“ere now, that not the ay it works, m’ord.”, the boy replied, a smirk slowing forming on his filthy face. <br>
<br>
“I beg to differ. You’ve spent my time, which is rather precious to me,” the bard replied, a matching smirk growing on his face. Brendyn pulled back his cloak, allowing the boy to glance at the bastard sword hanging easily from his belt. “I would not want to be the person to take that time, and waste it. Now, tell me what you know, or tell me that you’ve wasted my time,” Brendyn finished, the smirk replaced with a deadly serious stare. <br>
<br>
The street urchin stared at the blade, looking as if he was suddenly going to run for it. Brendyn, feeling more at home now then he had over the past few months, pulled back the other side of his cloak, revealing a very thick coin purse. All thought of leaving left the young boy, his eyes drawn to the sight of more money then he had ever seen. <br>
<br>
“My time is short, boy. Maybe you misunderstood me. I will pay you, and pay you well for your information, as long as it is useful to me. Now, tell me what you know,” Brendyn said. <br>
<br>
“Vencklayne,” said the boy. <br>
<br>
Had Brendyn not been tired from his previous fruitless searches, and so far away from home, he might have been able to hide his excitement, the first rule of negotiation. Had he been aware of his own expression, he would have chided himself days later. <br>
<br>
Instead, Brendyn could only stare, his dull, tired eyes replaced with a gleam. <br>
<br>
“Tell me more,” Brendyn said, a slight edge seeping into his voice. <br>
<br>
Brendyn left by horseback that very night, headed south to the location detailed by the young boy. He knew that he would only be wasting his time staying in Tir na Nog, being too excited to even sleep this night. Finally, a lead. Finally, he would have his chance. <br>
<br>
His chance for revenge. <br>
<br>
The young street boy opened the back door to his abode, tossing aside the gold coins he had received from the bard to the beggar sitting next to the alley. His anonymous “tip” for the services of a guard. The type that was never noticed, even by the rogue’s guild. Stepping inside, the young boy stripped out of his dirty street clothes, heading first to the bath. Removing the filthy cap from his head, his pointed ears poked out above his hair, slightly sore from being tucked down beneath the hat. Stretching to his full height, he still stood below six feet. Short and young, even compared to other elves, the rogue had perfected his disguise as a street urchin. The man cleaned up, replacing his rags with his well-oiled black leather armor. The rogue ran his fingers through his golden hair, cleaned and brushed after the recent bath. Already smiling from his latest accomplishment, he glanced over where his weapons rested, grabbing his large magical black cloak. His weapons shared a table with an old, threadbare tomb, nondescript and unmarked. The rogue had to laugh aloud, thinking of all that he had accomplished in the past few days. The book was safely his, ready to be delivered to his employer. The only person to know about it left for dead in the tomb of the Muire family. He smiled, thinking of the bonus he would receive for taking care of that nosy bard, the last person to know of Vencklayne. <br>
<br>
He glanced outside, noting the position of the moon. The bard would make it to the camp in an hour at most. The rogue grinned from ear to ear at that thought. <br>
<br>
Midnight couldn’t come soon enough.<br>

<br>
Brendyn glanced over his shoulder, feeling the wind rush past his face. His gaze fell upon the rising moon, peaking above the trees of Tir na mBeo. Brendyn settled back into the saddle of his horse, deciding that he would make it in time. The street informant told him to make it to the camp by midnight, and judging by his directions, it would be a little ways into the forest nearby. <br>
<br>
The forest where Vencklayne lived. <br>
<br>
Brendyn rode past Ardagth, just another horse rider on the trail to the south to those who even noticed. Save one. A set of eyes marked his passage, with a little more than a passing interest. The owner of those eyes walked calmly over to the stable master, purchasing a horse to ride to Connla, hoping to follow the cloaked bard. <br>
<br>
Brendyn’s arrival in Connla was met with little attention, many of the inhabitants already gone to bed. Tethering his horse at the stable, he glanced around, found the right direction, and headed into the forest. Although he had time, he was not sure how long it would take to find the campsite, and did not want to miss his chance. <br>
<br>
The informant said that Vencklayne always visited the campsite at midnight, some sentimental reason that only an elf would hold, and only an elf would know. The reason was not important, however, it was the chance to catch the wily warrior out in the open that mattered to Brendyn. <br>
<br>
He arrived at the camp, noting that the moon still shone before its apex. Brendyn nodded, finding one of the empty tents to be suitable for his trap. Then, he laid in wait, flexing his hands and wiping the sweat from his eyes. <br>
<br>
Inside the tent, he could only see the immediately surrounding area. Had he been outside, he might have seen the slight glimmer of the moon coming from a nearby tree, shining off of a set of dull armor as the wearer breathed in the night sky. <br>
<br>
Brendyn felt it more than saw it. A presence, just outside the tent. Although he could not see anything from inside, he felt like he had pinpointed the location of the midnight visitor. A dark dread seized his heart then. Trusting his feelings, he quietly held up his sword, lining up his stab. With a yell, he leapt forward, through the tattered leather tent, directly diving for the heart of the presence. <br>
<br>
He tumbled to the side, suddenly very cold, his hand going numb. <br>
<br>
Untangling himself from the tent, Brendyn found himself sitting just outside the campsite. <br>
<br>
Staring right through a ghost. <br>
<br>
The specter turned to regard him, undamaged by his sudden attack. Brendyn looked down at his hand, surprised to see his sword lying on the ground next to him. His hand was so numb, he did not even feel the sword missing. <br>
<br>
The bard looked up, his face setting in the scream that his lungs would not make. One by one, more and more ghosts appeared at the campsite, each in succession turning to regard him, the intruder. <br>
<br>
A slight hiss, like ice hitting a red-hot coal, escaped the spirit’s mouth. Gathering around, and coming closer, Brendyn found himself in a situation he hadn’t been in for a long time. <br>
<br>
Brendyn didn’t know what to do. <br>
<br>
His feeling of helplessness and fear melted to sheer terror as the voice of the undead filled the night air. <br>
<br>
“ALBIONIAN!…INVADER!” <br>
<br>
Brendyn had been prepared for that call during his entire stay in Hibernia. From small village to large bustling city, from quiet meetings to loud taverns, Brendyn had been prepared to debunk any claim of his heritage, any accusation of his homeland. <br>
<br>
But there was no convincing the undead. Their proof was spiritual, able to sense that he did not belong here. He would not be able to talk his way out of this. Even as that realization sank in, he glanced at his sword lying on the ground next to him. Brendyn had his doubts about the effectiveness of fighting his way out as well. <br>
<br>
That left only one alternative, running. One he was particularly good at, or so he thought. Brendyn tried to rise to his feet, but found his body sapped of strength, the terror of the undead before him too much for his battered and weakened body. <br>
<br>
Brendyn smirked, preparing for the end. He found it a bit ironic that his end would come at the cause of his obsession for finding Vencklayne, although he had assumed it might, if only at the end of Vencklayne’s sword. <br>
<br>
Brendyn closed his eyes, as one of the spirits stopped before him, raising its sword to cut him asunder. His preparations for the afterlife were interrupted as a voice, a human voice, cried out. <br>
<br>
“BRENDYN!” <br>
<br>
A flash of steel, a flurry of cloak, and a sharp ringing of metal on metal assaulted his senses. Brendyn’s eyes snapped open, trying to figure out what just happened. <br>
<br>
Standing before him, staring down the ghosts with her sword drawn was a celtic heroine. Shaenon turned to glance at him. <br>
<br>
“Oh Brendyn, what have you done?” <br>
<br>
Brendyn could only stare back, shocked by her sudden appearance. His shock was quickly replaced with dread, as he saw the ghosts suddenly turn their attention to Shaenon. <br>
<br>
“Shaenon, you have to get out of here!” Brendyn cried, but was cut short by the look on Shaenon’s face as she regarded him. <br>
<br>
Peace. Calmness. Devotion. <br>
<br>
Love. <br>
<br>
Brendyn slowly closed his eyes, for the first time in his life, disgusted at what his charm spell was about to cost. For what his spell was about to do to this young, shy woman. <br>
<br>
He looked on in horror as Shaenon steeled her gaze onto the specters, raised her huge sword with one hand….and beckoned to the ghosts. <br>
<br>
Brendyn finally got his feet under him, and stood up, hoping that he would be able to offer something, anything, to the coming battle. The ghosts slowly stalked around Shaenon, their blades glowing softly in the moonlight. Shaenon and Brendyn stood their ground, awaiting the exchange of blows. <br>
<br>
The specters had a different idea. <br>
<br>
As one, they raised their free hands, each pointing a finger at Shaenon. Shaenon screamed out, her body suddenly covered in cuts by invisible blades. Brendyn prepared a spell of minor healing, hoping to at least stop the bleeding, to do something to stop this brave woman from dying before him. He found his voice trailing off as Shaenon turned her face to look at him. Her body was bleeding from numerous cuts, but Brendyn found himself unable to turn away from her face. <br>
<br>
The blue lines, celtic markings foreign to the bard, pulsed with a gleam barely seen in the darkness. Shaenon’s mouth slowly smiled at him, before contorting in a grimace. Brendyn stared on in fear, as Shaenon stared back, eyes suddenly a dark red. <br>
<br>
A vicious “pop” filled the air, and Shaenon let out a scream. Brendyn thought the noble heroine was under attack again, before the awful truth sunk in. Shaenon’s body began to contort, a growl escaping Shaenon’s lips. Suddenly rising to her feet, her body growing beyond the armor she wore, her hair growing tougher and tougher, becoming like hard bone. <br>
<br>
Transformed, the Celtic warrior towered over Brendyn, who stood transfixed by the sight. A forest spirit, easily holding the 2-handed sword with one hand, growled in defiance to the ghosts before her. <br>
<br>
The spirits seemed to take pause, perhaps a little surprised to see one so in tune with nature on the other side of the battlefield. As Brendyn studied their inactivity, he noticed for the first time that they were, or at least used to be, Elven. As Shaenon began her charge, the ghosts raised their hands again, this time not to cut down the raging Stag spirit, but to magically hold it in place. <br>
<br>
Brendyn’s heart sank as he saw Shaenon held tight by magical bonds, unable to get any closer to the spirits, her body weakened from the wounds she had suffered. A few moments later, she collapsed from exhaustion, her body reverting to its normal form. <br>
<br>
The ghosts, having dispatched the heroine, again turned their attention to Brendyn. Before they could even approach, Shaenon pulled herself up with her sword, gritting her teeth. <br>
<br>
“WAIT!” she cried out. <br>
<br>
The rest was lost to Brendyn, spoken in a language he did not know. It was not Elven, for he had overheard a few words in his travels, but somehow, the spirits understood it. They seemed appeased by whatever Shaenon had said, yet they did not move to leave, gathering instead in a semi-circle around Shaenon. <br>
<br>
The darkest horror Brendyn had ever felt suffocated him as what was happening began to sink in. It would have been appalling had Shaenon died during the battle for his sake, though he would probably not have had long to lament with his death quickly following. <br>
<br>
But this…this was agonizing. This was horrific. This wasn’t right. <br>
<br>
The ghosts waited, apparently agreeing to give Shaenon a few moments to finish any business she might have with the living; giving her a chance to say her goodbyes. <br>
<br>
To him, of all people. The person who caused her demise. <br>
<br>
Brendyn looked at his sword, lying next to him still. He stared, begging, pleading with his body to fight off the numbness and raise it up to save Shaenon’s life, even at the expense of his own. His own worthless, pathetic life. <br>
<br>
“Brendyn” Shaenon whispered, drawing him out of his internal battle, “stop. It’s over.” <br>
<br>
“No….NO!…there’s no reason for you to do this!…it isn’t right!” Brendyn sobbed. <br>
<br>
“Bren….let go of your guilt. This is my choice, my life. It is what I was charged to do.” <br>
<br>
The bard stared at her, the tears flowing from his eyes going unnoticed in this moment. <br>
<br>
“How can you say that?!…After what I did?!…You don’t deserve to die!” Brendyn cried. <br>
<br>
“You did nothing, young bard. I am a gypsy, knowing when I was very young that my life would be given, devoted even, to the protection of another. Your enchantments have no effect on me, but I knew there would be no other way to get you to allow me to keep my vow.” Shaenon whispered, her bleeding slowing as her life began to wane. <br>
<br>
Brendyn only stared, shocked. “Your vow?…to whom?” <br>
<br>
Shaenon smiled sadly, “I only wish I had the chance to be there, when you find the person you’re looking for. Though my life is not pointless, not in the least, your life is that much more important. You MUST survive, you must live on. Consider how important your role is, even now, if I am willing to give up my own so that you can succeed.” <br>
<br>
Shaenon coughed, feeling suddenly very light. Brendyn fell down to the grass beside her, forgetting about the twelve ghosts that surrounded them. <br>
<br>
Shaenon raised her hand to Brendyn’s face, caressing it softly. “You have to learn to trust them. Your road is a difficult one, one that you cannot do alone. My vow is kept, my life complete. Do not dishonor that by failing. Do not fail by being too proud to seek help. Be strong, Brendyn. I will be watching from beyond, and when the day comes that you pass over, I will hold you to telling me how you succeeded. Do not disappoint me,” she said, smiling as she closed her eyes for the last time. <br>
<br>
Brendyn did not notice that the ghosts had left. <br>
He did not notice as morning approached hours later. <br>
<br>
Later that day, Brendyn watched the sun set on the coast, resting on the cliff top that overlooked Connla. He looked down, to the place where Shaenon now laid, buried a few feet away. Haunted by her words, Brendyn tried to make sense out of what had happened to Shaenon, what she had meant, and why he was given another chance. <br>
<br>
Somehow he felt that Vencklayne would know.<br>

<br>
The young man flinched as another line snapped free from the boat’s mast. This was the worst storm he had ever heard about, much less been in. He had grown up in a fishing town, near the coast, and boating had been a way of life ever since being old enough to swim. Another bolt of lightning struck the water near his vessel, demanding his focus on the job at hand. When the storm began, his first thought was returning home. Now, after nearly four hours of torrential rain, crashing waves, and dangerous lightning, his only thought was survival. Only an hour later, and his boat was capsized, his final thoughts were of his homeland. <br>
<br>
The young man awoke on a beach gently lapped by the waves. It had been ten years since his arrival here, and just recently, his dreams had been filled with that fateful day, brought on by his upcoming departure from this land, back into the sea. He thought back to his first meeting with his elven provider, just a young man himself. Both were surprised to see another living being out here. Both were fascinated by the others way of life. <br>
<br>
After six months, they learned enough of each other’s language to communicate every day with basic words. They built a hut to live in, and hunted for food nearby, the elven companion teaching the young man how to hunt the beasts of the forest. The human returned the favor, teaching the elf how his people earned their living on the sea, setting up water cages and fishing off shore. <br>
<br>
After one year, the elf had learned enough of the young man’s language to understand him fully. To understand the civil war ongoing back in his homeland. <br>
<br>
To find himself fascinated by tales of far away lands. <br>
<br>
After three years, the young man had learned enough of the elven language to understand it fluently, though he could still barely complete sentences with it. The elf spent the next year telling the young man about his own homeland, beyond the veil, and his interests in the outside world that drew him out. To him, the gathering of knowledge was the greatest goal of his life. <br>
<br>
They spent the next years trading information with each other: the young man taught as much as he knew about the outside world, their culture and livelihood, and the ways of the ocean and boating. The elf taught the young man the ways of the land: how to hunt, how to track and travel quietly through a forest. <br>
<br>
And how to fight with a blade. <br>
<br>
And now, ten years later, the young man was about to return home. The two had spent the last few years crafting a boat sturdy enough to allow him to return to his homeland. He was now 28, both were actually, though only in human years. The elven lad, still appearing quite young for 28, would live long beyond the life-span of the young man he had come to know so well. However, the years spent together had forged a friendship neither was prepared to give up. <br>
<br>
The young man sat up, glancing over at his newly crafted boat. All seemed in order, his preparations made to set out tomorrow morning. He looked back towards the hut that he and the elf had called home for the past ten years. <br>
<br>
He thought again of how much he would miss this place…. <br>
________________________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
The elf looked out from the doorway to the hut he now called home, to the strange young man sitting down by the beach. So much had happened in that span of ten years, so much had been learned from this one young man. The elf’s thirst for knowledge was enough to drive him beyond the veil at such a young age, to return to the land populated by celts and firbolgs. And then, beyond his wildest dreams, a stranger from a distant, foreign land practically stumbled across his path. <br>
<br>
It had been a wonderful, informative ten years. The elf was not about to let it stop now. <br>
<br>
The elf glanced down at an orb, resting on the table next to a few souvenirs for the young man to take with him. The orb was small, only two inches in diameter. Its color matched the azure blue of the sky after a rainstorm, still glowing slightly from the enchantments placed on it. The elf would be working off that debt for some time to come, but the price was nothing compared to the power he now had in his grasp. <br>
<br>
The elf took a small parchment out, writing a few words with delicate strokes of a quill. He quickly rolled up the note, and touched the orb lying on the table. Without a sound or delay, the orb opened in half, revealing a compartment. The elf placed the note inside, closed the orb shut, and wrapped it in a few rags, placing it amongst the young mans items. Yes, ten years was a long time to gather information. <br>
<br>
But not nearly long enough for an elf.<br>

<br>
Ereck woke early, eager to return to his patrol. It had been ten years since his return to his village, and his hometown had accomplished much. The civil war had ended, though bandits and rogues still roamed the outskirts of the larger cities, feeding off of the little hamlets like Ereck’s fishing village. Though individually they posed no threat to Ereck and the men of the village that he had trained in the basics of fighting, Ereck had always worried that they would only grow stronger and bolder as winter approached. <br>
<br>
Time had passed, and Ereck found himself aching more and more with each morning. His youth spent protecting the land he loved left him with many bruises and cuts, and himself feeling much older than he actually was. Ereck had taken a beautiful wife, a childhood friend more than happy to see him return so long ago. They gave birth to a son, whose fifth birthday was fast approaching. <br>
<br>
Ereck thought back fondly to the time he had spent in the elven land, idly picking up the strange blue orb his elven friend had given him. He thought, and not for the first time, how his own son might follow his footsteps, learn the elven arts of the forest, and protect the land Ereck had come to love. He turned the orb over in his hands, trying to remember the path his boat had taken between his land, and the elves. <br>
<br>
Ereck sighed, whispering to himself the impossibility of reaching him. <br>
<br>
With the name of the elf uttered, the globe slowly glowed, and opened., revealing a parchment rolled up and held within. <br>
<br>
Ereck read the note, surprise slowly replaced by excitement. With a smile upon his face, Ereck scribbled a note in reply, placed it within the orb, and closed it shut once more. Uttering the elven word for “return”, the orb’s glow increased in brightness, only to begin to fade. As the orb grew dark, Ereck held his breath as the orb itself disappeared. <br>
<br>
He could only hope that it would return properly to its master. <br>
_______________________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
The elf looked up from his writing, watching with delight as the orb slowly came into focus. He had wondered just how long it would take for Ereck to figure out his little “gift”. Although he would not admit it to the human, he was impressed with how quickly the reply had come. Ten years was not a long time for an elf to wait. <br>
<br>
His slender elven hand grasping the orb, the elf uttered the word of opening. He read the note eagerly, only to find himself rather perplexed. He read it a second time, and a third, allowing the proposition to sink in. Perhaps he could still use this to his advantage. Although it was not part of the original agreement outlined within the note, the elf was sure it would not take much convincing to get Ereck to see things his way. <br>
<br>
Gathering information would be easy enough as he patrolled the areas around his village. Perhaps he would have to travel a bit farther than he might want, but with his child “safely” under the care of the elf, Ereck would surely try to appease his old master. <br>
<br>
The elven master gathered his equipment, and prepared for the journey ahead. He wrote a reply to Ereck, detailing the directions to the designated island. He included a small sketch of a map, knowing that one as skilled as Ereck would have no trouble finding the place in the open seas. <br>
<br>
The elf sent the orb back on its magical journey, and set out for the island. Although Ereck would have no trouble finding it, this would only be the master’s fifth trip on the ocean. He decided it might be best to get a head start on “young” Ereck.<br>

<br>
The boy grinned, assured that his blade would finally hit its mark. This time, he would strike the master! <br>
<br>
The boy sat on the ground, trying to figure out what had just happened over the past three seconds: how he had been disarmed, and dropped with but a flick of the master’s wrist. <br>
<br>
The master chuckled, trying not to laugh too loud. Although the boy might think otherwise, the master knew that this one was probably his best student yet. <br>
<br>
The master had seen many generations of students pass through his doors since the day Ereck had reached out to him for help. He approached each new challenge with youthful zest, finding each new student to be brighter and faster than the last. This one in particular had mastered the basics of sword combat in but two years. <br>
<br>
At the age of fourteen. <br>
<br>
The master generally left sword fighting as the last stage of training, allowing his students to grow into their new muscles, but the joy his latest student had shown in his studies of warfare simply overpowered the elf’s original plan. This one would be a wise tactician, and a fierce warrior. Exactly what his homeland now needed. <br>
<br>
The master dismissed his student to his daily chores, retiring to his chambers. The elf was saddened by the latest information reports coming in from his student’s father. The 40-year war had reached a crescendo of activity, with many battles ending in the death of those who dared to defend their land from the bandit army. The master sighed, and returned to the work at hand. <br>
<br>
He sat at his desk, opening the book resting there. Printed neatly across its cover were the words &quot;Beyond the veil, an anthology of the known information about the lands outside our home.&quot; <br>
<br>
Turning to the next empty page, the master began to scribe the latest information he had collected. <br>
________________________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
The master stretched as he waited at the shore of the island meeting place. He was surprised to hear so quickly this time from his previous student, Umael, who was already wishing for his master to take on his next student. As Umael’s boat approached, the master wondered how much he would be able to accomplish, feeling the age that had seeped into his bones and muscles. <br>
<br>
Umael approached, followed by a young woman. This was certainly a first. Not surprisingly, his students had always been men. Perhaps it was just luck of the draw, the first born always being a man. Perhaps his students did not want to submit their daughters to such trials. The master did not waste much time on it personally. <br>
<br>
The master waited to hear exactly what Umael, his brightest student in the ways of knowledge, had in mind. <br>
<br>
“Master, I fear to inconvenience you, but our needs have changed.” <br>
<br>
“Oh?” the master asked, already knowing the answer but still curious of where Umael was going with this conversation. <br>
<br>
“Yes master. Our lands have finally come to love peace, the war ending shortly before I had returned home. Although I have tried in earnest to secure that peace, there are many that hunger for political power.” <br>
<br>
The master nodded, his own studies in politics telling him as much, and already formulating a plan. <br>
<br>
“I’ve come to the decision that our child should be raised to be a leader of men. I would be forever grateful if you could teach our daughter your knowledge of men, and of politics. Surely you have collected a vast amount of information in such things. Just the formative years, for she needs to return to our homeland at an early enough age to enter into the political world to work her way into a position of leadership. I fear I returned to old to work my way into the system.” <br>
<br>
“Formative years? Early age? Your daughter seems to be quite old enough already,” the master said, his older age loosing his tactful speech. <br>
<br>
Umael smiled, as did the woman behind him. “No master, this is my wife. Our daughter is still quite young.” <br>
<br>
Umael’s wife unwrapped the bundle she held close to her body, exposing their young daughter for the first time since leaving their homeland. <br>
<br>
The master shook his head, “I am not a child raiser, student Umael. This is not satisfactory at all!” <br>
<br>
“Master, I know I am asking much. But I feel this is very important, and therefore am willing to make…sacrifices.” <br>
<br>
“Oh?” asked the master, his curiosity entering his voice. <br>
<br>
“Our sailors have found the location of two other countries, untapped resources for your book”, Umael smiled, having taken a peek through the book his master had been writing. Just as Umael had expected, a new life seemed to shine out of the master’s eyes. <br>
<br>
“Well then, let us begin at once. Tell me, who might my newest student be?” asked the master. <br>
<br>
Umael smiled, as he always did when speaking about his daughter. <br>
<br>
“Her name is Tyl. Tyl Villenria”<br>

<br>
Kaejar was afraid. He wouldn’t admit it to his companions, would barely admit it to himself. But it was there. Fear. This was the lurikeen’s first trip into the tombs of the Muire family, the tombs that he had heard about since he was just a boy. Stupid dares! Why did he say yes? <br>
<br>
Pride. No other reason. With Nydira watching on, there was no chance he could say no. He had to impress her, and this was his first and only chance. Being the youngest of the kids that lived in Ardee, he would have been teased and belittled for the rest of his life had he said no. <br>
<br>
So here he was, an aspiring adventurer, with his most trusted friends. The four of them, on a search for the Hell Hag of Muire Tomb. Legend claimed that she could be seen wandering the halls of the deserted tomb, and only the bravest had escaped with their lives, much less defeated her. Kaejar swallowed hard, second-guessing the wisdom in hunting such a feared creature, and getting his best friends involved with it as well. <br>
<br>
“Look!” whispered Crauf, Kaejar’s best friend. “There she is!” <br>
<br>
Kaejar’s eyes grew big, as he looked down the dark hall, seeing a form stalk slowly toward them. Its hair was matted with sludge, cobwebs surrounded its body, grasping with the grip of the dead to the form’s clothes, dirty beyond recognition. Kaejar held his breath, his rugged bow shaking in his hands. <br>
<br>
“What are you doing Kaejar?” whispered Crauf. “Shoot her, quick!” <br>
<br>
Kaejar reached for an arrow, fumbling a few to the floor around him. Drawing back as far as he dared, he steadied his gaze, and let fly the arrow. <br>
<br>
The hag dropped to the floor with a thud. <br>
<br>
Kaejar and his friends grinned, congratulating Kaejar with slaps on the back. He would be the hero of Ardee! He would prove his worth to the beautiful Nydira! <br>
<br>
Crauf was the first to see the hag move. <br>
<br>
Silenced by the growl from across the hall, Kaejar looked up to see the hag slowly rise to its feet. <br>
<br>
Crauf was the first to reach the stairs, followed quickly by Kaejar’s other friends. <br>
<br>
Kaejar stared at the hag, his hands gripping his bow, his feet frozen in place. He could not pull his eyes from the horrible monster as it stalked slowly towards him. As it lumbered into the light, Kaejar’s eyes went wide. <br>
<br>
A woman! A warrior! What had he done?! Kaejar stared, seeing the woman covered in slime, blood, and webs. <br>
<br>
The woman looked down at the young lurikeen, and then glanced to the bow still held in his hands. She smiled slightly, trying to ignore the pain in her leg. <br>
<br>
“I think you dropped this,” Tyl said, handing the boy the arrow she had deftly evaded moments ago. Turning to pass, Tyl approached the stairs. <br>
<br>
“Wait!” Kaejar said. “You mean you’re not the Hell Hag?” <br>
<br>
Tyl looked back at the young boy, a slow smile showing on her face. She tossed a few strands of cloth at the boy’s feet. “Sorry, she didn’t think it was time for me to leave. I had to convince her.” <br>
<br>
As the blademaiden left, Kaejar looked down at the mummified cloth lying before him. <br>
<br>
A slow smile grew on his face. Boy would they be surprised when he returned! <br>
<br>
________________________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Laroac grinned at his assistant, counting the day’s take happily at a nearby desk. Today had been a good day, with many people visiting the city. It was with a bit of reluctance that he accepted the unexpected visitor. <br>
<br>
“Yes, what is it?” Laroac asked, always in a sour mood when interrupted from counting money. <br>
<br>
The short elf just smirked, wrapped in his black cloak, quietly standing before the rogue boss. <br>
<br>
Laroac shifted uncomfortably in his seat, unsure how to proceed. His ire only increased when he noticed the elf silently chuckling to himself! Before he could say a word, the elf cut him off. <br>
<br>
“You’ve already forgotten about me? Fine enough.” the elf said, pulling a book out from under his cloak. “Here’s the book you requested. Pay me my money, and I will be on my way.” <br>
<br>
Laroac couldn’t help but smile when the smirk disappeared off the elf’s face as his reward was thrown upon the floor in front of him. No one would speak to him in such a matter! He had a reputation to uphold! That would put this arrogant elf in his place. <br>
<br>
The elf stared holes into the rogue boss, refusing to bend down to retrieve the purse of coins lying before him. Laroac only laughed in his face, his personal guard moving a bit closer as his attendant walked up and took the book from the hands of the elf <br>
<br>
Laroac quieted, when the elf finally smirked. Without a word, he turned, walking calmly out of the room. The purse of coins laid untouched, on the floor where the elf had stood. As the door closed behind the young elf, Laroac’s guards broke into laughter, joined shortly thereafter by the assistant as he picked up the money purse, and placed it back on the table. <br>
<br>
Laroac chuckled, trying to forget about what just transpired. He was just one elf, Laroac told himself. <br>
<br>
What could one elf possibly do? <br>
<br>
________________________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
The hall was rather quiet. Although a few of the guild had gathered to share stories and drink, the patrons kept the volume rather low. <br>
<br>
Sylaria, Easyn, and Thiule gathered around a table, listening to the young nightshade Evelynne’s latest stories of battle against invaders. Nokekula and Starrag stood near the bar, debating tactics for the coming raid. Near the fireplace, Gilrondaar sat taking a much-needed rest, rubbing the ears of faithful Darkpaws, curled up before his feet. <br>
<br>
All eyes turned to the door, every voice going quiet, when the blue-cloaked bard slowly walked in. <br>
<br>
In his hands was a large shield bearing the emblem of the Fellowship of Dihn. Strapped to his back was a huge two-handed sword. Its name was Destruction; know by appearance to a few of the guild as the sword Shaenon had used. <br>
<br>
Brendyn walked over to the wall, where many weapons had been hung, retired for good or for just a break by the patrons of the tavern. The bard removed the blade from his back, and placed it upon the wall, hanging the shield next to it. Brendyn’s hand lingered near the blade for a moment, as all in the tavern watched the scene before them. <br>
<br>
Brendyn turned, and met the gaze of each guild mate in turn. Brendyn removed his light blue cloak, hanging it underneath the memorial to Shaenon. Nodding to the witnesses before him, he pulled a cloak from his pack, and fastened it around his shoulders as he left. <br>
<br>
Those who remained inside the tavern watched the bard walk away, the emblem of Dihn emblazoned across his back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tylvillenria>Tyl Villenria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/30/03 3:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Return to Battle</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Return to Battle - Chapter 14: Full Circle</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
The young man stood in the shade of the building, comfortably cool during the hot afternoon. Returning to Ardee was always a bittersweet visit for him. Growing up as one of the shorter elves ever seen, he was constantly the runt of the group. He took it all in stride, trying not to show just how much it hurt. Just how much he wanted to belong. <br>
<br>
He shook those thoughts from his mind, reminding himself that he had business to attend to. The elf waited patiently, knowing that Kaejar had never been late before. Even though he was a young boy, the lurikeen had shown a surprising maturity for his age. The youngest of the current group of children growing up in Ardee, Kaejar found himself in much the same position that the elf had: Always the one to be teased. Perhaps that was what had drawn the elven rogue’s attention to him, though the elf always told himself it was because no one suspected the boy would be working for a thief from Tir na Nog. <br>
<br>
The elf could not refuse to notice his jealous feelings when he saw Kaejar this morning, apparently the new “leader” of the youngsters of Ardee. <br>
<br>
Kaejar left the group, walking over to join the elf, knowing even as he did not see him that the elf would be standing there, in the shadows. A contented smile was on his face as he greeted the rogue. <br>
<br>
“What do you have for me today, lurikeen?” the elf spit out, a little more ire slipping into his voice and words then he meant to show. <br>
<br>
Kaejar’s face went dark, as he turned and looked away. The rogue was quick to respond. “Forgive me Kaejar, I have much on my mind this day. So who are the new warriors passing through Ardee this week?” <br>
<br>
The lurikeen’s face went blank, as he looked up at the elf. Clearing his throat, he said “You…you promise not to tell anyone about this?” <br>
<br>
The rogue could not hide his surprise. “My dear little friend, who was it that brought you the wondrous gem for your girlfriend Nydira? Of course you can trust me. I’d thought us better friends that that.” <br>
<br>
Kaejar smiled, remembering the look on his dear Nydira’s face when he gave her the gem. “Well, while hunting the Hell Hag in Muire tomb, I came across an amazing woman. She single-handedly fought her way up from the tomb, dispatching the Hell Hag herself. She…she gave me the hag’s scraps, so that I might claim her as my own kill” he finished, looking a little sheepish. <br>
<br>
The elf had to smile at this, aware of Kaejar’s new notoriety amongst the youngsters of Ardee. The smile only grew wider as the lurikeen continued. <br>
<br>
“She was a blademaster, dressed in blue armor, with fiery red spiked hair.” <br>
<br>
The elf was already pondering this new development as he said, “Please, dear little Kaejar, tell me more of this blademaster…everything that you remember.” <br>
<br>
Kaejar’s eyes lit up as the elf punctuated his request with a large, red ruby. <br>
<br>
______________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Tyl walked into Tir na Nog, no worse for the wear from her adventure in the tomb of Muire. Her clothes were washed, and her wounds clean. To any guardian she passed on the streets leading in to the capital, she appeared like any other warrior returning to the town after an extended trip away. <br>
<br>
Tyl’s real wounds were much deeper, beyond the view of casual observers. <br>
<br>
Her heart was heavy with failure. The last strong lead to the answers she sought was long cold, lost to the shadows. She considered the watchers, but doubted they would welcome her back. No, she decided, she was on her own. The book was the key, she was certain. Perhaps she could find out who was after it. These thoughts consumed her mind as she walked into her home in Tir na Nog. Closing the door, Tyl tried to think of where to start her search. Thinking another reading of the letter may yield some more clues, she turned to head upstairs. <br>
<br>
Her eyes were drawn back to a corner across the room. Even though she had not been home in a very long time, Tyl instinctually noticed the shadow thrown by the table; it’s length just a little too long. Before she could draw her blades, she recognized the laugh coming from behind the table. <br>
<br>
A young elven woman rose from the shadow, a smile on her face. <br>
<br>
“I almost had you, Lady Tyl!” laughed the elf, shaking her head. <br>
<br>
“Indeed you did, Lady Evelynne! I will have to keep my eyes out for you, as I see you have grown quite a bit since last I saw you. To think the same girl who brashly tried to walk in unnoticed just months before stands hidden before me now!” Tyl finished, a sincere grin on her face. <br>
<br>
A thought suddenly occurred to Tyl. Perhaps the young Evelynne could help Tyl out more than merely distracting her from her dark thoughts. <br>
<br>
“Evelynne, do you have contacts within any of the rogue’s guilds within the city?” Tyl said. <br>
<br>
“Not many, but I’ve a few friends. What might you be looking for?” <br>
<br>
“A man. An elf, though short for your race. Dressed in a rich black cloak, with golden hair. He had just completed a job for someone involving a book taken from Muire tomb.” <br>
<br>
“Well milady Tyl, I would be happy to see what-“ <br>
<br>
Evelynne stopped suddenly, her eyes staring behind Tyl to a corner. Tyl spun around, her own eyes going wide with shock. She heard Evelynne draw her blades, preparing to leap ahead and attack the intruder, but all Tyl could do was stare at the man. <br>
<br>
The man simply smiled at Evelynne, his arms folded across his chest, his dark black cloak wrapped around his body, no weapons in sight. <br>
<br>
“I suggest you hold your place, little girl. This doesn’t concern you. Or would you strike down the man offering the information your friend Tyl seeks?”<br>

<br>
Tyl could only stare at the man before her now, attempting to take in all that was happening. All that was happening so fast. <br>
<br>
Evelynne was a little less reluctant to act. <br>
<br>
Her blades already drawn, she boldly moved past Tyl to confront the elven rogue. Tyl outstretched an arm, turning her around to face her. Evelynne cast a shocked gaze at Tyl. <br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, I must know what this man has to say,” Tyl said. <br>
<br>
Evelynne nodded slowly, to agree with Tyl’s words. Suddenly, a look of surprise crossed her face, her eyes looking into Tyl’s…questioningly? <br>
<br>
Doubt was replaced with surprise, as her shoulders slowly went limp, her eyes unable to remain open, and her body tumbling forward at Tyl. <br>
<br>
Tyl looked up from behind the body of Evelynne she now held, to see the rogue retract a small needle. Calmly, he replaced it in a short bracer on his left wrist, finishing with a blank stare aimed at Tyl. <br>
<br>
“What?” he asked. <br>
<br>
Tyl fumed, her anger rising even faster as she noticed his blank stare replaced with a smirk, much like the one he flashed at her in the depths of Muire tomb. That look also reminded her of the importance of the information this man claimed to have. <br>
<br>
“Do not worry about your friend,” the rogue suddenly began, “she is merely asleep. We could not have her following us, much less hearing about our plan.” <br>
<br>
“OUR plan?” Tyl reiterated, skepticism clear on her face. <br>
<br>
“Well, maybe not OUR plan. But one you will come to accept, if you ever want to recover your precious book.” <br>
<br>
Tyl looked to her friend, Evelynne; now sound asleep on the floor. She hoped Eve would not hold this against her when she awoke. <br>
<br>
“So what is OUR plan?” Tyl said, defeated. <br>
<br>
The elf smiled. “We will infiltrate the rogue guild that holds the book you seek. Although our forces are made solely of you and I, we will surely triumph, as surprise is on our side. Finding our way to the guild master, we will…convince…him to give you the book. Meanwhile, I will recover what was taken from me.” <br>
<br>
“And that was?” Tyl asked. <br>
<br>
The elf only grinned from ear to ear. <br>
<br>
Tyl sighed. “Fine, what do I need to do then?” <br>
<br>
Again that annoying smirk. <br>
<br>
“Simple. You just need to trust me.”<br>

<br>
Tyl stared long and hard at the building across from the alley that she found herself in. A simple three-story structure, like many of the homes in Tir na Nog. Upon closer inspection, she did notice a young man that seemed to be standing rather close to the door most of the time.<br>
<br>
Tyl turned around to the rogue sharing the alley with her, to ask him about this man, this “rogue guild”.<br>
<br>
She found him dipping a dart into a small vial.<br>
<br>
“What are you doing?!” she hissed, trying not to be too loud.<br>
<br>
The elf looked up from his careful work, only briefly.<br>
<br>
“I’m trying to get just enough of this sleep poison so that I don’t kill the young man guarding the door,” he said. With a disinterested look, he returned to his work.<br>
<br>
Tyl reached out a hand, grabbing his arm to get his attention. “I don’t think we need to-“<br>
<br>
The rest of her words were lost in the intense cold stare that the elf returned to her. Tyl fell back a step, trying to discern if this man was about to attack her. Was he actually shaking?<br>
<br>
The rogue visibly calmed, taking a steadying breath. But the look in his eyes remained.<br>
<br>
“Do not touch me.”<br>
<br>
His gaze held on Tyl for a moment longer, and then he returned to his work. Tyl could only blink in response.<br>
<br>
The elf finished his work, and looked up to the doorway. Without turning around he said, “Stay here. When you see the guard walk away from the door, count to five. If he doesn’t turn around, make your run then. The door will be unlocked. Open the door, rush in, and engage the four guards on the first floor. I will be right behind you.”<br>
<br>
Tyl stared at the rogue, expecting him to turn around and give her that annoying smirk.<br>
<br>
Instead, he merely stood up and padded off toward another side alley.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Tyl watched as the guard walked off, counted to five, and headed for the door. Sure enough, the door was unlocked. She opened the door, ran inside, and looked for the guards.<br>
<br>
Her gaze was met by six very surprised thieves.<br>
<br>
Tyl noticed two things instantly. One, there were six guards, not four. This in itself was rather disturbing. The second thing she noticed was that none of their gazes were shifting behind her:<br>
<br>
To where the rogue, her “backup”, was supposed to be entering from.<br>
<br>
Tyl sighed, looking behind her just to make sure. She returned her gaze to the thieves before her, as they each reached for their weapons.<br>
<br>
Tyl shrugged, drawing her own blades.<br>
<br>
“Well then, guess we might as well start this dance. And me with no date. Any takers for first dance?”<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Tyl ran up the stairs to the third floor, cursing the rogue who led her into this disaster. But there was no chance to turn around now. The book was upstairs, and she wasn’t about to pass up on this, her only lead.<br>
<br>
She rounded the stairs landing, coming to a stop. A long hallway stretched out before her, longer than the building itself. It obviously tunneled into the mountain behind the house. Down the hall ahead of her laid the bodies of ten rogues. Before she could even fathom what happened, she heard noises from below. Reinforcements.<br>
<br>
Then she heard a sound that sent a shiver down her spine: the barking of dogs. Guild houses were notorious for raising the meanest dogs ever seen, almost like wolves. Intimidated, beaten, mistreated, they were bred for the sole purpose of tearing apart an intruder.<br>
<br>
Tyl ran down the hall, trying each door, but all were locked. Half way down the hall, she heard the dogs on the stairs behind her. Turning around, she stood her ground, blades drawn.<br>
<br>
Three dogs rounded the bend, their eyes latching on to Tyl, their mouths drooling. As they rushed forward, Tyl steeled her gaze.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, she heard a voice cry out, in a language she did not understand. But the voice carried weight, the word sounding like a command. Immediately, the dogs stopped their charge. Two of the dogs curled up on the floor, and went to sleep. The third loped back to the stairs, where a celt in dark robes immerged.<br>
<br>
The dog yapped happily as the man stroked its muzzle, petting the dog on the head as he turned to face Tyl. A sincere grin came across his face.<br>
<br>
“Tyl! Guess I stopped by in time.”<br>
<br>
Tyl could only smile at the mentalist standing before her.<br>
<br>
“Well, I guess you did Easyn. Thanks for coming, even though I forgot your invitation.”<br>
<br>
Easyn smiled in return, his face suddenly going serious. “Tyl, behind you!”<br>
<br>
Tyl turned to see a man with a short bow standing in front of the door at the end of the hall. An evil grin on his face as his arrow was aimed at Tyl’s heart.<br>
<br>
The sound of a whizzing arrow passed by Tyl’s ear in a flash of blue. It took her a moment to realize that it passed from behind her, toward the bowman.<br>
<br>
The bowman stood surprised, trying to figure out what just happened. An arrow, his arrow, fell to his feet. His hands started to shake as he looked to his bow, to see that the string was cleanly cut, a stilleto perched perfectly where it once was.<br>
<br>
Everyone in the hall focused their gaze at the young elven ranger calmly rise from her roll and lunge before the archer, her weapons already being replaced.<br>
<br>
The ranger turned around to see what everyone was staring at. Suddenly, she giggled, and returned their stares, throwing a wink Tyl and Easyn’s way, and a suddenly calm, determined glance to the terrified bowman.<br>
<br>
“Oh come on now, don’t look like that. Don’t you have any more arrows in that quiver? Looks like…five, six more? Listen, I’ll give you another chance,&quot; she stated, and started to walk back down to the other side of the hall.  &quot;Surely you’ve got another string in there. Go ahead, restring that bow. Come on, come on, we haven’t got all day….”<br>
<br>
The ranger giggled again as the bowman threw his bow down, running past the three and down the stairs.<br>
<br>
“Can never find a taker for that bet,” she said, shaking her head.<br>
<br>
Easyn and Tyl each smiled at the ranger, having witnessed her speed many times before.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps everyone you’ve run into is still sane, friend Sylaria?” Easyn chided.<br>
<br>
Sylaria paused to ponder this statement, for only a moment before a grin took in her face. “I guess I’ll just have to keep looking,” she said, a playful dejection seeping into her voice.<br>
<br>
“But Tyl, what are you doing here?” Easyn said, their friendly banter replaced by the need at hand.<br>
<br>
“There’s something I need to retrieve here, as well as a certain rogue to repay for his treachery,” Tyl said, turning to look at the last door at the end of the hall.<br>
<br>
Sylaria and Easyn exchanged glances, a plan formulated in mere moments.<br>
<br>
Easyn began a chant, calming Tyl’s mind from exhaustion and mending her wounds. Sylaria voiced her support, saying, “We’ll take care of the reinforcements below, you just do what you need to do friend.”<br>
<br>
Tyl nodded in thanks, and headed for the end of the hall without turning around. She knew she could trust her friends.<br>
<br>
As Tyl approached, she heard voices coming from the last room. Loud voices:<br>
<br>
“You have no idea how much money that is worth! I’ll…I’ll give you half…all! I’ll give you it all, just don’t kill me!” a voice cried out, full of terror.<br>
<br>
“You don’t get it, do you!? Even now…especially now, you continue to insult me?! You think this is about the MONEY?!” a second voice, rising in power, consumed by rage.<br>
<br>
“What do you want?!” the first voice, now desperate, cried.<br>
<br>
Tyl could only hear the second voice, suddenly deathly calm, but could not make out the words. A moment later, one of the voices screamed in horror, then suddenly went quiet.<br>
<br>
Tyl threw open the door, to find a man lying face down on the floor. Standing just beyond him, perched on a windowsill, was the elven rogue, wrapped in his black cloak.<br>
<br>
Under his arm was the threadbare book.<br>
<br>
Even now, after expecting every word spoken by the rogue to be a lie, Tyl was crushed by this last betrayal. Suddenly unable to take it anymore, with exhaustion seeping in, and Easyn’s calming spell wearing off, Tyl broke down, falling to her knees on the floor.<br>
<br>
The rogue sat there for a long moment, looks of regret and pain crossing his face very briefly as he watched the tears fall from Tyl’s eyes.<br>
<br>
“I’m….I’m sorry.”<br>
<br>
Tyl looked up, choking back the sobs.<br>
<br>
The rogue shook his head, the blank stare replaced.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry………..but this book must be destroyed.”<br>
<br>
Unable to look Tyl in the eye any longer, the rogue dropped out of the window to the street below.<br>
<br>

<br>
The elven rogue smiled briefly as he watched Tyl enter into the rogue guild house. Having heard the tale of Tyl’s escape from Muire tomb, he had no concerns about her ability to fight any inside of the rogue guild. Nodding to himself, he turned to find his own entrance. <br>
<br>
He chuckled to himself as he rounded to the back of the guild house. They thought they were so smart, hiding the window above the marketplace, impossible to see from any angle in the street below. He savored chances like this, the perfect finale to the events he had already set in motion for the guild house. He had patiently waited for the perfect time to exploit that weakness, putting petty insults and cheap opportunity aside, reminding himself to save this knowledge for just the perfect time. <br>
<br>
That time was today. <br>
<br>
Climbing the side of the mountain did not pose much of a challenge for the nimble elf, and he was quickly beside the windowsill of the guild masters office. <br>
<br>
He peaked in, listening with keen elven ears to the conversation going on. It seemed that the defenses were in disarray, unprepared for a warrior such as Tyl to enter the premises unannounced. However, steps were being taken to fend off the intrusion. The elven rogue heard the master order out his remaining guards, trusting that the only entrance to be gained would come from that hallway. <br>
<br>
The elf smiled. <br>
_______________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Laroac watched the last of his guards leave, shuffling over to his personal weapons cabinet. He looked through his collection, trying to find something that he may be able to use, just in case. <br>
<br>
“Come now, you don’t REALLY think that’s going to make a difference, do you?” <br>
<br>
The voice stopped him cold. Laroac turned around to find the black-clad elven rogue perched on his windowsill. <br>
<br>
“How…how…how did you get in here?” <br>
<br>
The elf smirked, glancing at the windowsill he was sitting on. “Probably through this window.” <br>
<br>
The guild master stammered a few more times, suddenly realizing who was now staring at him, and not too kindly. He fell back as the rogue hopped off the sill, in stunned silence as the elf quickly surveyed the room’s contents. <br>
<br>
“What, just a common thief, trying to come in here and steal from me? I’ll have you know that I’ve an army of guards just past that door. One word from me-” <br>
<br>
The elf laughed, not even looking over at the man. <br>
<br>
“At first, I just thought you were ignorant, perhaps just rude. Now, I truly see that you are an idiot,” the elf finished, picking up a threadbare book off of the desk. <br>
<br>
“Wait, what are you doing? You can’t take that!” <br>
<br>
The elf finally turned to regard the man, a smirk on his face. “I’m sorry, did you say I CAN’T take this? You hardly look like a man in a position to make demands.” <br>
<br>
The elf’s smirk disappeared as the man began to laugh at him, replaced with a blank stare before finally settling on a slow boiling anger. <br>
<br>
“You have no idea what that is, do you? That book you hold contains information very valuable, to some very powerful people. Stealing that will only mark you as an enemy, and your life will quickly come to an end,” said the guild master. As if drawing strength from his own words, he stood up to the short elf. <br>
<br>
The elf took a quick glance through the book while the man talked, soaking in the gist of the contents. Snapping the book shut, he interrupted the guild masters taunts. <br>
<br>
“Do you really think you could sell this to those people? You really ARE stupid. What’s to stop them from just killing you outright…” the elf stopped, suddenly seeing the game for what it was. <br>
<br>
“You have no intention of selling this to Fagan’s men, do you?” the elf accused, seeing immediately that his words had hit the mark, as the guild master shrunk back to the floor. <br>
<br>
“You’d actually sell out your homeland for some money?! You’re thinking to make a deal with Albion or Midgard? Where do you think you’ll go with this money? I should kill you now as a traitor” <br>
<br>
“What does it matter to me? I’m not a young man; my time will pass before this land sees any change because of it. This might even save Hibernia, with the information in that book, they could wage a much more profitable war against either of the other countries,” the guild master mused. <br>
<br>
The elf’s face turned serious, his blades finding his hands in an instant. For a moment, he thought of the poor he saw in Tir na Nog everyday, of those unfortunate people who had nothing to look forward to but living another day under the sun of Hibernia. <br>
<br>
He thought of Kaejar and Nydira, the future of his homeland. <br>
<br>
“You would discard the futures of those who call Hibernia home, for some cheap gold?” the elf spit, indignant. <br>
<br>
“Some cheap gold? You have no idea how much money that is worth! I’ll…I’ll give you half…all! I’ll give you it all, just don’t kill me!” the guild master pleaded. <br>
<br>
The elven rogue lost all composure, infuriated by this man who would so easily consider him as nothing more than trash, first by disregarding him, and now by thinking he could so easily be bought. <br>
<br>
“You don’t get it, do you!? Even now…especially now, you continue to insult me?! You think this is about the MONEY?!” the elf shouted, overcome with rage. <br>
<br>
“What do you want?!” the guild master cried. <br>
<br>
The elf calmed visibly, a slow smirk overcoming his face. <br>
<br>
“I want you to listen to every word I am going to say. Right now, as we speak, your guild house is in shambles. A lone warrior has conquered your men. That same warrior was within my grasp, to provide to you. With that simple knowledge, all of this would have been averted. However, you had to mock me, to belittle me. Because of that simple action, she was able to overcome your meager defenses, and ruin you today. And trust me when I say you are ruined. What rogue would join a guild that cannot even defend against one lone woman? But if it merely stopped there, you might be able to repair your reputation, and recover the losses you suffered this day. And yet, I must continue. I feel obligated to report you to Fagan’s men, anonymously of course, although I’m sure it won’t take long for them to check my story out. Honestly, offering information to our enemies? That’s treason. You’ll be hung by sundown. <br>
<br>
“Except I know you and your type too well. You won’t take your death like a man, you’ll run, and run far. You’ll try and gather as many men, and as much gold as you can, and make a life for yourself somewhere else. But then what would your lesson be? No, I can’t allow that,” the elf said, that evil smirk on his face from ear to ear. <br>
<br>
“Instead, as soon as I finish this sentence, I will poison you with this sleep poison, and you will awake to find yourself with mere minutes to make your escape,” the elf said, poking the man with a small needle. <br>
<br>
“Welcome to the working class, fool!” the elf snickered, laughing directly in the man’s face as he fought the poison. <br>
<br>
The guild master screamed, trying to work his way to the door to call to his guards, but instead he slumped to the ground, fast asleep. <br>
<br>
The elf turned to leave, arriving on the windowsill, when the door flew open. <br>
<br>
He turned to look back, having a good idea who it might be. <br>
<br>
Tyl walked in, looked down at the man asleep at her feet, and then to the elf. <br>
<br>
The elf had stared down many opponents, had used people to his own devices many times, and had even left people to their own demise. <br>
<br>
Yet, he paused, and could not move when he saw the tears begin to fall from her eyes. <br>
<br>
What could he say? Nothing seemed right at the moment, and yet, he felt obligated to explain to her, to tell her why he now must leave with the book she seemed to want so badly. <br>
<br>
“I’m…I’m sorry” <br>
<br>
As he said the words, he had to ask himself, why DID she want this book? After learning of its contents, he had to believe it was for personal gain. Fame, fortune, glory? <br>
<br>
His eyes met Tyl’s, as she looked up to regard him, clearly hurt by his betrayal. None of those things seemed to fit what little he knew about this woman, and yet, what else could there be? Confused by her motives, but positive he had the right course in mind, if not for her, or for himself, he steadied his heart. The right course for Hibernia, he told himself. <br>
<br>
“I’m sorry………..but this book must be destroyed.” <br>
<br>
With that, he turned, unable to meet Tyl’s eyes. Best to move on, and get this business over with before he changed his mind. He quietly dropped to the street below, moving amongst the crowd quickly, hoping to find solace in the shadows that were quickly forming as the day expired.<br>

<br>
<br>
The dawn found the elven rogue sitting beneath a tree outside of Ardee. Having left Tir na Nog underneath the cover of nightfall, the rogue’s black cloak wrapped tight about him for protection from the rain and any prying eyes, he collapsed shortly thereafter at the tree. Yet he could not find any sleep. <br>
<br>
He dared not sleep while the book was in his possession. <br>
<br>
The title seemed harmless enough. Barely legible on the threadbare cover, the words simply read “Beyond the veil, an anthology of the known information about the lands outside our home.” Yet even as he turned the first few pages, the rogue found his heart beating faster; faster than it had while making his escape from the walls of Tir na Nog. <br>
<br>
The first page listed the proclaimed author, Vencklayne. Not many knew of this old elf, but the rogue made it a point to know more than most did. His was only a minor tale in the long, grand history of the elven race. Vencklayne had left the veil, overcome with his own thirst for power. He was quickly considered an outcast, and many had been sent, fearing that in his search for information he may give away the secret of the elven homeland hidden behind the veil. None of those sent had returned. His name soon retreated from the minds of elves, and later from the history books. So it was no surprise that few knew the name today. <br>
<br>
What followed the first page was a series of hand drawn maps. The rogue could only study the first collection in confusion, knowing that he had never seen any of these places before. One page after another was turned in disgust, as the elf was sure he did not know the land they detailed. <br>
<br>
And then he read a word he did know: <br>
<br>
Midgard. <br>
<br>
The first few pages were nothing more than crude sketches of the Midgard frontier, not unlike those he had seen from returning Hibernian rangers. Yet as the pages turned, the maps appeared to be getting closer to the Midgard border. As the rogue turned to the next page, his passive curiosity suddenly became more focused. <br>
<br>
A list of names, ones he could only assume were of towns. Detailed maps, some obviously crafted by midgardians, were included within the book. Although many of the maps were written in a language he did not understand, most of the important words were translated by hand within the book. <br>
<br>
The elf continued to turn the pages, soaking all of the information in. Routes between towns, populations, known military camps, forest trails, and mountain paths; the book contained it all. His eyes grew bigger, his breath stolen away, as he came to a page simply titled “Jordheim”. <br>
<br>
Floor plans, shop locations, guard routes, even hand drawn pictures of the great hall. <br>
<br>
The rogue glanced over his shoulder, the weight of the information in the book weighing heavy on his mind. <br>
<br>
The next page was titled “Albion”, and followed the same course as the maps of Midgard. The elven rogue quickly flipped through, amazed at the splendor of both foreign lands. The collection of maps ended with “Camelot”, though the elf found it interesting that it ended rather abruptly, and certainly not completed. <br>
<br>
Still, with the information detailed within this simple book, the balance between Midgard and Albion could easily be swayed, should the book fall into either of their hands. And should Fagan recover the book, the knowledge could be a rallying point. He could gather a force large enough to overcome either of them, if not both. <br>
<br>
The rogue was pondering this thought, and asking himself if it was altogether a bad outcome, when he came across the next section. An empty page, with the words “Ocean maps” written across the middle. <br>
<br>
What followed was a collection of hand drawn maps, roughly gauging the distance between the realms by way of the oceans. The elf almost dropped the book in shock. Having never traveled on the open seas, he had never thought the realms could be that close to each other. And yet, here was a map that claimed that the ocean could reach each realm easily enough. The rogue wondered where the skills required to sail the open seas could possibly come from, knowing that this was never a prominent skill among the Hibernians. <br>
<br>
And then he spotted it. It was small, and nondescript, but it was obviously an inhabited island. He turned back to the first collection of maps, the ones he did not recognize. Sure enough, a few matched up with the shoreline of the island. He had never heard of this land, yet there it was. <br>
<br>
He then realized the even greater knowledge held within the book. For any realm that could conquer this land, or at least enter into an alliance with those who lived there, would have a platform to launch attacks against the other realms, except this time, by the ocean. <br>
<br>
The war could easily be swayed by such a surprise attack. And having the ability to press a realm on two fronts would win the war in a matter of months. <br>
<br>
The book held the rogue’s interest so tightly that he did not even notice the sun rise above Ardee that day. <br>
<br>
He did not see the town come alive with shopkeepers and weapon smiths preparing for the day’s sales. <br>
