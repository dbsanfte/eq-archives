He feels half-asleep, and half-awake.  This is his dream:<br>
<br>
It was a vacant laboratory with many different out-of-date scientific tools laying out on all of the tables and counter space.  An antique microscope took up a quarter of the room.  It was the doctor’s old lab – his first one in the Philippines.  The Doctor looked around the room observing all of the things that covered the walls.<br>
<br>
Magnetically, his eyes were turned towards the door.  There stood General Stock, neatly dressed in his uniform.  The doctor blinked half in shock. “Sire, I thought you were dead.” The Doctor managed to muster.<br>
<br>
“That’s what I wanted everyone to believe, but they found me out.  I’m blood hunted everywhere.”<br>
<br>
The Doctor smiled to himself.  “Please, come in, have a seat.”  As soon as the Generals back was turned, Dr. Demarco pulled out a gun and shot the general point-blank in the back of the head.  General Stock fell to the ground dead.  Again, the doctors’ eyes were magnetically drawn towards the door.  <br>
<br>
There stood a small boy, about the age of seven.  He was poor, dirty and disheveled.  It was Simon as the Doctor had first met him.  With the gun still in his hand, smoking, he stared at the boy in astonishment.<br>
<br>
The boy took a few steps into the room. “Hey mister, why’d you kill him?”  The childhood version of Simon had an innocent charm to it.<br>
<br>
The doctor attempted to give him a strait answer, but found himself slowing down and using very small words (very condescending) “Well, this man is a very bad man, and he broke a lot of rules.”<br>
<br>
Simon had a very intellectual retort, “Don’t fool yourself Dr. Demarco.  You didn’t have the authority to end a life.  In addition, you always taught me that life was precious – you kept talking about how you wanted to save the world.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, Simon…” saying that name, in that context, was the most natural act the Doctor had felt in months.  “You need to remember that I ALSO told you that you must make certain sacrifices to do good in the world.  Just know when to draw the line.”<br>
<br>
The boy began to pout “Then why did you kill me?  What did you gain out of that?”<br>
<br>
The doctor paused. “I was told to kill you.”<br>
<br>
“Stop lying to yourself Dr. Demarco”<br>
<br>
The Docter became frustrated and began to speak rather quickly “Alright, I killed you to make the world a better place.  I thought that you were a good person deep down, but you were just as corrupt as the next guy.  I made sacrifice after sacrifice – I sacrificed my morals, I sacrificed my research, I sacrificed my LIFE!  And I decided it was time that I cut my losses and let you go…. Face it Simon, the world is a better place without you.”<br>
<br>
The boy was now crying profusely, and the doctor was infuriated.  The doctor just stared angrily at the boy as puddles of tears were made on the floor.<br>
<br>
The boy looked up at the doctor, still balling, “You can yell at me all you want, just tell me the truth!”<br>
<br>
The Doctor was gritting his teeth “That IS the truth!”<br>
<br>
The boy looked down at the floor. “Fuck you, Fredrick!”<br>
<br>
As soon as Dr. Demarco heard those words, he pointed the gun, still smoking, at the boy’s head and fired.  Simon’s childhood body fell over on the floor, lifeless.  Blood was splattered all over the laboratory.<br>
<br>
Again, the doctor’s eyes were magnetically drawn to the door.  There stood the Herald, in a light brown jacket, fidgeting with a spoon and a key ring.  The Herald spoke “You’ve forgotten what I’ve told you already?  I’m so ashamed of you.  Get a grip, you don’t need power, doctor, I thought you were better than everyone else.”  <br>
<br>
The words repeated over and over again as the Herald kept his stare “Get a grip, you don’t need power, doctor, I thought you were better than everyone else. Get a grip, you don’t need power, doctor, I thought you were better than everyone else. Get a grip, you don’t need power, doctor, I thought you were better than everyone else.”  Eventually the words became muddled, twisted and confused in his head.<br>
<br>
Doctor Demarco awoke the next day without any real recollection of his dream… just the vague notion of a sentence in his head:<br>
<br>
“Get power, doctor, you’re better than everyone else.”<br>
<br>

<br>
All of the people that had made a moral impact on his unlife were there:<br>
<br>
General Stock<br>
Simon<br>
The Harald<br>
<br>
When he awoke this time, the dream was clear to him.<br>
It created a whole new insight into his problem.<br>
<br>
Dr. Demarco sat up in bed, and looked around him.  it was 4:00pm on wednesday.  He got up, and pulled a bottle out of the refrigerator (that he had converted into a &quot;warmer&quot;) and poured himself a glass of &quot;wine&quot;.<br>
<br>
He glanced down at the book left open on his desk:<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
Journal entry<br>
Tuesday April 8th, 2003<br>
<br>
Keeper, I know you're watching.<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Doctor slammed the book shut and threw it into his safe, chugged his glass of &quot;wine&quot; and walked back into the lab.<br>
<br>
&quot;I must get back to work&quot; He told himself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=79.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=79.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=79.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=79.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=79.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241b<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
