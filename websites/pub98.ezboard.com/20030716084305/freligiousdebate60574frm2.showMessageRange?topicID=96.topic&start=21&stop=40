To be sure one must be cautious with studies which is why I took a good look at Barna and their other work before using this particular one over a year ago (it's quite famous by now) and why when making a point about trends I try to include several studies done by several reputable groups over long periods of time whenever possible as this helps account for things like sampling errors, possible bias, questioning technique etc. If you actually visit the Barna site, you will find they are very thorough and provide lots of data on procedure, methods, analysis and sampling error. They are about as reputable as you'll get with this kind of thing.<br>
<br>
Why did I include it? You guys asked for data to back up my point about religion not improving marriage. Your elder said and was quoted here--<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness,respect, love, compassion, work and wholesome recreational activities.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
and you all agreed with his statement. The research on marriage and divorce contradicts the claim that &quot;successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer....&quot; Apparently, those most successful at marriage do it without these elements of religion while many who include these are not successful.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Seems to me that people who are truly in love, honest, have similar values, yet are willing to compromise and work at their relationship are the people who have the lowest divorce rate.

I haven't had time to look at it (dinner is on the stove, and I being the &quot;slave&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  must get back to my work! LOL), so hopefully you can answer MamaGadfly.<br>
1. How did the researchers go about validating a person's claim to a religion? What I mean, is, there are many people who claim Christianity, and yet are simply &quot;Sunday&quot; Christians. They don't pick up a Bible unless they are sitting in a pew, they don't practice what they hear preached, and they simply view it as a &quot;religion&quot; rather than a life-style or relationship with God. This alone could count for a vast number of divorces coming from &quot;religious&quot; people. I will have to agree with Heather, here, in that people that are truly committed to God (whether that be &quot;main-stream&quot; Christian, LDS, or even Jewish) probably have a stronger committment to their marriage and making it work than those who see divorce as something they can do when the going gets tough (ie: those who simply go to church to say they go to church).<br>
2. Did the people who got a divorce say when they got it? Meaning, most of those religions mentioned have many people who converted at some point in time ... it could very well be that they were divorced before their conversion, now are of a certain belief/religion, and when asked if they had ever been divorced answered yes. So, just because they are now Presbytarian (sp?) doesn't mean they had any church affiliation or committment before their divorce. (Again, also see my comment on those who are only &quot;Sunday&quot; Christians.)<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1. How did the researchers go about validating a person's claim to a religion?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think many who consider themselves religious (like my mother, a &quot;born again&quot; co-worker of mine and others) would disagree with the assumption that those that do not regularly attend church are not as devout, but of course there is no way in any survey to &quot;prove&quot; this. The folks (all adults interviewed 1:1) were taken at their word if I understand correctly and asked to describe their religious activity and beliefs. Descriptions of what is meant by evangelical vs. born again is on the Barna site. Indeed, many can claim to be religious and not mean it, but then so could the atheists and buddhists. I think everyone who claims to be xian believes s/he is and practices according to her/his beliefs about this. <br>
<br>
Now to be fair there was a huuuuuge hubbub in xian circles after this as they considered it to be a wake up call that folks weren't getting the right message in church, were bowing to social pressures and trends rather than god's word etc. I get way less questioning of the results (perhaps since Barna is a recognized xian research group) than I do reactions from religious groups and leaders trying to address these. Frankly, I'm more impressed by that too. It would be easy for them to live in denial or pick things apart rather than recognize what George Barna himself described as a trend among xians and address in within their own communities and churches. Kudos to the group for their honesty and openness with the results.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Did the people who got a divorce say when they got it? The divorces were with people already religious, though perhaps some religious folks found they could not continue in their beliefs or denom with a partner who was either never committed or grew away from religion and god. It's possible, but not the main reason. More likely, as Barna points out there is a trend to be more &quot;liberal&quot; in biblical interpretation and law. My grandma NEVER ate meat on Friday, cooked on Sunday or touched the host at Mass. My mother will try to eat fish on Friday, does whatever on Sunday and doesn't believe she has to go to Mass at all to be with god. As time goes on and society changes, so do our beliefs about marriage, commitment and how strictly we must follow rules...perhaps even god's rules. <br>
<br>
My two cents on why these may have been the results. Again--I'm not asserting that being Baptist makes you divorce or that atheism guarantees a good marriage. I absolutely agree that having both partners on the same page and agreeing about roles, child rearing etc. up front goes a loooong way in helping and admire the Catholics greatly for their marital counseling. What I am saying is that being committed to god and your xianity makes you no better prepared to marry or likely to stay married than my atheism.<br>

Thanks for your answers to my questions ... I agree with a lot of your points (don't have time to quote them ... ds is rearranging the office as I type). I also think Barna had a very good point about what is being &quot;preached&quot; so to speak and to address these trends in their churches. I think divorce rates like that, no matter the people's religious affiliation or lack thereof, are alarming and should be addressed. I also think that it boils down to being in sync with your spouse and having the same convictions, whatever they may be. I do know that in my family, it was the atheists or agnostics that all ended up divorced. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I also know that among my other &quot;born-again&quot; friends, all of our beliefs coincide in that divorce is not an option (unless of course there would be abuse, but that's a whole different topic). Our committment is to our marriage and making it as strong as possible through our faith in God and His will. (I'm not expecting you to agree with that statement, but that is how we see it.) I know that my dh and I were brought together for a reason and that we are meant to be married to each other. Sadly, though, in our society, divorce is seen as a very easy out of a very serious committment (I think I keep spelling that wrong ... is there only one <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>t</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?). This coming from one who came from a &quot;broken&quot; home. Anyways ... enough soapboxing about marriage. Thank you again for taking time to answer my questions. If I ever get more uninterrupted time, I'll try to check out the Barna website.<br>

<br>
I did want to briefly bring out this point you made ... it seems many churches have tried to diffuse the friction between &quot;societal&quot; norms and the Bible. Many churches seem to have relaxed their approach and have made church someplace where you are made to feel that no matter how you live your life, etc., that it's all okay. Therefore, I would agree with this statement as well. Maybe churches are trying to stay &quot;up to date&quot; with the permissiveness of society at large so as to attract more people?

Actually, (except for the &quot;his will&quot; part) I do agree with you. As my dh says, you pick the best you can and work with it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I agree too that if you do believe, you must abide by what you think is god's will. At least you're being consistent and living your convictions. I also remember a talk show on which a psychologist made the point that you must be committed to marriage--the concept, the institution, the conpact--however you both see it rather than just each other, this way when you are in your &quot;love you but don't like ya&quot; phase you can remember the partnership you are committed to. <br>

Amen sister!! Reagan I think was the first to make &quot;no contest&quot; in Ca so damn easy and contributed heavily to this idea of marriage being so easy to get in and out of. When there are no kids maybe, but then why distinguish? <br>

Me too--but that is part of what drives me so much to have a good marriage. I spent a great deal of my childhood and adolescence convincing myself divorce didn't hurt the kids so much and that an absent father wasn't such a big deal...what a load of crap. The stats are in and conclusive here too---it's actually better for kids for parents to stay married if they can be civil, even when one or both might prefer to be apart or happier individually that way. <br>
<br>
Another interesting fact I got from a mother's magazine---research on women who go through periods wanting divorce show that if they stick it out for at least 5 years they report being happier in the end!! Also most who divorce say it was harder than they thought on themselves and the kids and they should have tried harder. Sure, some folks should divorce, but I'm against it too--especially for the children.<br>

You really should, especially as a religious person. There are loads of interesting surveys on religion and how to approach the results. I am so impressed by this groups willingness to take good data and solve problems they see keeping with their beliefs and desires. There is a trend away from values and family and secularists are also alarmed. Surely there is common ground here we can use to fight these things together. What is more important?<br>

<br>
My thoughts were that those who are truly committed to their religion are less likely to get divorced than those who are &quot;religious&quot; in name only.  And the reason that Atheists had lower numbers too is that they have consciously thought about their philosophical theories and are living consistently with their own morals.  People who are &quot;undecided&quot; or not living consistently with their ideals have already demonstrated that they lack commitment, and IMO are more likely to choose the easy out. <br>
<br>
The ideals that the Proclamation on Families express if applied make the marriage that you are in more successful.  And I would suggest that all things being equal, a couple who practices the ideals that are expressed have a greater chance than a marriage where they are not.  If all Mormons practiced the doctrine in the Proclamation, I would be willing to bet that the divorce rate would be significantly lower than it is see e the same mistakes that all people do including selfishness, adultry, unfortunately even spousal abuse. <br>

<br>
I agree; I don't believe that someone has to be &quot;religious&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; to have common values. But so often the terms &quot;morals&quot; and &quot;family values&quot; get slurred in the same sentence as &quot;born-again&quot; or &quot;fundamental&quot; that everyone gets a bad taste in their mouths. (Granted, the &quot;fundamentalists&quot; may take the terms farther than the general public, but like you said, there is definitely some common ground to begin with.) Going off of this thought ... it amazes me at what we allow broadcast on TV (another soapbox of mine, though not as big as standardized tests and what a joke those are!). Our society is getting more and more permissive, and to me, it is getting more and more depressing. The question, though, is how do we find that common ground without feeling like each side is flirting with the &quot;enemy?&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I find the traditional view of christians about the man/woman role in marriage to resemble a parent/child relationship. I don't see how that can be healthy. Even when you have love and respect on both sides I don't see how having one partner being the person who has to submit to the authority of the other in all things (rather then each taking turns) can be anything but a parent/child relationship. How...unfullfilling.<br>
<br>
Now I, myself, to preform most of a traditional wife's job. I stay at home (my choice and preferrence). I do most of the cooking (I want to eat). I do most of the household chores. This actually is a point of contention in my family and one I want to see addressed because its wearing on me and due to taking out the recycling the other day we had a major problem here at home (my 2 year old locked me out of the house). <br>
<br>
But aside from practical roles my dh and I are equal partners in this marriage. Neither of us puts out wants and wishes above the other and for the most part take turns submitting to the other's wishes. He isn't head of the house. He does not make the finally decision in family questions. We make them together. We equally participate in this marriage. <br>
<br>
I grew up in a large family who the majority of them are practicing catholics (well mom's side is catholic and episcopole (sp)). I am taking about a HUGE family. My Dad is one of seven. His mother is one of seven. HUGE. (his mom's family is mostly baptist I think). One uncle was divorced and had the marriage annuled. The wife cheated like on the third day of marriage. Bad business. And one aunt married a divorced man. That's it. Divorce just wasn't something the family did. <br>
<br>
I think family background does contribute to divorce rates. I have had the luck of seeing family members work things out. Its nice. It helps me work things through with my DH when we are having troubles. <br>
<br>
But it also can be a problem. My sister and I were talking about how there has been times in her marriage when she might have wanted to leave her husband (I would not call it a healthy marriage) but hasn't because she worries how it would be accepted plus she does not want to hear Dad say &quot;I told you so&quot; or anything along those lines. I don't think he would say it to her, but he probably would to someone else. He doesn't like her husband. Doesn't think he's good enough for her.But then he doesn't think my DH is good enough for me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When my MIL found out my FIL had been cheating on her for years she refused to consider divorce because it wasn't biblical (in her mind though I've heard it here said that it is allowed in adultry). Their marriage is ... so unhealthy in my mind. And I think its sad that people stay in a marriage that isn't healthy for either partner because of religion. Its one thing to try and work things out, but this marriage is like watching an illness. <br>
<br>
I think marriage is good when its founded in similar principles with each partner. Mutual respect. When religion enters into it, if both partners respect the other's belief then it can be a strenght, but if one partner thinks the other needs to be changed in some way....I think that is the problem...and probably the source of the higher divorce rates over athiest. We all know if you go into a marriage thinking you can change the other person you are doomed to fail.<br>

Had a date with my wife tonight and got back late.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So much to respond to, I will start from the leftovers off the other thread....Ians1mom, I am sorry if you don't like me not respecting a woman who chooses to submit.  I would no more respect a slave who chose to submit or a parent that would not defend their child or a person who refused to think.  Do you realize that until the early 80's it wasn't illegal for a man to rape his wife?  You may chose to stay at home and raise a family, and that I do endorse.  I endorse it so very much that my wife and I practice it ourselves.  She is a SAHM and I am a breadwinner.  She submits to me as much as the sun submits to you.  You don't have to submit to do each acording to their ability.  You can do it as equals.  The minute you point out to me that you would never tell another woman she has to do what you do, we stop having a disagreement.  (Which you did so hardly anything I say applies to you personally.) What I disagree with are those who presume that the man-woman, breadwinner-domestic scheme is the ONLY way or that any other way is inferior.  That is condescending and self-righteous.  To answer your question about why I see wives as slaves to their husbands acording to your faith if not your practice is because (brace yourself Leah) Heather is right.  The bible is pretty clear about male superiority and womens status as chattel.<br>
<br>
Paige - do I believe my marriage is a property contract?  I believe that is what the document filed with the court is, but that is not what my marriage is.  My wife and I lived together before we were married, and I was commited to her before any paper came into it.  To tell you the truth, that document has hardly anything to do with my relationship to my wife.  It has far more to do with our relationship to our insurance carrier than how we see each other.  As far as 2 parents at home, loving and raising kids, well duh, obviously it is better for a kid than parents who despise one another or one parent who has to be away earning a living.  Then again, 4 parents who love each other would be better still (picture your inlaws moving in) and I know several families with their extended family in the home.  Mostly asian and hindu (which oddly have the lowest rates of divorce!)<br>
<br>
Misty - I am sorry if you think us citing statistics in refutation of an unfounded claim is some kind of superiority complex.  It isn't.  The only marriage and divorce rate I care about is my own. If someone takes a position that is unsupported by the facts (xians are more moral, xians have happier marriags, xians are smarter, make more money, commit less crimes, whatever) it doesn't matter to me if the group disproving them is buddhist, atheist or martian.  I care about the facts and reality.  Unfortunately, most of my facts are either xian or athiest oriented, because that was what I was and what I am now so that is where my exposure and knowledgebase arise.  Let me ask you this though, if an xian had stastics supporting that they were more moral, commited less crimes, earned more money, lived longer, had better hair and generally smelled nicer, do you think they would hesitate to roll them out?  Do you think I should be embarassed that the facts support my lifestyle and never mention it?  Or should I be pleased that my care and hard work appear to be pointing me in the right direction for a happy and successful life?<br>
<br>
Heather - this is twice in the same post, but here goes...&gt;You are right.  You cannot have 2 chiefs.  If you have a cheif somebody has to be an indian.  My question though is why have a cheif?  You also cite a great deal of scripture that pretty clearly says women must submit.  I don't see where it says women are smart or needed (your quotes say &quot;good thing&quot; and &quot;helpmate&quot;, nothing about smart there) but it rings clear and loud that women are to serve men.  As you said, if the others aren't listening to you, they aren't following the bible.<br>
<br>
Okay, on to the correlation of stastics.  A single study, like a single person can be flawed and not representative of reality.  If I were to tell a xian I was going to choose an avatar of their faith as a role model and selected Bill Clinton, that wouldn't be representitive. (Then again, maybe it would be?)  Yet if I took 4,000 men and bill was one of them, it would more closely relate.  So, you don't take a single study (or if you do, investigate the funding, very revealing) you are better served by taking SEVERAL studies and interpreting the mass as a body.  If one study says when xians pray for the sick they recover better, this is a positive correlation.  If another study says when they pray people get worse, this is a negative correlation.  Yet if you have multiple studies of reasonable quality and they each point in different directions, yoiu have NO correlation, which means the cause and event were unrelated.<br>
<br>
The one thing we can count on is that people change over time.  None of us are the same person we were 20 years ago.  I was a faithful xian 20 years ago, who could guess!  If you hold your faith more tightly than your marriage, you have handicapped your chances.  The choice of spouse should be based on compatibility (which requires clear understanding of what is compatible, I don't feel the bible is conducive to clarity with all the disputes among xians)  commitment and respect.  The nice thing about being an atheist is we can agree on what is truth and as we grow and change we can keep our eyes on that truth and reality to keep us safe.  I just wish xians could do that.<br>

i just wanted to make a point on this scenario.  who ever said that children born out of wedlock dont have a mom and a dad that love each other?  honestly, these are my opinions based on observing others, like myself, who have kids out of wedlock, but, it seems like my &quot;bastard&quot; children have 2 loving parents and many other friends and aquaintances of mine who have &quot;bastard&quot; children do too.  its the people i know that got married, had kids, then decided they hated eachother whose kids have the down side.  so im just a little offended by that remark.  my SO and i do not have any plans to wed ever.  we have stated our commitment to eachother privately and we dont need a piece of paper and witnesses to prove that commitment to others.   marriage, to us, is useless.  theres nothing like a wedding to screw up a perfectly good relationship says i!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Paige - it is lovely that you can selectively view your churches doctrine to make your life easier. Nevertheless, they hold that premarital sex is bad, children out-of-wedlock are somehow screwed for life, and that your bil fortunately pulled it all together to conform and multiply. (How lucky for him!) Each step away from the 'classical' doctrine is a step closer to reason.  Already you espouse policies and philosophy that distinguishes your cult from more fundamentalistic ones, and I see that as good. (In the same way I see a less stinky swamp as better than a more stinky one.)  Maybe if we could get rid of all the crap in the book of myths, we could approach something more like deism and everyone just get along.  Admit our ignorance rather than pretend to baseless knowledge just so we can feel good or superior or whatever.<br>

But as you and I have both stated in this thread, Heather is right and following her religion and the bible. I have to side with that cranky old Anarchist Bakunin on those who see the crap, injustice, mythology and inconsistencies in the bible or religion and choose to &quot;interpret&quot; it differently to fit what they can swallow and live with. This is an act of cowardice--to see the truth and lack the courage and conviction to call it that and choose to stand with it.  <br>

It is clear about women sumitting to their husbands and even the atheist can see that<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (even though I know you don't agree)  <br>
We will never see eye to eye on this issue but thats ok.<br>
I still dont like the way you all &quot;see&quot; submission, because I don't think your getting the real picture.  Like I said My husband doesn't boss me around and think he's on this high horse.  He goes out of his way all the time for me.  He lives to make ME happy.  He tells me all the time the only thing he cares about is that i'm happy.   He literally treats me like a queen.   I couldn't ask for a better husband in this world.   As being born-again believers we are all servants in the big picture.  He needs to give his 100% to the marriage also.  I'm not his slave!<br>

Sounds like the nice and loving way I treat my children and dog for that matter. As I said a long time ago---a benevolent dictator is still a dictator and the very long history of slavery was often one of kindness and good deeds done for the servant.<br>

He has the final say. Who has the final say in the parent/child relationship....the parent. <br>
<br>
How is that type of relationship healthy? I know you are going on the bible and doing what it says....but that isn't an answer. How is it healthy? <br>
<br>
I would get ticked off living like that. I am an equal in this marriage even if I do fullfill the traditional wife role. But I have equal say in all matters. We couldn't respect each other any other way. We can respect our children, its our job to raise them and part of raising them is making their choices for them. But I couldn't respect my husband if I knew he would accept my final say in all matters. And he wouldn't respect me for the same thing.  It wouldn't matter if he usually LET me have my way or if he treated me like a queen. Just knowing that I would always back down if he instisted (and viceversa) would kill our mutual respect. <br>
<br>
But then I look long and hard for a man who could stand up to me. I've a very forceful personality. And its nice to buttheads. It makes us both stronger.<br>
