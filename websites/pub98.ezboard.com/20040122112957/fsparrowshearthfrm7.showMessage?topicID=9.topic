<br>
It seems though to me, a lot of people who aren't even necessarily Christian, believe in destiny.  I hear it all the time, &quot;This is your destiny&quot; and &quot;You were destined for this.&quot;  In Star Wars, Darth Vader said, &quot;Luke, it is your destiny.&quot;  Of course he believed it was Luke's destiny to join him on the dark side and obviously that wasn't his destiny.'<br>
<br>
I might not believe in destiny except I have no good answer for why I am able to believe and accept Jesus while others are not, even others within my own family.  And I often wonder, &quot;Why me?  Why am I able to 'get it' when others can't?&quot;<br>

I don't think predestination is such a bad word when it is viewed in the proper context.  The &quot;ugliness&quot;, if you will, comes from that centuries old argument that creates a gulf among believers.<br>

Well Peaches, your questions here center around the debate between Arminians, Calvinists and all the peeps in between...and without writing a book, I'll just give ya my .01 on the &quot;why can't they see&quot; part.<br>
<br>
What blinds men?  Satan<br>
What renews/regenerates men? The Holy Spirit<br>
What is man's role in being regenerated? Faith<br>
What is man's role in being lost?  Continuing in the way of sin<br>

Maybe it's a different way to view it, but if I didn't believe God was able to control His creation, that He wasn't involved in it, guiding us through our lives and so forth, what would I be believing in Him for?  Only God is able to do these things, anything less is just a higher creation than we are, maybe, but still a creation, not a Creator. <br>
<br>
I also agree with Heartjoys, just because God does predestine our lives it does not rob us of our responsibility in responding to Him. <br>

It is very important to know that there is most definitely a third option (contrary to a lot of popular belief) when looking at this issue.<br>
<br>
It is something that I have been trying to look into lately (among other things) and if I can remember where I read some fairly interesting articles, I'll try to post the links here.<br>
<br>
As a brief aside, one of the articles was by a Roman Catholic apologist, but it definitely took a middle road.  Roman Catholicism absolutely disagrees with Arminian arguments since it does lead to Universalism, but even though it comes closer to Calvinist ideas, it does not go all the way.  I wish I could remember where I saw the article, it was quite interesting.  <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

I think I would fall into that third category because from what I've heard from both the calvinistic and arminian doctrines, I don't fully agree with either.  There are parts of each I agree with, but I seem to fall somewhere in the middle, even though calvinists try to tell me it's impossible.  It's possible, I know me better than they know me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One thing I guess I don't like so much about the calvinistic approach is that they seem to be solely trying to explain everything from God's perspective and it seems to me, we're a bit small to be able to understand God's perspective.  We ourselves have a very human perspective on things.  And I don't think He has revealed as much to us as calvinists seem to think He has.<br>
<br>
I believe in a predestination because the Bible says that word very clearly.  But I don't think we can fully understand what that means exactly.  Because the Bible tells us that the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom.  That means out best wisdom is more foolish than God's foolishness.  So I think at some point we should be willing to admit we don't know everything and accept by faith that one day God will answer all our questions, some in this life and some and the rest in the life to come.  I believe God predestined us to have a choice because the Bible does say, &quot;Choose today whom you will serve.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

<br>
Arminian theology does not lead to universalism.  That is an old Calvinist fable.  They tell it to themselves and others because they cannot conceive of a general atonement.  They think in terms of Jesus' death being punishment for individuals.  So they reason that if He were punished for all individuals, then God has no grounds on which to condemn any individual sinner -- thus, universalism.<br>
<br>
But that reasoning springs from a Calvinist understanding of the atonement, so it is an invalid critique of Arminianism.  Particularly since Arminians have, from the very beginning, maintained that &quot;whosoever believeth on Christ shall be saved; whosoever believeth not shall be damned.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=esdras>esdras</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sir Esdras, Brewmeister <br>of the Great White North</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#B87333>(4/25/03 7:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/gsmorgan/images/ADPY005.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Is Destiny a bad thing?</span><hr size=1> Sorry, Eugene.<br>

You're right about that.  My statement was much too generalized.  I was thinking of that spectrum of Theology in a similar fashion to a political ideology spectrum:<br>
(e.g. right wing - conservative - moderate - liberal - left wing)<br>
<br>
What I should have said was that Arminian Theology is closer to universalism than Roman Catholic Theology which is closer to Calvinism.<br>
e.g. (Calvinism - Roman Catholicism - Not sure ism - Arminianism - Universalism)<br>
<br>
I think as you progress up or down the line, some things remain in common while others change.<br>
<br>
So, you are right that I should not have said Arminianism leads to Universalism.  They are distinct.  By the same token, not all non-Calvinists are Arminian, as Roman Catholic doctrine would indicate.<br>
<br>
I hope this post made sense, and I did not mean to offend.<br>
