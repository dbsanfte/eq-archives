Author: scifichick774<br>
Rating: PG-13<br>
Category: Supernatural/Humor/Romance/Drama – honestly, it’s got a little bit of everything.  The pairings are all over the place, but Chlex fans won’t be disappointed.<br>
Spoilers: Anything through the second season is fair game.<br>
Summary: Mr. Mxyzptlk decides to go back in time to cause mischief in Smallville, since Clark isn’t Superman yet and won’t know how to send him back to the fifth dimension.  <br>
Disclaimer: Not mine, no infringement intended, please don’t sue.<br>
Feedback: Yes please.<br>
Archival: Sure – just let me know where.<br>
Author’s Note: The second story is a response to Adeylan’s challenge, but because there were very specific requirements, they won’t be listed until the end of it.  The genie name Mxyzptlk uses comes from a Scooby-Doo episode, so I don’t own the rights to it either.  This story begins a couple of days after Clark first met Mxyzptlk and there are some really bizarre scene switches, so I hope it won’t be too confusing.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lionel’s office – Metropolis – a little after lunch hour<br>
<br>
“I don’t see why this is necessary,” Lionel said as the hairdresser shaved off his beard.  The woman finished up and then got her scissors out to start cutting his hair.  Lex tried to hide the smirk that so desperately wanted to play on his lips.  He folded his arms across his chest and tried to look serious.<br>
<br>
“Technically it isn’t,” Lex said.  “You could just forfeit the Tanaka Taro account to Lex Corp and not change your personal appearance at all.”  Lionel scowled at his son and then stared straight ahead.<br>
<br>
“Stubborn man set in his horribly outdated values.  I doubt he’s even worth doing business worth.”<br>
<br>
“Well, like I said ---”<br>
<br>
“Oh, shut up.”<br>
<br>
This time, Lex did let the smirk show on his face.  The truth of the matter was, although Tanaka was renowned for not doing business with people who didn’t appear to live up to a clean-living lifestyle; which roughly translated to short hair, clean shaven, and impeccably dressed; he also refused to do business with people and companies who weren’t environment friendly.  And Lex had been kind enough to fax him several documents earlier that day that indicated Luthor Corp had stepped outside of the EPA’s guidelines.  <br>
<br>
Lex barely resisted the urge to start chuckling; knowing that the account wasn’t going to go to his dad’s company, regardless of what he did to his appearance.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lana’s office – the Talon – around closing time<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk hovered invisibly in the air as he watched the Lana pour over the books at the Talon.  She had been at it for a good two hours now and he could see that she was unhappy with the results that she kept coming up with.  He also knew that she was one of Clark’s friends and if he caused trouble for her, then Clark would inevitably get involved, but he could do it without Clark knowing that he was behind it.  He smiled to himself.  He had the perfect plan.  <br>
<br>
Lana sighed and rubbed her temples.  Despite everything she was doing, profits were down at the Talon.  Part of it could be blamed on the increased cost of coffee beans from their supplier, but she knew Lex would only see that as an excuse and want her to fix it.  Her eyes drifted around the room until they landed on something that she was sure hadn’t been there before.  Lana furrowed her brow and rose from her seat as she kept her gaze fixed on the dusty Aladdin-styled oil lamp in the corner of the room.<br>
<br>
She walked over and bent down to pick it up.  After she lifted it, she drew in a large breath of air and blew on it to rid it of some of the dust.  <br>
<br>
“Too bad these things don’t actually work,” she mused aloud.  “Still, it looks old.  I could probably get Chloe to sell in on EBay for me or something.”  Mr. Mxyzptlk inwardly groaned.<br>
<br>
‘Stupid girl,’ he thought from his new position inside the lamp.  ‘Just rub the lamp so I can start my fun.’  A quirky grin curled at the corners of her mouth as she held the ornate lamp out in front of her.<br>
<br>
“Of course, you never know unless you try.  Right?”  She held the lamp in one hand and started to rub it with the other.  Mr. Mxyzptlk started to stream out of the opening in a swirling green fog.  When he finally appeared, floating in front of her, he had changed himself to look like one of the genies from the old movies that he doubted she had ever seen.<br>
<br>
“Who summons the great Babu?”  Mr. Mxyzptlk asked in a thundering voice.  Lana’s eyes grew wide and she dropped the lamp.<br>
<br>
“I – I ---”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk crossed his arms and looked at her almost scathingly.  He arched an eyebrow in apparent disgust.<br>
<br>
“You?”  He asked.  Lana nodded, too weak from shock to speak.  “Mmm,” he said as if he were considering it.  “What is your name?”<br>
<br>
“La-Lana,” she sputtered.  <br>
<br>
“Lana,” his voice roared.  “You may have three wishes and no more.  What is your first wish?”<br>
<br>
Lana thought about it.  She could really use more business at the Talon to bring profits up.<br>
<br>
‘But then, I *do* have *three* wishes,’ she thought.  She cleared her throat and tried to speak confidently.  “I wish that the two people in Smallville who are meant to be together, but aren’t, will finally get together.”  ‘Finally.  No more skirting around the idea with Clark.  We’ll finally be together.’  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk was taken by surprise, but didn’t show it.  He had expected her to wish for more money, or something along those lines, but she obviously had a crush on some guy and wanted to be with him.  <br>
<br>
‘Too bad she didn’t clarify that,’ he thought.  Her first wish was still going to be to his advantage.  Mr. Mxyzptlk still believed that Clark liked Chloe, and what better situation to disturb Clark than the girl he liked getting together with his future enemy?  He gave a nod of his head as he looked at her.  “Granted.  Your second wish?”  Lana furrowed her brow in confusion.<br>
<br>
“Done?”  She asked.  She didn’t know why, but she had been expecting immediate results.  ‘Maybe it doesn’t work like that,’ she thought.  ‘Maybe he’s having Clark drive over here right now.’  She took a breath as she calmed herself down.  “I wish that the Talon’s business would go up; that we would start getting more customers.”<br>
<br>
“Granted,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said with a small smirk that Lana didn’t catch.  Life was about to get very interesting for the girl Lucas had referred to as the princess.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Helen stormed out of Lex’s office after initiating yet another pointless fight with him.  Lucas glanced at her as she started to walk through the room he was in.  He casually flipped through the pages of the magazine he was reading, but he could feel her eyes burning an imaginary hole in his head.<br>
<br>
“You should really stop doing that before he kicks you out on your ass,” Lucas said bluntly.  Helen crossed her arms and glared at him.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me?!”<br>
<br>
Lucas set his magazine down and stood up, completely unthreatened by Helen’s posturing.  He crossed the room to where she was and half-smirked at her.<br>
<br>
“I said you need to stop all of this passive aggressive bullshit with my brother,” he said.  Helen’s eyes filled with rage and if she were a cartoon, Lucas could have sworn that smoke would be coming out of her ears.<br>
<br>
“That is it!”  She yelled while pointing her finger at him.  “Go pack your things!  You are *so* out of here!”  Lucas chuckled and crossed his arms.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, right,” he said.  “In case you hadn’t noticed, I’m *blood*.  You’re *nothing*.”  <br>
<br>
Helen’s mouth dropped open and then shut as she glared angrily at him.  <br>
<br>
“We’ll just see about that!”  She turned on her heel to head back to Lex’s office.  “Bastard!”<br>
<br>
Lucas shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Ye-ah,” he strung out as if she were a complete idiot.<br>
<br>
Helen bunched her hands into fists and stormed down the hallway toward Lex’s office.  She was ready to verbally attack him about Lucas when she stopped dead in her tracks at the site in front of her.  <br>
<br>
Lex’s office door was open and he was in the middle of what appeared to be a very heavy make-out session with a familiar looking blonde girl.  <br>
<br>
Helen was stunned.  She thought she had Lex wrapped around her little finger and hadn’t been expecting anything like this.  She thought about backing away from the door, but the anger inside her won out.<br>
<br>
“What the hell are you doing?!”<br>
<br>
Lex and the blonde separated and Helen recognized her as Chloe Sullivan, one of Clark Kent’s friends.  Her mouth opened in shock.<br>
<br>
“You’re cheating on me with *her*?!”  Helen screamed.  “I can’t believe this!”<br>
<br>
Chloe and Lex exchanged a look and Lex picked up his phone and called security as Helen continued to rant at him.  Two guards showed up quickly, but not before Helen had spewed a string of profanities at Lex and Chloe.  Helen glanced at the security guards.<br>
<br>
“You’re kicking me out?  You can’t do that!  God, Lex!  Come to your senses already!  *I’m* your *girlfriend*.  The woman you asked to help you from turning to the dark side.  The woman who ---”<br>
<br>
“The woman who has been manipulating my emotions from day one,” Lex interrupted.  “I’m sorry that I didn’t turn out to be as foolish about it as you believed I was.”<br>
<br>
“You asked me to move in with you,” she pointed out cockily, leaning her head to the side as she crossed her arms.  Lex gave her a curt nod.<br>
<br>
“I did,” he agreed.  “But only because you had some information I needed.”  Helen’s face showed her surprise and she looked over at Chloe who seemed almost surrealistically calm about the situation going on around her.  “Now, if you’ll excuse us ---” he trailed off and motioned for the guards to take her with them.<br>
<br>
Helen shook her head in disbelief as the guards latched onto her arms to escort her out of the house and off the property.<br>
<br>
Lex turned to look at Chloe and he raised a questioning eyebrow at her.<br>
<br>
“You handled that much better than I would have thought,” he commented.  Chloe shrugged and then her hands trailed up his chest and rested on his shoulders.<br>
<br>
“Doesn’t matter.  It’s just a dream anyway.”<br>
<br>

The corners of Lucas’s mouth twitched upward in a delighted smile when he saw Helen being escorted out by the security guards.  He had actually jest been expecting a short lecture from his brother on why he shouldn’t instigate fights with the harpy, but it appeared as though Lex had finally come to his senses about her.  Lucas glanced down the corridor that led to Lex’s office and briefly contemplated going down to see him, but he thought better of it; reasoning that his brother was sure to be in a bad mood after what looked to be a bad breakup.  <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lex tilted his head at Chloe and thought about what she said.  It did seem a little strange that she had appeared out of nowhere and they had been immediately drawn to each other.  It also seemed out of the ordinary that he had finally gotten past whatever emotional abuse Helen had been putting him through and kicked her out of the house.  Still though, he didn’t want to question it.  Being with Chloe felt so unlike how he had felt with anyone else.  It felt right.  He had always liked her for her spunk and wit, not to mention how easy she was on the eyes; but if he had known how it felt to have her in his arms, then he would have seduced her away from her longtime crush on Clark Kent long ago.  <br>
<br>
This, unfortunately, begged another question.  Why would Chloe think she was dreaming if she was kissing *him*?  Certainly her thoughts, consciously or not, would have been filled with images of Clark instead of him.  Lex’s head started to spin with all the questions that Chloe’s one simple statement brought up and Chloe looked at him with concern.  She brought her hand up and stroked Lex’s cheek with the back of it.<br>
<br>
“Are you okay?” <br>
<br>
‘How to answer that?’  Lex thought.  A seductive grin moved across his lips.  If she thought she was dreaming, there was a significant chance that he might get further than he would if he told her the truth.  He leaned down to speak in her ear.<br>
<br>
“It’s a good dream,” he half-whispered huskily.  <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lana left her office with the intent of flipping the sign on the door to ‘closed’ and locking up to start closing for the night, but the sight that met her when she left the room was quite different than she expected.  It seemed like every person in Smallville was now crammed into the Talon’s main area and the one poor waitress she had staffed for that time looked like she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  Lana smiled worriedly.  When she wished for wanting more business, this wasn’t what she meant.  <br>
<br>
She quickly darted behind the counter to help her waitress out, but within just a few minutes Lana was just as frazzled as the waitress was.  She smiled when she caught Clark in the middle of the crowd of people, certain that her first wish was about to come true.  She and her waitress took care of the orders quickly and soon Clark was up at the counter.  <br>
<br>
“Hi,” Lana greeted happily.  He smiled at her, but she inwardly frowned when she realized that it wasn’t anything more than a friendly smile.<br>
<br>
“Hey Lana,” he said.  “Can I get a large triple espresso?”<br>
<br>
Lana was startled.  Definitely not what she had been expecting.  He was ordering coffee?  He was supposed to be sweeping her off her feet and rescuing her by getting her out of there.  Not to mention the fact that it wasn’t Clark’s normal choice of drink.  She shook her head absently.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, sure,” she said and went to retrieve his coffee for him.  Clark paid her and smiled his thanks.  She watched him leave, not even listening to the next customer in line who was now placing their order.  ‘I’m going to have to have a talk with that genie when this rush is over.’<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk watched on invisibly and snickered to himself.  <br>
<br>
‘So, she likes the bumbling boy wonder,’ he thought.  ‘Interesting.’<br>
<br>
The rush went on for a few more hours before Lana finally had to be stern about making the people leave.  She closed the front door and locked it, flipping the sign over to the ‘closed’ side as she did so.  She leaned her back against the door and blew a puff of air upward, effectively moving the hair out of her face for a moment.  <br>
<br>
Lana had never felt so exhausted in her entire life.  Every muscle in her body ached and she was fairly sure that if she tried to walk then she wouldn’t be able to.  Her one waitress had left about an hour before, telling Lana that she didn’t mind working *some* overtime, but this was ridiculous.  Lana’s face contorted into an angry pout.<br>
<br>
“Babu!”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk took the image of the genie once again and seemed to appear from out of nowhere in front of her.  His arms were folded across his broad chest and he looked down at her as if she were the most insignificant creature on the face of the planet.  Lana felt uneasy at the genie’s domineering presence, but she forced herself to stand strong.  After all, he was supposed to be working for her, not the other way around.<br>
<br>
“What was *that*?!”  She yelled, motioning wildly with her arms.<br>
<br>
“You wished for more business,” he stated.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but not ---”<br>
<br>
“If that was not what you desired, then you shouldn’t have wished for it,” he chided her.  “Have you decided upon a third wish?”  Lana’s mouth dropped open at his gall.<br>
<br>
“What about my first wish?”  She asked.  “Why wasn’t Clark all romantic and stuff?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t recall there being a ‘Clark’ mentioned in your first wish.”<br>
<br>
“Uh, ye-ah,” she strung out.  “I wished that ---”<br>
<br>
“You wished that the two people in Smallville who are meant to be together, but aren’t, would finally get together,” he reminded her.  “And it is done.”<br>
<br>
“No,” she said as she shook her head.  “I meant me and Clark.  We’re supposed to be together.”<br>
<br>
“Apparently you aren’t,” he said, trying to fight the smile he felt from lifting his lips.  “And if you wanted to be paired with this ‘Clark’, then you should have been more specific.”<br>
<br>
Lana’s eyes blinked rapidly in disbelief and she didn’t even realize that her mouth had dropped open again.  She and Clark weren’t the one true couple in Smallville who were meant to be together?  How was that even possible?  And then the increased business thing – Lana had a feeling that she would go out of business if it didn’t calm down the next day.  They had already used up more than half of their month’s supply on the sudden wave of people who had flocked to the Talon with an inexplicable need for coffee.  Lana frowned.  There was one face she hadn’t seen in the sea of people who she had definitely expected to.<br>
<br>
“Can I ask you a question?”  She asked.  Mr. Mxyzptlk held his hand out in front of him as if he were examining his shortly trimmed nails.<br>
<br>
“You *may*,” his thunderous voice replied.<br>
<br>
“Where’s Chloe?  She’s my best customer and she wasn’t here even though practically everyone else was.  Why didn’t she come in?”<br>
<br>
“Do you wish for me to locate her?”<br>
<br>
“No, no,” Lana said, shaking her head and motioning with her arms again.  “I just thought you might know.”  Mr. Mxyzptlk gave her a scathing look.<br>
<br>
“I’m a genie, not a God,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Sorry, I just --- never mind.  I’m sure she’ll be here tomorrow.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk nodded once, neither agreeing nor disagreeing with Lana’s statement.<br>
<br>
“Have you decided upon a third wish?”  He asked again.  Lana bit her lip.  She only had one wish left and she had to make sure it was a good one that wasn’t going to backfire on her like the other two had.<br>
<br>
“Not yet.”<br>
<br>
“Mmm,” he sounded with disapproval and then vanished into a cloud of smoke.<br>
<br>
Lana looked around the Talon’s main room and groaned.  The establishment wasn’t designed to hold so many people at once and as she took inventory with her eyes, she noticed that all of the tables and chairs had been squeezed up against the far wall; not to mention the small trails of litter that now seemed to be lining the floor.<br>
<br>
“Damn it,” Lana said under her breath.  “Maybe I should wish for him to clean all this up,” she thought aloud and then shook her head with amusement at the idea.<br>
‘He’d probably just make it all disappear, and that wouldn’t do me any good.  No.  I need to think of a good specific last wish, and I’m not going to waste it on cleaning this place up.’  “Stupid genie.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk grinned almost evilly when he saw Lex and Chloe kissing like there was no tomorrow, and about to do significantly more.  <br>
<br>
‘She didn’t say *how long* the couple needed to be together for,’ he thought to himself.  And he would hardly be the gentleman he considered himself to be if he let Superman’s future nemesis take advantage of the poor girl.  That, and he doubted that Lex’s brother would be pleased if he walked in on them.  He still wasn’t sure what kind of a role Lucas was going to play in his pranks, but he knew that he wanted that kind of irreverent sociopathic attitude on his side rather than Clark’s.  He snapped his fingers and as quickly as Chloe had originally appeared, she was gone again.  <br>
<br>
Lex opened his eyes when he couldn’t feel warmth of her body pressed against him anymore.  He briefly thought that maybe Chloe was right and it had been a dream, but he had never experienced a dream that felt so real before.  And he was sure that if it was a dream, then she would still be there.  If the years of therapy he had after his mom died taught him one thing, it was that he could control aspects in his dreams – and he never would have let her leave.<br>
<br>
No.  It wasn’t a dream.  Something strange was going on, and Lex left his office determined to find out what it was.<br>

Story #2: Genie In A Bottle – Chapter 3<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
The Talon<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe this is happening,” Lana said under her breath.  She had arrived to open the Talon early and found a large group of people waiting out front for her.  Luckily, she was able to sneak in the side entrance with no one noticing her.  Lana sighed and slowly made her way to the front door.  No additional help was expected for a couple of hours and Lana dreaded facing the crowd by herself, but then, this had been her wish – sort of anyway.  She flipped the sign to the ‘open’ side and unlocked the door, only to be mowed down by the coffee-crazed patrons.  <br>
<br>
She shook her head and tried to push herself up to at least a sitting position when she saw a hand reached out to help her.  Lana looked up and saw Clark smiling down at her.  She smiled back and took his hand.  Clark pulled her to a standing position and she shook her head lightly at the crowd that had gathered by the counter, complaining loudly that no one was there to serve them.  <br>
<br>
“Looks like business is good,” Clark said.  Lana took a deep breath and smiled at him again.  <br>
<br>
“I don’t suppose you’d like to help?”  She asked, batting her eyelashes persuasively.<br>
<br>
“Depends,” Clark said coyly.<br>
<br>
“Oh, just get behind the counter, Clark,” Chloe said as she walked in and caught the last part of Clark and Lana’s conversation.  When he arched an eyebrow at her, Chloe gave him a little shove to motivate him.  “Come on!  I need my caffeine!”  Clark and Lana both chuckled and then made their way to the back of the counter to start waiting on people.  <br>
<br>
It had been a good half hour since the Talon opened before Lex pushed his way into the building.  He had already had his coffee at the house, but he had a rather firm suspicion that he would find Chloe at the Talon, and he could always use ‘checking on his business investment’ as an excuse if he needed to.  His eyes widened when he realized that the crowd of people packed almost every inch of the building.  <br>
<br>
‘She must be putting something in the coffee,’ he thought to himself and then allowed a tiny smirk to grace his lips.  ‘Good for her.’  Then he saw Lana being cornered by what appeared to someone wearing a large dragon costume.  It seemed to be attacking her for no discernable reason, but Lex saw no need to rush to her aid.  After all, how much harm could the person do while wearing a padded costume?  Lex was yanked out of his thoughts when he felt a familiar female body being pushed into him.<br>
<br>
“Hey!  Watch it!”  Chloe snapped at the man who had just shoved her.  She had a ‘to-go’ cup and was on her way out anyway, so there was no need for him to be so rude.  She turned and looked up to see Lex staring down at her.  Chloe couldn’t help the blush that rose to her cheeks.  ‘Whoa.  Down girl,’ she thought to herself.  ‘It’s not like he knew what you were dreaming last night.’  “Mr. Luthor,” she greeted.  “Sorry about that.  I guess these people need their coffee even more than I usually do.”  She smiled at him and he returned it.<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk barely kept himself from laughing at the predicament that Clark was in.  Lana was being attacked by someone in a dragon costume and Clark was too busy serving coffee at a ‘normal’ hurried speed to notice.  He was tempted to turn the person into a real dragon, but he thought that might be pushing it a little too far.  ‘It would be lots of fun to watch though,’ he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
There were so many people in the establishment that Chloe didn’t even notice when Lex slipped his hands onto her waist.  Mr. Mxyzptlk did though, and he had to say that he was pleased that Lex wasn’t giving up so easily.  Spurring a competition between Lex and Clark over Chloe would only add to Clark’s inability to cope with the other little things that he had in store for him.<br>
<br>
“Dragons included, apparently,” Lex said.  Chloe gave him a quizzical look and he motioned to where the man or woman wearing the dragon costume was trying to bite Lana with the big plastic teeth.  Chloe started laughing and Lex could feel her body reverberating under his hands.  He looked down at her and Chloe suddenly felt a little uneasy with his gaze.<br>
<br>
“I should go,” she said and took a step to the side to move, but Lex quickly pulled her back over.<br>
<br>
“Stay,” Lex said.  “I need to talk to you.  I tried calling you last night, but your dad said you were already in bed.”<br>
<br>
“Oh.  Okay.  Well, do you mind moving the conversation outside then?  I’m feeling a little claustrophobic in here,” Chloe said.  Lex gave her a curt nod and offered her his hand to help her get through the many patrons who were surrounding them.  <br>
<br>
She took a deep breath and then released it after they got outside and far enough away from the crowd of people for her to feel comfortable – or as comfortable as she could be holding Lex Luthor’s hand after having a rather vivid dream about him the previous night.  “So --- what did you need to talk to me about?”<br>
<br>
“I ---” Lex trailed off when he realized that Chloe may have been right all along.  Perhaps he had just been dreaming.  He bit his tongue.  ‘No, that can’t be it, because this morning Lucas congratulated me on finally getting rid of Helen.’  “Do you remember being at my house last night?”  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk watched the couple invisibly and rested his hands behind his head.  <br>
<br>
Chloe’s skin paled and her eyes darted away from Lex.  The pale skin started to color into a lovely blush when she remembered her dream in all of its lurid glory.<br>
<br>
“I – what do you mean?”  She finally got out.  Lex arched an eyebrow.  Obviously she remembered.  The only thing that remained to be seen was whether she still believed it was a dream or not.<br>
<br>
“Chloe,” Lex said as he started leaning toward her slightly.  <br>
<br>
“Hey, Lex!”  Lucas greeted as he came up behind them.  He slapped his brother on the back and flashed a bright smile at Chloe.  “Hello beautiful.”  Chloe let a nervous chuckle escape her lips.  She couldn’t believe that she had almost lost so much of her self control that she was about to kiss Lex.  He didn’t think of her that way and she would have been mortified in embarrassment if Lucas hadn’t showed up exactly when he did.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” she greeted.<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk snickered as he watched Lucas interrupt Lex’s moment with Chloe, but his minute of amusement was quickly destroyed when he heard Lana calling his ‘genie’ name.  He let out a suffered sigh and zapped himself to her location, which happened to be her office inside the Talon.  He appeared before her in his genie form and crossed his arms, trying desperately not to laugh at the poor girl’s appearance.  <br>
<br>
Her hair was messed up, her clothes were torn, she looked exhausted, and she had tiny little scratches on her skin from where the person in the dragon costume had tried to bite her with the plastic teeth.<br>
<br>
“Yes?”  Mr. Mxyzptlk asked.<br>
<br>
“I know what my third wish is,” she said.  Mr. Mxyzptlk arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“And?”<br>
<br>
“And I ---”<br>
<br>
“Lana?”  Clark asked as he opened the door.  His eyes grew wide when he saw the large blue genie floating in the middle of the room.  Lana looked panic-stricken.  She couldn’t believe that Clark had caught her talking to the genie.  She was never going to live this down.  “What’s going on?”  Clark asked hesitantly.  Lana bit her lip.  It would probably be better just to tell him the truth and get it over with; even if he did try to have her committed afterward.  <br>
<br>
“I – uh,” she paused and sucked in a breath.  “I found an old genie lamp in the office last night and I know it was wrong, but I wished for business at the Talon to be better, but it’s turned into a nightmare, and I was just about to wish for everything to go back to normal when you came in,” she rushed the words so quickly that Clark was surprised she had managed to say it all in one breath.<br>
<br>
Clark narrowed his eyes at the genie.  Something wasn’t right here.<br>
<br>
‘Other than the fact that there’s a genie floating in the middle of Lana’s office,’ Clark thought to himself.  His mind went through all of the weird things that had been happening lately and it stopped when a picture of Mr. Mxyzptlk drifted into his head.  He would never forget seeing the purple-clad man who looked like an oversized leprechaun with a head too big for his body floating in the middle of Cole’s living room.  He couldn’t have been more than three feet tall, but he obviously had the ability to shape-shift to take on the appearances of others.<br>
<br>
Lana turned her attention back to Mr. Mxyzptlk since she thought Clark was too stunned to speak.<br>
<br>
“Babu, my third wish is that everything would go back to normal,” she said.  Mr. Mxyzptlk rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
‘How predictable,’ he thought.  He nodded his head once in acquiescence.  “It is done.”  With that, he kept up the appearance of pretending to be a genie and started to dissolve into a green fog.<br>
<br>
“Wait!”  Clark shouted.  Mr. Mxyzptlk solidified again and couldn’t help but smile when he saw the accusatory look on Clark’s face.  “It’s you, isn’t it?”<br>
<br>
“It took you long enough,” he replied in his regular speaking voice.  Lana furrowed her brow, wondering where the genie’s thundering voice from just seconds ago had gone.  Mr. Mxyzptlk morphed into his normal self and looked at Clark.  “Two to zero,” he boasted.  His eyes twinkled when he turned them upon Lana.  “Be careful what you wish for.”<br>
<br>
He disappeared into nothingness and Clark and Lana stared blankly at the empty area in front of him.<br>
<br>
“Clark?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah?”<br>
<br>
“What was that?”<br>
<br>
“That --- is a long story.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
