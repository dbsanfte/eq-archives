<br>
My question is, is this really possible?&quot;<br>
<br>
I think it is possible, but it might depend on how strong your beliefs and practices are to begin with.  After my mom married my stepdad, I was being raised in a 2 religion household (Catholicism and Judaism).  Given the fact that neither my mom or stepdad felt too strong about beliefs and rules, it wasn't much of a problem.  We delved into Judaism a little bit more, but my stepdad was pretty much a non-practicing Catholic anyway.  My &quot;Catholic experience&quot; consisted of celebrating holidays in a secular fashion, and he never went to church.  I may not be the best person to respond on this considering my parents were a little lax, but if Christianity would have appealed to me in any way, then I would have had family members to turn to.  My mother also would let me go to church with my friends on occasion so I could be exposed to other religions and their practices.   <br>
<br>
&quot;For dual-religion households, many religions have fundamental dogmatic differences, how can those be reconciled in a dual-religion family?&quot;<br>
<br>
I think it would depend on the two religions you are talking about, and how strict you are on the beliefs and practices.  I think a religious Jew and a religious Muslim would have an easier time reconciling their beliefs than a religious Jew and a religious Christian.  Judaism and Islam have a lot of similarities in both religion and customs (depending on the branch of Judaism), as do different Christian sects.  Compromise would be necessary though, and both spouses would need to think that through before they walked down the aisle.  There seems to be a lot of Jewish/Christian families that follow Judaism more in the religious sense because worshipping Christ would go totally against Judaism, whereas skipping the Christ part may not make the Christian feel as bad because they still have the &quot;old testament&quot; and the overall belief in God.  A very religious Christian may not be able to do that because they have the need to accept Christ in their life.  When my dh and I first got married, we both had some religious beliefs at the time, but it didn't bother him to have a wedding without Jesus or to raise our kids without accepting Christ as their savior.  We were on the road to agnosticism though, lol.  He just felt more comfortable with a Jewish wedding than a Christian one because he knew the Jewish wedding wouldn't violate any of his beliefs, whereas a Christian wedding would have violated mine.  <br>
<br>
&quot;If you're athiest/agnostic and raising your kids with general religious awareness, with the thought that they can choose later, how do you teach about religions without also imparting your own opinions about them? Are we teaching tolerance, not acceptance, and if so isn't that also forming their opinions of religion (same as raising them in a specific faith)?&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't personally believe that you can raise a child with completely objective points of view on life.  My kids aren't going to live through the next 18 years without having a clue about what our opinions are.  What I plan to teach my kids is both tolerance and acceptance, if that makes sense.  I want to give them a general overview of various religions and cultures, and drive home the &quot;to each his own&quot; point.  I want them to be accepting of most, but there are certain religious rules and customs out there that our family has a serious problem with, and we just need to tolerate it.  I think that just because someone dislikes something, that doesn't mean they are being intolerant of someone else's religion.  I think they should be able to express their points of view without fear of being labeled politically incorrect.  Being open minded to different relgions is a way of looking at life just like a religion I suppose, but I'd rather teach my child to be open to all instead of closed to all.  One of my big issues with how organized religion is approached is the fact that it tends to be divisive.  If my child meets a Muslim, a JW and a Mormon at school that he gets along with, then I want him to be able to be friends with these kids and just accept the fact that they all have varying beliefs.  It sure beats having him fight with these kids on the playground due to belief differences.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you think that by having more &quot;blended&quot; families we are headed towards a &quot;global belief system&quot;, kind of like pidgeon English, a pidgeon faith?&quot;<br>
<br>
No.  I don't think you will ever see mankind having one belief system.  That would require way too much conformity and closed-mindedness.  I think that more blended families will cause more of an acceptance of varying beliefs.  I think America is a great example of this already.  We definitely still have your closed-minded bigots out there, but mainstream America is accepting of different religions and cultures.  We read statistics, and we hear about people being rude to eachother on tv, but IRL we don't see all this fighting.  My dh used to work with a Muslim, and nobody thought twice about the fact that he followed a different path from the rest.  Not only that, but they were all friends.  When I was paying attention to Dylan's cartoons over the last holiday season, almost every single one addressed Hannukah and Kwaanza.  It was all addressed in the form of &quot;this is what these people do, and this is what we do, but it is all good&quot;.  I also feel that with modern amenities to free up our time a little more, people are looking to become mroe intellectually stimulated, and part of how they do that is by taking an interest in other people's customs.  People love to ask me questions about being Jewish all the time just because they find it interesting.  The acceptance of Jews in America has made great strides since just 50 years ago when they were getting turned away from fraternities and golf courses.  I think this is the path we are headed on since we live in a blended society where different beliefs and customs are something your nextdoor neighbor has instead of some nameless faceless family half way around the world.  <br>

&quot;If you're athiest/agnostic and raising your kids with general religious awareness, with the thought that they can choose later, how do you teach about religions without also imparting your own opinions about them?&quot;<br>
<br>
I honestly don't think you can get into ethics without imparting your own opinion, but then I don't think parents should be morally neutral. It is our job and responsibility to teach ethics and morality to our children and I would hope each of us is choosing what we think is right. <br>
<br>
&quot;Are we teaching tolerance, not acceptance, and if so isn't that also forming their opinions of religion (same as raising them in a specific faith)?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, in terms of raising children with a certain belief system. It's not faith, but it certainly is providing moral instruction and guidance to children and this naturally involves opinions of right and wrong and what's real and what should be done or not done. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you think that by having more &quot;blended&quot; families we are headed towards a &quot;global belief system&quot;, kind of like pidgeon English, a pidgeon faith?&quot;<br>
<br>
Oooooooooooooo interesting question. I definitely think we are becoming more secular, but it could be that faith itself may be morphing too. Perhaps one day we can evolve beyond faith and religion and that's where we are now headed.<br>

Mom just refused to convert, yet for a while she was the reason we went to church, she volunteered us to be greeters and do other things around the church. And yet except for that time, and special masses (we were involved, weddings etc) Mom has not gone to church. Dad now goes weekly, but Mom doesn't go. <br>
<br>
I was raised fairly open minded about religion. My parents felt it was the person you were and not the religion that mattered. <br>
<br>
DH was raised Baptist. If we both were practicing, this would have been a big issue for us because of the major differences between catholics and baptists. But neither of us cared. It is a difficult point for my MIL and I. <br>
<br>
I hope to raise my children as openly as possible. WHile I do not practice or believe, I don't want them looking at different religions with contempt or distain. DH can be a bit of a bigot at times in regards to religion. He at times, hates them all - including atheism (I know it isn't a religion but a lack of beliefs but it doesn't matter to him) <br>
<br>
I would support my children exploring different churches. If they wanted and asked me to, I would go to services with them and help them learn. I do feel religion can have a purpose in providing comfort for those who are not strong enough (sorry JMO) to find it on their own. And provides a reason to be moral for those who can't do it on their own (again JMO). And for some people, it fullfills something I guess I don't need or lack. <br>
<br>
But I couldn't be totally open minded. I would have a very difficult time with a fundalmentalist religion. Or any religion that promots hate or intolerance. <br>

I knew one couple where the guy was Hindu and the woman was mainline Protestant...but she was really the one who practiced. So mainly, the kids were being raised Christian but were learning Hindu culture as opposed to being raised in the faith, if that makes any sense.<br>

Personally, I don't think I could have dealt well with that kind of situation, and so when I was dating, I only dated people who were mainline Christian like me...a lot of friends said that was being too picky, but I didn't want to deal with the stress of figuring out how to respect two belief systems without compromising either faith (if that is even possible, which I am not convinced it is). As it turned out, my husband was Episcopal when we married but even he referred to it as &quot;CatholicLite&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  so it was never a problem for us...<br>

Without going into a lengthy explanation about how it happened, I was raised in a household that included two Catholics, one Deist, one agnostic, a fledgling atheist (me), and a...well, I'm stumped since I never figured out exactly what (or if) my youngest brother believes. We all seemed to get along just fine philosophically, and whatever scars came out of the various PsOV didn't happen at home.<br>
<br>
I'm married to another atheist, and our kid is a Christian. This was her decision entirely, and it's never been much of a bother to any of us. I was a little worried when she was married to her first husband, who tends to be a little overboard in the religion department, but she weathered it pretty well. We let her go to various churches when she was living with us, and I only put my foot down twice; once when she was having bad dreams because a neighbor told her God was going to &quot;reach down and crush the world in His mighty fist&quot; any day now...and incidentally that her dad and I were going to roast in Hell...and once when she got mixed up with a bunch speaking in tongues and having fits in the aisles.<br>
<br>
I guess the bottom line is, we didn't have a kid in the hopes of producing a copy of us, complete with our personal philosophies. She's her own person, with her own mindset, and we never believed in the topiary hypothesis of childrearing.<br>
<br>
It seem to have worked okay. <br>
