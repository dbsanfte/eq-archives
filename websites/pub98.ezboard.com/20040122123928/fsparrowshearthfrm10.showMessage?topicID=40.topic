We went and had senior pictures made at a professional portrait studio.  I will refrain from mentioning the name of this studio, although I want to shout it from the mountain tops at the moment. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :g4 --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/g4.gif ALT=":g4"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Is it normal to take a girl with dark brown hair, dark eyes, in a dark brown dress and put her on a black, dark dark brown, or even a dark deep purple background for pictures??  <br>
Is it normal to not flip hair back into place if it's kicking out in an area and makes it look 'messy' in the photograph?<br>
Shouldn't one expect that the studio who has said they will work with you, to let you ask or set up specific poses?  Instead they take the subject back into a room and request that no one else accompanies them?  They also were supposed to help with the make-up and hair, which they didn't do.<br>
There were a very few pictures that were good in a pile of 33 proofs.  When confronted, I was told that the dress will look black in the pictures no matter the lighting.  I was told the lighting, in a few poses you could actually distinguish her hair from the background, did not and was not expected to happen like that in all the pictures.  That it's normal for the edges particularly to fade to black? They did not request/suggest what color outfits should be brought, I'm finding out most go in jeans now.  Most of the time, at the schools, they request colored clothing because white causes such a glare in pictures.<br>
Needless to say I was upset at the pictures for what I'm intending on paying for them, and the 20 year old that took the pictures probably thinks I'm daffy now.  Any suggestions on what to do?  Or am I making a mountain out of a molehill here?<br>
Thanks and God bless,<br>

<br>
But as to the thought of you making too much of a deal out of this. You are not. Senior pictures are a very large investment. Not to mention that this is how everyone will see your daughter as she looked in high school. To have her body drowned out by black, and her hair being frizzy, probably isn't what she would have in mind for that.<br>

<br>
No, you are NOT making a mountain out of a molehill...photographs cost a lot of money and you should be satisfied with your results.  Does the studio have a sitting fee?  Is it nonrefundable?  Are you obligated to buy any images?  Unless they have specified that some fees are nonrefundable, I would ask for my $ back.  These are special memories for you and your family and you shouldn't feel as though you have to settle for 2nd, or 3rd or 4th best.<br>

$50 dollar sitting fee, paid at the first shoot, and will not be refunded.<br>
We talked to the studio and a retake is now scheduled for Wednesday the 24th and there will be another photographer doing it.  This time, a little more wise I think, I'm going to make him/her talk to me first, and push it if I have to.  Right now they still have the money from picking up the proofs, but that I can get back if this session doesn't work out.  It was a check and I have the receipt as well.<br>
<br>
I think I was more frustrated that when I pointed these things out to the photographer her attitude was, &quot;I don't see anything wrong with them.&quot;  But not only did I see these things wrong, my parents and my husband did too.  So I'm glad I'm not crazy or going too far.  <br>
You are right Heartjoys, they aren't cheap and I felt like I could have gotten the same results at a K-Mart or Sears studio as I did with this professional studio and it frustrated me.  They did a couple of backdrops, most were the dark, solid ones.  They put my daughter, who was in a cocktail type dress, in a simulated barn scene?  And a couple of shots were lighter but it was in a setting with concrete steps and a door frame that had cracking/peeling white paint, like an old building?  It just did not fit, the outfit and the scene together. I hope I'm explaining myself well enough.   So, we shall see what shall happen next.  This time if they don't work with us or the photographs are of a lesser quality than what I expect, I will ask for my money back. <br>
I do know, at least somewhat, what to expect having had a few good portraits made before, and my wedding pictures done by a professional.  Plus my dad worked for Olan Mills (not the studio I chose for this) for a time as the photographer and he was also very unimpressed with this studio, which is comparable in price and status around here.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your input TommyT, Jebleez and Heartjoys.  I appreciate it!<br>
<br>
God bless,<br>

You know, I'm about ready to hire <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>HEARTJOYS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for a photographer! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :dsco --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/smilie_disco1.gif ALT=":dsco"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   OR asking my dad, who has one of those 35 mm Cannons with all the fancy little lenses and filters to give it a shot.  See what he can come up with, and if they are good, take them up there and go, &quot;SEE!  This is what we were wanting!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If they mess this one up, I will take it up with the Better Business Bureau.  Plus be VERY vocal to those I know about it.  <br>
We changed the clothing though, so it may not even be an issue. The photographer was told this time to lay off the heavy dark backgrounds unless, showing him the one picture we liked, with the correct lighting is used.  <br>
I'm actually praying this won't be an issue anymore, as my grandma says, &quot;Lord willing and the creek don't rise.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :thk --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/thk.gif ALT=":thk"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
