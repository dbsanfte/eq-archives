The tavern was silent and empty, and the candles were going dim.<br>
<br>
Mitzi sighed behind the bar, absentmindedly polishing it with a rag.  &quot;I don't think you're friends'll be coming tonight,&quot; she shrugged.  &quot;Want to rent a room? There are plenty open tonight.  I've never seen the place so empty.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No...it's alright.&quot;  Kyonae looked a bit disappointed, but she quickly hid the emotion.  &quot;I'll wait a while longer...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright.  I have nothing better to do anyway.&quot; The redhead barkeep brushed back her unruly tangles.  &quot;So, who's coming?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Some old friends of mine...&quot;  the word &quot;friends&quot; seemed to have a strange effect on her tongue, as if she did not say it often.  &quot;And a certain void demon.  I'm not sure if I trust him, but his intentions seem as well as mine to destroy the Mistress.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooh...don't even say that name.  Gives me the creeps, it does.&quot;  Mitzi shivered.  Then she smiled.  &quot;Looks like you won't have to wait long.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kyonae.&quot;<br>
<br>
The soft, deep voice came from behind her.  She turned her head to see a tall, handsome young man in mage's robes, though bearing a swordbelt.  Dark, messy locks of hair fell in his charming face as he smiled softly, emerald eyes glittering.<br>
<br>
She stood up.  At first, neither spoke.  What was she to say?  What was she to do?  &quot;Menion...&quot; she spoke finally.  &quot;You...you came.&quot;<br>
<br>
He chuckled.  &quot;Well, I said I would.&quot;<br>
<br>
After another moment of silence, Menion gave a great cry that made her jump.  Before she could stop him, he had bounded across the room and swept her up in one of the most crushing bear hugs ever known to man.  Twirling her around with him, he laughed in joy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kyonae!  So good to see you again!&quot; he cried, hugging her.<br>
<br>
The elfmaid, shocked, slowly returned the heartfelt embrace softly.  She couldn't breathe, but the fire mage was beyond calming down.  He always overreacted to everything...it hadn't been that long since they had last seen each other...and besides, what did he care?<br>
<br>
&quot;I...missed you too, I guess.&quot; <br>
<br>
He finally let her go when he heard her gasping for air.  &quot;You did? Well, now, that's a big step for you, isn't it?&quot; he joked playfully, messing her hair.  She quickly set it right again.  &quot;So...who else is coming?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eve...&quot; Kyonae said thoughtfully.  &quot;Jai...Naomi, hopefully.  Cedric and Miguel said they would.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, the whole gang's getting together again, eh? Ah, we haven't seen each other since...since we became Royal Mages.&quot; He looked at her thoughfully.  &quot;I've been worried about you.  Where have you been?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh...I have been...around.&quot;  Memories of the chase through Mystic Forest flashed through her eyes, but Menion didn't see it.  &quot;And that reminds me...someone else may be coming.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh? Who, exactly?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He is a void demon named Mirak, and his friend Lenoig.  they have been sent on a quest by their Lord Faro.  They want to help...&quot;  she trailed off, looking away.<br>
<br>
Menion's smile faded as he understood.  &quot;...Oh.&quot;  He sat down with her.  &quot;Are they reliable?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They are very strong,&quot; she nodded.  &quot;Though they do not understand the might of...her, they may prove to be--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't ask if they were strong.&quot;  Menion looked into her eyes, his voice lowering slightly in concern.  &quot;I asked if they can be trusted.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I...do not know.&quot;  Kyonae lowered her eyes from his gaze.  What was he getting at?  &quot;But they want to help.  And I can't do this on my own...I am not strong enough, Menion.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not strong enough?&quot;  he chuckled.  &quot;Kyonae, my friend!  Let me remind you of who, on our Test of Magery, saved my life, fighting against a full grown Iaret, was swallowed whole and climbed back out it's throat without a scratch?&quot;  He saw he wasn't helping, and took her hand.  &quot;You ::are:: strong enough.  You are.  I've seen it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked up at him, grimacing with pain of an old memory that stung like a brutal scar, taking her hand away as if it had been burned.  &quot;You have not seen enough,&quot; she assured him coldly.  &quot;Is Ember coming?&quot; she changed the subject.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/22/03 12:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm191.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mitzi's Tavern</span><hr size=1> Mirak teleported into the tavern, scaring most of the poeple as he entered.

Kyonae quickly stopped him, remembering her own encounter in the forest.  &quot;Don't.  It is okay.  He is Mirak,&quot; she said to him.  &quot;Physical weapons won't harm him, so don't even try it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Menion slowly lowered his sword, though he did not step aside.  &quot;This is Mirak?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.  He will be helping us.&quot;  She cleared her throat and spoke to the tricloptic demon.  &quot;It is fine that your lord could not come.  Indeed, we are waiting for the rest of our friends to arrive, so I hope you won't mind to wait a while longer.  I will pay for a room if you are too weary.  Or perhaps if you wanted something to drink.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, I'm supposed to ask that question, Falcona,&quot; Mitzi joked breathlessly behind the bar, still holding her chest in shock of the demon's sudden appearance.  &quot;Whoo...snake people appearing in my tavern...wow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyonae looked apologetically at the barkeep, then at Menion in warning, then back at Mirak.  &quot;As I said, we are waiting for the rest of our friends.  I hope you do not mind.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/22/03 12:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm191.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mitzi's Tavern</span><hr size=1> &quot;I mind not to wait&quot; Mirak said and sat down on a chair. &quot;And thank you for your offer but I need not food, drink or rest.

Of-of course.&quot;  Kyonae looked up at Menion.  &quot;The Mistress is very dangerous.  She can possess anyone, of any strength or will, and make them unholy.  She can even possess those as powerful as you, I am afraid.  I have seen it happen.&quot;  She motioned the demon to sit with them.  She suddenly looked very tired, even for a youthful elf.  &quot;She has servants everywhere.  The Dark Sirens are her minions, and her messengers and spies.  They are like angels with black wings and deadly voices.  I warn you, Mirak, right now, if you ever come to see one, hide immediately and cover your ears.  They have powers of their own.&quot;  She shivered.  &quot;But anyway...she has possessed the woman Artema as of lately.  She is our target.  Mainly, we are just trying to keep her from harming the innocents.  But if we can kill her completely...we can save them.&quot;  Suddenly, Kyonae groaned in defeat, holding her head in her hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's wrong, Kyonae?&quot; she heard Menion say, a hand resting on her shoulder.<br>
<br>
Her eyes burned as she once again felt the futility of it all, as she had done many sleepless nights, under the waning light of the blue moon Una.  What was wrong? He would never understand what was wrong.  Couldn't he see it was useless?!?  She couldn't kill a god! No one could...but she was expected to, because she was a Paladin.<br>
<br>
And she had been as foolish as to drag all of whom she cared for...and those she didn't even know...right into the crossfire.<br>
<br>
She blinked away the sting, shaking her head.  &quot;Nothing.  A headache, nothing more...it has been a long day.&quot;  she looked up at Mirak.  &quot;Anyway...there is not much else to say about Evil.  Evil is evil.  She has slain countless armies and slaughtered nations with the mere will of thought.  She has killed stars and made worlds beyond my own barren and lifeless and nothing.  She is so powerful, and there are few who match her strength, and none who can overcome it, save the six first Gods with which she was born.  But they are dead.  And she wishes to bring about the Eternal Null again, the age of void and nothing, where none will be able to survive but her.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to go and get us some wine,&quot; Menion offered. &quot;It will be good for your headache, Kyonae.  Be right back.&quot; He rose from the table to the bar, and started talking to Mitzi.<br>
<br>
Kyonae watched him go, then turned back to Mirak.  &quot;I asked you to help us because I see much power in you, and much wisdom of age.  I believe you may be a great help to save my world, and all that have collided.  But talk of the goddess and her plans and her strength disturb Menion.  It makes him very uncomfortable, to think the world may be ending.  An optimist at heart.&quot;  She shook her head, tossing the snow white locks gently from her eyes.  &quot;I have never told him I am a Paladin.  He would never understand.  He would try to stop me, because for some reason, he always seems to worry. But I told you, Mirak, because you hold the age in your eyes, enough to understand my fate.  And I hope you will understand enough not to tell him either.  I'd rather him not know.&quot;    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/22/03 1:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm191.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mitzi's Tavern</span><hr size=1> &quot;I shall not tell him but I believe you should&quot; Mirak remarked. &quot;It is never a good idea to keep secrets from those you wise to trust with your life.

I trust him with my life...though I wish I didn't.  He should not be involved.&quot;  Kyonae glanced at the tall blonde at the counter.  &quot;None of them should.  But they volunteered themselves to this fate.  Who am I to stop them?  Not meaning that I haven't tried.  But...maybe it is time I stop trying to stop them, and trust them as the...the friend they want me to be.&quot;  She gave a soft, rare smile at the void demon, but it was pained.  &quot;Thank you, Mirak.  Your counsel has done much for my conscience, and I won't easily forget it.  Lord Faro taught you well.  And I do believe you are strong enough to withstand the powers of the Mistress.&quot;  Her thought went back to that situation.  &quot;The seemingly easiest way to kill a god is to take away their worshippers.  The Mistress has more servants than the number of breaths I can take in a lifetime, so it would be impossible to go that way.  We shall have to make a direct attack.&quot;  The elfmaid nodded, mostly to herself in thought.  &quot;Naomi should be here soon.  She is very wise and more of a leader than I am.  She will be able to help devise a plan.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/22/03 11:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm191.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mitzi's Tavern</span><hr size=1> &quot;You speek to highly of Lord Faro, Kyonae, far to highly.

It is not often I meet one so highly learned, and you speak of your Lord often.  I assumed that you learned from him a part of your knowledge.  But I see, it is purely instinct for you, and no help of your demon lord.  But yes...the direct attack.&quot;  She cleared her throat.  &quot;I...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm back!&quot; Menion said brightly, coming over with two mugs of strawberry wine, specialty of the tavern.  He looked at Mirak.  &quot;you told me you didn't need a drink, so I didn't get you one.  but if you need anything, just ask.  If you're going to be joining us, you might as well feel welcome.&quot;  Menion smiled, but it was clear he did not feel comfortable around the demon.  He sat down between them.  &quot;So, what did i miss?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyonae paused, like she was about to tell him what she had told Mirak, but paused.  &quot;Nothing,&quot;  she said softly. &quot;Mirak just asked me about directly attacking the sorceress.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh.  Well, that's easy.&quot;  Menion grinned.  &quot;Back after the first Cataclysm on Mahtim, demisorceresses were popping up all over the place, their tombs uncovered by the earthquakes and chaos.  They were wreaking havoc all over.  But they soon found out that a golden dagger to the heart would kill them instantly.  Kind of like a vampire, only a little more complicated.  So, we thought that maybe there would be a way to kill a full grown sorceress the same way.  Like a special weapon of some kind.  But golden daggers won't work.&quot;  Menion shivered.  &quot;Many have learned that lesson the hard way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;  Kyonae nodded.  &quot;Exactly.  Which is why we wait for Naomi and Cedric.  Naomi is very wise, and Cedric is a historian in most respects.  He knows the history of Mahtim like his own life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have that right.  The man is a bookworm,&quot; Menion laughed, tipping back his mug thirstily.  &quot;Hm.  Wonder where Ember is.

Mirak then turned his attention back to Kyonae. &quot;So this 'golden dagger' was the demisorceresses equivalent of a void weapon to me. Interesting. I would assume that when a demisorceress becomes a Sorceress they loose their weakness to 'golden daggers' or perchance one just needs a sharper dagger.

<br>
They all turned to see a hooded figure in black velvet robes approaching.  She was a thin, tall figure, though not as tall as Kyonae. She was walking with the support of a long, blackwood staff.  She pulled back her hood with a white, slender hand, to reveal a head of impeccably neat, short black hair, a deathly pale face and sharp, somber yellow eyes.  In the light, it was still a surprise to Menion, who knew her so long, to see her pupils slit like a snake's as they were exposed to the candlelight.  Her footsteps were silent on the floor as she approached them.  Kyonae stood to meet her, a soft smile on her face as she greeted the old friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;Naomi,&quot; she breathed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kyonae Falcona,&quot; Naomi smiled grimly, pupils thinning and stretching to accustom to the light.  The two lightly embraced, for it seemed if Kyonae held on too tight Naomi's skeletal figure might be crushed.  &quot;You haven't changed a bit since...what is it, six months.  But how little people change in the first place.&quot;   Naomi bowed shortly to Menion, warding away the coming bear hug, then looked at Mirak.  &quot;I did not know a void demon would be joining us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyonae looked at Mirak.  &quot;Mirak, this is Naomi Eboncloud.  Naomi, this is Mirak.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Charmed, Mirak,&quot; Naomi purred with only the slightest trace of sarcasm, but Naomi always sounded like such.  &quot;The more the merrier, I always say.  I've heard rumors about you, on the road...so, what have I missed?  I cannot believe how late I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, nonsense,&quot; Menion smiled. &quot;I just got here too, so you aren't that late.  Want me to get you...oh...right.&quot;  She had silenced him as she withdrew her leather hip flask, taking a deep sip of the contents. She nodded apologetically at Mirak.  &quot;I apologize for my rude manners, Sir Mirak,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;But I carry my own water.  You never know who is watching, waiting, ready to pour poison into your glass...&quot;<br>
<br>
Menion set down his glass abruptly, gulping consciously.  Kyonae's eyes glittered with humor and Naomi chuckled, nodding once more. <br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly.&quot;  She took one more sip, and then looked about her old friends and the new companion.  &quot;So...what I have I missed? I can see by the tension in the air, I have missed some sort of conversation that may have needed my counsel.&quot;<br>

I did not know my coming was so anticipated.&quot;  she cleared her throat quietly, eyelids fluttering as she recalled something.  &quot;Long ago, the Mistress attempted a similar attack on our world.  It was almost six thousand years ago, though for you, Mirak, only a blink of one of your many eyes.  She wised to capture a certain token, a pendant bestowed with the powers of the Goddesses; Glacia of the ice and sea, Firadra of the fire, Thundra of the storm and sea, and Blossoma of the earth and flower.  The pendant held great power that was not to be reckoned, it was the most powerful since the legacy of the First Gods had died, and the Four Dragons had been the first creatures created after their birth.  It had fallen into the possession of a certain Dratilian princess as a birthday gift from the goddesses themselves, as they still walked among the mortals at that time.  But even then, the Mistress could not grab it.  The princess, when she had become aware of the goddess, had summoned the dragons and bid them to guard the city gate, which they did until they turned to stone as they are today.  The token went missing, and none saw of it again.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is the key to the Mistress' defeat, I believe.  A golden dagger if you will,&quot; she added wryly.  &quot;The only thing that may kill her is to summon the four goddesses from their ageless sleep, and they will kill her.  They are no creation of hers. For she was locked deep inside the womb of Mahtim, and did not even see the first sunrise.  They will know her, though, and they will defeat her.  But she is still one of the First Gods, and we must beat her down.  For even the first creatures of Mahtim, goddesses themselves, cannot diminish a creation of stardust by themselves.&quot;  She fell into a brief spasm of coughs, and brought a handkerchief to her lips, then the hip flask soon after.  &quot;Right now, as far as we know,  The Mistress' current possessee is one Artema Dragonchild.  If we find Artema, we will find the Mistress.  Now all we need is the token, and the strength.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyonae looked uncomfortable.  &quot;I've finished my wine already,&quot; she stated breathlessly, standing up.  &quot;I think I might go and get some more.  who knows when I will have the luxury of mitzi's strawberry wine agian.  Excuse me.&quot;  She walked away form the table, head hanging slightly as she went to the bar.<br>

And it is not many tokens, it is only one.  Only one was made, trusted to one mortal, one bloodline.&quot; Her catlike pupils glanced ever so slightly toward the elfmaid at the bar, but Menion did not notice. &quot;But such power I cannot hold.  I was not trusted with the said token.  None who are of the bloodline of the Dragon Princess can hope to use the power within it and live.  Save the Mistress, of course.  So we must find this descendant, yes? This...paladin.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That sounds like a very good idea,&quot; Menion nodded.  &quot;But where would we find them?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh...I am sure the descendant is not too far out of reach,&quot; she purred, and looked back towards Mirak, eyes gleaming knowingly.  &quot;Don't you agree, Mirak?&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly her voice sounded again, but not in the air, but rather in the mind, within the demon's brain.<br>

<br>

&quot;The night is late.  I hope you will not drink too much, Menion.  I know strawberry wine is your favorite, but your wit must be sharp for our journey.&quot;<br>
<br>
Menion was already glowing a little, his smile dreamy.  &quot;Ah, I know...&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly there was a thunderclap and a scream from outside the inn.<br>
<br>
&quot;MENION!  Get OFF me, you jerks!!!&quot;<br>

Kyonae stood up so fast from the bar that she dropped her mug which spilled all over the floor.  &quot;Ember!&quot; she gasped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ember!?&quot; Menion stood up as well as Naomi did.<br>
<br>
Outside the window, shadows in white robes were galloping away on palomino horses, carrying a struggling figure in red.<br>
<br>
&quot;Menion!!!&quot; the scream came again. <br>

Kyonae looked at Menion with fear.  &quot;The Osirians,&quot; she gasped. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/26/03 8:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm191.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mitzi's Tavern</span><hr size=1> &quot;The Osirians the servants of the Mistress guess they are keeping us below their vision aswell&quot; Mirak remarked and cast a spell that created a black orb infront of him. &quot;Through this we should be able to see The Osirian, the kidnapper&quot; Mirak said as he looked at the shadows in white robed figure on palomino horses through the orb. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/26/03 4:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm191.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mitzi's Tavern</span><hr size=1> Naomi took up her staff, bolting out the door.  &quot;Let us make haste!&quot; And quickly ran after Kyonae and Menion, who had run out the door with weapons drawn.
