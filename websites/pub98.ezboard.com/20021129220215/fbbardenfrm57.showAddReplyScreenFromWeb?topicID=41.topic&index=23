<br>
As far as Judiasm and the messianic concept goes, it makes us a much stronger and ambitious group.  We feel it's our duty to do as much good in our lives as possible, and that every little bit helps.  Sometimes just doing that good is enough to give meaning to life, because you're working to make the world a better place for the people you love and for the children that will inevitably inherit the earth.  Knowing you've helped, even in some small way, gives a sense of accomplishment and worth.  Whether or not it looks like a losing battle, it's still one worth fighting.  If the news covered acts of kindness the way they cover acts of cruelty I think many people's viewpoints would change.<br>
<br>
As far as knowing the exact second when my grandma died - we had been with her in the hospital for 2 weeks while she was intubated and dying from a combination of leukemia and pneumonia.  I had been sad and tormented the whole time.  I finally went home one day to cook dinner, and while I was driving it was raining like crazy.  Then poof, all of a sudden I was ridiculously happy - couldn't stop smiling and laughing.  I looked up, saw a huge double arch rainbow and said, &quot;Grandma's dead.&quot;  I pulled into the driveway of my house, saw my Dad looking sad and he said, &quot;Sweetie, your grandmother died while you were driving home, about 3 minutes ago (which was  when I'd had the smiling/laughing/crying fit).  We need to go back to the hospital.&quot;  And I heard her say to me, &quot;You know I'm  happy now and not in pain.  I need you to clean the house and fix dinner because your mother shouldn't have to deal with this.  I need you to take care of her for me.&quot;  <br>
<br>
So I stayed home and I cleaned the house like mad and made a great dinner, and told everyone about the rainbow, and it cheered them up...  To make things even more freaky, my cousin, Jenifer also saw a rainbow at the same time, and called me at home immediately after Dad left and said, &quot;Rae, is Grandma dead? I just got the weirdest sense that she's gone.&quot;  Totally trippy, but enough to convince me.  No one had time to call Jen to tell her to get on a plane.  She just up and called me, just as Dad left the house to go comfort Mom.<br>
<br>
Also, I think I need to clarify my belief as to what God is.  I was checking out the free classes that MIT has online about philosophy and it made me realize there is room in the description of my belief system for confusion.<br>
<br>
I do not believe in an omniscient, omnipotent, thoroughly good God.  I believe in a life force that binds us all together, that exists whether or not we do, and that is indiscriminate in giving and taking life.  I do not believe in heaven.  I do not believe in hell.  I just believe in doing what is right - and I define what is right by doing what will cause the most good for the most people for the longest amount of time.  I believe that bad things happen to good people for no reason at all, and that the only true rewards you will receive are those you earn.<br>
<br>
Also as for who created God - that's a fabulous question.  I believe that the word God and the way that most people think of him/her/it is entirely manmade and does exist to offer comfort and a structure for living.  As for the higher power I speak of, I couldn't begin to say who or what would have created it.  All I know is that there is sufficient evidence to prove to me that it does exist.<br>
<br>
I'm sure the next question would be to present that evidence, which would be more than fair.  All I can say is to look around and see the magnificent balance that our world is constantly in.  Yes, shitty things happen every day, but so do wonderful things.  I see the beauty in music and in mosquitos, even if they piss me off... and I see the splendor of love and the horrid pain of loss.  I see pollution, global warming, terrorism, rape, incest, and murder... and I also see volunteers cleaning beaches, treating strangers for diseases, teaching, building... people in happy families giving birth to wanted babies, and wrongs being punished by people like my father. (He's a prosecutor.)<br>
<br>
I simply believe the spirit of life and creation refuses to be repressed, and that ultimately, whether or not we die in a nuclear holocaust, it will survive without us.  I just choose to recognize its presence.  <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=23><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCE6FF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bbbarden.showUserPublicProfile?gid=confound>CoNfOuNd</A> </span><br><BR><img src=http://peter.armo.co.uk/img/irish.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Createur de Projets<br /><img src='http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-admin.gif' /><br /><img src='http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-vip.gif' /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 10/14/02 11:01:40 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: -</span><hr size=1> I don't think you believe in the kind of God most Christians do.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I knew the exact second when my Grandma died, even though I wasn't there <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I would believe in this, but I would never relate it to God or anything. I would relate it closer to the human soul and our spiritual instinct.<br>
<br>
As for hearing your Grandma talk to you after she died, I just don't know. I wouldn't like this one bit. It wouldn't comfort me, but I would find it more spooky. I don't believe anything would ever happen, except again when a person is in such a mental state that they comfort themselves with imaginery voices and images. Without insulting you, I just don't think I could be like you.<br>

The hearing thing was really more of a sensing, and less of an actual *hearing* - and it would make sense that it was a way of me dealing with Grandma's death.<br>
<br>
As far as the difference between Jews and Christians, there's a huge amount of differences, but the largest and most easily defined one is that of belief in Jesus as the messiah.  Christians believe that in order to be &quot;saved&quot; from the perils of an afterlife in hell, one must have unwavering faith that Jesus died on the cross for the sins of the world, was resurrected and ascended to heaven 3 days after his worldly demise.<br>
<br>
Jews don't believe that.  In fact, Jesus himself WAS a Jew, and taught many people.<br>
<br>
Rather than go into all the particulars, I'll just point you towards a very well informed site in case you're interested. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.convert.org/differ.htm">www.convert.org/differ.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->   Tells the difference between Christians and Jews in a very even handed manner.<br>
<br>
Also, when you talk about spiritual instinct or the soul, that's *exactly* what I'm talking about.  That God is comprised of the souls of every living thing - that we're all connected... and that I knew BECAUSE we're all connected.  <br>
<br>

Why do we need a higher power for these things? They are just &quot;chance&quot; happenings- evolution from specks of bacteria millions of years ago. I see beauty too, but we are not preseving it, I see it dissapearing.<br>

Life will go on after us, and the human race won't last forever. There is something from within rather than without binding us....<br>
As to your grandmother, I don't know how to explain that... But I don't have all the answers! I have experienced to much pain and loss, I assure you there is no-one watching over me, I lost faith a long time ago.<br>

Do you believe in souls? Could it just be minds connecting people?<br>
