<br>
1 Samuel 16:7  &quot;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart&quot;<br>
<br>
The article speaks of a lady, Lisa Bevere, the mother of three boys, who was asked to speak on an unlikely topic:  sex.<br>
<br>
Her pastor asked her to speak to a group of teenage girls about sex and, says, Bevere, the experience broke her heart.<br>
<br>
&quot;She met young women without guidance or protection who practically fed themselves to boys for affection and attention.  She saw girls who were trapped inside bodies they despised, being controlled by forces too sinister to battle.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Bevere offered a candid critique of the seductive clothing with which so many young women identify.  She encouraged the girls to ask themselves:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Do I want a guy that sees me as a conquest and has no interet in me beyond my ability to meet his sexual needs?  Or do I want someone who is intensely interested in me as a person--someone who truly loves me and wants to spend the rest of his life with me?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Reading this article brought to mind something that I've learned recently-- a current trend in high schoolers dress.<br>
<br>
My kids are still so small....but when we recently went to the High School to see the grade-schoolers Christmas program, I got to see a bit of the latest female trends, which include wearing low-cut jeans with the 'belt' of a thong showing above.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1 Peter 3:3-4 &quot;Your adornment must not be merely external--braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses;  but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God&quot;<br>
<br>
In a seminar Bevere presents, she challenges girls to take a look at their wardrobes....<br>
<br>
&quot;Your enemy wants to strip you, make sport of you, and merchandise your body,&quot; she writes, &quot;but your heavenly Father wants to clothe you with beauty, strength, dignity, and honor that will endure.&quot;<br>
<br>
I bring up this article because I'd like to know your personal experiences with regards to teaching our young girls about the messages they send out by what they wear.  <br>
<br>
Or, as one with high school not so long past, what were YOUR experiences with this?  did you ever encounter peer pressure about how you dressed?<br>

I did face peer pressure about my clothes.  Not in school, mind you, we had uniforms (blech), but most definitely outside of school.  I was always comfortable in big clothes, mainly becuase I was insecure about my person and how I looked.  My friends wanted me to look, I don't know, better (in their opinion), so they always wanted me to wear stuff that I felt was too tight, or too low.  And I know that they might have had my best intentions in mind, but I didn't like their reasoning.  One person said, &quot;You know, you could look much prettier if you dressed this way.  That's why guys don't notice you.&quot;  HELLO!!!  That's why I was dressing the way I was.. because I didn't want guys to notice me!  At least, not for the way I dressed.  Anyway... I think that too many girls have had pounded in their mind the image of a diva dressing goddess of all, and so they try to dress like a .... (if this word is inappropriate =, please change or delete it or whatever) skank.  Or a red-light special.  Really, there's no other way I can think of to describe it.  So anyway, back to my experience.  I told them if the only reason a guy noticed me was for how I dressed was because of my clothes, I probably didn't want that kind of guy.  And still they pestered me.<br>
<br>
Okay... I know that was long.  This topic really does bother me, though, because I see girls selling themsleves short for just a little bit of unneeded attention.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :intel --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/znaika.gif ALT=":intel"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I see it in church every week, and I just want to cry.  I would love to tell them what that guy is really thinking, and that 9 times out of 10 it has nothing to do with the Bible.  I see it at school, and I see it when I go to the mall.  My heart breaks for these girls.  They need to know they are valued without having to wear the sexually explicit clothes they wear.  This doesn't value them at all, in fact, it devalues them... and that's when bad things happen to girls. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :intel --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/znaika.gif ALT=":intel"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Okay.. off my soapbox, for now, anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heartjoys>heartjoys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=purple><b>Velvet-Steel Wannabe</b></font></span><br>  Posts: 2097<br> <font color=#B87333>(12/31/03 2:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/celticcross.jpeg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What Women Wear</span><hr size=1> I appreciate you sharing of your experiences <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mallaidh08</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
