&quot;Alfred. What news have you of our holdings?&quot;<br>

'Not much, Master Alex. Everything seems to be on the up and up'<br>

&quot;Splendid. Any luck on reaching the five I wished to contact?&quot;<br>

Where are you my friends? Friends? Should I say those whom I abandoned for an easier life? Those I left for a dream so many moons ago. I do not sense you any more. Have you taken leave of this world or do you hide from me? Raphael, are you doing well? Do you still look at the stars and wonder? Arman, does your duty stil drive you? I miss you so. Lance, has your impetous streak gotten you into trouble yet? So many others my mind is pulled to in this time. War does that to a person.<br>

Yes? Of course. I'll be on the first plane out tomorrow evening. See you then.<br>

He hasn't seen his Sire in sometime and coming back to this place still torments Alex's soul. He enters the terminal and the cacophonous din assaults his senses. He places a pair of tinted lenses over his eyes as he scans the crowd. He sees them a fraction of a second before the group spots him, as is usually the case. Family in a sea of strangers can be rather comforting. He approaches Cecile and gives her a hug, not wanting to let go of his best friend. He smiles to Elektra and Sebastian; so happy to see them that he can hardly contain his excitement. He instantly establishes telepathic contact with Cecile as they head to the car, conveying to her everything that has happened in the last year or so. They exit the terminal with Elektra and Sebastian and step into the midnight blue Rolls Royce waiting for them...*<br>
<br>
&quot;......is Denner in a good mood?&quot;, asks Alex<br>
<br>
'He's looking forward to seeing you, Alex. He's missed you but he won't admit it.', replies Cecile.<br>
<br>
<br>
*the car drives away from Paris into the French countryside. About an hour and a half outside of Paris, they approach a chateau and reduce speed. Alex looks out the window at the old house as they pull up to the front. A servant opens the door of the car and Alex steps out of the car. He removes his shades and as soon as he turns, Denner has initiated telepathic contact with him, instructing him of his location and when to meet him there. Alex waits for the others to exit the vehicle and walk up to the front door with him.*<br>

&quot;Because I want to find everyone I can now so I can arrange to fly them here or a central place to talk, that's why. The information I have received from my contacts tells me the I will have to return to the States to possibly find two of them but I have no clue where to find the last. It's so frustrating!!!!<br>
