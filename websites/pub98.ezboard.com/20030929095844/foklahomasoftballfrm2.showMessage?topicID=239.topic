everyone got along well.Of course there are a few players on every team that get pretty competitive,but like someone I know pretty well said,&quot;Its just softball&quot;.Friendship comes first,so if someone doesnt come forward and talk about it,the problem cant be fixed.I know OSC has had some squabbling,but we have discussed it as a team and hopefully we have taken care of some problems.Oh
