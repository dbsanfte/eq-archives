Which is FINE, if that's what you want out of life.  Nothing wrong with it...  Just not for me.  I did that and a factory.  I didn't like it.<br><br>The school system in GA sucks.  Here's your proof.  The schools are too small, underfunded, understaffed and full of teachers who don't give a damn and kids who don't wanna be there.  There are exceptions to this VERY generalized statement, but they are few and far between.  I know this.  I am a product of said school system.  I'm one of the lucky ones.  My son, I feel, is lucky, too.  He wasn't during Kindergarten and the first part of his first go round in first grade.  But he's doing better in the school he's at now.  He finally has teachers who NOTICE that he has issues and they are helping to correct them or work with him.  They know the signs of struggle, of trying but not grasping, and of not trying at all.  Had he been in this school to begin with, he wouldn't be repeating first grade.  In MY opinion.  And this school is a little rural Georgia school...  Not the suburban one he started out in.<br><br>We considered private schools.  But there are only two varieties available in our area.  One is the academy/prep variety.  It was WAY too expensive.  The others are religious schools...  And, no offense intended to anyone of the various religions offering such services (and not all are Christian, so let's not go there), but HELL no.  Teaching my child history, math and the usual subjects is the job of the school system.  Religion is something we prefer to be taught at home.  I also don't like it that some of these schools also make you swear, as a parent,  not only will you not drink anything resembling alcohol *gotta have my beer*, you also can't take your child to the MOVIES.  YOU cannot go to the movies.  I kid you not...  My son wouldn't survive in such a restrictive and ridiculous atmosphere and neither would I.  And that's just an example and is in no way inclusive of all the rules.<br><br>So, basically...  Unless I win the lottery, my son is stuck in the public school system.  Hopefully he'll stay lucky and in the right hands.  Sad, isn't it, that luck has something to do with it?<br><br>*sighs*<br><br>~Jenna<br><br> <p>The tolerance level on my stupid s**t-o-meter is at zero. <BR> Don't overestimate your luck or ability to outrun me.<BR> http://www.vampyresociety.org/</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ustonepanther.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stone Panther</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/29/02 5:58:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F7F7F7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ucblackthorne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CBlackthorne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#D15400>(8/29/02 7:51:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbriarpatchmailbag9753frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.andale.com/f2/130/111/6904582/996329801090_Cullan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We're DEAD LAST!!!</span><hr size=1> I was fairly fortunate myself.

Gee, I`m shocked. You mean all those stupid drivers on the Georgia roads are really uneducated. It does not surprise me to hear how bad the school system is in Georgia. All the southern states have a bad rap when it comes to education. There`s enough red necks and trailer trash in this state to bring down any test score. Well, thats my thoughts. Next time you`re at the mall check out all the young kids hanging out, and you won`t have to wonder why Georgia is last in education. Stupid parents raise stupid kids. I used to umpire little league baseball for six year olds. The parents came to the games drunk and cussed as if their kids future was held in balance over a little league baseball game. The parents were more concerned about the outcome of the game instead of their behavior that they were showing at the games. And we want to know why kids show disrespect to their elders. Poor Georgia. My friends up north just laugh when I mention anything concerning the south.

I say this because there are nice, large signs in the middle of the medians and along the highways that say &quot;Slower Traffic Keep Right&quot; and there is ALWAYS some idiot driving slow in the left lane.
