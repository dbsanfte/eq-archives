That's wut I am gonna call you cuz Dear Journal is too long. Anywayz. School! School started and I was so excited. It was so much fun, although that's probably cuz I like school but anyway. It was different, cuz at my school they consider 6th still elementry school...so this year was alot different. I liked i tho. We have so much stuff and only 5 mins between classes. Uh oh, I gotta go study for a test. TTYL,<br>

right now I have my hair in curlers...something I absolutley hate. I have no idea why. Well school's not too bad. In creative writing we are writing short storie. It's fun. Jason keeps bugging me to tell him who likes him. He and I are good friends, but he can really bug someone. Tehn he and Timothy and a couple other people made up so sort of code that certain people become clolrs and then they say things like&quot;purple likes red and red likes green&quot; They're alittle weird. At soccer today, the assiant coach was telling us which foot to kick with and stuff like that,she was being really bossy. I kinda like being the only girl,although it can be awarkward. I'm good friends with most of the boys on the team, so that helps. Tyler is having a pool party on Saturday. I dunno if I'm going, but I  might. Then there are class elections. Ugh..best friends are running against eachother and causing big fights all for the 7th grade election.  Some people are weird. Nothing's really going on. Kelly says that I'm getting a bunch of attention form guys and all, but I've given up on likeing them. P.O. Forever(Sierra Jensen)<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm good freinds with most of them. I don't have a crush anymore. Oh, well. Some of my freinds think that's strange but I've told them that it's not all about guys, but some of them are just boy crazt. Well, I better go. TTYL,<br>

Well, after church, I hung around the house a bit and then we went to the park for a group of families Olympics. It was fun. We played different games and the red team(my team) came in second. It was alot of fun. I never have anything interesting to talk about. My life is boring. I went to the mall yesterday with Kelly and Rachel. Trezure didn't get to go which is too bad, but she went to a football game. Afterwards, Rach and I went to  Lifeway and I got 3 Lori Wick books, but I finished two of them already. I love her books.

Well today was interesting. First I cleaned my room. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :dislike --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/schmoll2.gif ALT=":dislike"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Then, when we were getting ready to leave, Cole and I got into a big fight. We almost never fight anymore, we're becoming very close, but when we do, you had better watch out. So my mom made us ride our bikes to the pool which takes about 10-15 minutes. I was so mad, but the ride calmed me down. When I got there, I apoligized to Cole and he did to me and we were friends again. I was still mad at my mom though, so I didn't talk to her for 5 minutes. I know that was wrong, but I was really mad. But then I confessed it and apoligized to my mom. Later that day, my mom's friend from college and her husband came over with their two kids. We played Star Wars and we did other things with them. It was fun. Now I'm procrastinating because I have amth to do and I hate math. Tomorrow I am going to the orthodontist. Yuck! Well, I guess I procrastianted enough(yeah right). I better go. TTYL,<br>

My best friend liked this guy and he liked her. He didn't ask her out cuz he was too chicken. Anywayz, he had his friend tell her today that he didn't like her. Well, he told me 3 weeks ago that he didn't like her anymore and I thought he had told her, so I never brought it up. Well, he hadn't told her and she still thought he liked her. And today, his friend tells her in the meanest way that he didn't like her. He said, &quot;Jason doesn't like you anymore. He likes someone else now.&quot; When I heard this, I was really upset. So I went and talked to my friend and asked her if she was okay and she looked at me sadly and said really quietly, &quot;I will be.&quot; I wanted to cry so bad. Then, when I confronted Jason, he didn't even care. Well, then I had tears in my eyes and I had to leave before I cried. I was really upset, and he doesn't even care. Then, after soccer practice, he starts this rumor that I like Zach. I don't like Zach, and I laughed it off, but inside I was a little hurt. Jason was one of my best friends.

      I am so tired. I went to bed at 2:00 last night because I was reading. I've been reading Lori Wick books, there really good. I just finished the 3rd Kensington Chornicles(sp?). It was good, but I fund myself yelling at the characters in my head. Sometimes books do that to me. <br>

See, I'm not really friends with that many of them. There were about 20 people and I'm friends with about 7 of them. Anywayz...most of them are the &quot;popular&quot; people. Well, besides a couple of my friends, they kinda ignored me unless I spoke to them first. I'm used to it though..I'm not a really popular person, although I have a lot of friends. My friend told me one time it was because I was too good for them(as in behavior). While I was there, alot of people were cussing and junk and I didn't really feel all that comfortable. Well, I'm telling ya'll the bad things, when in realitly(except for above)I had a great time. Well I better go..more in detail later. I have a mean story to tell. Later,<br>

Yesterday, Kyra had her party. What she did is we all went surfing and then out for pizza. Now,  don't surfing much but I love it. I had a great time riding the waves because for once we ahd some nice ones.After we surfed for about 2 hours, we went for pizza. During dinner, I was kinda ignored. I was tired so I didn't talk much like I usually do, but Kyra was so engrossed with the guy she liked that se almost totally ignored me. There's another time that I ask myself why I hang out with those people besides Kyra. They aren't very apporiate all the time, talking about making out and stuff. I kinda tuned most of it out but I sure was ignored. After we had dropped everyone off, Kyraacted like she was my best friend all the way to my house. I felt kinda bad for being upset, but I put it behind me. Well, I was gonna tell about today but I have to eat and do homework still. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :dislike --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/schmoll2.gif ALT=":dislike"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  TTYL,<br>

We had a soccer game today and we tied 0-0 but we already beat them so it's all good. In PE today I broke my finger. It hurts really bad, but I played anyway. The guys on the team are just starting to accept me because before, they would all pretty much ignore me and make me find a partner or be w/ who ever was left. It's okay I guess. Well, I better go.

Oh well. It's been raining alot. Thunder and Lightning galore(although I love thunderstorms). We had a feild trip yesterday for math. We went to publix(grocery store),the mall, and Ryan's. It was fun until we got to Ryan's, the food was really bad. Well, we were supposed to have drama practice today but no body showed up. We went to the beach today and I feel asleep and got alittle sunburn on my shoulders(it doesn't hurt-yet). Tonight my family and I are going to see Jonah and then I'm gonna spend the night at a friend's house.  Well, I better go. TTYL,<br>
