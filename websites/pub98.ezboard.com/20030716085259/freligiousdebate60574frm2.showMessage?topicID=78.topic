<br>
&quot;The congregation has only been in this massive building for just over four years - but already is threatening to outgrow it. A total of 18,000 people come here for the three services every weekend. <br>
<br>
Many thousands more spend a good chunk of their week in the smart new gymnasium, food court, day-care centre, classrooms... You see this is not just a church, it is the shopping mall of modern religion - a new medieval city, clustered round the sanctuary. <br>
<br>
One of the other Mega-Churches is actually introducing a McDonalds. Some of them have housing developments on campus, one is building a religious theme park based on the story of Jonah and the whale.&quot; <br>
<br>
-----The above is just down right weird to me...but a very easy way to lure people to the church I guess....<br>
<br>
&quot;One religious affairs expert described it as a form of Christian cocooning - as the faithful withdraw from what they see as an increasingly threatening world.&quot;<br>
<br>
------This sounds quite feasible - I could imagine some of the fundies I know online reacting very well to a prospect like that. <br>
<br>
&quot;Another former member of the congregation explained to us a less high-minded motivation. Southeast Christian is the place to be seen in Louisville, it's the place to meet the leading local politicians, to make business contacts. It's the country club of religion.&quot;<br>
<br>
------But the above paragraph is just down right scary!!!!!<br>
<br>
Maybe it is just coming from GB that makes it all seem wierd to me...becuase religion isn't really &quot;out there&quot; like it seems to be in USA - but this whole &quot;megachurch&quot; thing strikes me as really creepy!! *shrug*<br>
<br>

<br>
Last time I was actually living there the big church mentioned in your last quote was just getting underway.  It was totally out of control -- they had just moved into this enormous facility, and already it was too small for them.<br>
<br>
I guess I could care less on one level, what worries me more is the extended effect this could have.  For example, at the time I was working in a fast-growing home health care org, and all the bigwigs from the company went to that church.  It would bother me if I thought that there were groups of execs going to the church, and deciding company issues either at the church or being influenced by people there.. or worse, people feeling pressured to join the church just to stay with the &quot;in crowd&quot; at work.<br>
<br>
I guess it's the same principle of the whole Augusta National thing.. I could care less whether or not they want women in their little club.. it only bothers me if they are doing all these big deals inside and thereby are excluding others from important business/government issues. Something similar happened at another place I worked (this time in Chicago).  All the big players were smokers, and they'd all go to take smoke breaks together outside.  One guy decided he wanted to quit smoking, but felt forced to keep going outside with everyone else on smoke breaks because they'd chat about business and sometimes even make business decisions out there.  Don't know if he was able to stick with stopping smoking, but I felt bad he was put in that position anyway.<br>
<br>
Did I make any sense?<br>

<br>
Kate absolutely. This is too often misunderstood where harassment or exclusion cases are concerned and it's a shame. I imagine in some parts of this country just not being xian will get you excluded (this is the case in a dept next to mine at work) not to mention membership in the mega-church. <br>
<br>
I have no problem with folks building huge complexes...gosh it's not much different to me than the Mormon buildings for teens next to EVERY high school in my area or the 4 temples within 20 miles of my house. If you live in certain areas, you're just gonna be outnumbered...but I will say many xians have expressed to me a distaste for mega-churches because they feel the sense of small community and fellowship is lost. I can see this point too and would probably prefer a smaller church myself if I still went with folks I could build real relationships with and saw in my community often---not just strangers to share McNuggets with.<br>
<br>

It was huge back in the 80's; I sometimes went with girlfriends for the pizza. It was THE church to attend...one either went to the First Baptist or St. Stanislaus (which sponsored the local Central Catholic School/High School for all the first people. Seriously...the Gallo wine empire is a big contributor to the church and the school is across the street from the Gallo mansion).<br>
<br>
The FB Church has bought several city blocks. Back then, the central worship hall was a giant auditorium that most likely held 2-3,000 people. It didn't look like a church at all. It used the existing storefronts for its offices and sub-ministries.<br>
<br>
It's rather like a sucubus, inhaling Modesto one block at a time. My parents still live there and Mom says it just keeps getting bigger.<br>
<br>
Interesting, because I don't know of any mega-churches in the Norfolk area except Pat Robertson's mini-empire in Va Beach. He broadcasts the 700 Club from the Regents University campus but since he sold The Family Channel to a Japanese interest (who has since sold it to ABC), his stranglehold in this area doesn't seem so tight.<br>
<br>
I do know of a massive single cinderblock bldg in Norfolk, some Calvery place...we made the mistake of going to Costco one Sunday morning as church let out...ACK!!! Never again!<br>
<br>
(Gaia, a Costco is a warehouse-type store. You can buy things in bulk, like toilet paper and chicken. Plus they sell Hebrew National hotdogs and a soda for $1.50...we can eat there for under $5.00!!!) <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We sit outside and argue all night long <br>

There is a temple across the street from our housing development, 5 miles south of the street we live on, 3 streets north of the closest one perpendicular and yet another 2 streets east if you take the closest cross street that direction and those are just the ones I know about built on major streets!!!! Coupla years ago when July 4th fell on a Sunday they actually deferred the national holiday and had the fireworks on Monday since so many work for the city and are just plain here and refused to participate or work on that day---it really sucked, but we had no choice and there's certainly no danger any other group will outbreed them<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , though we have a very large Catholic population and many immigrants from Mexico that enter Az are also Catholic so it's quite interesting.<br>

And I attended one a few times at my mom's request when I was in HS. There is a church in Akron that (in the early '90s) was the 7th largest church in the US. As far as I know, they do not have a McDs but since they are right in the heart of a big city and next to The University of Akron, they probably do not need it. I will give them this much, they started as a small church over 50 years ago and now when they get too large, they create new churches (There is one right down the street from me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) instead of trying to find larger and larger buildings. They also have 5 to 6 services every Sunday (Depending if it is the holiday season or not)<br>
<br>
I will admit that this is one church that I do not harbor ill feelings towards, but even if I did go to a xian church, I do not think I could go there... Way too big for me. I like getting to know people. kwim? <br>

Prayers also don't have to be &quot;to a god&quot;.    From one of my UU books _Rejoice Together_ ....&quot;Prayer is an honest expression of some of your feelings, especially 3 kinds of feelings.  Sometimes you feel thankful for nice things that have happened to you. If you express your thnks at bedtime, you may enjoy them all over again.  Somtimes you feel sorry for things that you have said or done.  If you express your feelings of beeing sorry , you may fell much better.  SOmetimes you have hopes for yourself and other people.  If you express your hopes in prayer, you may see what you can do to make them come true.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've copied some examples for you guys.<br>
<br>
I am thankful for the night<br>
and for the pleasant morning light,<br>
for health and strenght and loving care<br>
and all that makes the world so fair.  Amen.<br>

I remember it was all over national news--mostly because of the MLK stuff rather than him getting himself removed in every possible way. There is a very large LDS community here that supported him, but he was indicted so that was the end of that and a democrat took over (Rose &quot;beehive&quot; Mofford). I went to DC that year and everyone was calling us Aribama...very embarassing indeed. We almost lost the Superbowl over that one.<br>

LDS man opening minds — and hearts <br>
<br>
NAACP giving King Award to Darius Gray<br>
By Diane Urbani<br>
Deseret News staff writer<br>
<br>
      Darius Gray takes a lot of questions — often following stunned silence.<br>
<br>
Darius Gray<br>
 <br>
      Why would an African-American man join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1964?<br>
      &quot;I found out the night before I was to be baptized that I wouldn't be able to hold the priesthood,&quot; Gray remembered. &quot;I said, 'No way would I be baptized into that church tomorrow.' But I took it to God that night.&quot;<br>
      He prayed and heard what he today calls &quot;a succinct answer&quot; — that this was to be his faith, built on &quot;the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.&quot; So, in the midst of the civil rights movement, he adopted a faith that excluded black men from its priesthood.<br>
      In 1978 LDS Church President Spencer W. Kimball received what black Latter-day Saints simply call &quot;the revelation.&quot; It extended priesthood privileges to all worthy men, regardless of race.<br>
      Twenty-five years hence, many people of color still view the LDS Church as racist, Gray acknowledged. But as he receives the 2003 Martin Luther King Jr. Award from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, he hopes to open some minds.<br>
      &quot;In the '60s and '70s, many of my black brothers and sisters found fault with me because of my chosen faith. They saw me as an Uncle Tom,&quot; he began. &quot;It's nice to finally have my brothers and sisters recognize and appreciate that I've been there too,&quot; working for equality for all people.<br>
      &quot;I've been struggling too, with them. As a black Latter-day Saint, I've struggled as much as a black Baptist or a black AME to bring about change.&quot;<br>
      Gray is president of Genesis, a support group for black members of the LDS Church.<br>
      He just finished writing &quot;The Last Mile of the Way,&quot; the final book of his trilogy about African-American pioneers. It's a kind of Intermountain West &quot;Roots,&quot; tracing the journeys of Gray's great-grandfather, who lived most of his life as a slave, and his grandfather, who was born a slave and later freed.<br>
      The story progresses to Gray's father, a light-skinned man who could have passed for white but &quot;proudly chose his black heritage,&quot; said Margaret Young, co-author of the book. Gray's father, Young said, constantly carried a copy of &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing,&quot; the African-American national anthem, as he and his wife moved West to raise their family in Colorado Springs.<br>
      Gray isn't the least bit eager to talk up the books nor the award he'll receive on Monday. Young, however, said there's nothing she'd rather do than pay him tribute.<br>
      &quot;He knows what it's like to feel isolated, knows what it's like to be called a racist name,&quot; she said.<br>
      In his travels across Utah and the United States, Gray &quot;holds steady in his beliefs,&quot; encouraging African-Americans to join discussions of faith and race, Young said.<br>
      &quot;Martin Luther King's principles have been the guiding principles of his life,&quot; she said.<br>
      The co-authors have occasional meetings with their publisher, Deseret Book, to plan marketing and presentations around the country. But Gray has skipped such meetings after telling her, &quot;There's a Genesis sister with a child in the hospital, and I need to go be with her,&quot; or a friend needs to talk.<br>
      Both Young and Gray frequently hear from people looking for Genesis, whose newsletter mailing list covers 1,500 homes.<br>
      Gray says his research on the African-American pioneers who migrated West taught him, &quot;We are literally brothers and sisters. And we ought to act that way.&quot;<br>
      &quot;The Last Mile of the Way&quot; is due out in early May. The book spans from 1890 to 2002, following Gray's forebears through the Depression, the march on Washington in 1963 and up through Gray's own life in Utah.<br>
      &quot;Their stories are stories of faith and endurance. And Darius' is too,&quot; Young said.<br>
      The book, Young hopes, will let the reader &quot;experience what they went through. . . . It can be a heart-expanding experience.&quot;<br>
