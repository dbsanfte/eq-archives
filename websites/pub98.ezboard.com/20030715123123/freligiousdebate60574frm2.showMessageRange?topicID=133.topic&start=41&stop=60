<br>
I think the orig author is skewing the verse (in my own lofty opinion).  He's turned it into a &quot;circumcision thing&quot;, but, again in my opinion, it's talking about dishonesty and usury, etc. not circumcision and paying people to do that, etc. (Do you pay a mohel?  How much?  More questions to crowd their way into my mind, lol).  It's using circumcision more as an identifier.<br>
<br>
I did read your earlier posts (and your re-quotes) but I think it totally discounts the science that has gone into some of these studies.  You are dismissing them completely by trying to bring FGM (female genital mutilation) into it, but I think that's wrong.  It's not like a bunch of science nobodys (like myself, lol) have been saying this, but actual researchers.. and there's a medical reason they give for why AIDS is occurring substantially less frequently among African men who are circumcized than not.  Of course, there are rebuttals from other scientists, but not of the variety you presented. (Although some may have been thinking that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  I just don't think it's a cut and dry (excuse the expression) issue.<br>

<br>
Well, I'm going to have to read that aritcle again myself today when I have more time and see what I can gather from it, it was a pretty quick skim I did the other night.<br>
<br>
  Again, it wasn't so much that I think the versus in question are saying &quot;we are really talking about genital cutting here, not usury&quot; but more that once you understand how people who have become accustomed to the tradition react to being questions about it, you can see evidence of the same thing going on back then reflected in the scriptures.<br>
<br>
Also, I hear a lot (we've even heard here in this thread) that if this was so wrong, surely someone (a prophet, Jesus Himself, some other church leader?) would come right out and denounce it.  Yet, we see that Jesus did not run in to the group about to stone the adultress yelling &quot;stop the insanity, you are all hypocritcal murderers!&quot;  Once you look at it that way, you start to wonder if the isn't also other evidence in the scritpures of Him or His apostles suggesting that genital cutting is the same sort of thing (can you say Jerusalem Counsel?).  Maybe it wasn't exactly an &quot;intactivist&quot; meeting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , but I think it is possible that discussions regarding genital cutting among other traditions were had beyond a &quot;symbolic&quot; level.  I do know that some Bible versions do use the word mutilation when talking about it.<br>
<br>
Another case of something that isn't clearly outlined in the Bible, but once you know what you are looking for you do see some possible references to it.<br>
<br>
OK...enough about that until I read more myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
<br>
I'm not discounting the science, I'm questioning the ethics that were involved in conducting the studies in the first place.  This sutdy involves having a large sample group of men who have had part of the penis amputated.  Before we can even begin to look at the results of the study, we should ask ourselves whether there was sa logical reason to hypothesize that this would significantly effect aids in the first place, and then, was it ethical to proceded.<br>
<br>
I just asked if you thought it would be ethical to do the same studies on women (create a sample group that had had part of their gential removed and then studied). <br>
<br>
Of course, it is absurd for me to use that example.  Obviously cutting parts off of male genitals is much more like peiricng girls ears than it is cutting off part of their genitals <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Sorry Kate, that eye roll wasn't really for you, just that I've been watching this debate at BC for over a year now and there are people who will compare male circumcision to everything and anything else under that sun that is even semi socially acceptable except the logical female counterpart to it.   Hmmmm, let's see, what is cutting part of the male sex organ off comparable, hmmm, let's see, possibly.......CUTTING PART OF A SEX ORGAN OFF?  (Again, not directed at you Kate, just had to get that out)<br>

PS, Shirene, this makes me think of something.  Do you think God has an opinion on whether a boy peirces his ear, let alone his penis, let alone his mother doing it for him as an infant? <br>

Yes yes yes. Heidi you are so right! I don't understand WHY as a culture we can readily denounce female circumcision/cutting/mutilation and IN THE SAME BREATH say &quot;But Routine Infant Circ is not like that... not fair to compare!&quot; Huh? So they cut off the female clit in some cases, right? And they don't cut of the male glans, which is the counterpart organ. But so what? Females can still achieve orgasm vaginally, males can still achieve it despite the loss of the frenulum and other sexually sensitive tissue, and even with keritinization. <br>
<br>
Just because a person can still get off, doesn't make cutting off parts of their genitals against their will okay. <br>
<br>
Sorry to be so blunt, I'm in a hurry.<br>

<br>
(Nice touch with the quotes, way more subtle than all the question marks.)  You continue glossing over the issues when you keep focusing on the Priapism and discount the Phimosis.  The symptoms you keep coming back to as not a part of B in your list are not part of priapism.  I never said they were, I referred to them as Phimosis.  I also clarified that names applied to conditions were from the combination of the 2, not the one alone.  Phimosis is an inability to retract the foreskin.  It is common among infants and typically resolves itself by 5.  Circumcision is recommended after puberty if the problem is persistant.  Take a nonretracting foreskin, force it to tear frequently by an extreme and intense erection, then continue to do this a few times a day, every day until you are 13 or so and a doctor decides he will circ.  Painful, embarrassing, needless. <br>
<br>
Maybe your child is of the ideal variety where a painful medical condition striking them down in class or at play is not embarrassing, especially if it is correctable and you choose not to treat it, but my kids would be embarrassed.  The same way medical incontinence would be embarrassing or grand mal epileptic seizures.  This is not some larger social psychological hang-up on human anatomy or genitalia, this is ordinary human development.  If you fall on stage when everyone is looking it is embarrassing, if you are the last one picked for kick-ball because you may stop and double over in tears it is embarrassing, when you do things that make you not fit in, it is embarrassing.  Standing out by choice or exceptional ability is just not the same as standing out for a disability or medical condition.  I said also that it did make a difference, but not as big a one as the anti-circ extremists are trying to make out of it and I stand by that.  You will not be able to convert me from my current and considered position barring some profound evidence.  The spectrum of skepicism runs from cynic to sucker.  In this debate, the extremist anti-circ camp is the cynic, the people who circ without investigation or any thought are the suckers.  I am neither of those.<br>

I know what it is. I know what causes it. I discussed it with family and physician alike. There is no better way to treat it.  Simple circ, problem gone.  Alternatives: wait-and-see if it comes up as an issue then treat it at that stage (plus complications of surgery at that age, longer recovery time, increased likelihood of problems, pain and suffering until it can be scheduled and performed – given family history it wasn’t just a possibility, it was a probability, and a high one at that); perform continued stretching and massage exercises (doesn’t actually prevent it, only mitigates it possibly, still a high probability of ending up in surgery – in nephews case it didn’t do jack because massaging and stretching a scarred and cracked piece of damaged tissues was more like torture than therapy); skin grafting to increase foreskin size (more complicated and risky procedure than circ); medications to prevent priapism (mostly blood thinners, not allowed in children, damaging to developing bodies, risky).  Forgive my lack of approval for the armchair quarterbacking, but the arguments against circ that have been strung out before me start from the premise that I do not know what I am talking about, do not know how a penis works, discount or ignore family medical history, and argue rabidly from the basis that it is at all times wrong.  Token exceptions are being made for an adult who chooses to do it, or undefined medical cases that may exist but they will not name, (or if named are so extreme or rare as to make their argument untenable), and this is the same as never.  <br>
<br>
People seem fond of my vestigal tail analogy, one made for its comperable level of surgical complexity, but it seems to hold up fairly well as an analogy.  I would have preferred to stick with tonsils or wisdom teeth that I also listed, but since everyone wants to use the tail, we shall.  What is the significant difference between the tail and the foreskin?  It is concealed from ordinary scrutiny, so as to be a personal decision.  It occurs naturally and requires surgery to remove that can be painful (and is even more risky than circ if nerve tissues extend into it.)  So the difference seems to be that tails only occur rarely and foreskins occur in about half of all births.  Their uncommon nature renders them less worthy of protection and retention.  Oh, but a foreskin protects something that is vital and significant!  Yet no debilitating life changes arise without that protection.  No significant impacts at all occur in a properly circed case.  Some evidence is presented that it may even be beneficial, some studies support it and they are dismissed with some spurrious and suspicious reasons (uncirced guys are more likely to smoke and have multiple partners?  Please!)  We do not see statistically significant samples of circed men in counciling for pain or inability to commit to a partner or lack of sex drives.  They don’t screen you at marriage counciling for cut and uncut.  The impacts just are not as significant or abhorrent as is made out to be.<br>
<br>
My position was and continues to be, don’t circ unless you have a reason to.  My basis for that reason has a far lower threshold of acceptability than the extremist propaganda machine would feed us.  Even in the poorly decided and irresponsible case of cutting just because insurance pays for it, I do not see lasting, appreciable harm done.<br>

<br>
Part of the reason I glossed over that is because Phimosis is a loosely used term, and arguably should not be used to describe the normal condition of the foreskin being connected to the glans at birth (by a membrane like what attached a fingernail to the finger, only the one on the penis is supposed to disintegrate eventually), so I did not use the term that way.<br>
<br>
**edited in **<br>
<br>
You know, after reading through this again I'm going to take that apology back.  Not because I wouldn't be sorry if I had misunderstood, but because I don't think I did what I just apologized for.  I did not gloss over it, I included the condition set you are calling &quot;phimosis&quot;  under E) and F).<br>
<br>
**end of edit**<br>
<br>
Your saying that this &quot;usually resolves itself by around the age of 5&quot; is like me saying that my young daughters flat chest &quot;will resolve itself by around age 16.&quot;  It is not an abnormal condition that resolve itself, it is part of the normal maturation process in both cases.<br>
<br>
Now, as for what you continue to gloss over, priapsim does not cause larger erections, just long lasting painful ones that have nothign to do with sexual arousal.   I've been trying, in a not so claer manner apparently, to say that even children with &quot;phimosis&quot; (glans still attached to foreskin) should under otherwise normal circumstances be able to accomodate an erection without pain or tearing.  &quot;Phimosis&quot; is the normal state for their penis to be in for quite some time.  What is so different about a priapism erection that would cause it rip the foreskin off when other erections don't?<br>
<br>
My opinion, based on what you have described, is that they might have &quot;acquired phimosis&quot; if you want to call it that, or in other words, because of something like premature forcible retraction it was torn away before it was ready and then scar tissue did form.  It is also my opinion that if a foreskin needs help loosening, at any age, a steroid cream is the most sane option (in fact my friend used one on her DAUGHTER to correct a labial adhesion.  Funny, she didn't freak out about how she just knew she should have had her labia removed in order to avoid it).<br>
<br>
***edited in***<br>
I'll just move that apology on down to this part where it is more fitting.  I honestly did misread you here DBC, sorry about the following <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Finally, where did you get this? (Fighting the temptation to use another row of question marks but I'll show some restraint <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So the difference seems to be that tails only occur rarely and foreskins occur in about half of all births.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A foreskin is not an anomoly, it is a normal, functioning part of the penis that every boy is born with (well, probably not every boy, just like we see missing digits I guess this part comes up missing sometimes as well too, but you see what I mean).<br>
<br>
It is clear to me now that we need to back way up here and establish some common ground about what a foreskin is and what functions it serves (not just protect the glans by the way) or we are going to continue to spin our wheels.<br>
<br>
By the way, I challenge you to take your arguments about there being no significant detrimental effects on males sexual experiences or that of their partner to the BC Circ debate board.  The posters there &quot;Mythtaken&quot; and &quot;FranklySpeaking&quot; would probably like to have a word or two with you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

I'm wondering if your nephews foreskins were prematurely retracted for cleaning or if this was done at the doctors office or by a sitter for some reason? My ds is intact, and when he does a &quot;system check&quot; the glans remains inside the foreskin. We've never retracted his. He is 18 months old.<br>

About half of the babies born are male, so about half of all births result in a foreskin. Nor have I said that priapism caused larger erections, if it did I am sure more people would refuse treatment or brag about the condition.  Would you disagree though that an erection from a natural cause would go away if it was accompanied by pain (thus reducing or eliminating the pain) and that one arising from a mechanical defect would remain no matter what pain accompanied it?  Furthermore, I will never dispute there being exceptions to any generalization, so there may in fact be people with detrimental circ experiences.  There are also people with detrimental skin grafts, dental fillings, appendectomies and hairstyles.  The question that would raise though is whether those were properly performed and subject to the general principal, or cases of malpractice.  The range of ‘feel’ during sex is so very subjective as to make any discussion over it arbitrary if not first hand (like Carl’s.)  So your BC friends may wish to take issue, but it will remain that there is not any STATISTICALLY significant evidence that this is a abhorrently detrimental procedure when properly performed, no matter how significant their personal experiences are to them.<br>
<br>
Lastly, you are correct about phimosis, it covers a wide spectrum of potential causes, including lack of tissue motility, elasticity, length, or membranous connections.  Tearing of the membrane is one set of symptoms, tearing of the foreskin should reasonably get it’s own name and diagnosis, but thusfar has not. Nevertheless, it warranted treatment and was treated in the safest and least impactful way.<br>

Just to make clear, I hope that the silliness in my recent posts has not in any way come across as me making lite of the condition your nephews had that you did your best to spare your son from.  Not that you've accused me of such, you haven't, I Just wanted to make sure you knew that you have my sympathies for that, and what they went through is no laughing matter.  I've tried to keep the lighter comments seperated from our more serious discussions for that reason.<br>
<br>
Question for you before I concede that the only and best cure for the condition you described is only coincidentally also a powerful culturally ingrained tradition and that that was not at all related to the decision to circumcize:  Were steroid creams to loosen up the foreskin even discussed or tried?<br>
<br>
And if elasticity was of issue, wouldn't having even less skin, thus having to be stretched even farther, be even worse?<br>

DBC, I have to say that this whole discussion is reminding me of a little game my 3 year old used to like to play where he'd put something in one and then hide both hands behind his back then ask you to guess which had it was in.<br>
<br>
If you happened to guess the correct hand he would simply say &quot;nope&quot;, but then just stand there not showing his hand, we just had to trust his word for it.<br>
<br>
You've spent a lot of time on this with me, which I appreciate, but I guess what I'm looking for would be more of a full description like:  This family was completely comfortable leaving the sons intact and were very aware not to force the foreskin back for cleaning as that would cause problems.  Their doctors and baby sitters also knew this.  When they were 2 the mom found them crying one night and they were having a priapismatic (correct word?) erection and surprisingly the foreskin had also began to tear away from the glans.  They took him tot he doctor who prescribed a topical steroid cream to see if they could help loosen up the foreskin but after several weeks of continued tearing and scarring and infections it became clear this would not work so a slit was cut in the foreskin to widen the opening.  When this also did not work they finally decided that circumcision was more humane than allowing this continue.....etc, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
Is that honestly what happened?  If so, I truly do believe it is a rare case becaues I've never heard of such a thing (have any of you who live where circumcision is uncommon heard of this happening?)  I know that you too are saying this doesn't happen to everyone, it's just that the way this story has unfolded and the way you seem unable to see circumcision in general as a bizarre practice and how the changes in the way the penis functions (not just subjectively, but real oberservable changes in how the penis works) makes me skeptical.  Anyone who has educated themselves about circumcision, as you have, should know that that is ample reason for people to be skeptical of the &quot;cousin/nephew/friend of a friend&quot; stories about &quot;having&quot; to be circumcised, though of course it would be extreme to say &quot;NEVER, EVER!&quot;<br>
