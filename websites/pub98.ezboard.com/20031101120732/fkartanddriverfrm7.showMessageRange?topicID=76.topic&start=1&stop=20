The flag men do know what the flags mean and can count laps.  They do have 100% payback, they don't payback just to relatives and the staff is competent and have all been around racing for years.

He was going to be this year but due to his deployment at the beginning of the season, he is not the techman. Berryman is.  To Richmond Racer, the flag man does know what he is doing and if you had been watching he threw the red flag and headed across the track to help JK because the flagman is also a registered EMT.  The black flag has been thrown at Richmond this year.  One whole class was black flagged for rough driving, so you can not say they haven't thrown the black flag.  I haven't missed a week and they have thrown the black flag many times.  The weights they run in Limited are the weight in the WKA series.

It brings to light alot of the discrepencies at Richmond, although it is an unusual way to get at them, it does bring them to light. Richmond is a great track, no question about that, the kart count of averaging in the 70's throughout the year is proof positive, but as with alot of the great tracks throughout KY, and there are many, there are small problems at all of them. Problems and decisions are a fact of life at the track and in our everyday lives. Sometime we make the right decisions, sometime we don't. But we dont beat ourselves to death over and over after we make a bad decision, we learn from it and try to move on. It is very interesting to read the different things that have been mentioned, and for the most part, even though I have CHOOSEN to make Richmond the track I race at most, the things said are true to a certain degree. But nothing is done with malice. Thats the key phrase here. The Super Hvy class is an outlaw class at Richmond this year, but you know what, not one of the three drivers that have been running out law has denied it. I personally have been told by two of them that they are running stock appearing motors. They have told each other that. It kinda started when one karter had an engine failure with his stock motor and for several different reasons stated by him could not get his stocker fixed. So he decided to finish out the rest of the year on his SA motor. Was that a great decision, he knows the answer to that now, he is a great guy with lots of intelligence. That carried through to another kart bringing his big motor and then a karter who just got a new chassis and motor that really woke his program up and he consistantly ran third, beating all the the other stockers, which in turn really meant he won those races, but he was told by the 2 other SA motor drivers that they were not legal, Thats a run down on how this got out of hand in SUPER HEAVY, but they werent hiding it and they were nice enough to keep the SA motors out of the $200 to win night for Super Hvy. This brings up an odd thing, why didnt anyone in Super Hvy protest. That would have stopped it, but it was kinda like it was a gentlemans agreement. But this lead to one guy who runs at richmond occasionally coming to run Super Hvy a cpl of weeks ago getting beat by one of these SA motors and then returning to a few weeks later with his SA motor to run in Heavy class the last night of night racing at Richmond. So, things are apparently snow balling, but I truly beleieve it will come to a halt at the begginning of next year, especially in Hvy class, which is where I run. I didnt through up a protest on that guy the last night of racing due to me having the points locked up, but I would have and will if I see someone running a HOG thoughout the regular race year. Its our responsibility as a karter and competitor to do so. Thats our way of policing ourselves. It is a tried and true method. As far as flagging at Richmond, it has changed hands several times throughout the year due to several misfortunes of manpower availability, all out of the control of the owners. It has been done a little differently by each new flagman, but we as karters have to understand that we seem to want to get use to one flagman and we do, but we need to be up on the wheel and watching the flagstand all the time while on the track and ready to respond at their commands. I have been caught off guard by some of the different flagging and its no ones fault but my own. They control the show and I need to be watching them, not just doing what I'm USE to. I did read one comment that i liked particularly. it stated that one karter ran the same motor in stk hvy and stock appearing. Well, I dont know if you were talking about me, but 2 years ago I started out running my SA motor in the SA class, but do to most of the karters in that class not being setup for Richmond very well, I switched to my stocker and won most of the races with it and eventually the class championship in SA due to my set-up. That cant be done now, that class has progressed way beyond where it was 2 years ago. Better and more experienced drivers now rule in SA. I'm sure though that some other karters have done this a few times lately as you have stated, but once again, we must police our selves by protesting. That does bring up a good point, Protesting. Some want to raise the $50 fee. Which is a BAD thing in my view. If you raise it higher, only the RICH will be allowed to protest. I do hear the concerns of others and understand their views when they say it cost them more than $50 to send their motor off and have it rebuilt after a protest. HOGWASH, Karting is not about just sitting behind the wheel and driving, it is about LEARNING new things. You had to learn to drive, you had to lean to fix things,you had to learn about setting your kart up, you had to learn about tires and the different compunds, about stagger and so on and so on. Why do we not want to learn about our motors? A vital part of karting is our motors, it is our responsibility to learn to rebuild our motors unless you are RICH and can afford to have someone else do it for you. But 90% should learn to do it ourselves, I've heard several say that they cant get the timing and different specs from there engine builder to set the motor back up, the motor builder wants them to send it to them each time. SURE they do, it makes them lots of money. It is time to find a new motor builder if he cant give you enough info to setup your motor and sell you replacement parts. Kick that guy to the curb. But, you still have another option, if you like one motor builder that wont give you the info, when you get it back from him, sit down with a degree wheel and some feeler guauges and a few other basic tools and see for yourself. You may say you dont know how to do that, well just like you learned alot of other things about karting, ask someone. A degree wheel is not expensive. Thats what I had to do with my motors and I learned and I now rebuild them myself. You can to. As far as teching, Richmond is not known for alot of teching, but it has teched on several diffeent occasions.  As i have expressed to the 2 tech men personally, I have a few problems withthe procedure they use as far as degreeing in the cam and checking the cam profile as well as not allowing the proteser in to watch the tear down. But, I have voiced that as you other karters should do as well. They have done a good job otherwise throughout the year for us tho. I want to keep this short, LOL. So i will stop here, just another view from another karter. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkartanddriver.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kartndriver>kartndriver</A> at: 10/3/03 7:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Big Dave</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(9/28/03 9:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Engine</span><hr size=1> Why in the world should an engine builder tell someone info like that.

Most engine builders out there including my self, if an engines is tore down in tech you usally get taken care of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> kykart71</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(9/28/03 5:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> richmond</span><hr size=1> I WON THE LAST REGULAR SEASON POINTS RACE IN HEAVY LAST FRI NIGHT SO, I ASSUME THAT YOU ARE AGAIN TALKING ABOUT ME .

We are supposed to be setting an example for our children and personally i think this is the worst example possible for any one.....Grow Up and act your age. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> GETREAL</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(9/30/03 8:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> WHATS THE POINT</span><hr size=1> <br>
  Why protest!!!  When they do tech it is half done.  I mean if your goin to tear an engine down do it right.  They need to get a real tech man in there who will lay the law down and do it right.  There tech man may be certified and everything but that don't mount to anything when you can't use what you learned and do it right.  All richmond is doing is agging on the problem.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> speed demon</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(10/1/03 8:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> tech problems</span><hr size=1> tech is very seldom done at any track.i have been to tracks and a driver wants to protest and heard the track official say the tech man is not here. or the tech man cant tech his own engines.two good excuses i guess? richmond has tech men that are highly qualified to do the job,its not their fault if nobody protest they are there to do the job. the problem is with the divers and owners they dont push the tech,what are they scaerd of being eligal themselves, if you are leagle put the money up,if not set back and shut up dont complane about it. i am lick the guy above me the way to stop cheaters is to protest them. i was there last friday night you can tell the ones who run leagle and who dont there are some hot karts running out there, but you got to protest them. the limited race prime example the second place driver tried to protest but the winner done pushed his kart across the track need a roped off area holdover then when drivers are ok send across track if not in holdover area disqualified. thats all i have to say lets clean up the karting and go racing.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=76.topic&start=21&stop=34>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=76.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=76.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=76.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.threadControl?topicID=76.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=76.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=76.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="kartanddriverfrm7">General<option value="kartanddriverfrm23">For Sale<option value="kartanddriverfrm21">Track Info<option value="kartanddriverfrm22">Race Results<option value="kartanddriverfrm9">Motor & Chassis Questions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkartanddriver>Kart and Driver</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7>General</a> <font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href="www.kartanddriver.com">Kart & Driver</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
