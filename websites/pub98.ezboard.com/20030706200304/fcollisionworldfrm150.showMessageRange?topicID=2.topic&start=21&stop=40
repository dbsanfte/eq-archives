&quot;Mr. cucumber is his name?&quot; She smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its a long story.&quot; Marth chuckled. &quot;I'll hafta tell you sometime. <br>
<br>
Kirin was still staring after Enari, not knowing whether to be happy or afraid. She did have a bad feeling... a knot in her stomach. Something told her that he wasn't involved in it though. <br>
<br>
&quot;Um, Eevee, who is this young elf?&quot; she asked Eevee.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh! This is Marth.Remember i was telling you about him earlier? he's  my master.&quot; She rolled her eyes. &quot;Hey Marth! This is Kirin!&quot;<br>
<br>
Marth took Kirin's hand and kissed it. &quot;A pleasure to meet such a pretty young maid.&quot; He smiled.<br>
<br>
kirin blushed slightly. &quot;You know him? THat man?&quot; She asked, a little nervousness in her voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I sort of ran into him and we became traveling 'companions.' Actualy, i'm starting to take a liking to the guy!&quot; Marth laughed. &quot;His name is Enari, if you're wondering.&quot; he gave a mischievious grin. <br>

She heard the neighing. she saw the one named Dune.<br>

Eris was...fading. She seemed... Kirin didn't know exactly what to think of what she felt. But something was wrong with Eris. A little different than the others thought. That black star... had something to do with it. <br>
<br>
Marth had gone to Virgo's side. &quot;What's wrong Virgo?&quot; He saw how pale she was, and looked up at the one known as Dune. <br>
<br>
Eevee just gave a puzzled look to the worry in Marth's green eyes. She'd never seen that look before from him. Galith had gotten up and stood next to Kirin.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; He asked, sympathy lacing his tone. <br>
<br>
&quot;I...don't know.&quot; She looked back at him, her eyes filled with a passionate sorrow. &quot;Eris... she's...fading. Or... I don't know. BUt something strange is happening to Eris. Different than what we would except.&quot;<br>
<br>
Galith pondered her words, wondering what the prophetess meant.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Enari trudged through the forest, not really caring how much noise he made anymore. Everything he was known for: stealth, coldness, silence, power, efficiency, speed, and so much more...gone. Everything gone. He was extremely sloppy, weak, confused, and had his head in the clouds. What was he doing? He didn't even have a plan of action...he couldn't even make one up that second, and he was a master of that along with many other things. What was his problem.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnit.&quot; He cursed with avery irrated tone. &quot;What am I doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
That young woman...the prophetess. She was to blame for all of this. But why? Why should he have to blame her? Did he...have feelings for her? Enari didn't know. For once in his life... he was clueless. Stopping abruptly, he hung his head. Maybe he would play along for a little while. Maybe even join forces...anything to do away with Pheonix. How he hated him...loathed and despised him. Now, he wanted to sacrifice the poor prophetess. Enari lowered his eyebrows into a most hateful position, then took his left fist and punched into a tree, punching almost straight through it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why do I care? WHY?&quot; He punched again, making a cut to the otherside. &quot;Why her? And now? Why must I be so WEAK?&quot; He punched in a different spot, this time the hole was much wider and went all the way to the end. &quot;WHY!&quot; Punching a third time, the small tree fell, and Enari dropped to his knees with helplessness as the tree fell the other way. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't even know her...&quot; He barely whispered, resting his forehead against the trunk of the tree. &quot;and I care about her.&quot; <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

She slipped by like a ghost, and appeared from the brush, behind Enari.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enari.&quot;  Her voice was deep and accented with a dead, evil language, and her eyes had gone a strange shade of yellow.  She did not walk like Eris, or talk like her either.  &quot;Forgive me for my appearance.  Good shells are hard to come by.  I have a proposition for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you have your eye on the prophetess.  I have my eye on what you see me as.  They'd both get in the way of our plans, and that would not be good at all.  Maybe there is some way we can help each other?&quot; She smiled bitterly.  &quot;Help me get this one...and you'll have your prophetess, and whatever you'd like to do with her,&quot; she added, smirking at the look in Enari's eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't stay in this form too long.  My power is not yet revived.  So make your decision now...join me?&quot;<br>

Ayaka stopped Seifer from going after her.  &quot;No, Seifer! You mustn't!&quot; she whispered, looking warily at Dune and Marth and Virgo.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't care about them,&quot; he snarled, wrenching himself of her grasp.  &quot;I love her, no matter what she feels, and I'm not goign to let her get hurt!

What would he do? He was ordered to get her...she had nothing to do with him. If Pheonix got his hands on her, then she'd be sacrificed, giving the demon even more powerful. But, what could he do with Kirin? What could <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>he</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> possibly do with her?<br>
<br>
&quot;I decline.&quot; He stood up, shaking his head. <br>
<br>
He knew well enough he could do this  on his own. Deals were something he hated. A loner he had always been and most thought he would always  be.<br>

Kirin ran through the forest, following Eris. Seifer had disappeared, and she was wondering why she had come.<br>

&quot;That depends on if she wants to or not. Even then I wouldn't let her talk to *you* in private.&quot; He spat out &quot;you&quot; like it was poison. <br>
