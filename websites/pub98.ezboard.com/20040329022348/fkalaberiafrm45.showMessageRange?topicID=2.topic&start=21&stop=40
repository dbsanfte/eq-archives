He found and snuck behind her. Slouching slightly, as if he was hiding from the vampires as well, Cale called out, low but audible to the humans rediculously weak ears. &quot;Hey!&quot; The girl turned around, and gave a start, but did not scream. She had been surviving for long indeed if she knew enough restraint not to scream. &quot;It's not safe to be out in the open like this,&quot; the vampire continued, matching his voice to one he saw in a movie once and offering his hand out to her. &quot;Come on, I know a place where we'll be safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl was tentative but came forward. He motioned her to the front. &quot;I'll watch the rear.&quot; As she turned her back to her, Cale took the chance to gaze at the girl's posterior.<br>
<br>
Suddenly she spoke, and he snapped his head up incase she was looking at him. She wasn't. &quot;I really appreciate you helping me find a place to stay.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As I appreciate you helping me find something to drink,&quot; Cale responded, his voice dropping back into the normal cold tone he uses. She spun to say &quot;What?&quot; But he caught her before she could. Bending her head to the side, the vampire's fangs pierced her neck. The blood flowed forth and he drank. As he sucked in the vampiric ambrosia, the girl involuntarily breathed in, and when he paused she breathed out. This cycle continued until the girl no longer breathed, and her blood was no longer in her body.<br>
<br>
Cale wiped his face off, and stared at the girls body. &quot;Tsk. Tsk. It's almost a shame. Lasted this long.&quot; A cold smile lit his lips, and he head off. Looking up along the sky scrapers, he saw one that looked like it had recently seen an explosion. The rest just stood there like tombstones these humans built for themselves. Cale had busied himself so much with looking up that his foot caught on something he hadn't seen, sending the object skittering across the ground a short distance away. He walked over and picked up the object. It was gun, revolver. It looked like it might have been in the building when it blew, but to Cale's surprise, the cylinder still spun.<br>
<br>
A bullet found itself out of the gun and in the vampire's hands. He sniffed it. He smelled rust, and aluminum. Throwing th bullet over his shoulder, Cale thought it useless. When the cartridge landed it exploded on impact and the thermite contained inside caught fire. Cale looked back at the gun. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A vampire hunter capable of setting his prey aflame.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Tucking it away, Cale's gray eyes caught on a bar.<br>
<br>
He stepped inside and looked across the dance floor. He stopped when he say a girl dancing with a gentlemen. She was biting his neck. &quot;Looks like she needed a drink,&quot; he said to himself as he walked to the bar. &quot;Guiness.&quot; He said to the bartender, as he relaxed in his chair. This could be a long night, and he was hoping to make it longer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwynnethdelioncourt>Gwynneth de Lioncourt</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://animatedgif.net/bulletsballs/flasharrowrt_e0.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/17/03 11:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jasminebecketgriffith.com/boredfairy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> Iris caught sight of someone at the bar who had looked in her direction. &quot;I'm going to go ingest some alcohol, Steven. I'll be back shortly.&quot; She waded through the see of bodies, human and vampire alike, as she made her way to the bar. She perched on one of the stools, next to a man clad in a black leather jacket. The smell of the leather wafted to her, nearly making her shiver. There'd always been something about the way well-cared for leather smelled...<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll have a Kinky Cat, please,&quot; Iris said to the bartender. <br>
<br>
&quot;What was in that again? No one's ordered it until you came in here, Iris.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled a little, concealing her fangs well. &quot;Grenadine and Bourbon, Tim. Remember?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yeah. Haven't seen ya in a while, so I musta forgot.&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
She nodded her thanks as he finally served her the cocktail. It was a bright orange color that practically glowed in the blacklights all around. She took a dainty sip and sighed blissfully. &quot;Clouds should taste like this in Heaven...&quot; she murmured softly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/17/03 11:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> Just moving his eyes to look at this female clad in vinyl, Cale approved of what he saw.

She ended up with a napkin and a Sharpie. &quot;Close enough...&quot; she muttered, taking another sip of her drink. She wrote down a phone number and a name. &quot;The guy's Jimmy. If anyone'd know about her, he would. Tell him you know me, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very well</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and he'll help you out as best he can. See, a lot of people know who I am and try to get info from Jimmy, so we added the 'very well' bit to let him know you were really sent by me.&quot; She wrote that down on the napkin as well, handing it to Cale and giving the marker back to Tim.<br>

&quot;For whatever reason you're after her, I hope you can find her, Cale.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwynnethdelioncourt>Gwynneth de Lioncourt</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://animatedgif.net/bulletsballs/flasharrowrt_e0.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/31/03 11:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/18/03 12:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> &quot;Thanks,&quot; Cale replied with a smile, the same one that melted many southern belle hearts from his time. &quot;Tim.

<br>
Again the soft chuckle sang from his throat. &quot;To tell you the truth, my brother was always better at dancing than I was.

If you have any sense of rhythm at all, dancing now isn't hard. There aren't any complicated steps like there were with swing dancing. It's almost primal, instinctual. You just let your body <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>feel</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the beat, and move with it...&quot; Her voice trailed off as she partially led him through the crowd of bodies, the people wisely making a path for her and her companion to pass through. It was hard not to be imposing when you were 6'3 and covered from neck to toe in black vinyl...<br>

She stood still for a moment, allowing herself to adjust to the volume of music. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/24/03 9:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> Cale smiled as he followed the lady, and marveled at the ease that they found themselves on the dance floor.

She smiled at how easily Cale picked up on her rhythm, since most of the guys she glommed onto had two left feet. She wondered how much of it was preternatural assistance, and how much of it was inborn ability.<br>
<br>
&quot;Definitely good enough,&quot; she said with a little laugh. She ran her hands up his arms and over his shoulders, feeling the slight swell of muscles beneath the jacket. &quot;So,&quot; Iris began, wanting to strike up an idle conversation if Cale was up for it, &quot;How long have you been in the city?
