I tend to think that things happen without necessarily having a purpose.  Do all strong believers think we are here for a particular purpose?  Even if there is life after death, what would the purpose of that be?  What is the purpose of just sitting up there on a cloud or just merely existing day in and day out for all eternity?  Also, what about the purpose of particular life events?  Is there really a purpose to a baby being left to overheat in a locked car or a purpose to a young teenager dying in an accident (yes, the latter is a little personal to me)?  I am happy living my life for the here and now, but so many others are just focused on some bigger picture that nobody can truly grasp.  Some people think that you can't find joy in life without finding joy in an afterlife.  To me this is like turning down an invitation to a party just because there won't be another party the next day.  We go to a party in order to enjoy that given moment, and we have fun at these parties eventhough we know it will end.  When I showed up at my wedding I looked forward to the next 6 hours of fun.  I didn't sit there and say &quot;what is the point of being here if it is just going to end?&quot;.  Some thoughts...<br>

we are all here that we might have joy.<br>

i would feel out of place and experience less joy in a place where i feel uncomfortable and that my spirit doesn't like.  this is true both here and now as well as in the eternities.<br>

Actually, I am quite enjoying this present party AND I know I get to go to another one once this one ends. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Just because I believe in Heaven and that I will be there one day does not in any way diminish my joy at this life. I cannot tell you how many times each day I sit back, stare at my son, and think, &quot;Wow, he's something else!&quot; (And I mean this, usually, in a good way!) Seriously, though, this life is meant to be enjoyed. It is my belief that God created us to love Him, love each other, and be loved by others. My life is about trying to experience that. My purpose right now in this present life is to be the best daughter, wife, mother, teacher, sister, aunt, etc., that I can be. Most the time, it is a very fulfilling experience. Granted, there are really low and bummer times. My m/c made me really wonder why some things are allowed. It took a long time to come up out of that pit. But, eventually the fog began to clear and the goodness of life came back. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What is the purpose of just sitting up there on a cloud or just merely existing day in and day out for all eternity?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You know, I have such a hard time even conceptualizing Heaven. I don't think, though, that it will be merely existing day in and day out. First of all, I do not believe that our concept of time will exist. But sometimes I still wonder, &quot;Will I get bored?&quot; But then I think about being in church, singing away with our praise band; or I think about being at a Christian concert, blending my voice with the 1000's of others there, and think, I could do this forever. That's what I think it will be like. Those who make it will all be there for the same purpose - to sing praises to God for eternity. No tears, no sorrow, no pain, no hunger, no needs. So, from a Christian standpoint, the purpose of being there is to lend voice (and hopefully our voices get perfected, because I don't know if God would want to listen to mine for that long! LOL) in praise of Him. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also, what about the purpose of particular life events?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'm not sure if there is always an answer for this. I went through this off and on after my m/c. I wanted to know that if God knew I would m/c, why did I become pregnant in the first place. I also went through this when my nephew died. But, I can also see good that has come out of it. BUT, this has taken much time and distance to focus on. I really didn't like people telling me in the moments that everything had its reason and God had a purpose. Yes, I knew deep down this was true, but it didn't make the hurt and pain go away. Now, I see my niece who is an amazing girl and probably came because of the death of her brother. I see the drastic changes in my life - quit one job in the middle of a school year and began another - that probably wouldn't have happened without something as devastating as my m/c. So, ultimately, I do see a purpose for events happening, though I don't think we are always privy to that information. <br>
<br>
I don't believe, though, that God chooses for &quot;bad&quot; things to happen. This would involved a whole 'nother conversation about Adam, sin, free choice, etc. I do believe He allows things to happen, but we choose our own paths in our lives. It is up to us if we are willing to bend our choices to His will or if we are going to go it alone. But no where in the Bible does it say that once you believe in God or choose to follow Him will your life be easy. Nor does it point out that your life will be any worse for the wear if you don't follow Him. (I know there are some out there that are probably chomping at the bit to bring up Scripture to the opposite, but I believe the original post was written in sincerity and I am replying in the same way.) Just look at Paul's life for an example of the &quot;easy&quot; life after following Christ. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Anyways, you brought up some very interesting points about life. I hope I have given you a little insight possibly into one way at looking at it.<br>

how would you feel if all the atheists are in a place of eternal progression while you remain stagnantly singing for eternity?<br>
<br>
if you are truly as happy as you could be singing hymns of praises for all eternity then you should also be happy for others who receive the glory that their spirits obtain.<br>

so my question is this.  if you get all the happiness your spirit can handle then will you be mad if someone else gets more?<br>

As I do not buy into LDS belief on heaven and &quot;eternal progression,&quot; this comment does not even affect me. I do not believe in levels of glory nor levels in heaven. You either go or you don't. So I'm not terribly worried about whether or not atheists are in a place of eternal progression. My beliefs are that there is one place and one Name by which you get there. <br>
<br>
I do think it preposterous to assume that we will be on the same level as God one day - nor is this my purpose in life. <br>

Where does this come from? Did I ever say anything to lead you to assume that I would have an opinion one way or another? As I stated before, the OP asked for the opinion of others when it comes to purpose in life. I answered. Why don't you more clearly explain your purpose in life rather than try to start an argument with me over something that hasn't even been said? I did not ask you to agree with my answer. I am waiting to hear what other people have to say about their purpose in life. I think just as atheists believe that Christians see non-Christians as having no purpose in life (which I do not believe is true), I also think they see Christians as only having a purpose for a life after this. The misunderstanding, IMO, goes both way. I have a great purpose in this life and enjoy it very much. I am also glad that it doesn't have to end when I die. Likewise, just because someone doesn't believe in God or an afterlife does not mean they cannot find a purpose in this life.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=momluvsum>Mom luvs um</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/18/03 3:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=118.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Purpose In Life</span><hr size=1> What is the purpose of this life?

You know, I can't even remember what the points were for in Brownies - was it to earn those silly little badges? In all seriousness, though, I do not see other people as my &quot;projects&quot; so that I can earn brownie points for anything. But then again, I do not subscribe to the mind set that I can do anything to gain favor with God. What I stated earlier about my purpose - love God, love others, and be loved - I think can be achieved in one form or another by anyone. Of course, someone who doesn't believe in God wouldn't do the &quot;loving God&quot; portion of that, but you still are involved with loving others and being loved by them, yes? From my point of view, my agnostic and atheist family members are still fulfilling a purpose in this life, though it may not be to the extent that I believe we were/are created for. Does that make sense? I think if you don't have any purpose (I'm not speaking strictly spiritually or religiously here) then it can be difficult to get out of bed in the morning. JMO Even if I was not a believer in God, I would still view my purpose in life as being the best mom to my ds I could be, being the best wife I could be, being the best daughter, etc. It's like my job - my purpose is to go in and be the best teacher I can be to my students; I am to be prepared, fair, respectful, and knowledgable about my subject. I just see life, on a bigger picture, as having a bigger purpose. I think each and every one of us here have some sort of purpose ... but maybe not every one realizes their purpose (again, not necessarily speaking on a spiritual/religious level). Just my thoughts ...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=powertotherae>Powertotherae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Satan's Lil' Minion</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/18/03 5:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=118.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Purpose In Life</span><hr size=1> Ians1mom<br>

What I mean by that is it seems that some religious people get so wrapped up in getting into heaven that they don’t enjoy the now. I feel like instead of people taking responsibility for there bad lives or that things didn’t turn out the way they thought, they just keep their eyes on the prize so to speak. I have just found way too many xians not doing anything to make their lives here any better because they are holding out for what’s to come. I do things because that is what I want to do. I am who I am because that is who I choose to be. I don’t see a purpose in living by someone else’s expectations (even gods). I am who I am and I refuse to make excuses for myself. To me that is what really matters is always being true to who you are even if somebody else doesn’t approve. Does that make sense?

do you think it preposterous to assume that your kids will be parents one day?  if your kids do become parents would it take away from or add to your happiness?  what if one of your kids wants to learn everything you know?  would you keep them at arms length and tell them to sing?  is that the nature of a loving parent?<br>
<br>
i'm really not trying to start a fight.  i'm just wondering how fundamental christians get such a pessemistic attitude towards god?  what is loving about melting your children?  what is just and fair about being born worthy of that punishment?  why would i want to praise someone who pulls me out of a stadium full of family and friends and then blows it to pieces?  faith really doesn't have to be this morbid.<br>
<br>
i was wondering if you and i end up in the same place after we die, would you want to discuss eternal progression at that time?  or would your spirit still not want to continue to progress?  that's all i'm asking.<br>
<br>
it's fine if you are happier being a cheerleader.  maybe it would bring you greater joy to cheer on all of your atheist friends who refuse to stop evolving.<br>
<br>
our purpose is either to progress eternally (and continue to increase in joy) or there is no purpose.<br>

Heather, as an atheist feel the same way about oblivion, or whatever you want to call my &quot;belief&quot; that when your are dead, you're dead. No more problems, no more worries, no more bills - but also no more sunny mornings or fudge brownies with coffee. I won't be conciously there to miss it, therefore it should be every bit the relief that your heaven is.<br>
<br>
Dag, your explaination of your beliefs about god's nature vs. fundie beliefs about god's nature nicely sums up why I can't buy into <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>any</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> theology. Presuming to &quot;know&quot; what god is like, or believe that god is &quot;revealed&quot; through other people (prophets) or through scripture takes a bigger leap of faith than I have legs for. <br>
<br>
When you boil it down, it's all just dogma.<br>
