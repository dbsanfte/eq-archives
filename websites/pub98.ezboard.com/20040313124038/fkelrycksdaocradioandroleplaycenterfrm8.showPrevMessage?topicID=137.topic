He sucked in his soft belly and straightened a little in an effort to appear taller.  He would never match the stature of most men, he thought to himself, but his money made up for that.  After all, there was nothing in the world that a little gold couldn't cure.  Gazing into the looking-glass, he admired his new suit of clothes and fought to suppress a giggle at the ridiculously low price he would pay for it.  Such finery would have been far beyond his means only a few years earlier; but much had changed since then, and all to the better as far as Skatt was concerned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Humph,&quot; he said out loud, &quot;I suppose it will have to do.&quot;  He looked down his beak of a nose at the tailor, who stood with his head bowed and his hat in his hands, then tossed a small purse at the tailor's feet.  The purse fell to the floor with a soft clink.  &quot;There you are, six gold, as agreed.&quot;  The tailor slowly bent down to retrieve it, then opened the purse-strings and glanced inside.<br>
<br>
&quot;Beggin' yer pardon, Master Skatt, but…&quot;  Skatt's face darkened into a scowl.  &quot;Ah, that is, ah, Lord Skatt,&quot; the tailor quickly amended.  Skatt wasn't a real lord, of course, but his newfound wealth and position made him too powerful to be trifled with, and the tailor was too poor to anger a wealthy patron.  &quot;Beggin' yer pardon, Lord Skatt, but did we not agree on a price of nine gold?&quot;<br>
<br>
Skatt's lip twisted in a sneer.  &quot;Did we?  Well, no matter.  Six is twice what these rags are worth.  Be thankful that I'm a generous man.  Now begone.&quot;  The tailor opened his mouth as if to reply, but whatever he was about to say was cut short.  &quot;Begone!&quot; Skatt shrieked, spittle flying from his mouth.  &quot;Get out of my sight or I'll set the dogs on you.  Bors, see this man to the door.&quot;<br>
<br>
A heavy-set bodyguard with the broken nose of a tavern brawler stepped forward, one hand on a rusty short sword at his belt.  The tailor shut his mouth with a snap, then gave a bow that was little more than a nod of his head.  &quot;As you wish, milord.  I'm grateful for your… generosity, milord.&quot;  With that, the tailor turned and strode stiff-legged from the room with Bors close on his heels.<br>
<br>
The hatred in the man's eyes had been plain, but Skatt only laughed as he turned once more to his mirror.  He toyed with the idea of having the man beaten for his insolence, but quickly dismissed the notion.  The man was too good a tailor to waste, and Skatt thought he might yet have need of a good tailor.  He scrutinized his reflection, his hands caressing the silk waistcoat, the lace collar and cuffs, and the fine velvet cape.  Yes, he thought, these were clothes fit for a prince, and perfectly suited for his purpose that afternoon.<br>
<br>
Skatt's heart quickened at the thought of what this day would bring.  Today, the wench Elmeara would be his at last.  Five long years he had waited, five times longer than custom demanded.  Everyone knew that oaf Steffon had been killed in the battle to retake the Black Hills Bridge.  Yet Steffon's corpse had never been found, and Elmeara had prolonged her mourning in the vain hope that he would return.  Skatt grinned at himself in the mirror.  Well, five years was long enough, and he would no longer be denied.<br>
<br>
Skatt strode from his bedchamber, locked the door carefully behind him, and descended the wide stairs leading to the manor's great hall.  &quot;Bors!  Where are you, you great ox?  It is time.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a grunt, Bors lifted himself from a bench near the fire and bowed deeply, a faint upturn at the corners of his mouth giving a hint of mockery to the gesture.  Skatt ground his teeth at the insult, but there was little he could do about it where Bors was concerned.  The huge man had been with him since before the great storm had brought darkness and chaos to Albion, and he knew too much about where Skatt's fortune came from.  Besides, Bors had been a faithful servant all these years, and he kept the other strong-arms in line.  Still, Skatt thought to himself, something would have to be done about Bors eventually.<br>
<br>
Squinting against the bright afternoon sunlight, Skatt followed Bors out into the street.  Turning in the direction of Elmeara's cottage, he assumed what he thought was a regal posture, taking care to keep his fine new clothes out of the mud.  He nodded to the people he passed, but most of them turned away and avoided his gaze.  On any other day, this would have brought Skatt's blood to a boil, but he was determined not to let anything spoil his mood today.<br>
<br>
At last, the two men reached their destination.  The cottage was plain but sturdy; the porch was swept clean, though the garden was bare of the flowers that had once adorned it.  Bors knocked three times on the door, and cried &quot;Open in the name of Lord Skatt!&quot;  There was no response.  After a moment, Bors again pounded on the door and bellowed, &quot;Open in the name of Lord Skatt!&quot;  Still there was no response.  As Bors lifted his fist to pound again, Skatt heard the sound of a bolt being thrown back, and the door slowly creaked open.<br>
<br>
Skatt strode into the room, his eyes gradually adjusting to the darkness.  Elmeara stood before him in a plain black dress, her hands folded at her waist.  &quot;Hail, fair Elmeara,&quot; Skatt purred.  &quot;I expect you know why I've come?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Elmeara replied, &quot;that I do.&quot;  Her face betrayed no emotion whatsoever.<br>
<br>
&quot;Five years it's been since your husband was last seen alive.  Your time of mourning is over!&quot;<br>
<br>
Skatt's eyes drank in the sight of the woman who stood before him, who he had lusted after since he was a young boy, and who was soon to be his.  She had always been beautiful, perhaps the fairest lass in the entire village.  Though the sparkle in her eyes and her bright laughter had vanished with her husband, the sight of her still made Skatt's heart race.  Her honey-colored hair spilled over her shoulders like spun gold; her skin was as soft and pale as fresh cream; and her full bosom and round hips made Skatt's mouth water.  He leered at her openly, relishing the sight of her lithe and still-youthful body.  Elmeara shivered as though she could feel his gaze crawling across her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will forever mourn the loss of Steffon,&quot; Elmeara said.  &quot;You know that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Steffon,&quot; Skatt snarled, &quot;was a bumpkin and a fool, and unworthy of you.  I can give you more than Steffon ever dreamed of.  And that time has now come.  Or have you forgotten your promise?&quot;<br>
<br>
Elmeara looked down at the cottage's earthen floor.  &quot;Nay, I have not.&quot;  Then she looked Skatt coldly in the eye.  &quot;I promised I would be yours, after five years passed, if you would meet my conditions.  Would you now hear them?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, yes, get on with it.&quot;  Skatt replied impatiently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, then, are my terms.  First, I will join you as consort, but not as wife.  I'll not have this union blessed by the Church, and neither I nor my offspring will take your name.&quot;<br>
<br>
Skatt grinned wolfishly.  &quot;Aye, I can live with that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elmeara nodded, as if expecting his answer.  &quot;Second, you will see to it that my son is trained as a fighter.  You will use your… resources… to ensure that he is as skilled in the ways of arms as any other in Albion.&quot;<br>
<br>
Skatt chuckled.  &quot;Ah yes, the boy.&quot;  He glanced at Bors.  &quot;I think I've just the trainer in mind for him.  He'll have no match in armed combat in any of the Three Realms.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, Elmeara nodded.  &quot;Third, you must pledge that he'll have no part whatsoever in your… business dealings.&quot;<br>
<br>
Skatt shrugged.  &quot;As you wish, milady.  I agree to your terms.  By the One God, I swear it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elmeara laughed, but her laughter was devoid of mirth.  &quot;And when have you ever believed in the One God?  When have you ever set foot in a church?  Nay, I'll not accept that oath.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, what oath would you have me swear, then?&quot; Skatt replied haughtily.  &quot;Name it, and it is yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elmeara turned her gaze toward Bors.  &quot;This man here, he is you sworn liegeman?&quot;  Bors and Skatt both nodded.  &quot;Bors, will you obey your master whatever he commands?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, milady, I would kill or die at his word,&quot; Bors answered solemnly.<br>
<br>
Elmeara regarded Bors for a moment, then nodded as if reaching a decision.  &quot;Then here is the pledge I will accept, Skatt.  Command your man, here, that should you break any part of this oath, he is to slit your throat as you sleep.  This command may not be foresworn nor rescinded, by any word or deed, from this day forward.  Order him so, and I am yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
Skatt's smile faded.  He knew that if he gave such a command, Bors would obey it to the letter.  Still, none of Elmeara's requests seemed particularly troublesome, and Bors could always be dealt with if need be.  &quot;Very well, then.  I do so command.  Bors, do you hear and obey, on pain of death?&quot;<br>
<br>
Bors pressed his clenched fists to his breast.  &quot;I hear and obey, master.  As you command, so do I swear, on pain of death.&quot;  The amusement on Bors' face was unmistakable, yet Skatt had no doubt that Bors would keep his oath.<br>
<br>
Elmeara's shoulders slumped in resignation, and her eyes once again sought the floor at her feet.  &quot;Then I am yours,&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; cried a small voice from a corner of the room.  &quot;No, Mama, No!&quot;  A young boy bounded toward Elmeara, clutching at her skirts.  &quot;Da will come back, he will, you said he would!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So this is the lad, then,&quot; Skatt said, baring his teeth in what he hoped would be taken for a smile.  &quot;Come, let's have a look at ye.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; the boy repeated.  &quot;You're not my Da, you can't tell me what to do.  My Da will come back, you'll see, and he'll beat you to a pulp, craven that you are.  Go away!&quot;<br>
<br>
Skatt grabbed the boy roughly by the arm.  &quot;Come, lad,&quot; he spat, &quot;you'll learn respect for your new benefactor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; the boy yelled once again.  He began to lash out with his hands and feet, landing a fist in Skatt's belly and two kicks on his shins.  &quot;You can't make me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Skatt's face turned first white, then red, then purple with rage.  He drew back his arm to backhand the boy, but Bors was faster.  Grabbing the child by his thick red hair, he pulled him out of Skatt's reach.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whether he can or he can't, lad, I most certainly can,&quot; Bors chortled.  He held the boy at arm's length as easily as he might have handled a kitten.  The boy's arms whirled like cartwheels, and his legs kicked frantically, but to no avail.  Bors threw his head back and laughed.  &quot;Aye, I think this lad's got the makings of a fighter in him.  Not long out of swaddling clothes, he is, yet I see the bloodlust in his eyes.  Well, lad, here's yer first lesson.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bors' boot landed squarely in the boy's stomach, sending him crashing against the wall before collapsing in a heap on the floor.  There he lay, gasping and retching, as Skatt cackled gleefully and his mother looked on dispassionately.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have ye learned some respect, then, lad?&quot; Bors said with uncharacteristic gentleness.  The boy glared about the room, still coughing and struggling for breath.<br>
<br>
Finally his mother spoke in a voice as cold as snow.  &quot;Learn well, my son, and learn fast.  You may not have the luxury of many lessons.&quot;  Elmeara's eyes took on a glint of madness.  &quot;A fighter's way is your destiny, and that way is not an easy one.  Yet it is the path you must take.  It is an oath I swore long ago, and one you must accept.&quot;<br>
<br>
The boy glared first at Bors, then at Skatt, then finally at his mother, and his shoulders sagged.  &quot;Very well, Mother, as you wish it.&quot;  Then the fire seemed to rekindle in his eyes.  &quot;But one day I'll have my revenge.&quot;  He rose to his feet and stood on shaky legs, then spat bloody phlegm at Bors' feet.<br>
<br>
The boy swore an oath and a curse then, but they were for his ears alone, as his words were drowned out by the laughter of the two men who had come to claim his mother.<br>
