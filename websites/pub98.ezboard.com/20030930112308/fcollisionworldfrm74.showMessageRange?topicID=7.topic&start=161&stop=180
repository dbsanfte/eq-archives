<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She was trapped in a dark cell, somewhere deep inside her soul.  Inside the world of Abydos, where she awaited judgement.<br>
<br>
The sky was a screen of what was happening about her body.  Her eyes were still open there, allowing her to see Azalea holding Aeli's dagger.  Aeli crying hysterically over her.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>NO!  AELI!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Her voice echoed through her cell but no one answered except her own taunting voice.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Aeli...don't cry for me.  I never meant any of this to happen...Kelin, please hear me!  Please!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
She cried the demon's name, hoping that somewhere in the dark realm within Aeli's mind he would hear.  She cried as she rolled up into a ball and trembled.<br>
<br>
Some said that one could feel no pain in death.  They lied.  Laurena's pain tripled in intensity at the sight of Aeli's tears.  She almost wished she had let him die with her like he wished, so he could be here...<br>
<br>
Her hand clenched around something, suddenly.  Sittign up, she inspected the thing that had appeared in her hand.<br>
<br>
It was a blue flower...with silver thorns.<br>
<br>
The small flower brought her much joy.  She clasped it closely to her chest and looked up at the sky, where Aeli cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why live on?&quot; she heard Aeli ask.<br>
<br>
Azalea grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because there is always a way to bring them back...&quot;<br>

&quot;Of course.  There are certainly no guarantees. But if you do not even wish to try...&quot; she snapped, a surge of anger filling her at him.<br>
<br>
She came forward and took Laurena from Aeli's grasp, the siren's body hanging gracefully in silent death.  Azalea's eyes brimmed with rare tears--Laurena had not had even time to sing her deathsong.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is alright, Aeli.&quot;  Her voice became gentle and there was no blame.  &quot;I have no right to ask you to go to such a place.  Laurena...was my responsibilty.

The shadows about her pressed in harder about her body, and the sky above her faded to black.  She could no longer see her friend's faces, her love.  Dark thoughts filled her mind, sucking all hope from her soul.  The flower in her hand began to die.<br>
<br>
Her judgment would be soon...<br>
<br>

Her whole essence faded away and a truth settled into Aeli's brain. She was gone now. Gone for good. She might never come back, and Aeli might never see her bright, joyous lavender eyes. Or her dazzling smile. This was it. <br>
<br>
Laurena had been a bright, sparkling star in his world. And now... She had faded away. As soon as that truth settled into his brain, his eyes dried. He was now beyond tears. Beyond saddness and depression. <br>
<br>
This wasn't right. He couldn't help but feel that this wasn't supposed to end like that. It just wasn't. No matter how hard he tried to accept it, he couldn't. He had to do something... Find a siyron, go to the underworld.... Something. Anything. <br>

He walked up next to Azalea and placed a kiss on Laurena's cold, clammy head. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Don't give up, hold on, please Laurena. You must've give up, please. I beg you.

I would rather you not, but...&quot;  she sighed.  &quot;There are many doors to the shadow world, Aeli, to Abydos.  They are spread across the world, nothing to those who know nothing of them, but useful to those who know how to open them.  To our convenience, there is a door here:in the Old Ostona.&quot;  She gestured to the silent village of death as she walked.  &quot;I know precisely where the door is, and I have the key to open it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saying this, she held Laurena's dead body tighter in her arms.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I have been there only once.  When Laurena perished as a child, Garion and I were summoned there by the gods--I was the most powerful mage in this world, and he the truest knight.  The best of sword and sorcery were chosen to watch Laurena, to guard her, but to let her live out her life in natural motion.&quot;  Her face grew tight.  &quot;It pained us both when she was captured and put into slavery.  We were to do nothing, unless she were in danger for her life or the minions of the Dark Queen were in close pursuit.  And then, when Lance came...Laurena eluded us.  She would not let us stop him, and in the end he hurt her worse than imaginable.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have had no desire to return to this place--but now I have no choice. You do, Aeli--you can stop now, and wait for me to return.  I do not think that in all your years as a warrior, even as a demon, you would have ever seen such destruction as this. You have a choice to stay.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stopped as she said this, along the invisible line where LAurena had never been able to cross.  The village was close, but not close enough to be clearly seen.  The ankh around Laurena's swanlike neck pulsed dimly the color of the setting sun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarialunai>Saria Lunai</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://pic8.picturetrail.com/VOL252/1289854/2559643/31064134.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(8/19/03 8:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=169>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *dances* Kyonae's on!

All he wanted was her to be alive... And to bring that glimmering, peaceful happiness she seemed to give him, just by smiling. <br>
<br>
&quot;Azalea... I'm sure not many that ever lived did as much destruction as I have seen or done. When you were a demon, controlled by a sorceress for a long while... You tend to destroy more than you could ever imagine. And when you're a slayer of my degree... You see the destruction that others have done. Powerful others... I think I could handle it. Especially for Laurena...&quot; His eyes scanned the horizon, looking for something. He didn't quite know what, but he was searching for something.<br>
<br>
Yes, he would go to the underworld for her. At least he could keep that promise... Unless something else happened. Why did he feel so strongly about promises anyways? Maybe it was becuase he was completely and utterly lost. So deep in love that no one could ever save him. The others would definately wonder when they saw him. Leon especially...

They entered the village.  Azalea sucked in a ragged breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome to Ostona...&quot;<br>
<br>
The place had not changed since the night of the great slaughter.  The bodies of the maimed sirens littered the road, the blood still terribly fresh on the ground.  They were slashed, raped, riddled with arrows, and still so freshly dead.  The stench of death filled the air and Azalea could barely stand it.  Huts stood or remained collapsed, burned black. <br>
<br>
&quot;Artemis placed a curse on this place,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;A curse to keep it like this forever...a wretched scar on Mahitm to mark the cruelty of humans and their greed.&quot; <br>
<br>
They walked among the slaughter, until they came upon an unsettling scene:  A lithe man with short brown hair and bronze wings, stabbed to death and stabbed even after death.  Beside him, a slender woman with black hair, defiled in more ways than one, her amethyst eyes open to the heavens in terror.  Nearby, their was a small pool of blood littered with white feathers, but no body laid there.<br>
<br>
&quot;These are Laurena's parents,&quot; she croaked, gesturing at them,  &quot;This was their home, and this is where Laurena died.  This is the door to Abydos,&quot;  she gasped in a hidden sob, gesturing then to the pool of blood where no body lay.  &quot;Laurena's body is again the key.&quot;<br>

<br>
Suddenly they were surrounded by darkness.  Cold air rushed around them, and screams of pain filled the air.  Suddenly they were on ground, or what was believed to be ground, and darkness surrounded them, pure and horrible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Abydos...&quot;<br>
<br>
Before she could say anything else, they came upon a sight of sadness.  Only a few feet away lay Laurena, a mere shade of what she used to be, crumpled on the ground, holding a dead flower the color of Aeli's hair and eyes.<br>

&quot;Laurena...&quot; His voice was so soft, that only those of elven blood would be able to pick up the murmurs of his voice. Why had she been so hasty? Why hadn't she let him protect her? He couldn't done it. It wasn't like he was weak. Yes, he might've gotten hurt, but that didn't matter. What mattered is that Laurena was safe and happy.

&quot;Oh...oh no...no, no...&quot;<br>
<br>
She began to cry, the flower falling to dust.  She stood up, and begged of them,<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you here?!  Don't you know that you are in danger?  I am dead...there is no saving me...&quot;  she whispered, looking at Aeli as if he were the ghost.  &quot;Or are you dead too...?

<br>
He didn't know what to say to her. &quot;Fool!&quot; and &quot;Love!&quot; came to mind at the same instant. But he could hardly say either...

How much she longed to keep him here, forever, and be like this...in eternal embrace.  His life force was overwhelmingly warm and scorched her beyond the knowing of pain, but she only drove herself further into it, fearing she would be lost in the darkness were she to let go.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Why</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?&quot;  she sobbed.  &quot;Why, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>why</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->...&quot; it was all she could say.  Why had he come here?  Why had he tried to kill himself?  Why did Azalea stand behind them, as pale as a ghost, holding her material body close in her arms?  She threw these questions aside and frantically placed ghostly kisses on Aeli's face, even though it burned her lips.  And then, just as suddenly, she pushed him away roughly, crying out in terror.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; she cried.  &quot;No, you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fool</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!  You shouldn't have come here!  You shouldn't have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>dared</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!&quot;  she yelled, trying to be angry, but all she could feel was utter sorrow.  &quot;You have to go, now, before...&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly the darkness around them shifted and trembled, the ground beneath them shook and tossed.  A great booming could be heard, so loud it seemed to be coming from their very hearts and souls.  The cries and moans of the sinfully dead increased, and fire flickered among the horizons of the shadow realm Abydos.<br>
<br>
Laurena moaned.  &quot;It's too late,&quot; she sobbed.  &quot;He is coming...t-there is nothing you can do...it was all for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>nothing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->...&quot;<br>
