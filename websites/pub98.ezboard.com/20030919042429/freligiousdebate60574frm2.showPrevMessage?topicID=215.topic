<br>
I personally feel that there are some major differences in the sexes (beisdes physiological) and that those differences lend themselves to define gender roles in general.  Of course there are exceptions to every rule and I believe that opportunities should be open to anyone who wishes to pursue the career of their choice, but I think the different gender roles are a result of those differences and not the other way around.<br>

I believe that the emotional/psychological differences of mena nd women are rooted in the physical differences (women as child bearers etc.) and have been been ritualized and perpetuated by society.  I believe that inherently men and women have the same mental/psychological/emtional potential but that since gender roles are so ingrained in our society it is difficult for some people to relaize their natural potential.  <br>

What is meant here by roles? (mother/father, librarian/CEO???)<br>
<br>
What are the differences you feel are not physiological? Of what nature are these and exactly how do you feel they define gender roles?<br>

<br>
The behavioral differences in genders stems from basic biological chemical differences, specifically hormones and precisely, testosterone.  The introduction or suppression of it in either gender (as appropriate) will physiologically alter them to conform more closely with the opposite gender to include active behaviors, emotional responses, physiological secondary sexual characteristic expression (facial hair, tissue development, fatty deposites, etc.) and the results can render one indistinguishable from their opposite.<br>
<br>
It reads like you are generalizing a dominant/submissive role allocation, but before I respond I want to be certain what position you are taking and respond accordingly. <p>DBC67<br>

By not just physiology, I thought someone might get cute and say well of course their are differences meaning sexual anatomy.<br>
<br>
But the differences that exist like you mentioned DBC are the ones that I am thinking of as well, chemistry, brain structure, hormonal, build of body etc.  I think those real differences have naturally led to distinctly different gender roles. Where some believe that it is all a matter of socialization.  I think that in the nurture vs. nature - both make a significant impact.<br>
<br>
I think that on other levels like emotion, logic etc that differences are both social and inherent.  I know that women are naturally more nurturing (in general) this is the type of differences I see.<br>

<br>
Nature v Nurture is an ongoing case and the only thing that has been proven is that it is always both.  Occasionally one will seemingly overpower the influences of the other, but only when the other is allowing itself to be over powered.<br>
<br>
However, there is still a great deal of misinformation out there about men v women and supposed differences.  For example, the tendency to violence.  It is often presumed that men are more violent than women, and the facts do not bear out this reasoning.  More women are battered by men, but more children are battered by women.  Equal violence levels, directed at different classes of victims.  Moreover, less violence against men and children is reported, no support structures exists for men, and socially there is a huge stigmata against men being victimized.  <br>
<br>
The tragic reality is, the only way a man could respond to violence from his partner is by stooping to an equal level of violence in response.  Otherwise, the physiological differences don't come into play.  If DH is hit or threatened (&quot;I'll kill you in your sleep&quot;) and he does not wish to punch her back or kill her first, how else can he respond?  What battered women’s shelter is going to let a man move in?  What police policy is going to make the woman spend the night 'cooling off' downtown.  (OK, that last line was inciteful, in CT the rule is the one who calls the cops is the one who gets to stay home, but hopefully you see my point.)<br>
<br>
I will also disagree that women are 'naturally more nurturing' than men.  While socialization and the culture you operate in may lead you to that conclusion, I disagree that it is 'natural' in origin or even true.  I know too many women parents that are just terrible and they quite smugly hold the view that they are naturally better endowed at care giving.  Yet they act out scenes straight out of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mommy Dearest</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> right in front of me.  While this is an anecdotal reply to your anecdotal conclusion, it is only meant to get you to question the presumption.<br>
<br>
Some of the other stuff, brain structure, build, etc, are all tied to the hormonal composition both during development and later stages of life.  Flood a little girl with testosterone as she passes thru puberty, you'll have a person physiologically indistinguishable from a male.  Yes, even to the genitalia (clitoral over development to present the appearance of penile development.  No actual testicles or prostate, they're chromosomally precluded, but the rest of the structure.) Suppress testosterone in a male and his penile development will halt, he will develop breasts and his shaving problems will end.<br>
<br>
The differences that exist are largely expressed in population characteristics and tied to sex linked traits.  Color blindness, profound intelligence, hair lines, etc.  No single individual will present any different opportunity for trait expression, but when considering the population as a whole, you can see trends.  These however are different from 'naturally more nurturing', emotional states, intuition reliance, logic use, etc. which are largely anecdotal.<br>

I just think society is behind on the science on this one.  There is a young male teacher at my daughter's preschool, and I confess to wondering why the heck a cool, young guy would choose to herd a bunch of 4 year-olds all day--wondering if he's just a slacker or if he's a pedophile.  Then I catch myself and realize just how ingrained gender roles are in our culture as opposed to our biology.  Men can be GREAT child care providers, nurses, hair stylists, but society isn't going to make it easy for them.  Not only will they suffer the poor pay that traditional female professions generally receive, but they'll be questioned about their motives, intelligence, and ambition.<br>
I wonder, too, if the same doesn't go for jobs that involved risk--police work, race car driving, fire fighter.  Have women traditionally stayed away from these lines of work due to an inherent avoidance of risk, or because we as primary care givers to our families would face censure if we risked our own lives?<br>

<br>
Maybe, but I also believe that physical structure and ability has had a lot to do with that.  I am all for a woman doing any of those jobs IF the same standards are applied equally.  When we were first married dh went through a period of thinking that he wanted to be a cop.  When he went out for the training and testing, there were different physical requirements for men and women, which I think is totally bogus.  If the standard is created to ensure that a person can physically do the job, why should ANYONE be given any slack, either you need to meet that physical requirement to do the job or you dont.    <br>
<br>
Applying those same standards would it be ok to allow a male administrative assistant to get by at 40 wpm when the females are required to have 60wpm?<br>
<br>
Why should my life be put at greater risk just for political correctness?    If the female fire fighter has to drag me out of the building as opposed to carrying me, I am sure my risk of injury is greater.<br>
<br>
I dont know the exact stats, but just for fun I have paid attention to the number of police shootings of a suspect according to gender and here in Utah WOMEN shoot more armed suspects than men. And my own personal opinion is that it is because they feel more threatened and are less capable of disarming a larger male suspect.  (not that these guys are innocent, but it is a pretty serious differnece in going to jail and being killed because the female police officer cant take you down or she feels more threatened because of size difference)<br>
<br>
If anyone wants to do a job that is traditionally held by the opposite gender, I think that the same qualifications should apply across the board. - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=212.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=212.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=212.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.threadControl?topicID=212.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=212.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=212.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="religiousdebate60574frm2">Debate Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm10">Christianity Discussions (G Rated)<option value="religiousdebate60574frm1">Announcements<option value="religiousdebate60574frm11">Test Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm5">Help Files</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574>religiousdebate</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2>Debate Forum</a> <font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246f<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
