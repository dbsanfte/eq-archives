What is the normal flow for the White in terms of cfs?  The graph look to me like it is about 450 cfs.  I may be reading that wrong.  Increasing the flow to 800 cfs would still allow people to wade most areas, and would produce some awesome fish.  The boaters would have more access to the river but that could be bad knowing some of the rednecks out there!  I am not terribly familiar with the area below the dam but it seems like it would still be very wadeable from what I have seen.  Maybe I am misinformed--some one let me know.<br>

<br>
I think you are totally correct on all counts. We looked at minimun flow very hard over the previous years when the water temps down river began to cause some fatalities in the fishery. Our resulting death loss over a 3 year period greatly effected the fishery. <br>
<br>
However, being a fly fisher I am greatly concerned with the increase in access given to boats and the loss of wadable areas. I think there should be some room for compromise if minimum flow were to become a reality. Considering the mad house that is created on opening day in the C&amp;R area I'd hate to see that much boat traffic day in day out. It would basically kill any wade fishing in that area.<br>
<br>
With all our attentions paid to minumum flow recently I wonder why AGFC has not paid more attention to water quality? The results of previous and recent low oxygen levels could be easily eliminated with oxygen injection. The costs would be less and the overall impact to the fishery would be considerably positive. <br>

<br>
I would really hate to see all of the wade fishing lost.  It would be detrimental to the guide business, boat traffic over fly lines and in back casts would really get old.  The quality of fish in the C&amp;R areas would also be effected by the new ease of access to this water by boaters.  I agree that compromise would be the only solution.  At least they don't allow people to snag trout below the dam on the White!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Has anyone heard of the Minimun Flow situation on the Little Red now that the powers that be want to use Greers Ferry as the water supply for NLR?  I think the Min-Flo would be nice to see, as it should increase the insect base for all you &quot;boys&quot; up on the White.  Would it really eliminate the wading in some areas by simply increasing the water flow where the water cannot spread out, or would it create and expand what it already there, as far as shoals go, while remaining &quot;fishable?&quot;  What areas of the White would benefit and which shoals would be hurt for walk in folks?<br>

<br>
Water quality has always been an issue on the Little Red. The massive fish kill due to low oxygen levels there several years ago was what prompted the minimum dissolved oxygen levels we have mandated now. The Little Red is a fairly low gradient river as it is. I would imagine that any additional flow at all would substantially impact how wadeable the shoals are. That fishery is so healthy I'd hate to wonder what it would be like if it was improved much more.<br>
<br>
AGFC has really been concerned with the lower White and the rise in water temps down stream of Red Bud shoal. Where Crooked Creek and the Buffalo confluence and below the water temps have been very high within the last few years. Of course they were fine with all the high water we had this last summer. I don't know if it is as much of an issue of minimum flow as it is of maximum temp.<br>
<br>
Andrew you're our resident expert, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  how has the dissolved oxygen level been on the Little Red this year? Have you noticed any issues?<br>

In years past we have seen some fairly high surface temps around the Mossy Shoal area, 72 degree +, which is not a good &quot;catching&quot; temp, but lasts only a short bit(days) until they release water, which makes great drift fishing when you mix low, fresh water with the prolific caddis hatches found between Mossy Shoal and Pangburn.<br>
As for the DO content, the LR seems to be fine right now.  They have in the past, run water for power until they couldn't pull anymore out, then take a bit more.  I guess they take the cake and want the crumbs too.  Fortunately, it keeps low DO and high temps from killing fish, but it does hurt the fish in the lake.  They seem to run water like this around spawning time for walleye and bass.  The constant high water level in the lake this past year should give it years of good fish numbers.<br>
Overall, in the last few years we have been fortunate to retain sufficient amounts of rain to last the most part of the summer.  Hopefully this continues, as it keeps all these nasty issues from popping up.<br>
I was fortunate to have clients that are familiar with the river when they were testing the minimum flow on the 'Red.  They were really impressed with the shaol levels, and I must admit, I LOVE the idea of being able to row through Winkley shoal.   From what I experienced, it actually made the shoals deep enough for a drift boat to gracefully manuver, while having little impact on the walkin angler.  All this while promoting diversity in the river.  You have got to love it!<br>

The White still remains at only a few feet below power pool even with all the high generation. We are about to come into our rainy season. We could easily have another high water summer. I am curious what sort of fish are going to be in the usual areas since they haven't been fished in almost a year. After the water went down we had low Dissolved Oxygen levels for several months prior to the areas closing. Those fish have to be some where by now. Will's little Creek was full of 6lb fish in lieu of the usual 3lb. I'd have to imagine that it is going to be that way all over the river.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
