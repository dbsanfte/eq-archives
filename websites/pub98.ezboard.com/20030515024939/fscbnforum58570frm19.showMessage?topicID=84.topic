<br>
  Tree branches breaking across his legs like long matchsticks.<br>
<br>
  Punctures and gashes over his torso and limbs from the sharp protrusions in the ancient living things.<br>
<br>
  He felt a passing envy of the living trees.<br>
<br>
  Un-death so much like the eternal itch that can never quite be scratched <br>
<br>
  “Let them Rot in it!”<br>
<br>
  The raging sweep of his arm knocks over trees like stalks of wheat.<br>
<br>
  “She was ended by the very creatures I helped create.” He raged at some unknown source.<br>
<br>
  The blind fury drives him onward as the blood tears washing down his face blurred his vision.  A very thick old tree sent him spinning and now running in a different direction.<br>
<br>
  The scent of other supernatural beings wafts through the air, but any further interest in this world fades as the last grasp on reality is finally released. Understanding of liberation from this world slowly brings a previously unknown peace.<br>
<br>
  And then the words of poetry came back through from Thomas’ lost memories.<br>
<br>
&gt;   I stepped into an avalanche,<br>
      It covered up my soul.<br>
  When I am not this hunchback that you see,<br>
      I sleep beneath the golden hill.<br>
  You who wish to conquer pain,<br>
      You must learn, learn to serve me well.<br>
<br>
  You strike my side by accident,<br>
      As you go down for your gold.<br>
  The cripple here that you clothe and feed,<br>
      Is neither starved nor cold.<br>
  He does not ask for your company<br>
      Not at the center, the center of the world.<br>
<br>
  When I am on a pedestal, <br>
      You did not raise me there<br>
  Your laws do not compel me now<br>
      To kneel grotesque and bare<br>
  I, myself, am the pedestal<br>
      For this ugly hump at which you stare.<br>
<br>
  You who wish to conquer pain<br>
      You must learn what makes me kind.<br>
  The crumbs of love that you offer me,<br>
      They’re the crumbs I’ve left behind.<br>
  Your pain is no credential here<br>
      It’s just the shadow, a shadow of my wound.<br>
<br>
  I have begun to long for you,<br>
      I, who have no greed.<br>
  I have begun to ask for you,<br>
      I, who have no need.<br>
  You say you’ve gone away from me,<br>
      But I can feel you, I feel it when you breathe.<br>
<br>
  Do not dress in those rags for me,<br>
      I know you are not poor<br>
  And don’t love me quite so fiercely now<br>
      When you know that you are not sure<br>
  It is your turn beloved,<br>
      It is your flesh that I wear<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
  The eastern horizon gathers the faint highlight of impending sunrise and Jack can feel the call to slumber as his supernaturally chilled body cools the boulder upon which he is perched. He waits in his slowed tears and abandon to see the glorious sun once more: His eternal release.<br>
  As the dew falls he hears the movement of another creature up the hillside, coming toward him, making its approach known.<br>
  Jack remains unmoving and disinterested while the Werewolf steps out from the underbrush and cautiously approaches Jack’s unearthly Horrid form. The Werewolf realizes this intruder’s awareness by the telltale tracking of its monstrous ears, but is confused by its total lack of interest.<br>
  Realizing that this was no trap, the Werewolf sat near Jack and observed him, waiting to see what he’d do or say before destroying this intruder. Jack’s eyes were glued upon the eastern sky and remained so, unwaveringly.<br>
<br>
  Finally as the rising light begins to clearly affect the intruder, the Werewolf speaks in an old and wise tone, “This was your best option?”<br>
<br>
  Very faintly, Jack whispers, “yes.”<br>
<br>
  “I have smelled you here, before, you know. You used to sleep near here in the daylight in the back of your car.   …I miss watching your companion roll in the field and clean himself in the sun as you slept. He always reminded me of my youth.”<br>
<br>
  “Yeah, he was beautiful…  …they killed him too.” Jack forced the words through renewed tears. His despair and sorrow made his soul welcome the painful light that began to burn his eyes and make his skin feel as though it was boiling.<br>
<br>
  “You know I’m supposed to kill you for your intrusion into my territory; especially because I’m their elder and you’re the enemy, don’t you.”<br>
<br>
  “Yes, I know.” The tears washed over his face, “I don’t mind. Do so if you like.”<br>
<br>
“Well, …the sun is almost up and I just don’t think there’d be much point in it.” The Werewolf gave a surprisingly compassionate, if terribly toothy smile.<br>
<br>
“I would be a less than satisfying kill…”, Jack spoke with a painful smile through his blood-tear washed face. He mournfully looked the ancient werewolf in the eyes and asked finally asked the stranger, “Stay with me to watch the sun rise?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, why not? …I’ll bet you haven’t seen one in a while.”<br>

When its Crowley's turn to go, I hope and I pray that he goes with even a fraction of the dignity Jack/Thomas went with. The scenes you played on Friday were absolutely some of the best I've seen since I started. <br>

He was furious.  She understood.  She had overheard most of the conversation on the phone.  They were betrayed.  Worse than betrayed, it was more casual and less planned.  Those who had sworn to protect in trade for service simply couldn't be bothered to even betray.  She and Jack were obviously not worth anything.<br>
She would have expected as much from the majority of the population of the City.  They had ignored her warnings of Sabbat, if those who had been told had even bothered to pass on that information.  And for all their protests of organization skill and power, they were still children, and when faced with someone of as much self assurance and self possession as the Hunter, well they were bound to simply step aside.  She had not really expected any of them to care.  To make a stand.  After all, she had been made aware that they had indeed seen her before, and no one had made an effort to seek her out possitively or negatively until the Tremere had accidentally found her while seeking Demon worshippers.<br>
She had a moment to decide whether going after Jack was what she should do.  She could probably just catch him.  Somehow tho she felt that he'd have a better chance without her.<br>
She stepped onto the wind and surfed it back to the Chantry.  Her own rage was building.  She hovered above the false sanctuary and remembered all the good words, the big words, descriptive sharp and precise, that she had not used in so long, so long alone.<br>
Her mouth opened, and she had no idea if those were actually the words that poured forth, or if she drew only on animal howls of despair.<br>
&quot;HELP US!  I have done everything you asked.  Jack served you.  The girls served you.  Thomas served you.  You have done nothing but gain from my family.  HELP US!  You swore, all of you, that your walls would stand against whatever Sabbat that came.  You swore that I'd be safe here.  I would have given you everything, just to pretend for awhile that Jack was Thomas, that the girls were Thomas.  Just to pretend for awhile.  I have done *nothing* wrong.  YOU PROMISED.  I want everyone to hear what your word is worth.  NOTHING.  Not even the breath it's born on.  YOU BASTARDS.  What would it cost you?  To live up to your word?  To meet your promises?  BASTARDS BASTARDS BASTARDS.  I wish I was one of the damned Demon worshippers you sought.  I'd call on it to haunt you.  I'd sell my soul to make sure none of you know a moments peace, none of you ever feel love or trust or loyalty.  May you all be cursed forever to be as still and cold and unmoved as the stones here.&quot; <br>
Below her, the Gargoyles shifted, listening to some silent command.  She saw the flashes of personality and individuality that most others did not bother to notice.  Some leapt to the air with a joy to serve.  Some hesitated in confusion.  Some took flight with sad compassion.  They soared up to her.  She flexed her own wings, tearing them through her hooded shirt and shaking them free, to help her climb away.  <br>
Some of these were Thomas' children, some the girls', Jack's.  They flew and dived trying to catch her with dogged tenacity.  One she brushed as he past, and it's wings atrophied at her command.  It plummeted to the ground.  Another almost caught her and she twisted away, mangling it's hand as she ripped free.  There were too many of them.  Their strong bat wings buffeted the air, creating turbulance that she could not ride.  She shot up, pressing her little used wings to service.  Desperately she tried to modify them as she flew, make them into something that would set her free.<br>
Suddenly the pressure dropped from under her.  She had overshot the rising currents.  She had been holding too much mass to interact with all the others, and she had misjudged. Her wings lashed out trying to find some purchase on the failing updraft.  They whipped around her tumbling her out of the sky as surely as if her wings were sun melted wax.  <br>
She looked up and watched the stars rush away from her.  The same stars that she and Thomas had counted and wished on years ago.<br>
With a defiant effort she flipped herself, to face the oncoming cloud of Gargoyles.  She met them tooth fist and claw, laughing sadly at the end.  She felt one of her wings wrenched loose, torn meatily from the socket.  With her last bit of strength she flung a message to the wind.  <br>
&quot;Good Bye&quot;<br>
She stopped fighting.<br>
The gargoyle who caught her falling body snapped her neck.  It startled when she still moved anyway, stretching to kiss the beast on it's pebbly cheek.  She knew grace, she had felt true love, she would find Thomas somewhere.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theherald@scbnforum58570>The Herald</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Clan Malkavian</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/25/03 11:03:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Comments..</span><hr size=1> A far more poetic death than inches from a nearby car, neh?<br>
