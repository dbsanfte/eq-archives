India debates Iraq troops request<br>
From Satinder Bindra, CNN New Delhi Bureau Chief<br>
Tuesday, June 17, 2003 Posted: 1451 GMT (10:51 PM HKT)<br>
<br>
<br>
  <br>
The troop request has received a mixed response among politicians. <br>
<br>
 <br>
NEW DELHI (CNN) -- The Indian government is considering a request from the United States to send more than 15,000 troops to Iraq to serve as a stabilization force, senior Indian officials have told CNN. <br>
<br>
A Pentagon team, led by Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Rodman, visited New Delhi Monday to clarify issues about troop deployment. <br>
<br>
The request has received a mixed reception among politicians. <br>
<br>
&quot;They're asking us now to become sitting ducks for Iraqi snipers in a war that was not of our making and in a war which does not serve any particular Indian interest,&quot; said Mani Shankar Aiyar, an Indian opposition politician. <br>
<br>
Many in India opposed the U.S.-led war in Iraq. There were several protests and the country's parliament even passed a resolution criticizing U.S. actions. <br>
<br>
But senior members of the Indian government are favorably inclined toward the U.S. proposal, and several analysts believe New Delhi could use its participation as a way of winning President Bush's assistance leaning on Pakistan to rein in groups that launch terror attacks against India. <br>
<br>
The government is trying to build a consensus among its coalition partners over the proposal. <br>
<br>
To alleviate Indian concerns that their troops would be taking orders from U.S. generals, senior American officials have agreed to let them operate under an Indian flag, and the Indians would not be expected to take part in combat missions, the Indian officials said. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sending Indian troops to Iraq would symbolize not only the growing U.S.-Indian friendship,&quot; said Brahma Chellaney, a political analyst, &quot;more importantly, it will convey to the Bush administration and to the larger American political system that India is an ally of the United States.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Pakistan's information minister, said Pakistan is &quot;concerned&quot; about the possibility of the Indian troop deployment. &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Yeah, THATs a good idea! Lets ask a country that has been having some of the worst religious conflicts in the region to come patrol Iraq. Nah, won't seem like the US  has some sort of agenda against Muslims AT ALL!<br>
<br>
Oh , did anyone hear something about the US considering requesting UN or US troops to be sent to Palestine/Israel?  <br>
<br>
With decisions like these being made, I can see why the younger generation of Bushes are using drugs.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luvthatdyl>LuvThatDyl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 173<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/18/03 11:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=217.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Indian Troops to Iraq? WTF???</span><hr size=1> Gee, think the US might be trying to use India as a pawn in exchange for support against Pakistan?  This scenario just reeks of ulterior motive.  We are going to end up with WWIII here before we know it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh , did anyone hear something about the US considering requesting UN or US troops to be sent to Palestine/Israel?&quot;<br>
<br>
They have been pushing this for years.  It isn't anything new.  The Palestinians don't want troops there that they may see as an Israeli ally.  Israel doesn't want troops there because they said they want to handle the situation themselves, and because they are constantly being told by outsiders to &quot;show restraint&quot; when they are attacked.  To make a long story short, neither side wants outside troop involvement because they don't feel that outsiders have their best interests at heart.  Outsiders are fine as mediators, but that is where both sides draw the line.  I think outside troops may help the situation, but that technically it isn't anyone else's business.  As much as I support Israel, I have to question whether it is right for Americans to be putting their lives on the line for another country.  If outside nations wanted an excuse to send troops to the region, then they had their chances in the past when the PLO started attacking people outside the Middle East that had nothing to do with the situation over there (ie. hijacking of Achilles Lauro, assasination of American ambassador, harboring of European terrorists, etc.), but that ship has sailed, and we currently don't have an excuse to be there.<br>
