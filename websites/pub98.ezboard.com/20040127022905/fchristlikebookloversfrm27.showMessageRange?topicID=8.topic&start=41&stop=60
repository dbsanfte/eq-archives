I think I'm just really, really tired-it's been a somewhat hard week.  I didn't do much today-cleaned, went on the internet.  I wrote a letter to the girl I'll be rooming with when I go to Miami of Ohio for skating camp this summer.  Let's see...I can now successfully work the watch Alanna gave me for my birthday (always a good thing).  I've been listening to my Coyote Ugly soundtrack a lot for some reason-I've gotten sick of every other CD I have, so it's 'The Right Kind of Wrong' over and over-but I do love that song!  Hmm...I finally started reading the Bible I got for graduation last night.  I was going to read this morning when I went downstairs-but I fell asleep for an hour!  I just laid down, and the next thing I knew my sister was stomping down the steps, late for camp.  I've started posting 'Turning Circles', one of the stories I've written that I'm very proud of over at GLO, and it seems to be somewhat well liked.  I'm also writing two Star Wars fanfictions right now, and I've taken a break from my skating ones-they start out with some good ideas, and then somewhere a long the way they turn absolutely disasterous!  Honestly...the final chapters of some of them are the worst pieces of work I've ever done.  My imagination, now that there is more space for it and less for math and science (lol!) has come up with a crazy story.  It explains the kidnappings of Elizabeth Smart, Tionda &amp; Diamond Bradley, and the kidnapping and slaughter of Chandra Levy.  Basically, it's a hidden group of anarchists who are trying secretly to take over the US gov.  Needless to say, I came up with this very late last night...very, very late.  It's crazy, but it just might make a good story...hmm...I'll have to work on that!  Well, I'm off to bed now-6 hours of sleep 4 nights in a row really doesn't sit well with me!<br>

I've started An Acquaintance With Darkness by Ann Rinaldi, and I love it.  For some of her books, I have trouble getting 'into' them from the very beginning, but this one I became attached to very quickly.  It might be because it focuses on the Civil War, which I've studied extensively (for a 14-year old, anyway!  I've taken an advanced class on it, seens movies, read books, done numerous reports on it, even gone to Gettysburg!), so I'm always interested in different points of view.  It also focuses on my favorite part-the assassination of Abe Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth, and him being assissted by Dr. Mudd, thus creating the saying 'Your name is Mud!'<br>

If my computer ever, ever, ever does anything like that ever again, I'm gonna have a heart attack!  *scolds computer*  Anyway, my computer would not turn on today, which is why I'm now on so late in the day.  I was afraid I'd lost absolutely everything, and that is a very scary feeling, especially considering how much time and energy I devote to my stories.  Hmm, what did I do today, beside my heart attack and all that jazz?  Read my Bible and the two Prayers on My Pillow books (I love those!  Absoutely wonderful!) for about an hour and half this morning.  I went to church with my little sister.  I cleaned the last of my room, vacuumed mine and my little brothers room, did the dishes-work!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I also went bathing-suit shopping (can you say depressing?  Ugh!  I hate it!), and went to see a new baby girl-Sarah Regina.  Umm...I panicked?  I really can't get over that!  I did some reading, nothing too thrilling.  And now I have to go to bed, becuase I have ice dance tomorrow morning-buh-bye!<br>

Finished an Acquaintance with Darkness today, and absolutely loved it.  Wonderful book!  I also read a few pages of Second Bend in the River (an Ann Rinaldi I've been looking for for quite a while, and finally found!  Woohoo!), and I'll hopefully be finishing it soon, because I don't want to do any more house work-we're almost done, which is a good thing since we're showing it this weekend!<br>

This morning, I went on the internet and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  finally </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> figured out how to get my Michelle Kwan Fields of Gold music video to work-and oh, did I cry.  The address is <a href=http://www.shanfan.com/nongymn/skating/videos/kwan/kwanvideos.html>here</a> , by the way.  Scroll to the bottom, right click and hit save target as.  So pretty-I've been both listening and watching it all day.  *sniff*  I also watched 2002 Grand Prix Final, and I cried some more when I saw Jamie and David.  You see, lately I've really missed them.  The people-Jamie and David.  Not the media images.  Not the Canadians.  The people who they were before the whole Salt Lake city fiasco.  Before that, even with all the media attention in Canada, even with a world title and thousands of fans, they still stayed Jamie from Red Deer and David from Sayabec.  And when I saw the fluff piece with Lori and them, at the end, Jamie said 'We're still Jamie and David.'  And then, she was right.  I started crying as soon as it started, and cried throughout Love Story.  I cannot even begin to describe what a loss this is for me-for a while, I've noticed things seem different with them.  But watching a video of them just a few months earlier made it so much more evident, so much more real.  For two years, they (and Michelle Kwan, of course, but she's been for 6 years, at least) were my idols.  I loved Jamie and David.  I dug up all sorts of information on them.  Yet, when they wanted a private life, I gave it to them, along with all the fans on the old Jamie and David board.  Now, they no longer demand privacy and respect from their fans.  And That is just a small example-watch the interviews, heck, watch their skating, and you'll notice a difference.  There was a carelessness, a genuine love of what they were doing before the Olympics.  Now it's like they've become media dolls.  All they will ever be connected with outside the skating world is the SLC judging controversy.  And that was a hard realization for me to come to-I loved them, and now the Jamie and David I loved and respected no longer exist, in my mind.  I think I'm going to watch some Michelle (I'm ordering two tapes of her) for a while, and take a short break from Jamie and Dave.  I'm still rather upset about it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/suru.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/suru.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/suru.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Well, I'm sure that didn't matter much to anyone reading this, but it did to be, so I had to get it out.  I had ice dance this morning (I love ice dance, in case you've read through all three pages and still haven't picked it up!  I'm very, very excited!  It's just so much fun!)  Today I also did chores (all I have left is dusting my dresser-yipee!), and typed.  I've got to go get ready for bed, skating tomorrow.<br>

 I want one thing right now-sleep.  Isn't it a wonderful word?  Simply wonderful.  You see, Daddy, I have been so completely busy cleaning the house at my mothers bidding today that I am exhausted.  I've also had an extremely difficult time falling asleep, and as I regularly wake up by five, I'm sure you can imagine how tired I am.  Then again, Daddy, maybe you can't-after all, I don't know who you are.  Why can't you answer any of my questions, Daddy?  Sometimes I think you are an insufferable person to ignore them so often.  Still, I must remember I am here because of you, and be grateful for that.  <br>
At skating today I saw Ryder-and how I have missed her, for we have horribly conflicting schedules, and rarely see each other anymore.  She was there for a one-time only lesson with Henk-and oh, what a good thing it was only that, for I can scarcely abide him.  Nevertheless, I cannot help but be thankful for it, as it was lovely to see her again.  I also spoke with Julia, who was there as well.  We also talked about extracurriculars in our coming four years in school, and are both interested in some things of similar content and some of differing content.  <br>
There is very little else unusual-except I have been informed that, after the move, I might be forced to practice (not lessons, just one or two practices a week) at a rival rink, Robert Crown.  Honestly, Daddy, I don't know how I'll abide it!  For I am forced to go there during the month of August, and I simply cannot stand it.  I was a silly girl, and began to cry, but please do not think too low of me for I could not help it, I was so devastated.  Please, interfere if you can, for I should rather practice not at all than at that dreadful rink.<br>
Now, I know I was informed I was to write you of my studies (books!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :read --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/nsrtrts/nsrtrts_22.gif ALT=":read"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :read2 --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/nsrtrts/nsrtrts_297.gif ALT=":read2"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), so I shall.  Today I read more of Ann Rinaldi's Second Bend in the River, and I cannot help but think the woman is simply a historical literary genius!  Such marvelous books I scarcely read.  And, as I hope you can tell from the context of this letter, I also read a simply bewitching tale called Daddy-Long-Legs by Jean Webster, and it is the most cunning, sweet little thing you've ever read.  I can only hope that someday I'll be able to write half as well.  I do hope I shall make you proud should I ever get a work published.  It is now one of my firm intentions to read her sequel, Dear Enemy.  And now, dear daddy, I must go, for my mother is busy working me to the bone again.<br>
Farewell-parting is such sweet sorrow!<br>
Judy<br>
PS-isn't Shakespeare simply a genius?  I used that parting line from Romeo and Juliet. JA<br>
PS2-this was, of course, really written by Katherine, who is a divine girl, but decided to write it under a pen name of Judy Abott.  Do you suppose I shall have a pen name when I am published?

Gosh, haven't posted in a while because I was on vacation.  I had an amazing time!!!!  I love my grandparents cottage...there's something rather...I don't know...legendary, maybe, about it.  I love it!!!!  We left at 9:45 Thursday night, after my parents finished beautifing the house, since it was going to be shown on Sunday.  They spent a good hour or more just messing with the now-infamous chandleir.  That thing is more trouble than it's worth!  We arrived at two thirty in the morning-yucky.  We immediately went to bed, only I was awoken by a young cousin on the bunk bed above mine at 3:30 who was screaming for me and my sister to get her dad because she'd thrown up.  So I did, then went upstairs and fell asleep in about two seconds-I don't even remember her coming up.  Then I woke up at 5:30 for good-yucky, yucky, yucky!  That was sooooo not enough sleep!  I went outside and read for about two hours until my Aunt Cheryl woke up (us two are the early birds of the family!).  Slowly more people started waking up, and my favorite cousins, Erin, Michelle, and her best friend and my adopted cousin, Judy, got back from the hotel.  We went downtown to shop for a gift for Kris and Carol's wedding showers (Carol got married May 29th, and Kris gets married August 30th).  After we came back up, we went to....CEDAR POINT!!!!!  I love that place to pieces!  So cool!  We went on the Raptor first (only a 15 minute wait, so we ditched the tradition of doing Blue Streak first), then Blue Streak (5 min), then Millenium Force (45 min), then Mean Streak (10 or 15 min), then Gemini (about 2 minutes-and I love that ride!), then Magnum (about 20 min), then Paul, Michelle, Judy, and John went on Power Tower, my dad waited around, and me and Erin went to grab some fries and a shake to eat.  Erin dumped half the shake on her hair, hoodie, and the floor!  Still, we had a good laugh over it, and happily ate the rest.  The fries we stuffed in our mouths quickly, because we saw everyone else coming, and we knew they'd steal it if we didn't finish it.  Then Paul, Michelle, Judy, and John went on Wicked Twister and Erin, my dad, and I, went on Disaster Transport and then the Ferris Wheel.  We got off to discover Paul had finally won Sponge Bob!!!!  We were quite amused by this, but there's more to the story I'll get to later.  After that, Michelle grabbed something to eat, and we watched a bunch of resaurant people dancing to 'RESPECT,' which was great!  Then my dad watched Sponge Bob, Michelle, Erin, and I went on Millenium Force again (let me tell you, it's ten times better at night!), and Paul, John, and Judy went on the Raptor again.  While we were walking out to our car, a girl we ran into wanted to buy Sponge Bob from Paul.  It was a good five minute long conversation.  They started offering at $15, and finally went up to 20, 25, then, finally, 30.  And Paul sold it!  It was hysterical.  Lucky for us, we had a picture to prove he got it.  We stopped at Burger King on the way home, and got in at 2 again!  Everyone else just collapsed on the floor, and I snuck into my parents room, since there's really space for five people in there.  The next morning I was up at 6:30 (so almost five hours of sleep that night!), and my Aunt Mimi had come and had been there for about a half hour-that's the only time I lost my first person up title!  I went to her hotel room to take a shower, and we spent the rest of the day down by the lake.  At night, they had a bonfire, but I didn't participate, because I was completly wiped out and extremely depressed, because I'd spent the entire day looking at picture-perfect, thin girls (aka my cousins) and dumpy ol' me.  To console myself, I read From the Secret Place in my Heart, told my Uncle all about Robin, and happily went to sleep. <br>
I was first up the next morning, too, and went to the early mass, which was pretty good.  Actually, lately I've been thinking a lot about churches.  In some ways, I don't after all feel that St. Gregory's is the best for me, perhaps just better than St. Gertrude's.  And all in all, I'm having some doubts with the Catholic Church-not because of the priest's scandal, but because of the issue of Papal infallibility.  I simply cannot believe that a man who will not let women or married men preach is infallible.  Anyhoo, a bunch of people started to leave, and Michelle, Judy, and I went down to the beach again, where Shelle did my hair in a really cool way, and I got a lovely sunburn.  We got back around 8, and I very quickly went to bed since I had ice dance the next (yesterday) morning.<br>
Ice dance was fun...but I stunk!  I caught a cold (thus explaining my sore throat), and could hardly move my back.  I simply couldn't get the timing to anything to work!  Yucky yucky yucky!  I waited around for an hour while my annoying parents were late, and then went home to catch up on GLO!  I had my last Skates practice this morning, since I leave for Miami of Ohio on Friday.  I hope they have internet access, but I'm not sure.  Well, that's about it!<br>

Well, I've been re-reading just about every Christy and Sierra book, because I went on a massive library spree, and found most.  I also re-read Betsy and Joe and Betsy's Wedding, and read a junkie book on the TV series Felicity and one called Dancer, which I liked.  That's it!<br>

We leave for Alaska today, and they're going to show the house while we're gone, so it has to be perfect.  I'm actually supposed to be changing to go work out now, so I'll try to post later either here or in Alaska.  I've been reading some lately-I'm working on a Gathering of Old Men, which I'm reading for school, which is by the author of Miss Jane Pittman, which I couldn't abide!  Long sentance there!  Really though, I had an idea on two stories a few days ago, so I'm living in those more than books.<br>

Well, school starts in two and a half weeks-but for my brother and sister, and a bunch of other people I knew from school (because they're going to Catholic Schools) it starts on Thursday-that's so close!  Well, the one thing I am looking forward to is Back to School shopping-not clothes, although I do like that-but supplies.  I love getting notebooks and binders, and all that fun stuff.  I'm working on my mom to let me get a new backpack-the current one I have is a rollie, which I like (doesn't break my back) but it just doesn't hold enough books, and in HS, I'm going to have bigger and more books than this year.  I have Registration this Wednesday, the 21st, and I get my schedule then.  The thing I'm most worried about is finding my classes-Whitney Young is huge!  Three buildings-academic/main, arts/computers, and gym.  All of them have at least 3 stories.  Gah!  I'm used to a two story tiny building where only the top story was used, and there were only three classes per grade, tops.  It's going to be a major change, and I'm scared out of my mind.  Today I'm feeling sick-I think I might be over tired, and my little brother had the stomach flu a couple of days ago, so I may have a little of that.  I never throw up though-I just get kind of queasy.  I'm also really, really cold-never mind it's about 75 degrees out.  I was going to work out today, but, obviously, what with me being sick and all, that won't be happening.  My cousin Ben, from Alaska is here, to help us move...which will be about the second week of Sept, but he's helping with some stuff.  Well, that's about it for now, but I'll be back (hopefully) with more, and I'll try to post more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/ukatey14abc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>katey14abc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>For a custom title, let Amber know. ;)<BR><b>Mod of Teens</b></span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#3333ff>(8/21/02 4:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Katherine's journal!</span><hr size=1> Oi vey...I'm scared...seriously scared...I'm busy getting a heavy dose of reality.  I don't want to start school!  I got my schedule today-I'm made, I don't start until 8:55, which means I don't get out until 3:20.  Personally, I do best starting around 8, and getting out by two thirty.  If I started one period earlier, that's pretty much what I'd have.  But I'm terrified.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, temporarily better.  Edna had orientation today, and just about everyone on planet earth starts school tomorrow-Gordon Tech started today.  Maricris and some other very irritating girls from school prank-called me, and I hung up on them-they're really quite desprate to go back to school, they've got nothing better to do.  I think I'm going to go visit the NCA with Margaret Smith (who is a year older than me and also goes to Whitney Young) sometime before we start school.  I want to see Mrs. Grant and Mrs. Holley, if no one else-I think Margaret and I will happily pass up Mr. Wirtz's class-we both had him for homeroom, and we both couldn't stand him.  It'll be funny though, and will no doubt make me extremely grateful.  I read A Rose for Melinda today, and loved it-gotta run now.  More later.<br>

I'm on a Spanich kick again-it started at camp, died out, and is now going strong again!  I'm sooooo tired.  Falling asleep at the keyboard, practically.  I'm trying to get a journal at livejournal.com, but I don't think it'll work.  And anyway-I've got this one!  I'm listening to the Ice Castles CD I got at camp-very pretty!  Now I'll be waltzing around singing 'Through the Eyes of Love' for quite a while.  Anna has already started school (wait...did I already say that?), so I'm scared out of my mind.  I know I already said that!  I'm so nervous, though!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  *runs away screaming*  Okay, all better!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Guess what next weekend is?  Well, since no one's reading this, I'll tell you-Kris's wedding!  Finally!  I'm so excited-only not everyone will be there.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/suru.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    My Aunt Sharon found out she has breast cancer, so it doesn't look like she or her husband and children will be coming.  I'm disappointed, but I hope she's doing okay.  Still, everyone else will be there, and we're going to have fuuuuunnnnn!  The hotel won't know what hit them.  *giggle*  Michelle, Judy, Erin and I will not be getting a lot of sleep...unless they decide to be responsible and do homework-normally I'd be the responsible one, but seeing as so long as I finish my mythology book, I won't have any homework, that won't be in the way.  However, they all have already started school-Chicago Public Schools start really late.  Actually, though-Judy goes to public school in Toledo, so she might be in the same boat as me.  I'm also suffering from acute skating withdrawal!  I've been sick all week-yuck, which means I haven't skated since I tested my juvs August 4th-the rink closed, then I went to Alaska, then I got sick, so I never got a chance to go to Robert Crown-not that I want to, I just want something they have that I don't-ICE!  I'm feeling very fat, too, which is surprising because I've hardly eaten anything lately.  I had pancakes this morning, two cookies (I'm going to kill my dad for buying them!), and cucumbers.  I really haven't been hungry.  I don't have much going on for a while-I babysit Tuesday night, but only because I need the mulah-I have got to find another job!  Or Solveig needs to come back from vacation-the little girl is such a sweetheart!  I love baby-sitting her!  Everyone else I baby-sit is a boy-which is because I meet them all though my dear baby brother.  Anyway, i need to find something to do as a means of provision that doesn't not involve little children unless they're sweet, innocent, blonde little girls named Solvieg!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Like I said, I haven't been doing much lately, and I don't feel up to doing much.  I'm very proud of myself, though, because I finished on of the books I'm reading for school-yay me!  I hated it-but I did finish it!  Okay, this is just a long boring ramble about irrelevant things, so I think I'll stop now.  I'll try to start writing more again soon!<br>

Like I said, I read A Gathering of Old Men for school-hated it, but finally finished it!  Yay me!<br>

I hope that works!  I got David-yay me!I was reading this RPG thing on skaters on livejournal.com-it's, well, interesting.  I'm still busy decided what I think about it-let me get back to you on it.  I'm listening to my Coyote Ugly soundtrack-I never saw the movie, and I know very little of what it's about, but I love the music!  Irma got me hooked on it at skating...speaking of which...I want to skate!  Gah!  Katherine is dying of skating withdrawal!  Someone take me skating!  I went to the doctor today because my mom was still worried about me, but the very nice doctor didn't think I needed a blood test-thank goodness!!!  I just about died of thankfulness when the doctor said that!  My mom is irritated with me because I turned down that baby-sitting job-I changed my mind about it, and I couldn't reach them about the time.  I want to skate!  I'm just getting crankier each second I don't skate.  Why, oh why, can't I have a skating rink in my back yard?  Hmph.  No, I didn't want to answer that-it was a rhetorical question.  I also went to the dentist today, and my teeth are still perfect-yay Katey!  I've never had any problems with my teeth, for some reason.  I consider myself very lucky!  Oh yeah, and at the doctor's office I discovered I dropped 5 pounds!  Huge yes!!!!!!!!!  lol-lots of exclamation points in here.  I'm really excited about that, though.  On Wednesday I'm going shopping for a dress for the wedding.  We might also go school shopping.  And with any luck, we'll work out.  I'm watching Henry all day tomorrow-yuck.  The media is my friend!  However, he starts on Wed., so there won't be any more of these all day sitting jobs.  My parents owe me over 50 dollars-woohoo!  It is all greatly appreciated!  Still, if I have to pay for dance with Lizzie ( <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :crush --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/love/loveya.gif ALT=":crush"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      at the thought of a certain little brother of hers!), I need every penny and more.  I'm going to have to pay her back a little, though, for a CD and stuff I bought up there.  I talked to Kate Marino today-she just got back from Europe-lucky chicken!  She gave me some good advice about high school-said you have to decide to have fun and make friends, so I'll do my best.  My mom was over at the new house today painting my new room!  I can't wait until we move-I want my own room!  I've been doing a lot of the surveys I found on live journal to put in scrapbooks which I will make...when I get around to it.  I was going to this summer, but I had to help with the move and stuff a ton, so that didn't happen.  I think they're fun, though!  I'm really glad I'm not in school right now-Anna's complaining non-stop.  I'm also glad I didn't get Ms. Reed when I was in 5th grade, but don't tell her that-I've been telling her she's perfectly nice as to lessen any panicing (which is already occuring).  I want to skate!  lol-I'm not too creative today, am I?  Well, I'm off to go start my mythology book for school!  Au Revior!<br>

Umm...well...ya see...I kind of didn't-WAIT!  I did!  I read The Girl With the Pearl Earring while I was in the waiting room today.  It's a good book, but I'm just getting started in it, so I don't know a ton.<br>

Took another quiz-Me Moonlight sonata!  yay!  Fumie had a gorgeous long to it, and so did Gordeeva and Grinkov.  I get to skate today!!!!! Yes!  Thank goodness!  But it's at Robert Crown, of course-poopie darn.  I hate that place so much!  It's just yuck!  Still, it's skating, something I really want to do.  They did this body composition test thing on me today when I went to the nutritionist-it looked like they were electrocuting me!  It was freaky, but kind of funny.  I also weighed myself, and I have kept off the 5 pounds, yay!  My mom is over at the new house right now putting the primer on my room-yay!  I can't wait to move.  I'm listening to Michelle Branch right now-I love her CD-but I think I'm going to change it because I've been listening to it all day.  I really want the Avril Lavigne CD.  Next time I splurge (which probably won't be for a while, I'm too responsible), I'll buy it.  Okie, now I have Center Stage in.  Oh yeah-NOBODY LOVES ME!!!  Okay, so maybe some people love me, but no one with a livejournal!  I e-mail people I know who have them, but I don't get any e-mails back, and I really want one!  *pout*  I'd still post here, but it'd just be nice to have one.  I'm busy feeling dejected.  If anybody with a livejournal and codes is reading this, feel free to e-mail me at katey14abc@yahoo.com with codes.  I'm so tired right now.  I'm going shopping for a dress for the wedding tonight, hopefully I'll find a nice one.  And the lost 5 pounds can't hurt.  Henry started school today-so it's nice and quiet at home.  And we're dancing-lol, I'm listening to that song and I love it!  I wish ballet would start again.  Nothing is going on tomorrow, really-my mom works, so I get the house to myself for most of the day-although my dad goes in late.  I'm still obsessed with Shae and Vic-in fact, I think I'm gonna go fast forward through some annoying pairs scandal stuff (I want to commentate on figure skating!  Everyone else stinks!) to go watch them at the Olympics.  This was a rather boring update-but C'est la vie.<br>

My.  Gosh.  Owww!  I am in great and unbearable pain.  Owwww!  I am so sore from skating-it really hurts!  You see, I had absolutely no outside edge whatsoever.  However, this was a very painful discovery.  I was slipping a little on the back three-turn of my double three's, but I figured I was swinging my leg too much.  Well, my blade finally got tired of just letting me lose my balance, so it completely slipped out from under me, making for a very painful and rather humiliating fall-people do not typically fall on double threes, especially outside ones.  I wondered again if I was swinging too much, so I kept going-well, after another recurrance, I decided that my edge was completely gone, which was proved time and time again to me.  I couldn't hold the edges on my cross strokes, either, and I can't count how many times I lost balance.  I also had trouble with the ice-I always think I'll be fine with it, but every year, it never fails to throw me.  Robert Crown, has, without a doubt, the hardest ice I've ever skated on.  I went from ice I absolutely loved (Miami of Ohio Ice, which is perfect!) to ice that I liked (McFetridge, which is softer, but I still like it.) to ice that I can't stand (Robert Crown, which is sooooo hard!).  If I ever skated there constantly, I'd need my skates sharpened every two weeks!  Anyway, I was also working on-or rather, attempting to work on-my axel.  You see, it's very difficult to actually work on a jump if your take-off edge slides so much you can't really jump-darn dull edges!  But I'm so sore from those two falls, and my hips are sore too, because I also have a wider stance on harder ice for some reason-don't ask me to explain why, I'm not sure of it myself.  I kept on stepping out early from jumps, my weight was outside the surface.  I don't know why that was happening, it could have been because I was tense (I hate that rink!)  or it could've been because of the ice, or my skates...who knows?  I'm still livejournalless-hmph!  Poopie darn.  I was too tired yesterday to e-mail anyone, but I think today I'll e-mail Mel, and pray she has some codes.  Mel, please have some codes!  This thing is really irritating me.  Anyway, I still haven't decided what I think of the journals on livejournal.com-they're not illegal, like fanfiction, but I can't figure out whether or not they're moral.  Anyway, I kinda like to read 'em-but I'm still not sure.  Oh-to add to my list of complaints, my ankle bones are absolutely killing me!  I don't know how I'm going to walk downstairs, much less to Clark street!  We're showing the house at 3:30 or 4, and so not only is all the last minute cleaning being left up to me *glares at evil, lazy family*, but I also have to find some place to entertain myself for an hour.  So anyway, I think I'm going to Clark to stop at a bookstore, and try and find a CD place so I can get the new Avril Lavigne CD, which I really want.  I've been singing it non-stop for days!  Today I went searching on the internet for clips and videos, so I've heard a lot of Avril and Michelle Branch.  I was also blaring my radio so I could hear it in my parents bedroom (where the computer is).  Much to my delight, I heard At The Begining or whatever it's called from Anastasia-that's another soundtrack I want!  I wouldn't mind quite a few others, but we'll get to that once I get some more mulah!  Emily and Angel were both at Robert Crown for the session with me yesterday-Angel's almost got her double loop!  It's very close.  And Emily has a new program to East of Eden-I had to laugh.  That is very quickly becoming overused music in the skating world.  I guess when something's a hit (Like Michelle's version of EoE!), coaches latch on to it.  Another girl yesterday was skating to Austin Powers, which my group (Angelfish) did at synchro camp.  It was very irritating-bad memories.  Also, I'm there trying to do my axel and I hear the music, and I automatically start counting it out.  My mom and I went shopping yesterday, and after looking in Penney's, Kohl's, Target, and some other store I forgot the name of, we finally found a really nice dress at Sears'.  I love it!  And it looks nice on me, too.  I also found an Art Box, which is a store with the cutest little binder stuff that I absolutely loved a couple years back.  The thing is, I hardly used the stuff, so I think I will in HS, and the scheduling stuff will definitely help.  I've got two of 'em, and I love 'em both!  We drove by Notre Dame for Boys HS, and I saw a bunch of football players out.  I laughed-I couldn't help it.  I had no doubt that at least one or two of them were my old class mates, and I discovered I no longer hate them-I pity them.  True, all but a couple made my life miserable-heck, they made it worse than that, but I'll try to keep it G-rated-but I just don't care anymore.  Other than Edna, Julie, Cassie, Laura, and Nancy, I haven't talked to a soul from school all summer long-and Nancy and Cassie I only talked to in the middle of June, Julie in the middle of July, and I talked to Laura because I was forced to-so Edna's the only one I've talked to recently by choice.  I just don't care about it.  I've moved on.  I'm going to a new school (ack!  Don't remind me about school starting!), and the odds are most of these people I'll never see again.  True, Colin's got a few friends at WY, so I might run into him, but that's honestly the only relation I can find.  Eh-maybe we'll play them in a game or something, but who knows.  I should go clean now, so I'll post more tomorrow before we leave for Cinci!<br>

It was great!  My cousin Paul fell for this girl he met, Kelly-it was very cute.  Michelle flirted with a guy named Chris, I had my hair up and looked very nice, I think.  I finally figured out who Troy reminded me of-Colin!  Now that I realize it, the resemblance is quite striking.  Overall, it was an awesome end to the summer.  And now for some truly awful news-I'm tempted to start bawling, but I've always been one to hold my feelings in.  Charlie moved.  And not just a couple of miles away-to Texas.  It's so ironic I'm almost ready to laugh-but it's very black humor.  Texas-the one place I never had the urge to go to.  And now, the one guy I really, really got attached to, is there.  Lizzie told Ryder, who I talked to today.  She told me nicely, I must admit.  And she was sympathetic.  We decided Liz gets to tell Alana-Alana was always more open about liking him, I only have a couple people who knew, and they know I keep things in.  Alana's going to go berserk-I'll just stay silent and stoic.  And lonely.  So lonely.  I suddenly have the urge to go *poof* and just disappear.  I was thinking on the way back from Cinci how lonely I was, and it just got a lot worse.  I have to go now-I've got stuff to get ready for school, and I should get to bed.  Now I really know what they mean by 'They wouldn't call it a crush if it wasn't supposed to hurt.'<br>
Books-not much, really.  I'll get back to you when I'm feeling more motivated.  feeling awfully listless right now.<br>

I think it's going well, but I'm still kind of unsure.  Quite honestly, I just don't think my personality was made for regular school-it just wasn't.  I'm the type of person who works better independantly, or one on one.  A few of the kids at school are nice-I've been hanging out with Karen, Sharon, Sandi, and Antonio.  However, Sharon is getting a little to preppy and involved for my taste.  I also see Trica, my locker partner, and her friend, Keziah a lot.  I'm still kind of lonesome-skating's okay, but I just don't have any kindred spirit's, so to speak.  I've been writing in journals a lot-I use my really thin one, which will run out very soon, because I can carry it with me a lot of the time.  I've been doing a lot of writing, too.  I read when I can, but time is not something I have a lot of-I should really be doing an Algebra worksheet right now, but I'm not too motivated.  I finished my Biology, French, and English already-yay me!  I have to go to ice dance tonight, and I'm glad.  Yesterday I went into the coaches room to get my CD from Jenny's bag, and I looked up, and saw hair and heard breathing.  I nearly had a heart attack-it turned out to be Liz, sound asleep on the couch.  Lucky for her, I recognized her, and didn't scream.  Just sort of a random, funny thing.  Also tonight I have my first partnering lesson with Paul *gulp*  I'm nervous, since I'm always nervous about everything.  On Tuesday in school, we take the Explore's, which I did really well on-they were the ones I took to apply to St. Ignatius.  Hopefully I'll do just as well this time.  After that, we have a shortened schedule-25 minute periods each of 4, 5, 6, and 7th.  Since I have lunch 7th, though, I get to leave right lunch-yipee!  So I get out at two.  Karen and Sandy want to go to Chinatown, but I'm just going to catch the bus, and catch the 2:35 metra home, and make it home around three.  I'm sort of unsure about this whole high school thing-it's just not something I love.  I'm so much more of a solitary person-I don't like socializing.  I guess, though, that I'm happier than I was last year.  Just the same, I feel like I'm in a dreamworld or something (I just read dreamland, by Sarah Dessen).  I'm floating through life, doing things, but not really having strong emotions, or convictions.  Just doing homework, chores, reading, writing-I don't have my heart in anything.  Skating, sometimes my head will clear, and I'll be able to concentrate more-for some reason ice dance especially does that.  Sometimes for freestyle, too, but not always.  It's like I'm inside some bubble, some sheild that's keeping me from pain, but keeping me from feelings.  I should go now-Algebra, like I said.  I'll try to update more in here, but no garantees.<br>

I read Dreamland, by Sarah Dessen last week, and I liked it-not exactly the moral standards I have, but a good book.  Other than that, it's been the Christy and Todd Series (believe, nothing can cheer me up more than those), and The Odessey.<br>

Haven't written in here for a while.  I guess that's what having a LJ can do to you.  But the odds of someone I know finding this is much lower than the odds of them finding my LJ.  ANd that's how I want it to be, because I think that should be a way of updating people.  Unfortunately, Laura has spoiled that idea, and now I have to be a little more careful of what I do.  She made me mad, though-she was gossiping about it to Anna and Mary.  Newsflash, this is our business.  I could care less what she thinks or tells her new friends about me.  I know she can't stand me, why exactly, I'm not sure.  She attributes it to the fact I was mad she got into NCP.  Hi, but we weren't getting along before that, no matter how much she wants to deny it.  My thoughts are just that I grew up.  It started in 6th grade, my first year on a synchro team, and I really got close to all my skating friends.  I realized that, good Lord, there was a world outside school.  Honestly, I see a lot of kids realize that.  Stephen did just before 7th grade, Peggy even did a little in 8th.  Julie still hasn't figured it out, but Edna's got a good idea of it.  So I had my new friends, I wasn't relying solely on her.  7th grade it got bigger, and 8th grade even bigger.  I was growing up.  I knew there was more for me than NCA.  She still held tight to everything we had.  And she resented me for letting go of it.  And that doesn't bother me.  She can feel whatever she wants about me.  What does bother me is that she goes around spewing things to my sister, knowing it would come back to me.  And Mary and Anna are convinced they won't be friends anymore, just like Laura and I aren't.  I wish she'd just leave them alone.  If she's got a problem with me, tell me.  I don't care what she tells me.  But tell me to my face, don't let it come in a round about way.  It's dishonest, immature, and a low attempt at revenge.  I couldn't be happier to be at a different school than her, I don't think I could put up with her juvenile, immature attitude much longer.  What sucks, though, is that I can't get her out of my life completely.  She needs to get a life.  Badly.  And I'm pretty pissed right now, which is why I'm not posting this in my LJ.<br>
<br>
I think this will end up being my online journal when I need a rant desprately.<br>
<br>
Books-I'm reading Of Mice and Men for school.  It's okay.  But they talked about a mouse.  And mice scare me.<br>
