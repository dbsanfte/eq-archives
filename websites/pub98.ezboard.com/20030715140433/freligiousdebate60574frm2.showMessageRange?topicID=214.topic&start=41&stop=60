Anyway.  First let's examine DBC's comment.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>yet you insist people cannot hold different views on what a xian is from you. How egotistical.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  *cough*Hypocrite*cough*  You seem to have made your own definition of what a god is and insist that anything that does not follow your definition of god is therefore not a god.  <br>
<br>
Now as far as the whole double bell curve, just as your comments(and ST's comments) were based on the demographics in your area, mine were based on the demographics in my area.  <br>
<br>
Next to DL's post.<br>
Wisdom and knowledge are not mutually exclusive.  However, I do not consider the knowledge of how many ridges appear on the edge of a quarter to be wisdom.  Oh, and I forgot something else that I've gained through my exposure to the coven is a greater knowledge of what most refer to as 'kitchen magick'.  For those who don't know, kitchen magick is using mixtures of herbs to help alleviate problems.  One of the mixtures that I'm good at is a potion to help overcome insomnia.  A few drops of lavender, clary sage and neroli oils are placed on a folded facecloth.  The facecloth is then placed upon the forehead of the person who is suffering from insomnia.  This mixture puts me to sleep in minutes, whereas without it I can often lie in bed for hours before falling asleep.<br>

ST.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If, as Phoenix seems to be saying, his coven worships nature in a manner that attributes supernatural powers to it, then we're not talking just nature worship here--we're talking polytheistsic anthropomorphism.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We have groups of like minded believers who gather at regular intervals to worship the deitites.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'm sorry for leaving it up to misinterpretation.  When I said, &quot;we&quot; I meant many wiccan covens.  My coven does get together, and on sabbats we do celebrate, but this coven doesn't attribute supernatural powers to nature.  No consciousness, no special powers other than what is naturally there.  <br>

Frey, yes there are branches of wicca that believe in a goddess who is not at all outside the realm of nature.  <br>

I find it amusing of all the challenges I lay before you that you do not answer a single one but rather tritely quibble over the meaning of a word.  I have not made ‘my own definition of a god’ I cut and pasted it directly from the Websters page.  I did not cut out parts and reduce it as you did to fit my argument.  I used the whole enchilada.  Furthermore, it is the one used most commonly by atheists in this forum, as evidenced by the general agreement from some, and lack of challenge by others.  You challenge atheists to explain themselves, and I did.  You cannot countenance letting go of your preconceived prejudices, so naturally it must be we who are in error.  Your egotism continues to shine forth.<br>

My comments are not based on the demographics of my area.  I never said they were.  I have traveled quite a bit in my life and been to many areas beyond just this one.  Furthermore, the same view is espoused in any introductory sociology, psychology, anthropology and even some history courses.  Books like “Why we believe weird things” and “Exploring theology” also carry similar analysis, albeit more robustly expounded upon than here.<br>

<br>
Mixtures of herbs to alleviate problems….interesting.  Vague, and interesting.  The example cited is insomnia, so I tend to interpret this to mean we have a doctor here who brews his own medicines and calls it magic.  Most would call it pharmaceutical science, but hey, I have already been accused of being a definition nazi, so who am I to rule on this.  Of course, ‘problems’ is a word with many meanings.  If you can brew a potion that will get you out of debt or make it stop raining, those would be alleviating problems and more in keeping with ‘magic’ IMHO.  The question then becomes, do you believe that you can do those things and are just avoiding mentioning it to save credibility here?<br>

Here I think we see some of the mask in your inability to communicate well with some here.  You have already said before that what is considered supernatural to many of us here is to you only natural.  You say, “no special powers other than what is naturally there” and we could come away thinking “no powers” but in essence I get the impression that you think there are things there Stacey or I would call “supernatural” and you are just refusing to call it that.  You brew magic herb potions, I would call that attributing supernatural powers to it if you think it has some magical properties other than the simple ordinary science of pharmacokinetics.  If you DO think it is plain old ordinary pharmacokinetics, then you haven’t really stopped being an atheist, you are just following the holidays of wicca for the enjoyment of it.<br>

Some people’s definition eh?  What about yours?  Some of my friends are culturally jewish.  They do not believe in the teachings of the religion, but they were raised in the culture.  Consequently, they think of themselves as ‘jewish’ but are atheists in practical application.  I have some friends that were raised hindu, and are raising their kids in the same tradition, but do not actually believe in the gods as entities.  They are culturally hindu, but atheists in practical application.  Do you believe in a God and Goddess and the magical powers of your kitchen concoctions and are therefore a Wiccan, or are you wiccan-lite, and just enjoy the party so go through the motions while secretly harboring evil atheist conspiracy thoughts?<br>

Phoenix we are all influenced and react to the people and events in our lives, but this has nothing to do with the definitions of the terms theist and atheist. I'm not sure what your demographic is, but certainly the laws of physics exist there just as they do for DBC and myself (each of us at different ends of the country I might add). <br>
<br>

Good, because everyone is either one or the other. One may say god is unknowable or whether there is a god is unknowable, but then this person has no faith or belief in god and so is really an atheist, albeit a weak/negative atheist or atheistic agnostic. I'm tempted to quote &quot;The Case Against God&quot; here but it should be simple enough to understand just as the term supernatural as defined by Merriam Webster should be easily enough understood.<br>

More vague and nebulous talk. Phoenix I really don't buy that you are being controlled by the people around you to this degree and are forced to use the term theist by a bunch of maloprop-driven co-workers, social buddies and others in your &quot;demographic&quot;. An atheist in Boston is an atheist in Phoenix (the city) is an atheist in Seattle. Pick a theory, take a stand and stick to it. <br>
<br>
To be clear then--you do NOT believe in anything supernatural, do NOT worship a deity, do NOT believe prayers, magic (with or without the K), incantations or herbs will cause reactions that cannot be explained with science or defy the laws of physics right? If this is the case, you are a cultural pagan or Wiccan, but not a theist.<br>

Oh, and just because lots of people here agree with your hashed up version of the definition of god doesn't mean that it is the true definition of god.  If I were to go to a country that never heard of apples, brought a case of them, and told the local inhabitants that they were called bananas, then they would accept that these things were called bananas.  It doesn't fit in the definition of what a banana is, but all those people think that they are bananas so it must be true, right?  NO.<br>
<br>
But enough of that.  <br>
<br>
I find it amusing that you cannot let go of your preconceived ideas about religion and religious terms.  First of all, let's go over some terms.  These are the definitions as used by much of the wiccan community.<br>
Magic is the practice of slight of hand often used by stage performers from Harry Houdini to Sigfreid and Roy.<br>
Magick is the use of ancient knowledge to aid in the improvement of one's life.  Magick has three sub-divisions.  High magick is the practice of invoking spirits as a means of achieving some ends.  Obviously high magick uses the supernatural.  Low magick is the manipulation of energy fields to achieve some change in the surrounding environment.  This may include anything from trying to change someone's luck by holding a stone which vibrates at a different frequency than the person does, to an old fashioned rain dance.  Some parts of low magick require the supernatural.  Kitchen magick is the use of herbs, oils and spices to effect change in the physical body of an individual.  This practice later coined the term 'pharmacology.  However, as society advances more towards 'modern medicine' the wiccan with his/her kitchen magick chooses to continue using all natural ingredients believing them to be more potent.(and usually being right)<br>
Oh and so that you aren't wondering, here's the dictionary.com definition.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>An action or effort undertaken because of a personal need to effect change, especially as associated with Wicca or Wiccan beliefs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Source: The American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition<br>

Neither.  Both.  I am a non-theist(not an atheist) who's beliefs happen to fall within the confines of a branch of wicca.  Maybe before you continue this, you should read about the various branches of wicca.  Otherwise you will just keep making no sense.  There are branches of wicca that don't believe in the deities.  Most wiccans acknowledge that magick does not need include the supernatural.<br>
<br>
Oh, and DL,<br>
I don't hold atheism responsible for what occurred when I was atheist.  It was a result of the mixture of atheism and my own personality.  I also didn't mean to say that all the knowledge that I sought was equally trivial, it's just that through my connections with the coven my learning became more focused. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 299<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/22/03 4:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What do you call that big river in egypt?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Related to the first and last three parts of the definition as given by websters.

Parts of that definition are at odds with other parts, contextually explaining them would be necessary.  Worshiping a rock as though it were god, does not make it a god.  Thinking of yourself as Napoleon does not make you a deceased emperor.  I do not understand why this is so difficult for you to follow.  I did not reduce the definition, I explained it.  Your argument about &quot;the true definition of god&quot; doesn't hold water either.  Language as a means of communication needs to have agreed upon terms between the people communicating.  I could wink at Stacey and say we have another Dag on our hands and it would hold meaning for her and I have communicated.  If it holds no meaning to you, then you and I have not communicated.  Meanings are not absolute, they are negotiable.  They carry substance for the context in which they are used.  In the country to which you have brought your crate of apples, if one person there asked for a banana and another person handed them an apple and they both understood that it was the same thing to them, then it works.  If you doubt this then goto the UK and ask a bartender to turn on the football game.  The same is true for your 'going to the source' to get the definition of a xian.  WTF?!?  A single priest now speaks with authority for all of xiandom?  Are you nuts?  Half of the xians in the world don't recognize the other half as xians, how the hell do you expect any kind of consistancy?  There are KKK xians, and baptists, snake handlers, methodists, catholics and hordes of others.  Go to the religious side of this board and see how many xians are accusing others of not being xians or not really being saved.  How simplistic a rationalization.  Perhaps if you were engaging that priest on this board, you would have made an inroad to communication by agreeing upon a term. Unfortunately, that priest isn't here, so you really just wasted the time.<br>

Now we are getting a bit clearer.  Magic, magick, magique, yes, it all makes sense now.  You are trying to avoid the cognitive dissonance of your belief system and justify it with rationalizations.  Come along boy, dive right in and just say &quot;I believe in the supernatural!&quot;  Lots of people get tarrot readings and watch <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Crossing Over</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->! Don't dress it up with a giant tarp over the 'super' part and act like it isn't there.  Dont put a bag over your unicorn's horn and tell your friends it is a horse or a blanket over the wings of your pegasus.  These vibrating rocks you carry, or your dance to invoke rain, they are supernatural.  Eschewing the scientific method for your kitchen magick is just ignoring what 'modern medicine' has to offer over the anecdotal, approximated, lucky-guesses of your folk-lore remedies.  You may as well be using naturopathy.<br>
<br>
To be clear.  I am an atheist.  I presume to speak for me.  I do not believe in the supernatural.  I do not believe in gods, or fairies, or vibrating rocks.  If you want to belly up to the bar and say atheists are wrong because their definition of god is too narrow, expect me to tell you that your definition of god is over-broad.  I do not see that a Manwhani worshiping the sacred chicken and calling it god makes that thing a god.  It only makes that thing a chicken with a worshipper.  I comfortably say there are no gods, and if you want to prove me wrong, just roll one out for me to see and I will humbly admit my error. If all you trot out however is a chicken, I will nod sagaciously and quiety move to a safe distance from the dreranged psychopath.<br>

It's getting really boring and I'm having a hard time trying to think of new ways to explain this to you.  I'll just summarize what I've said.  If you use the definitions that you adhere to, then as Stacey realized, I would be considered a cultural wiccan and an atheist.  I you were to use the actual english definition, then I am a cultural wiccan and a non-theist.  The actual english definition requires disbelief to be an atheist, and since I neither believe nor disbelieve, I do not qualify as either atheist or theist.   <br>
<br>
And just to let you know, I am a big fan of naturopathy or holistic medicine.  It is generaly much better than all of the drugs that modern medicine gives out.  It is much better to improve the immune system rather than to simply take away the symptoms until the body can react.  By strengthening the immune system, you help reduce the time it takes for your body to react the next time, even if it's a different pathogen and is not simply taken out by the remanant WBCs in your blood system.  Also, your body seems to adapt slower to natural medicine.  Someone I know had been taking drugs for her insomnia for some time.  After a couple months she was so dependant on the drug that with it she has as much trouble sleeping as she did before she started using the drug, without it she almost could not get any sleep.  Over the past year, my natural medicine has helped her break her dependance upon the drug, and she gets a better sleep than she has in years.  I've used that mixture mentioned earlier for a couple years and I still haven't adapted to it.  Just in case you're thinking that maybe I just adapt very slowly, I don't.  My body has adapted to some drugs in as few as three days.<br>
<br>
And Stacey, as far as the laws of physics, the jury's still out on that one.  I'm currently trying to understand how my friend's trick works.  What he does is he has someone take a simple coin out of their pocket and place it in their palm.  He then proceeds to stare at it and after about twenty seconds the coin seems to levitate out of the person's hand, hover at about a foot over the person's hand, and slowly begin to increase it's angular velocity.  I'm pretty sure that it's not a trick coin since one time he asked me to be the one to pull a coin out of my pocket.  Currently the two leading theories that have been presented to me are: 1)Telekinetic ability, and 2)A magnetic field generator that is capable of generating a field that is so powerful, yet so precise that it can draw up the coin without making my bank and credit cards useless.  Obviously both theories have their faults, so if you could provide a more plausible explanation I'd be glad to hear it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doublelatte>Double Latte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Milk?</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/23/03 5:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Waitaminute....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> He then proceeds to stare at it and after about twenty seconds the coin seems to levitate out of the person's hand, hover at about a foot over the person's hand, and slowly begin to increase it's angular velocity.

Phoenix, have you seen David Blain perform? You would probably end up worshipping him as a god. A few of his tricks I couldn't readily explain, but that doesn't mean he can defy the laws of physics. Anyway, if what your friend does is &quot;not a trick&quot; then why doesn't he just explain to you exactly how he does it? If he has a special ability, why all the mystery? Who came up with &quot;the two leading theories&quot; about it? Does he claim he's telekinetic? Have any doctors, scientists or researches looked into his amazing ability? Can he apply this special ability to anything more useful than making coins float? For example, if you locked your keys in the car, could he stare at your door locks and make them pop up?  FYI, levitation tricks typically rely on optical illusion involving shadows or trick magnetics - not so useful for unlocking cars.<br>

I am a (non-Wiccan) pagan, but I also consider myself an atheist (let's leave the UU thing aside for now).  There are no deities, imo, but I guess the jury's still out for me on the &quot;supernatural&quot; stuff.  I don't think anything is beyond the natural world, but I do believe (without proof, I know) that the human brain is capable of far more than we are aware and that science has yet discovered.

Your question didn't seem idiotic at all.  After wading thru all this drivel arguing over what words mean I can't really blame you for being confused.  Hell, I have argued this very point in dozens of threads and they still give me a headache somethimes.<br>

Your beliefs sound very reasonable.  Your openess is wonderful and I can say I agree with you that there is the potential for so much more discovery and development within ourselves.

How recently have you looked at that thread?  I am still listed as the most recent reply.  I explained very clearly what I thought could be improved in Dawkins little ditty.  Oh, and as far as it being my beloved teological, if I really felt that it was beloved, I wouldn't have said it had faults.  So please stop trying to be insulting because it is really quite petty.  Or if you really want to continue to try to be insulting, at least get my position straight before you do.<br>
<br>
As far as the magnetic coin, he must have alot of them, and be prepared to swap them with any coin that a person pulls out.  He must also be very quick if he can dash over to the random assistant, swap the coin, and run back to his position about 2 meters away without anyone seeing him.  Although it would lead credibility to the magnetic field generator theory.(after modifying it a bit)  Any other theories?<br>

I know you think I'm being &quot;insulting&quot;, but your awe over parlor tricks combined with your ready dismissal of someone of real intellectual substance (Dawkins) will hardly earn you my respect.<br>
<br>
Your reply to the Watchmaker indicated dissapointment that Dawkins didn't provide an all-inclusive theory on how the universe began. All that tells me is that you missed his point entirely. Please reread his conclusion:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The details of the early phase of the universe belong to the realm of physics, whereas I am a biologist, more concerned with the later phases of the evolution of complexity. For me, the important point is that, even if the physicist needs to postulate an irreducible minimum that had to be present in the beginning, in order for the universe to get started, that irreducible minimum is certainly extremely simple. By definition, explanations that build on simple premises are more plausible and more satisfying than explanations that have to postulate complex and statistically improbable beginnings. And you can't get much more complex than an Almighty God!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

I fail to see how you figure that anything is being proven, or how you figure that I've figured that something is proven.  I wouldn't be asking for alternate explanations if I had already reached a conclusion.  I'm asking for alternate explanations because neither one of the current leading theories seems likely to me.  So maybe if you'd get your head out of your butt for a second, you would realize that I've asked for help explaining something.<br>
<br>
As far a Dawkin's conclusion.  He suggests that the irreducible minimum that is required is extremely simple and therefore due to Ockham's razor it would be the most likely explanation.  However, he has done absolutely nothing to prove that the irreducible minimum is extremely simple.  He has provided no evidence to back up his claim, and asks us to 'trust him'.  No offence, but the last person who asked me to just trust them without any evidence was a JW.  <br>
<br>
If I gave that article to a professor, they would give several oohs and ahhs until they got to that part, then they would begin scratching their head, and would write on the paper, &quot;insufficient evidence to propose such a conclusion&quot;.  They would also deduct marks for an incomplete citation.<br>
<br>
Oh, and since you asked, theory 2 was proposed by one of my engineering friends, and theory 1 was proposed by my physics prof. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 305<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/24/03 1:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Waitaminute</span><hr size=1> Pheonix, Pheonix, Pheonix *shakes head* <br>

You really are very egotistical.  Don’t assume you are giving me a headache.  Your arguments are quite simplistic and none of my rebuttals get responded to. No my boy, you do not cause the least nuisance.  Your silence to my replies is quite satisfying. Look for some of the exchanges with Michael the Theist to see what would be more frustrating.<br>

I like my gray matter active and engaged, as much as you obviously don’t.  I don’t find reason and logic to be a burden as you do apparently.  I look forward to the day I can prosecute you for malpractice when you treat your patient’s cancer with an olive oil wrap.  How sad that they will suffer for your oblivious ignorance.<br>

Why don’t you take your friend to see James Randi?  You could pay for your whole medical education off that one visit!  Possibly even your fist malpractice case too!  He offers a million dollars for proof of the supernatural.  Your friend’s telekinesis would definitely qualify.  Just because you can be suckered doesn’t mean we have to accept it.  We don’t even have to speculate debunking it because obviously, you aren’t impartial, so we really can’t take your word for it.  Responsibly, I would have to see the trick performed myself before I could attempt any analysis.<br>
<br>
One last thing, by your reasoning, there is no purpose in seeing any physician other than a general practitioner.  No need for fancy cosmetic surgeons, ophthalmic doctors, oncologist, pathologist, etc.  Nope, we can do away with all those useless wastes of medical degrees because their knowledge is so limited to their field, they aren’t worth crap.  They have to be able to all diagnose and treat everything in fields outside their area of expertise or they’ll get failing marks.  Dawkins quite clearly says he is a biologist and not a physicist, yet you criticize him for his specialization and admission of a lack of knowledge in an unexamined field and then discount his conclusions in his area of expertise as a result.  <br>
