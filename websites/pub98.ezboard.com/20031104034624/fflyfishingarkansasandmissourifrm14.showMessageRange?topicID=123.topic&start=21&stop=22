I'll take that under serious advisement.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I've probably got $1000 tied up in this deal thus far. I don't want to goof it up.<br>

<br>
This weekend I put about a quart of sow bugs in the tank from some samples obtained from the Little Red River. Gathering those samples alone was a bit of learning experience since I was looking for areas that would be productive in numbers in each sample. Generally the areas richest in calcium and oxygen provided the largest number of individual sow bugs. Generally, they were &quot;below&quot; the rocks of fast moving water that was in a nutrient rich inflow. I took some samples in the middle of the river but got only a few returns. When I would hit the coontail moss heavy I'd only get 3 or 4 per sample. As soon as I flipped over a rock under one of the pipes I got almost 200 the first sample.<br>
<br>
I have been feeding the Purina Aquamax food, which is a trout and carnivorous fish specific diet. The directions call for trout to be fed 10-12 times daily. I thought that was a bit odd at first. However when I noticed that they are generally taking very small amount of food at a feeding the rest just goes to waste. The trout I have prefer to feed in little portions but &quot;very&quot; often. They may be feeders of opportunity, but I think on the whole they prefer to feed continuously throughout the day. Remember that these are brown trout and not cutthroats. I know that some of you throw big streamers for cuts and have considerable success. Personally I think that you would have more success fishing with small flies even for the bigger fish.<br>
<br>
I dropped some hoppers in the tank of various sizes to see their reaction. It was interesting that with a hopper the size of a cricket that paid it no attention at all. It sat circling in the top of the tank for several hours in fact. I dropped in another that was about 1/2&quot; and they would strike at it but not take it. They actually appeared to be trying to sink the hopper. Once the hopper was fully submerged they actually fought over it. Several hours later I dropper in one that was 1/4&quot; in length. Three fish charged up from the bottom to take the fly. The one that took it was chased by the remaining two around the tank hoping to get a remnant.<br>
<br>
I have 8 fish in the tank with rocks spread across the bottom. When I first put the fish in they were a bright yellowish color. Their par marks were barely noticeable. Now that they have been in the tank for a week their color has drastically changed. They have adapted to the color of the rocks. Their spots have gotten a much brighter color as well. Their par marks are much more distinguished. They have established territories and have quit fighting nearly as often.<br>
<br>
Another interesting thing is that I put 8 fish in a tank that has a foot print of 4 square feet. I can't think of but a couple of occasions that I can find any more than maybe 4 of those fish. They are so adapted at hiding in cover I would bet my mortgage that you couldn't find all 8 fish on any given day. I was beginning to worry that something might have happened to a couple of them until I checked the tank this morning and all 8 fish were swimming close to the surface (whew).<br>
<br>
I am going to have some samples of sculpins and fresh water snails this evening. I need some species that will scavenge a little better. I will try and get some small crayfish and maybe a couple of darters as well this weekend. I need to refresh my sample of midges. Those little guys have all but cleaned out any and all of the midge samples I have.<br>
<br>
If anyone has some specific questions or observations you would like me to make let me know. These observations are meant more to be how they would apply to a fly fisherman than a biologist. I'm sure that there have been a million people that have made these observations before me. However this might be a unique opportunity to gain some perspective to what the fish actually see and react to.<br>
<br>
The fish spend half of their day with their head burried in the rocks. They are constantly on the prowell for something to eat. They will &quot;taste&quot; almost anything that even looks like food unless it is too large. However, when they taste something they almost immediately spit it out. They will do that several times before eating something. The &quot;taste test&quot; that they do is very quick. I can assure you that we are missing hundreds of takes in a day. If you are fishing an indicator it is especially important that you maintain a tight tippet and your indicator down stream from your fly, or you will &quot;never&quot; see a take. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
