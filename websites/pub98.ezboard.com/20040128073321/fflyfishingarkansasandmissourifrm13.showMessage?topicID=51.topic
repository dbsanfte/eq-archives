I got to cast with Steve at the Denver AFFTA show. I have quite a bit of video of Steve casting if you'd like some. His stops at the show were lazer sharp and quite a bit higher than the ones in Paul's video. I have viewed the video tons of times and I am still having some difficulty in figuring out where he generates his line speed. His back was bothering him and he's still throwing tons of line. I'm starting to think that true distance comes from the stop.<br>

     True distance truely comes from timing and of course, technique. Realize that the best casters have a gifted sense of timing, and NEVER underestimate timing.  I had a well known New England fly tyer and engineer Rich Murphy study me doing my Sayonara Sling outside at the Fly Tyers Symposium this weekend because he's going to include the cast in his new book. (He wanted to explain what forces are at work, and how it's done, so he had to study it in person) Rich said the way I do it gives the rod tip amazing and tremendous speed, and the reason is because of the consevation of anguler momentum. He explained that this is what  some historical physicist originally used to explain planetary orbits. Look it up. Said that's why I can cast so far with that technique. I know that I get the rod to bend incredibly as I load with the sling. He added that what may cause that (the great rod bend) is that the tip is actually pulling the rod with great force into the bend, before it starts moving in the other direction. Then it accellerates to amazing speed.<br>
<br>
  Another thing I thought about today as I was casting was that there's more to straight tracking than tracking. When I track well I feel the smooth unloading of the rod as the bend unloads from butt to tip ( I mean the bend literally moving from the butt to the tip) for the backcast. This somehow neurologically helps me snap into a physical and timing (neurological) groove going forward, where my timing is more finely tuned. It's this groove that actually makes me in that movement stronger and more precise. It's not the tracking that did it (some of it perhaps) it's more the physical and neurological trigger here. It's what this triggered for me physically. <br>
       I talked about something like this with my physical therapist, relating to the Sayonara Sling. I pantomimed the cast for him. He told me that I didn't know it, but that when I stopped (and the way I stopped and what I did when I did this) at a certain point before going the other way, it triggered something neurologically that made me automatically and more powerfully  stronger going into my delivery.<br>
<br>
       Perhaps no one will beat Steve Rajeff casting like Steve Rajeff. You must do it differently. <br>
<br>
       From what you tell me, perhaps Andrew can beat him in some things already. Andrew sounds that good.<br>
<br>
Remember too, that Steve doesn't cast the five weights as far as some other people do.<br>

<br>
Steve is the best &quot;all around&quot; caster at the moment. There are alot of points to style that may or may not have to be taken into account with the different casting events. Bill Gammel Chris Korich and Steve Rajeff all cast with the same style. This lends itself to events with a shooting head and heavier rods. <br>
<br>
Drew's style works very well with events that will require a long loading of the rod. He can carry tons of line on a 5 weight through an 8 weight. Bill Gammel an I were looking at his stroke and his stroke is close to 30 feet with his haul. It's probably the longest one I've ever seen. He will do very well in ISE events if he ever wants to take the time to get into it. Drew's on weekness is the length of his stroke. As long as he is in control of it he'll have no problems. When it gets out of kilter for him it will go wayyy out.<br>
<br>
Guys like Rick Hartman really interest me. I don't know if I buy into the right foot forward thing as yet. I agree with his theory of it lessening his body turn. However it sounds a little like a quick fix to another issue. However, it is pretty hard to argue with the distances he is throwing. He kicked my butt at the OLN Master's competition thats for sure. <br>
<br>
I'm going to have to see you cast one of these days. The guys on Pauls site are always talking about angular momentum and flexable levers, depleted uranium 232, Hydrogen isotopes, and other such stuff. Basically it relates to getting as much speed as you can, transfered in as straight a line as you can (both up and down and side to side), and all of this released as precisely as is possible in the quickest amount of time and distance. <br>
<br>
If I could be the Doctor Frakenstien of fly casting I'd take your rod loading, Drew's stroke, and Steve's stops. We'd have to know angular momentum at that point to calculate which lower Earth orbit the fly was going to settle into.<br>
<br>
By the way I'm not sure angular momentum applies since it is being acted on by external torque. It's been a long time since I had physics though. We studied some on the subject in flight school.<br>

      I was thinking about this last night, that I meant nothing arrogent by my post. I thought it might have been perceived that way, so I was thinking about it, and I didn't mean anything like that at all.<br>
      I don't know exactly about what Rich said, consevation of anguler momentum. I too have to understand it. I was passing it on. You've got to know Rich. He walks away telling me about it (as he's walking of course) and then he's mumbling about something, and then mumbling something about Lefty Kreh, and then the sound just trails away as he does. He's intelligent, but he's Rich.<br>
      Although we can analyze and try to analyze it, it seems that the best casters have something that most of the others don't. The real good ones I've seen develope, all got very good very quickly. They had a talent for it. That doesn't mean, of course, that someone can't get there by hard work, study, and persevearence, and of couse I think anyone can improve.<br>
       Many of the good tournament casters were trained the same way, on the West Coast. So they cast alike. The &quot;West Coast&quot; style.  A good case can be made that it's the most effective style because, for the most part, the best casters have used that style. But I think they're the best, not because of the style, but because they worked hard and had incredible talent. They just happened to be taught that way. Being in those casting clubs and competitions helped fuel their motivation too. <br>
       I'm now glad I didn't start or develope there. I think that I got (and will get) closer to my full potential by doing most of the &quot;developing&quot; myself, away from tutelage. Actually assembling what was right for me and my fishing. (I did, though, have very short &quot;lessonettes&quot; from Lefty Kreh (2), and Jerry Siem (1) at shows and events, but that's all, anything else was from books, primarily Lefty Kreh's). This left a lot open for experimenting, wandering, and creativity.<br>
      I think that on the whole, the best distance casters of the future (including shooting heads) will be the individuals who have the longer strokes. You can see it with Andrew, and the &quot;5 weight guys&quot; from Utah, and a guy named John Kestner from Michigan too. A fishing buddy of mine, Kevin Callahan, is tremendous as well, and uses a long stroke also. The cast I cast longest with is very different as you know, and who knows where that will go in terms of any following. It does also though, include a long stroke.<br>
        My stroke for accuracy is shorter, and even shorter, than it used to be. I think that if people really feel comfortable in their style, whatever it is, that they, with practice, will become very accurate. I agree that that &quot;West Coast&quot; style (Joan Wulff casts in that style too, as did her Eastern cohorts when she started - and I think Euopeans like Charles Ritz too, so maybe you could call it the &quot;traditional tournament&quot; style. ) is excellent for close to medium distance accuracy.<br>
         I'm for openess and acceptance of casting style, creativity, and for what fits the individual.<br>
                                         All My Best,<br>

 Does using a side arm cast give you better Trajectory control over the overhead cast?<br>
 We know that with the overhead cast you start out with the loop about 10-12 ft high. Where with the side are your loop leaves the rod tip about 5-6 ft above the ground.<br>
 This alone gives the overhead caster about 6 ft of heigth advantage. mmmmm  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
