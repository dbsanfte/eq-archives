Ok, given that you want them to operate from a factual basis, the only FACT of god's existence you could substantively argue is the fact of our existence.  The bibble itself you cannot take because it was written by men with man's purposes behind it 335 years after JC was supposed to have walked the earth.  It is rife with self-contradiction, and as you say, there is stuff in it you don't want to believe.  There is no evidence that the War Santa had anything to do with its creation, codification, or distribution.  It was a political standardization by Emperor Constantine to secure his rule over the 'holy' roman empire.  Are you going to burn in hell for wearing jeans and wool socks?  The bibble calls this a sin (cotton + wool) among other ridiculous things.  Constantine's editing was so offensive, it broke the council of nicea and several members ended up exiled.<br>
<br>
You assume 2 givens (I do not agree with, but will argue from for this debate.)  <br>
1.) There is a god.<br>
2.) It created everything.<br>
<br>
Given the evidence there is a creation, does it support or contradict the bibble?  God is unforgiving.  The weak are regularly killed and eaten by the strong.  Why would god need to intervene for your sick child because you pray when he already hand crafted their immune system and provided all that was needed to repair them?  No medical technology today does anything more than assist our natural healing process.  It is truely amazing and worth praise, weather god built it or not.  Our knowledge pales in comparison to the feats of evolution (started by god?) that brought us to where we are.  <br>
<br>
You want to operate from facts, yet believe (eg 'feel') that god is real.  This is self-contradictory.  There may indeed be a god, no one can prove there isn't (you cannot prove a negative) but once a positive assertion is made (such as a religion or bibble) it can be disproven.  Keep your faith, believe in god all day long.  Do good works, feel pride in your merits as a decent human, but give yourself the credit for your actions, for they are your own.  God does not meddle in our daily lives.  The bibble is political gibberish, not gods work.  The human body, the rocky mountains, the sun and stars may be, but the bibble isn't.<br>
<br>
This is deism.  It was the (predominant) religion of our founding fathers despite the modern inclination at historical revisionism to the contrary.  I can choose not to beleive in god, you can choose to, it doesn't affect reality either way, but as soon as you say he talks to you, people call you crazy.<br>

<br>
My point isn't that there is anything false about  the LDS Church at that web site(I didn't read far enough to see) but rather that if the Jewish people at the time Christ  &quot;proved&quot; with scripture that Christ was not the Messiah  (thus, millions of Jewish people have lived and continue to live in this world, and I do respect a lot of things about judaism, though obviously I think think they are wrong about Jesus Christ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  then why isn't it possible that the same thing is happening now with His restored Church?<br>
<br>
If the Book of Mormon isn't true (though I obviously believe it is) those arguments are certainly not the reason any more than that pharisees arguments showed the Christ was not the Messiah.<br>
<br>
I'll try not to repeat this again if you will acknowledge that you at least see what I'm saying here.  I'm not trying to get you to say the Book of Mormon is true, just that you see my point or else can explain exactly how what you are doing is actually different than Emmy's example about Hank <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  or different than the pharisees.<br>

The bible doesn't contradict its self at all.  You may think there are contradictions because you dont' know the bible very well. <br>

Would I go to hell for wearing jeans or wool? of course not.  WE dont live by the old test. either.   The bible proves its self true by the prophsey (?) within the bible.  <br>

Delightfully condescending, dismissive and charmingly trite.<br>
<br>
Still, you haven't actually answered anything have you?  You will be with god, because you follow his word.  Some of them anyway, but how to know which you can get away with dismissing and which are punishable by damnation and hellfire?  Tough Call!  <br>
<br>
Time may tell if there is a god, but I wouldn't want to waste the here-and-now over it.  Not that you'll regret anything of course because once you die, and there isn't a god, you are dead and can't regret anything!  How xian are you being if I ask a question and you turn away the opportunity to answer?  Close the door on one who seeks!  Please, illuminate my darkness with the depth and light of your knowledge!  Calling gods work a waste of time!  That won't earn you any points....<br>
<br>
Of course, I have read the bible, and gone to sunday school, and good xian schools all my life.  Some how I find god stopping the movement of the sun across the sky a contradiction to reality since the earth orbits the sun, disparities in JC's genealogy, last words, title on the cross, resurrection, etc all quite incalculable.<br>

Dismiss me if you like, but then this stops being a debate board and starts being self-righteous masturbatory prose.<br>

Are you really seeking? I dont think so.  I know whatever I say will not change your mind. Although I wish it would.  I think you've heard enough info in your lifetime to make a decision for Christ.  (there has been enough info on bc to tell anyone how to get to heaven.)<br>
<br>
Gods work isn't a waist of time for someone who is truely seeking him.  But titus 3:9 says But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. A man that is  an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.   <br>

Am I really seeking?  Not presently, I sought for a loooong time and have found my conclusions.  Does this mean if you were able to porve me wrong I wouldn't change?  Nope!  Prove me wrong and I was wrong, therefore I must accept what is right.  There is a difference in truth seeker's vs faith holders.  We can accept when we are wrong and hold on to the proven truth rather than cling dogmaticly to the blanantly false and call it faith as though it were an admirable quality.  How do you view the woman whose husband is blatantly cheating on her yet she refuses to see?  Is that not faith?  She has FAITH that her husband is true to her!  His word is all she needs!<br>
<br>
We must keep an open mind, but not so open our brains fall out (C. Sagan) and I do strive to keep an open mind.  Also, you are contradictory in your statements.  &quot;You get to heaven by accepting what Christ did...&quot; requires us to do something, accept JC.  &quot;WE can do nothing.&quot; is contradictory, because we HAVE to do something....accept JC.  <br>
<br>
How is heaven any different from Nirvana, Elysium, Valhalla or any of the other, much older I might add, basis for it?  Do you beleive in them?  Heaven is as much a fantasy farce and for the same reasons.  We die, we rot.  End of story.<br>

Very Animal Farmish.  All books of the Bible are equal.  One is more equal than the other.<br>
<br>
I've always found it interesting how the OT can be so easily dismissed.  And I've never understood how the covenant of the OT is fulfilled, particularly when there are certain specific things that are to happen - and the birth of the son of g-d is not one of them.<br>

<br>
The decalogue is in the OT so I guess it is tossed out too.  We can now disrespect our parents, bare false witness, covet everything and kill freely.  Not that the big 10 ever stopped god's sheeple from doing that stuff anyway. <br>
<br>
The NT had some other errors like the whole 'people alive today will see the return of JC' hooey that never happened.  Unless there is a 1,977-year-old arab someplace (more than twice Methuselah!) we don't know about.<br>

<br>
Actually Heather, the bible is rife with contradictions and this is something every bible scholar knows and readily admits to. Your statement shows that you cannot possibly be very familiar with this book you've based your faith on. <br>
<br>
Here is a link that provides a comprehensive list biblical contradictions. <br>

I just read a book written by a bible scholar and Baptist minister that was an interesting exploration of some of the issues brought up in this thread. It's called &quot;Rescuing Jesus from the Christians.&quot; He shows that Jesus was a mistaken prophet (the &quot;kingdom&quot; never came) and that Christians have both aggrandized and sentimentalized him far beyond what anything in the bible can support. It was fascinating reading.<br>

I have enjoyed your posts on the a/a board.  Now,  i was born and raised catholic, and moved to the south were I was&quot;saved&quot; and became a xian. i read my bible and went to bible study and put my kids in a xian school that i began a job as a teachers assistance and a substitute teacher. I was all for the word being it and everything was gods plan and happened for his reasons. I remember mydh asking me if god was so lvoing and kind, how can he lets children suffer and so on and so on. and I always went for the safe answer, because it is in his plan.  I had strong faith in jesus as my savior and i was unwavering.  then something happened that just threw all my faith out the window and on a course to learn and search for the truth. the more i have searched the more i believe the bible to be a nice book of stories that i just cant get my mind to believe them anymore. it seems the more i learn about other &quot;religions and lifestyles, the further it seem to me that the bible is the truth. to me it has become something for  when a person doesnt have the real answer for something, just fall on the bible, pull a verse out of it and say it all his plan. its just doesnt work for me anymore.<br>

<br>
I have to agree with DBC about the Catholic church. I remember sitting in my world history class in high school thinking, &quot;How can anyone learn about the history of the Catholic church and still believe it is inspired by God?&quot; Each king changed parts of it in order to fit his agenda. Because the rule was so based in the church, the best way to influence laws was by changing the Bible. I believe, and I may be wrong, but I believe that is the reason LDS say that they believe in the Bible as long as it is translated correctly. <br>
<br>
Also, any leader of any church living on the earth today is merely a mortal man (or woman in some) who is fallable. As are all of us. No matter what or who you believe in, we are all trying to negotiate life. We are all seekers of truth whether truth be the big bang, evolution, God, Jesus Christ, etc. <br>
<br>
Heather, unless you have seen Jesus Christ or God with your own eyes you are still basing your religion on your feelings. Even if you did see God, you would have to believe that it was God either because he told you so (debatable because anyone could say they are God) or because you in some way felt/believed said person was really God. Either way, you have to go with what your head and heart say is true. <br>
<br>
Even in the example of the court case and basing your decision on facts.... that is simplistic or we would have no need for any jury in any court. You have to make decisions about the facts that are placed in front of you. We all come from different experiences and different ideals, beliefs, etc. You can take 12 people on a jury and have each and every one of them interpret the facts differently even though they were all presented the exact same facts in the exact same courtroom at the exact same time. The truth is that there are very few things that just &quot;are&quot; and are the same to every person. It is our perceptions of the world that make up the facts to us. So, to say that you base belief in God or belief in there being no God on facts is in the argument fallable. <br>
<br>
Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon if pulled apart and placed scripture against scripture can be proved contradictory. The truth is that different situations warrant differences. It is illegal to shoot someone unless you are defending yourself, they intrude into your home with intent to harm you or your family, etc. There are very few ABSOLUTES. Just as there is a commandment that thou shalt not kill, the same God who gave the commandment allows us to defend our families. The commandment of thou shalt not steal... if someone took something that belongs to you and they then take ownership of it and you go get it back, are you then stealing from them? Who on this earth is to decide EXACTLY what God meant by every scripture? The only way I can see to determine if you are on the right track, assuming you believe in God, is to pray and ask Him if what you believe is true. Heather, do you believe that God doesn't answer your prayers? If so, why do you pray to Him? Why would He want you bugging Him if He had no answer for you? If God does answer prayers (which I believe He does), how do you get your answer? Because the last time I checked, God does not have email, he doesn't have a postal address and he isn't sending postcards to answer your questions. The only way we can get the answers to our prayers is to listen and the answers can only come in the form of feelings or in the form of events that we feel/believe are an answer to our prayer. <br>
<br>
The whole idea that you cannot trust your feelings just proves that you too can't trust your beliefs because you have no proof... only the fact that you believe the Bible is true. And that belief is based on your feelings and thoughts (also fueled by feelings). Just as your belief that Mormons are evil and that Satan has every last one of them in his grasp by deceiving them into believing that the Book of Mormon is true is based on your feelings and perceptions. You have no proof of that except your interpretations (feelings) about what you believe the Bible (also feel that it is true) tells you. So how do you explain other people perceiving and interpreting the Bible differently than you? Are you closer to God than they? Does God tell you that everyone else is wrong and you are right or do you just assume that your feelings and thoughts about each scripture is the truth even though others perceive those same verses differently. <br>
<br>
The other thing I wonder about is why people who are not of the LDS faith find the LDS church so intimidating that they will spend countless hours trying to disprove it, write articles about why it is wrong, spend time that could be spend doing good and spend it trying to trash another persons perceptions and beliefs about what is true. Why is that? I've just always wondered about that....<br>

<br>
Because we teach to Love God and to love your neighbor and to act like Christ did (you know, generally very kind and loving).  Not only that, but, gasp!, we cannot just pay lip service to this, we are actually supposed to do something about it.<br>
<br>
And, if that isn't enough, we teach that it is good to be nurturing parents and that it is important to be good to our families.<br>
<br>
What next!   A humanitarian aid center that dispenses needed blankets, money, etc. to those around the world who are in need? <br>
<br>
I think it is self evident why people would need to stop this at any cost including validifying agruments that tear their own belief system down in the process   ;-) <br>
