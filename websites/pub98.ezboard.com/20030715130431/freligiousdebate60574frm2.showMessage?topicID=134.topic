I'm a bit confused about something--in the article it said this ruling would prohibit public school children from reciting the pledge in the 9 western states affected by this court.  I thought they just couldn't be led to say &quot;under God,&quot; not that the pledge was being tossed out altogether.  <br>

<br>
The reason the whole pledge is being left out is because that part is in it and they can't really just ban parts of it. The original one was written without it and I saw a VERY old patriotic cartoon this weekend (pre-McCarthy era) that had Porky Pig reading it without the phrase--wonderful. Maybe those who spout patriotism so much and feel this is essential to indoctrinating our children can return to the original wording and our kids will start saying it again.<br>

Oh yeah and as someone living in one of those &quot;affected western states&quot; I just gotta say YEEEEEEEEEEHAAAWW.<br>

I'm under the impression it's only the &quot;under g-d&quot; part that's in violation.

As long as it remains part of the pledge, the court ruling seems clear that the whole thing is out. My local paper has school officials claiming students can just be silent during the &quot;under god&quot; part, but that won't fly in light of the court decisions and I'm not falling for it either. Replace the word god with Satan, Zeus, Goddess or even gods and let's see how harmless xians think it is for teachers to lead pledges during which their children can be silent...<br>
<br>
Seems the local districts (including the one we are in) are going to consult their attorneys Monday so I'll be letting them know how interested I am in the findings as well as my willingness to bring suit if they don't abide by the courts decision. <br>
<br>
P.S. All this &quot;public pressure&quot; and calling for the court to consider majority opinion by the Bush admin smacks of the racist cries that went out before and after Brown vs. Board of Ed and I'm glad the court realizes that when it comes to protecting the liberties and rights of children in the minority, listening to the majority isn't always the path to righteousness.<br>

1. We went to the ship's party Thursday night and of course there was an opening prayer. DH and I each took sips of our mixed drinks instead. Also, a gal I met there kind of adopted me since I knew nobody...I made an off-the-cuff mention of my haircut being modeled after Witchy Willow on Buffy (it is). She said, &quot;Well, as long as you don't worship Satan!&quot; and I said, &quot;Kinda hard when I don't believe in Satan.&quot;<br>
<br>
2. I went to a support group meeting for the ship's spouses last night...my first one ever in the 10 years of being married to a Navy guy. We opened with the Pledge and it was very pointed...everyone said &quot;under g-d&quot; except me. The woman next to me said afterwards, &quot;At least we aren't in CA or ID and can say under g-d.&quot; Yeah, whatever. Bite me.<br>

By setting yourself above as a group you devalue other citizens of the world and permit their slaughter and oppression and inequitable treatment.<br>
<br>
Over the last three decades, the Supreme Court has used three interrelated tests to analyze alleged violations of the Establishment Clause in the realm of public education: the three-prong test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13, 29 L. Ed. 2d 745, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971); the &quot;endorsement&quot; test, first articulated by Justice O'Connor in her concurring opinion in Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 79 L. Ed. 2d 604, 104 S. Ct. 1355 (1984), and later adopted by a majority of the Court in County of Allegheny v. ACLU, 492 U.S. 573, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472, 109 S. Ct. 3086 (1989); and the &quot;coercion&quot; test first used by the Court in Lee. <br>
<br>
Coercion is simplest to prove, does the state require it in an environment from which one cannot escape. Are you held captive during it. Public school graduations, classes, etc all have you captive. In Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 580, 120 L. Ed. 2d 467, 112 S. Ct. 2649 (1992) it relied on the principle that &quot;at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise to act in a way which establishes a state religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.&quot; Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court first examined the degree of school involvement in the prayer, and found that &quot;the graduation prayers bore the imprint of the State and thus put school-age children who objected in an untenable position.&quot; Id. at 590. The next issue the Court considered was &quot;the position of the students, both those who desired the prayer and she who did not.&quot; Id. Noting that &quot;there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools,&quot; id. at 592, the Court held that the school district's supervision and control of the graduation ceremony put impermissible pressure on students to participate in, or at least show respect during, the prayer, id. at 593. The Court concluded that primary and secondary school children may not be placed in the dilemma of either participating in a religious ceremony or protesting. Id. at 594<br>
<br>
The endorsement test is equally clear. In Justice O'Connors words &quot;The Establishment Clause prohibits government from making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the political community. Government can run afoul of that prohibition in two principal ways. One is excessive entanglement with religious institutions . . . . The second and more direct infringement is government endorsement or disapproval of religion. Endorsement sends a message to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lastly, in 1971 in the context of unconstitutional state aid to nonpublic schools, the Supreme Court in Lemon set forth the following test for evaluating alleged Establishment Clause violations. To survive the &quot;Lemon test,&quot; the government conduct in question (1) must have a secular purpose, (2) must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13. The Supreme Court applied the Lemon test to every Establishment case it decided between 1971 and 1984.<br>
<br>
So you can see, by the tests established in our judicial system and under the constitution, &quot;Under god&quot; does not belong.<br>
<br>
Lemon: Under god does not have a secular purpose<br>
It clearly advances religion. It entangles Gov't with it.<br>
<br>
O'Connor: Under god endorses religion, specifically monotheistic ones and deity based ones.<br>
<br>
Coersion: It is happening in a legally required forum (public school attendance.)<br>
<br>
Another, unexplored point is that Congress is electing to break laws they themselves wrote. The Pledge was written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister from New York. It was published in the September 8th issue of The Youth's Companion. Copyrights are protected and this work, as published was a copyrighted material. Congress blatantly disregarded the protection of that work begining in 1924 and culminating in 1954 at the behest of the Knights of Columbus in changing without permission Bellamy's work.<br>
<br>
No atheist is asking that the pledge be changed to read &quot;One Nation WITHOUT God&quot; or &quot;Despite God&quot; or &quot;There is no God&quot;. They only ask it be restored to its pre-prayer conversion or abandoned as the prayer it has become. You may argue your BELIEF that rights are handed down from god, but that is a belief and not everyone holds it. Forcing your beliefs on others is wrong.  <p><br>

But that's just it--legislation (like the current AZ law that every single 4,5 and 6 grader must recite the part of the D of Ind stating there is a creator or not be passed to the next grade) is just what can be declared unconstitutional. The Congress can mandate prayers and pledges, but those would still violate the Constitution. I can see them trying though--<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The sad part of it violating the constitution is that they can ammend the constitution.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
But again, you really can't amend the Constitution so that it violates the Bill of Rights (1st 10 amendments--I know you know, but in case there's question about why I called them out...) can you? Wouldn't this be immediately challenged, starting the legal battles again? The 1st Amendment is not something I think many want to repeal or mess with altogether...okay herr Ashcroft probably fantasizes about it, but....hmmm<br>

Much of our censorship laws are violative of freespeech's broadest coverage, but verbal harassment, &quot;hate&quot; speech, and other subversive things are restricted.  Security policies restrict freedom of the press, illegal search and seizure is defined by what makes it legal to search and seize.  The constitutional charge to promote the useful arts is the basis of our copyright, patent and trademark laws, yet they have been expanded to the point of hindering the arts in an effort to protect corporate interests at public expense.  The judicial branch can only interpret the laws, they cannot make them up.  If the legislature decides to make a law distinguishing the phrase 'under god' as outside the bounds of religous endorsement, then that becomes the standard of measure.  Congress itself is outside constitutional provisions for many things.  There was a case in the 1970's where a senator dismissed a woman cheif of staff because he needed a man to handle the pressures that so frail a vessle as a woman could not and he was judgement-proof because it was a senatorial discretion and the EEOC laws did not apply.  He even explained quite condescendingly in his letter to her about the inefficaices of the fairer sex when he both requested and accepted her resignation (in the same letter, before she wrote one.) <p><br>

Are there no religious groups (outside JW) that find the description of the phrase &quot;under god&quot; secular or indicative of a secular religion? Perhaps not now, but I can see a longterm &quot;bite in the butt&quot; if the tactic for the fundies becomes claiming &quot;god&quot; when used in gov't does not indicate a religious entity or is secular in nature....But alas, you are right we're in for an interesting journey on this one. I, for one, am just glad we're seeing it at all and that we have voices in the media this time out from parents across the country. At the least, perhaps we can make more people realize how many of us there are at school, work, neighborhoods....<br>

Anyway, you said:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But again, you really can't amend the Constitution so that it violates the Bill of Rights (1st 10 amendments--I know you know, but in case there's question about why I called them out...) can you?

<br>
Yes, the Constitution can be amended such that the Bill of Rights can be changed. It takes a lot to do it, but any part of the Constitution can be changed, provided that the amendment process is followed (until the amendment process itself is changed). Any court battles will end up in the Supreme Court, but then the Supremes will be required to following the amended Constitution.<br>
<br>
For example, someone could come along and decide that firearms really shouldn't be owned by individuals <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>at all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and so they decide to change the 2nd Amendment to read &quot;Militias being an historic relic, the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution is hereby repealed, and the right of the States to keep and bear arms shall be regulated by Congress.&quot;<br>
<br>
The 1st Amendment could be modified to allow &quot;equality of monitary distribution of public funds among religions properly recognized&quot;. This would go against what Madison (and Jefferson) would want to happen, but just because so-called &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; wanted something and understood history a certain way doesn't mean we have to follow it and remember the lessons they knew from experience.<br>
<br>
So, yes. Event the Bill of Rights can be changed. But it would be a very difficult fight, especially as regarding the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th Amendments. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The 1st Amendment is not something I think many want to repeal or mess with altogether...okay herr Ashcroft probably fantasizes about it, but....hmmm<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yep. Though a vocal group of people would like to see the 1st Amendment changed to supress nontheistic or non-JudeoChristian influences in society. (These are the people who claim that the 1st Amendment shouldn't be interpreted as providing a &quot;wall of seperation&quot; between government and religion, and also claim that the nation was founded to be a Christian nation, etc, etc, etc.)<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>DeLAY SEEKING CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, CURBS ON JUDICIAL AUTHORITY IN EFFORT TO VOID PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE RULING</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
House Majority Leader Tom DeLay has announced plans to remove the federal courts' jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of the words &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Congress for so long has been lax in standing up for the Constitution,&quot; the Texas Republican told reporters last week.  &quot;There are ways to express ourselves.  For instance, we could limit the jurisdiction of the judicial branch.&quot;<br>
<br>
DeLay said that under interpretation of Article III, Section 2 of the U.S.Constitution, Congress would presumably have the power to go as far as impeaching judges.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think that would be a very good idea to send a message to the judiciary they ought to keep their hands off the Pledge of Allegiance,&quot; DeLay blustered.<br>
<br>
DeLay has long complained of &quot;judicial activism&quot; by federal judges when they render findings contrary to his ideological bias.  His latest threat to intimidate the judicial system was prompted by a decision from the full Ninth U.S.  Circuit Court of Appeals to not hear a review on an earlier 2-1 ruling from last June which found that the phrase &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance was an impermissible endorsement of religion.  California Atheist Michael Newdow had challenged the practice, saying that his eight-year-old daughter should not be compelled to participate in the recitation conducted each morning in her public schools.<br>
<br>
Writing for the majority, Justice Alfred T.  Goodwin opined that the inclusion of 'under God' -- a phrase which did not appear in the original Pledge of Allegiance -- was a religious endorsement of monotheistic belief.<br>
<br>
The latest Ninth Circuit ruling fine-tuned the earlier decision, and stopped short of declaring the 1954 law, which ordered the words 'under God' included in the pledge to be unconstitutional.  Instead, the court majority declared:<br>
<br>
&quot;The statement that the United States is a nation 'under God' is an endorsement of religion.  It is a profession of religious belief, namely, a belief in monotheism.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Department of Justice and other principals in the dispute are asking the U.S.  Supreme Court to hear the case.  The outcry from media, political and religious groups has been attenuated somewhat by the fact that the Ninth Circuit has also, for the second time, stayed enforcement of its ruling.<br>
<br>
But DeLay promises to press forward with whatever it takes to overturn the Ninth Circuit decision, and continue forcing youngsters and other members of the public to recite a religionized Pledge of Allegiance. Entertaining a congressional resolution or constitutional amendment falls short of DeLay's actual goal of reigning in what he sees as &quot;activist&quot; judges.  Citing the stay of the decision, DeLay told reporters, &quot;This won't deter us from moving forward in trying to deal with the situation, and Congress ought to have something to say about this.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are early indications that some Republicans may join DeLay's crusade.<br>
<br>
Rep.  Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), a religious right stalwart, says that the Supreme Court is likely to overturn the Newdow pledge decision.  But if the court does not hear the case and rule against the Ninth Circuit, Congress could pass a constitutional amendment immunizing the Pledge from further judicial scrutiny, or try to limit the power of the judiciary.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope that it's not necessary to amend the Constitution,&quot; said Chabot.<br>
<br>
So far, Congress is solidly behind the &quot;God Pledge.&quot;  The Senate voted last week 94-0 to retain the present wording, and ordered Senate attorneys to intervene in the case and file an amicus brief in support of the pledge.  Last summer when the ruling by the Ninth Circuit was made, the House of Representatives voted 416-3 with only 11 others voting &quot;present&quot; to oppose the finding.  Lawmakers have also been threatening to split the Ninth Circuit for what the Washington Times described as &quot;punishment for rulings like the Pledge.&quot;<br>
<br>
But DeLay's call to muzzle the judiciary system could precipitate a constitutional crisis which has played out ever since the founding of the Republic.  The DeLay strategy would attempt to hijack Article III, specifically Clause 2 and Clause 3 (dealing with treason), and use it as a club against judges and judicial opinions DeLay finds offensive.<br>
<br>
One action which DeLay has long threatened to use is impeachment as a &quot;cure for judicial activism.&quot;  On several occasions during the late 1990s when he served as Majority Whip, Delay implored fellow lawmakers to use impeachment, and conveniently defined the offense as &quot;whatever a majority of the House of Representatives consider it to be.&quot; Critics termed the suggestion &quot;callous&quot; and a &quot;passing fantasy.&quot;<br>
<br>
DeLay's outburst at the Congressional Well was prompted by a relatively obscure case, UNITED STATES v.  BAYLESS.  U.S.  Judge Harold Baer of New York's Southern District ruled that two police officers had acted improperly during the arrest of an alleged drug peddler.  Drugs seized by the officers were thus deemed inadmissible.<br>
<br>
On Capitol Hill, more than two hundred lawmakers condemned the ruling. GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole called for Baer's impeachment, and even low level officials at the Clinton White House mulled pressuring the federal judge to resign if he did not reverse his unpopular ruling.  DeLay joined the uproar, excoriating &quot;rogue judges.&quot;<br>
<br>
In 1997, DeLay told reporters, &quot;The judges need to be intimidated.&quot; He also introduced legislation designed to impose term limits on federal judges and even restrict their purview in cases involving the death penalty and voter referendums.  He also released a laundry list of judges he was targeting for their decisions.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have to have a good candidate for impeachment in order to make it stick,&quot; DeLay told the Washington post.  &quot;We are doing a lot of research on judges' records to see what kinds of attitudes they have.&quot;<br>
<br>
Critics says that DeLay's attempts to intimidate  judges compromises the ability of courts to make decisions free of outside influence.  They also point out that the notion of judicial independence is a key component in the American legal system, and originated within English law during the Seventeenth Century as a way of challenging undisputed Crown authority.<br>
<br>
DeLay has also been criticized for trying to foster an &quot;improper form of influence by one government branch over another,&quot; according to the American Bar Association.  Several constitutional scholars have spoken out, describing the impeachment strategy as &quot;bizarre&quot; and legally unsupportable.  Incredibly, DeLay has maintained his position, and even told one reporter, &quot;It is my opinion that anybody can be impeached for anything &quot;(Chronicle, 1/30/98 ).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Focusing On Religion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
For Delay and his supporters, the real threat of so-called &quot;judicial activism&quot; involves alleged attacks on religious freedom.  Many social and religious conservatives argue that the phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; is not found in the Constitution or Bill of Rights. They also agree with Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who in the WALLACE v.  JAFFREE dissent opined:<br>
<br>
&quot;The Establishment Clause did not require government neutrality between religion and irreligion nor did it prohibit the Federal Government from providing nondiscriminatory aid to religion.  There is simply no historical foundation for the proposition that the Framers intended to build (a) 'wall of separation' ...&quot;<br>
<br>
The argument has attained new status, especially since many federal court decisions are not widely popular.  Unconstitutional activities such as prayer or Bible verse recitation in public schools, display of religious documents on government buildings or the recitation of 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance are often portrayed in a positive light as example of  wholesome religious virtues.  In the latest NEWDOW case, justices supporting a re-hearing or reversal of the original ruling even suggested that public opinion, reaction from government and clerical leaders, and the unpopularity of the decision required an automatic appeal.<br>
<br>
Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain, who insisted that the recitation of the Pledge &quot;cannot possibly be an 'establishment of religion' under any reasonable interpretation of the constitution,&quot; argued that public sentiment supported rehearing.<br>
<br>
&quot;We may not -- we must not -- allow public sentiment or outcry to guide our decisions,&quot; countered Judge Stephen Reinhardt.  &quot;The Bill of Rights if, of course, intended to protect the rights of those in the minority against the temporary passions of a majority.&quot;<br>
<br>
DeLay and other critics of &quot;judicial activism&quot; disagree, and object to practices such as life tenure for those on the federal bench.  Indeed, he supports the state model where about 87% of judges face popular election, thus rendering them more vulnerable to having their decisional freedom constrained by majority outcry.  At a 1998 American Bar Association seminar on judicial independence, Georgetown University law professor Roy Schotland warned, &quot;The greatest threat is in the increasing politicalization of judicial elections.&quot;<br>
<br>
Abner Mikva, a former congressman and federal judge concurred, noting that election of judges to the bench has become &quot;nastier, noisier and costlier.&quot;  He added the judges &quot;need a new way to communicate to the people (and) show why judicial independence is good for them.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the meantime, DeLay and his allies continue to threaten the judicial system for handing down unpopular decision, and especially those rulings which protect the separation of church and state.  The Majority Whip speaks for many on the Hill with his opinion that government needs to become more pro-active in legislating public religiosity, and even subsidizing faith-based groups. <p><br>
