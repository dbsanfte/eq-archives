This spirit of god stuff is clearly foolishness unto me.<br>
<br>
&quot;But she that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he herself is judged of no man.&quot; - well that is true of you also Heather.  You certainly do judge everyone else and do not point that critical eye upon yourself.<br>
<br>
And just to clarify your further miusunderstandings, I bear no hatred towards god.  That would be like me bearing hatered towards the toothfairy or mermaids.  I bear hatred towards the mindless things his minions have done in his ficticous name.  For example, the holocaust, crusades, inquisition, witch burnings, etc. all the way back to that poor old man gathering sticks in the OT just to name a few.  While you may secretly burn with the desire to see us heretics hung upon crosses of our own and purified of our sins in a classic Torquemada style, that is exactly the sort of thing I despise.  Before you profess that you don't harbor that dirty inner hope, it doesn't really matter because some of his minions do.  It is precisely because of these minions that the fiction of the xian god is such a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Again, as casually as you brand my ignorance of the bible, I at least have read it cover to cover and learnt the history surrounding it.  Furthermore, I am not the one claiming to be a dutiful follower and refusing to study his word.  This is precisely why I admire people like Candy, and not others who do not bother to learn.  You may decide your inferiority to men makes you their subject, but as the saying goes, &quot;In the kingdom of the blind, the one eyed man is king.&quot;  I'll just keep both my eyes open thanks.<br>
<br>
Lord save me from your followers.<br>

I never said I was refusing to study his word!  I am studing his word everyday.  Just not that topic which is of no importance to me at this time.   Maybe in the future it will be but for now i'm studing other parts of the bible.  Things that help me daily to grow closer to God. <br>

I could not provide stats because I dont think there is research out there that has studied marriages based on whether the couples involved were living up to the Proclamation on Familes.  As it stands the stats show that A/A and LDS have statistically the same divroce rates.  I would suggest (no data available) that those LDS couples who DO practice faith forgiveness etc have even lower divorce rates.<br>
<br>
As far as being judgemental, read the proclamation again.  It is very firm and sound in saying that husband and wives had individual and unique gifts and roles, but it doesnt say that those are men and womens ONLY roles and gifts.  If you took a survey of all the talks and lectures from those same individuals who signed the proclamation you would find that they emphatically state that each family is unique and each situation calls for individualization of application.<br>
<br>
QUOTES FROM THE ENSIGN - THE OFFICIAL LDS MAGAZINE:<br>
As mothers, perhaps our most important responsibility toward our children is to love them, to teach them, and to nurture their spiritual and emotional growth. Fortunately, we do not usually bear that responsibility alone, for the Lord gave that privilege to men and women alike. (See D&amp;C 68:25, 28; Moses 5:12.) This, then, is a first priority.<br>
<br>
The temporal welfare of the family is another responsibility that men and women share. From the beginning, women have worked to help support their families. After Adam and Eve were driven out of the Garden of Eden, “Adam began to till the earth, and to have dominion over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, as … the Lord had commanded him. And Eve, also, his wife, did labor with him.” (Moses 5:1; italics added.)........<br>
<br>
<br>
For mothers who wonder whether or not they would be justified in working outside the home, the Church has provided no pat answers. Rather, each couple must consider the family’s temporal, emotional, and spiritual needs and decide how they can best meet them. For Jeanne Inouye, this process involved some struggle, a blessing from her husband, and ultimately the decision to stay home: “What you try to do is look at the counsel that’s been given to us as a people. Then you look at your own particular circumstances, pray about it, and then try to make a decision that will enable the Lord to bless you, that will enable you to fulfill your mission, and that seems to feel good.”<br>
<br>
For Jeanne, the decision was not perfectly clear, but it has felt good.<br>
<br>
But what of others who follow this same decision-making process and reach a different decision? President Spencer W. Kimball has given this assurance: “The Lord knows … that through circumstances beyond their control, some mothers are faced with the added responsibility of earning a living. These women have God’s blessing, for he knows of their anguish and their struggle.” (Ensign, Nov. 1978, p. 103.)<br>
<br>
Every family must work out the details for themselves, but several suggestions may help:<br>
<br>
Decide with Prayer, Proceed with Confidence<br>
One couple with a large family found it impossible to buy basic necessities on the husband’s income alone. The young mother returned to college to prepare for a teaching career, which she and her husband felt would allow maximum time at home.<br>
<br>
This woman found that she could not rely on the approval of other people to justify her decision. While she was at school one day, one of her children became ill. When she called a neighbor to ask her to check on her child, the neighbor answered, “If you would stay home and take care of your children, you wouldn’t have such problems.” Not all working Latter-day Saint mothers meet such responses. But we must all look to the Lord for the sense of peace we need in order to follow our personal decisions. Knowing that the Spirit has confirmed our course brings comfort and assurance.<br>
<br>
ANOTHER QUOTE FROM PRES HINKLEY HIMSELF:<br>
President Gordon B. Hinckley in last April’s general priesthood meeting stated: “In the marriage companionship there is neither inferiority nor superiority. The woman does not walk ahead of the man; neither does the man walk ahead of the woman. They walk side by side as a son and daughter of God on an eternal journey.”<br>
<br>
<br>
ONE MORE:<br>
Please, for yourself and your future family, choose a fine education. Be qualified. Be well rounded.<br>

After all, to answer your questions, she'd have to think about it, and she doesn't want to do that, judging by how she called the question stupid, and then spread regurgitated nonsensical spew from someone else.<br>

Honestly, Heather, why are you even here? Is it only to tell people they' re hellbound? You don't even seem to understand what your own religion entails. Sadly, most of the atheists here have a better grip on the whole of the Bible than you do...<br>
