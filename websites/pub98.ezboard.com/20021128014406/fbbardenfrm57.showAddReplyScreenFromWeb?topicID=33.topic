Basically, the first Republican Lord Mayor of Belfast has put the tricolour up as well as the union jack, and it has outraged people. Firstly I shall demonstrate why some people dislike the obvious English readers:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It's a disgrace that this flag should be allowed to fly over Belfast City Hall. Belfast is a part of the United Kingdom and should fly the flag of this country and not the flag of a foreign, terrorist supporting country. <br>

<br>
Ahum, if they where to read the story they would find out it was in the lord mayors study, and the chance of the Irish flag flying outside over City Hall is currently small, until there is a vote. That kind of thing wouldn't cuase outrage, it would cause death. Ireland is not a terrorist country, and the IRA have never been stated as terrorists. They are freedom fighters, and maybe she he/she has missed out the news over the last 8 years!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Belfast should have its own flag and identity portraying its roots as Ireland. Maybe the tricolour with the union jack in the corner? <br>
Dave, England <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I like the idea yet it's unlikely. People want to be one or the other, and I like for it to be like wouldn't work. Unlike Australia its not a colony. The British and Irish governments have been in many talks about joint-ownership, yet it's not possible as people have to be one or the other. There was even something on the news about fights over whether cows where counted as Irish or British, but I don't know the details.<br>
<br>
There is a flag for Ulster, yet I am unsure if there is a flag for Northern Ireland.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
No way should the Irish flag be allowed in the Belfast City Hall. It is not part of the Republic of Ireland but part of UK. This is just another attempt to cause trouble. It is about time Tony Blair stood up for the rights of the people in Belfast and stop giving in to Sinn Fein! <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now they are right, it is part of the UK. I can't tell you the actual figures, but I would say 53% unionist. The future shows a clear catholic majority of the north. The south has a 3% protestant minority. There are talks about a border poll (deciding the future) in May 2003 along with the general elections. Both sides want this, as they both believe it will show a clear majority vote for there side. Also, the Unionists think it will get a huge number going out to vote, which they think will be good for them. British law states that when there is one border poll, another must follow every 7 years, so that means another one in 2010. This basically means Ireland will one day be united if the future Catholic majority theory is true.<br>
<br>
God, I have went on too much. Tell me your thoughts on what we should have as a flag, and what you think about the Lord Mayor putting the Irish Tricolour up in his personal study (the rest of the city hall is literally covered in union jacks if you look inside, so he wants to feel at home, as well as the old equality issue).<br>
<br>
Oh, I will also add that the Irish Tricolour was made whenever ROI seperated from the UK as far as I know. Before that Ireland would use another flag I think, probably with the harp angel thing on it (i really have no idea to be honesT!). The green of the flag represents the nationalists while the orange represents union (orange men etc.) and the white is meant to show how they should live in peace. Many people now see it as something far from that of course.<br>
<br>
Give me your feedback!

Politicians are ruining Northern Ireland. The people don't want it. Why not just accept that NI is part of the UK and get on with your life and help build it as a succesfull part of the UK. Strive for your own parliament - just like Scotland and Wales has done. Surely thats much better then being in a near state of civil war with corruption and violence?<br>
<br>
The thing that sickens me is that this whole thing is being fought on the face of religion. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with religion. It has everything to do with 'clanism' or perhaps more aptly 'gangism'. The fact that religion is being brought into it..and then used as a sort of holy grail in other countries for footballing reasons is sick. I'm fed up of the Old Firm bullshit - most of the supporters aren't even religious. It's not just the old firm - its the same with Ajax(with people pretending they are jewish when they blatantly aren't) and Feyenoord (Muslim my arse).<br>
<br>
Forget religion. Forget stupid flags. Forget the past history which really wasn't that interesting at all anyway. And please forget the politicians - the only ones gaining from this.<br>
<br>
Sort it out Northern Ireland - Your disgracing the entire Western World.<br>

(well I have but still)<br>
<br>
Politicians are ruining everywhere. Let's not put that as a major thing about N Ireland. There may be more Politicians than any other European government, but I still think they are everywhere and it's not a local related problem.<br>
<br>
As for religion, well you know my views on THAT. It creates hatred. I think it does fuel hatred and violence, and if not it gives a great excuse.<br>
<br>
One thing is that people are just looking for trouble. The most obvious thing would be something that I know England also has problems with, but maybe on a more minor key. Large gangs, of say 40 people, that get baseball bats and go hunting around parks for people to attack. This happened a few years ago in a case I won't mention, where they leave there area to go into a peaceful area that is better than theres, and cause violence. They pick on innocent people and if they catch them they beat them. This has absolutely nothing to do with the flags issue, yet it did happen on Sunday morning. There are hockey pitches in the South of the city beside a big park, and a man was found dead. He had been attending a night at a local hotel with workmates and went for a walk. He knows Belfast well yet he is from somewhere else. The park is well known for gay meetings, so perhaps it had something to do with that. He was battered to death with baseball bats and some type of 'iron bar' the police say. Now it is obvious to me, before they say who he is or give information that it was one of these groups who went hunting, leaving the area they live in to beat the hell out of innocent people walking in a park at night. He obviously ran from them. His car wasn't far away and I think it wasn't damaged at all, but he was in such a way that you wouldn't recognise him. That is just an example of the violence that has nothing to do with religion.<br>
<br>
The new police constable is now here, and he is good I think as he is a new radical, and I hope he will introduce zero-tolerance for riots.<br>
<br>
In another case policemen pulled over a man for drunk driving. A mob of around 80 people from local pubs and clubs chased them, surrounded them, and the police had to shot into the air to get them to go away. The person they stopped escaped and the 5 policemen where hurt, not badly but still hurt. This also happened in the last 48 hours.<br>
<br>
I don't know about it being a successful part of the UK, but I don't think people realise it is part of Ireland, and I think it's the idea of a foreign army on an island...as for Wales, its controlled pretty much by London....Edinburgh is doing better for itself, yet Glasgow is the true Scottish capital anyone smartass will know.(I know it).. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/ubrenfitz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BrenFitz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.unique-hardware.co.uk/server-smilies/cwm/alien/coolmad.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br><BR><img src=http://home.datacomm.ch/m2karchives/realm.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>KFC Monster<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-mod.gif /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 9/10/02 9:56:22 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: Flags Issue</span><hr size=1> Outside the Liverpool town Hall they fly both the Union Jack and St. George's Cross<br>
<br>
When I went to Edinboro' on holiday they had the Union Jack and St. Andrews Cross (is that the right name for it ?)<br>
<br>
And when I went to Wales last year Swansea Town hall flew both the Union Jack and the Welsh Dragon.<br>
<br>
The Aussies and the Kiwi's both still have the Union Jack on thier Flags.<br>
<br>
The point I am getting at is that These days flags, borders, divides, religions are so messed up that some people make uo their own rules, or are influenced by biased opinions. <br>
The example of the 'person stirring it up' about the irish flag being flown along with the Union Jack is just someone trying to start trouble for their own political belifs IMHO <p></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/ubrenfitz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BrenFitz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.unique-hardware.co.uk/server-smilies/cwm/alien/coolmad.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/10/02 10:57:35 pm<br></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCE6FF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/bbbarden.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=swallow>Swallow</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Dissolving<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-2-1.gif /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 9/14/02 9:50:42 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Ireland</span><hr size=1> I think unity is what Ireland needs, it seems crazy that England has taken so long to pull out, its about time they did give it back to the Irish.

Union Jack or Irish tricolour, does it matter? I live in South Wales (Swansea) and I am Engish, here the attitudes are relaxed you have the Welsh Dragon and the Union Jack flying side by side, the English are welcome - NO hostily, even with a very english accent! You go to north Wales, and it is different, there are many more Nationalists, the english are often made to feel unwelcome even treated as ousiders - invaders, (I am generalisng here) I think that is wrong. why can't people just exist side by side and get on with it?  The troubles in Ireland have been long and drawn out, it is about the english left them alone, I mean it is not as if england have an empire to keep anymore, what are they doing?<br>
Let the flags fly together, and let the politicians sort the borders out, let the people at last pick up the pieces and re-educate themselves.<br>

(oh, welsh, heheheh *giggles* - I can't help myself!)<br>
<br>
The only point I suppose I should make is that the Union Jack is the four flags put together - Scottish, Ulster, Wales and England - so there is nothing really against it being put up outside Liverpool Town Hall or other places....<br>
<br>
It is in cases only used to show who rules and where....such as the way over here the UVF have put up Israeli flags and the others have put up Palestine flags - they are big supporters of the countries! honestly! it has nothing to do with indicating a terroritial war!<br>
<br>
I think uniting Ireland would solve the problems to be quiet honest, and I think it's going to happen anyhow whether people politicians want it to or not - they might be able to control how long it is before it happens but they won't stop it for too long.<br>
<br>
As for the flags, well it's an obvious childish battle, and it's kind of a case of Gibraltar - don't ask me why! lol<br>
<br>
As for Welsh nationalists - maybe they would be more happy with a Welsh parliament. I don't know much (well I probably know more than most people) about the Welsh system but I think it's mostly controlled by London (Act of England and Wales). I think it should be more like the Scottish Parliament - I think they should get more rights too. I don't know if I would want independance as a Scottish person, because I am not one...but I would want difference and they have that maybe...*stops blabbering* <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCE6FF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/bbbarden.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=swallow>Swallow</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Dissolving<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-2-1.gif /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 9/15/02 6:17:16 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Ireland</span><hr size=1> Yup, London has overall control over Wales, more-so than Scotland (where I was going to live!), though the Welsh assembely controls a lot of &quot;inner&quot; matters.

<br>
BTW- Confounding, why does welsh make you giggle? <br>

Always makes me giggle when they say &quot;come yer&quot; because they can't pronouce &quot;here&quot;! A word of advice though: Don't try to learn the language- it is so hard!
