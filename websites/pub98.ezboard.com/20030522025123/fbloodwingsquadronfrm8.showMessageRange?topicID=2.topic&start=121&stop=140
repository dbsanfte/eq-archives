ARGH!</span><hr size=1> Please, everyone, let's all just settle down.  This vitriole is starting to make me tired and sick to my stomach...seriously<br>
<br>
Nobody wins in this non-stop bickering.   We all know where we all think fault lies, and it's obvious that no one is going to change his or her opinion on anything.  Besides which, I finally get that airing grievances publicly doesn't work.   Trying privately doesn't work all that well either, as it turns out.    <br>
<br>
It's just so stupid, and I'm so, SO tired of it.   Can we all, for the sake of the tiny shreds of sanity that we hold dear, just let it go, or at least call it a truce?   Nobody here needs this aggravation of the emotional schizophrenia rampaging through this thread.  <br>
<br>
Okay, that's all I've got.   I'm sorry I couldn't pitch in sooner, but I was out of the office this morning at an appointment.  So, there you have it.  <br>
<br>
Thanks.  <br>

It was good reading, that's for sure.<br>
<br>
Anyway, tonight's show will supposedly feature a match between Roddy Piper and Rikishi.  I can only describe that prospect as scary:   scantily-clad guy who likes to sit on people vs. guy who hasn't wrestled in fifteen years.<br>
<br>
For the men, there will supposedly be a bikini competition as well.   Yup, that has lots of cultural value, I'm sure.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Oh, and the latest column by Edge is up on the official site.  His recovery from neck surgery goes well, hooray for him!   FyreNyght, you really should read it.   He had thoughts on hockey all the time, being a Canadian and all!  <br>
<br>
That's it.  I'm out.  <br>

<br>
Last night's &quot;Smackdown!&quot; featured much of the usual but entertaining nonsense.    Rowdy Roddy Piper, appearing highly out of shape and lacking the tan that most wrestlers at least have a bit of, got smacked around by Rikishi until, of course, interference occurred.  Brock Lesnar showed up only to get his head cut open, sealing his upcoming victory at Backlash on Sunday...as if John Cena has a chance of becoming world champion anyway.   However, Cena did provide my new favorite phrase for the moment.:  &quot;Feel the pain, dog!&quot;<br>
<br>
For the guys, there was a Sable Invitational featuring WWE Divas in bikinis.  Did it serve any point?  Well, no, not really, but I'm sure the male viewers enjoyed it.    Of course, it ended in catfighting as well, which was expected.  <br>
<br>
That's about all for now.   I'll update on Monday with my thoughts on the Backlash results.  In the meantime, I'm off to get my first ever filling, and then it's time to bowl!    Rock on!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rock --><img src=http://www.mudai-mfg.com/rock-smiley.gif ALT=":rock"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The Rock says, &quot;Don't miss the Rock's last performance for the next few months, this Sunday at Backlash.   The Rock is SO going to be beat down, but don't worry.  It's all staged.&quot;<br>

I really would like to see Backlash this weekend though and glimpse The Rock one last time before he heads back to star-dom land.<br>

The Rock thanks for you for your interest.   Now, it's on to confront Whisher Bisquits, Goldberg.&quot;<br>

Having just seen the Rock on Sunday Night Heat here at my parents' house, talking up his big match tonight and showing Lillian Garcia just what nice muscles he has, I received renewed inspiration...as well as some Rock face time, which I always appreciate.   Anyway, here is my pre-Backlash poem, written as I think it up and watch &quot;Star Wars&quot; on TBS.:<br>
<br>
Help me, People's Champ, the Brahma Bull:  You're my only hope!<br>
You're going to leave me once again.   It makes me want to mope.<br>
Tonight you take on Whisker Bisquits, better known as Goldberg, Bill.<br>
Despite your obvious superiority, as Yoda would say:  Lose, you will.<br>
One may find my lack of faith disturbing, but I can see how it'll play out.<br>
Any bickering is pointless:   The Rock is surely on his way out.<br>
<br>
Hollywood is calling again, and the Rock will take the call.<br>
You'll soon see him again at the cineplex or a theatre at the mall.<br>
He's not yet Swarzenegger,  and he'll never have that accent.<br>
I'd bet, though, that he makes enough to pay a hefty rent.<br>
Even if he doesn't, he'll always have my admiration.<br>
Oooh, there are the charred remains of the Lars.  Well, D**nation!<br>
Anyway, back on target, the Rock is leaving me again.<br>
I'm sure he'll come back in just a few months, maybe for SummerSlam?   <br>
That probe droid is nasty.   The needles I use are not that bad!<br>
Uhhh...moving on, the Rock still rules.  His leaving makes me mad.<br>
Now they're on commercial break, so conclude the poem I plan to do.<br>
Oh Rock, my Rock, your parting is sure to make me blue!<br>
Come back to me again someday, will you promise me, Rock?<br>
In the meantime, it's back to the Next Big Thing, better known as Brock.<br>
Sure, he's a Neanderthal, and doesn't have your personality.<br>
But he's just going to have to do, though there's truly only you for me.<br>
Adieu, dear Rock, People's Champion, Brahma Bull, I hope to see you soon.<br>
You're far more like a space station than any supposed small moon.<br>

Apparently, after the PPV last night he pretty much told the audience that.   He could show up on &quot;Raw&quot; tonight, but I doubt it.  I don't really have the juice in me for another poem at the moment, but inspiration will show up at some point.<br>
Gosh, I'll miss him.    Losing him is like watching the Cubs without the drunken musings and ramblings of Harry Carey.  It's just not as much fun.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>&quot;You are such a nutcase!

Hello...Stone Cold?</span><hr size=1> Well, I haven't yet mustered the energy for another poem, but I do have a Rock update.    The official site of Bill &quot;Whisker Bisquits&quot; Goldberg has posted online the entire match from Backlash in little segments.   It was pretty cool to watch even though I knew the outcome.   I have to agree that Goldberg doesn't quite seem in sync with his wrestling yet, but he's probably just rusty.   Gosh, I love the Rock.   Oddly, Coach seems to love the Rock too.   He kept talking about what &quot;beautiful condition&quot; he was in and such.   Hmmm.  Even the King told him to stop sucking up to the Rock, and the King was pro-Rock too.   Anyway, I was glad to see the match....further proof that I don't need cable. <br>
<br>
In other news, I was surprised to read that Stone Cold returned again to &quot;Raw&quot; as co-general manager.  Huh?  Apparently, his injuries are real, so now he's more of a backstage, on-camera type of guy.  I'm not sure how well this will work for him, being more famous for pummeling people, but we'll see.  Well, somebody will see.   I'm not watching &quot;Raw&quot; anymore now that the Rock has left me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :boohoo --><img src=http://www.mudai-mfg.com/sad-smiley-009.gif ALT=":boohoo"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->        <br>

One week they are the hero and role model of everyone.  The next year they become the villian.  It happened with Bruiser, Hulk, and Stone Cold.  It will probably happen to the Rock.<br>

He was a cowardly villain during the whole feud with Goldberg, blathering away about how wonderful he was one minute and ducking out the first door available whenever Goldberg showed up.  It was stinkin' hilarious.    I love that guy!<br>
        As for soaps, mine is &quot;General Hospital.&quot;   I used to have this crush on the guy that played Jax and subsequently named my gerbil (both I. and II.) after the character.  His real name is Ingo Rademacher, which is wacky enough.  <br>
       &quot;Days of our Lives,&quot; though, that's a funny show!  I saw it a few weeks ago while waiting to get my sunroof looked at. (I broke it in a fit of rage over getting my first cavity.  How scary am I?)  Marlena had twins with Tony DiMeira, apparently, some time ago.    Who knew?   <br>
