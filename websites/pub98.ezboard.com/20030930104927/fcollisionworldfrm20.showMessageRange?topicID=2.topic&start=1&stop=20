Darren stumbled into the quaint-looking coffee shop, still half-asleep.  He ordered a coffee with four sugars, no cream.  He liked it sweet.  He picked up a local newspaper and started to read, sipping his coffee while catching up on the latest news. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mezumikatorizu@collisionworld>Mezumika Torizu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/4/03 8:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suzy Q's</span><hr size=1> &quot;hot...chocolate...CHOCOLATE!

She runs into the store, isn't watching where she's going and runs straight into a man reading a newspaper.<br>
&quot;ouch...&quot; She whines rubbing her head. &quot;she looks over and sees the man.<br>
&quot;AHH!!! I'm so sorry!&quot; She screams.<br>

If I'm wrong, just say otherwise!)<br>
<br>
Darren straightened himself up and tried to glare at whoever just ran into him when his breath was caught in his throat.  'Holy hell,' he thought.  'Are those cat ears?  Or am I just tired?'<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah!&quot; she screamed, her eyes gleaming.  &quot;I'm so sorry!&quot;<br>
<br>
Darren swallowed a bit.  He had never in his entire life seen something quite like her.  His first instinct on seeing something new was to pummel it into the ground, a decision usually reinforced by the new thing's intense desire to tear him to pieces.  In this case, however, he felt that perhaps courtesy would be the best way to go.  She could speak, after all, and seemed like a kind cat... person... thing.  'Are people like her common in these parts?', he wondered.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's... it's no problem... just try to be more careful okay?&quot;  He was exceptionally nervous, due mostly to the lady's appearance.  It wasn't everyday he talked to a half-human, half-cat, after all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mezumikatorizu@collisionworld>Mezumika Torizu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/4/03 10:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suzy Q's</span><hr size=1> &quot;I'll be more careful next time I swear!!&quot; Mezi promised. <br>
<br>
&quot;Of course...&quot;She began to think to herself. &quot;I said that to a person a while back and well...never mind.&quot; She shook the thought out of her head and then looked up at the man she had just ran over.&quot;Wait...&quot; She bagan thinking again. &quot;He doesn't have a tail...or ears like me...what kinda world is this?&quot; She began deciding if she wanted to ask him about it but decides not to.<br>
<br>
&quot;I really am sorry about that...really...it's just that well....I kinda get excited when I hear the word chocolate.&quot; She explained.<br>
<br>
Just then she turned right around to the counter behind her and to get a glass of hot chocolate.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyways...I'm Mezumika, Mezi for short. And you are?&quot; She asks after turning back around to him. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mezumikatorizu@collisionworld>Mezumika Torizu</A> at: 2/4/03 10:31:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thearchimage>The Archimage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/4/03 10:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suzy Q's</span><hr size=1> &quot;...Darren Loria,&quot; he said, after briefly considering using a fake name.  Not that he expected people to recognize the name here, but it simply wasn't good practice to drop your name around everywhere when you were in his line of work.  He ultimately decided that it couldn't hurt in this case.  &quot;Nice to meet you, Mezi.&quot;<br>
<br>
He set the newspaper down and smiled.  He was starting to feel a bit more comfortable, now that he knew she was, basically, human.  &quot;Listen... I'm sort of new in town, and...&quot;  He briefly considered what would bet the most tactful way to ask his question, and came up with, &quot;I don't mean to sound rude, but I've never seen anyone quite like you before.  With the cat ears, I mean.  Does that sound strange to you?&quot;<br>

She was wearing a pair of flare leg black pants, a black tank top just high enough so her diamond naval ring showed, a pair of black heels, her necklace, some hoop silver hoop earrings, and her hair down covering her different shades of blonde hair shoulders. She was carrying a think leather jacket over her arm as she walked in. <br>
<br>
          As she took the 4th step inside she looked over at 2 people talking. One a guy and the other a person with...&quot;cat ears?&quot;, she thought to herself. She shrugged it off and decided not to stare, after all, she had seen some interesting sights before, this didn't necessarily bother her the least bit. She walked over to the counter and ordered a mocha expresso, paid what she owed, and grabbed a near by newspaper. She had only been in this place for 2 hours so reading what was going on in this city seemed like fun. She took the expresso and paper and took a seat in the middle of the shop, she didn't feel like the sun shining on her just yet, it was just too early. <br>
         After reading the cover of the newspaper she took a sip of her expresso, and not realizing how hot it was filled her mouth with more than is needed. She squinted her eyes, swallowed very fast, and stuck out her tounge to fan her mouth with her hand. Her silver tounge ring shined as she made the fast movements too cool her tounge. She put her hand on her cheek and laughed a little to herself as she realized how many times she has done that in her life. She stopped squinting her eyes and opened them widely. She had very bright green eyes and long eyelashes. She ran her hand threw her hair as she looked up for a second at the guy talking to the cat person, then back down at the paper. She wiped her mouth with a small napkin that she picked up before sitting down at the table and took one more look at the guy. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=athenaoreily>Athena OReily</A> at: 2/5/03 4:42:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chibinekosushichan>ChibiNekoSushiChan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/5/03 5:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suzy Q's</span><hr size=1> Hiroko glanced around, wondering what made her step into the coffee shop in her search.

His mind latched onto something she said, and he suddenly became much more interested.  'Hasn't seen anyone that looks like me'?  'Feel kinda alone'?  It occured to him that this girl might need some help.  And his philosophy was to always do what he could to help people.  <br>
<br>
He asked, &quot;Is something the matter?  Are you lost?  Or looking for someone?  If you are, I'll be glad to do whatever I can to help you.  If you need anything, just ask.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mezumikatorizu@collisionworld>Mezumika Torizu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/6/03 7:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suzy Q's</span><hr size=1> &quot;Interesting?

&quot;Nothing is really the matter...you'd think begin on my own for the past 10 1/2 years I would get used to being alone but I guess not...&quot; She was about to go into how she is really here looking for clues on her parents sudden deaths but decided not to in the end.<br>
<br>
&quot;He said he would try and help but...I really don't want to bother him...&quot;She thinks to herself. She was so into her thoughts that she didn't notice how close she really put her hot chocolate to the edge of the counter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hot! Hot! AH!&quot; She screams as the cup goes flying into her lap. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Minutes later she finally got most of it cleaned up.<br>

She was hiding something, he could tell... but he wasn't going to press the matter if she didn't want him to.  &quot;Alright.  If you say so.&quot;<br>
<br>
When she spilled her hot chocolate, Darren readily handed her tissues to clean herself up, and wiped down the counter without complaint.  &quot;You have to be more careful,&quot; he admonished gently.  He was starting to wonder whether this girl was a little clumsy...<br>
<br>
When that was finished, his eyes darted to the clock.  Shoot, it was later than he thought it was.  He was getting seriously bogged down here, and he needed to continue investigating this city.  He told Mezi, &quot;It was nice meeting you... but unfortunately I have to go now.  Hey... listen, if you're ever in trouble, just holler.  I'll hear you and come running.&quot;  He paused to down the last of his coffee and smiled.  &quot;After all, us weird-looking people have to stick together!&quot;  He gave her a playful wink and left his money on the table to pay for his coffee before leaving the shop. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mezumikatorizu@collisionworld>Mezumika Torizu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/7/03 6:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suzy Q's</span><hr size=1> &quot;BYE!&quot; She yells waving her hand.

He leaned agaisnt the wall, eyes closed, looking very troubled. <br>

<br>
One worker stopped and looked at her in a questioning way.  &quot;Yeah?  What'll ya have?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, I don't want a drink...&quot; Mandy said, shaking her head, &quot;I understand that you're in need of some help.  I've come to apply for the job.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hold on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mandy watched the worker go back into the kitchen, then allowed her eyes to wander.  She saw a man sitting on the ground against the wall...*what's with that guy?  He looks really sad.*  She thought, watching him.  <br>
<br>
She gathered up her courage and walked over to him.  She knelt on her knees in front of him and asked, &quot;are you all right?&quot;<br>
