While they spoke, she looked at the river's calm, placid black surface, her breath ragged.  Her eyes darted back and forth, and she looked like a small child separated form her mother. <br>
<br>
&quot;I--I-&quot;  She breathed, unable to form anymore words.  Her lips moved endlessly but she made no sound.  She ignored them as they talked, shivering from the immense cold wetness.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have to find Seif!&quot; she blurted suddenly, a tremor in her voice.  &quot;He can't swim! Dammit!&quot; her fists plunged into the muddy bank before her.  &quot;Why the hell didn't he let me teach him!?&quot;  She staggered to her feet, and instantly toppled right over, inbalanced.  Then she rose again, stubling, but staying on her feet more or less.  For a minute she paused and marveled at Eevee, who darted through the air like a giant firefly.  Faeries, they were called?  They were a rare sight to see in Mahtim, most of them had been killed in the Terrible Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
She shook her head of the thoughts.  She turned from them, and ran downstream in search of her friend.  In any other case, she wouldn't have left them behind, but...<br>

&quot;Er...&quot;<br>
<br>
She heard his distant moan and stopped.  In the white mist that covered the river surface, her heart stopped when she saw his broad shouldered figure, slumped over a floating log.  Through the fog, she saw his half lidded eyes stare at her obliviously, as if he really didn't see her.<br>
<br>
Then, with a low moan, he slipped from the log and under the water, the water stilling almost as soon as he disappeared, not even a bubble surfacing.<br>

Eris' scream could be heard from miles around.<br>

She didn't have a good feeling about the city and the scream and some how all of it being linked together.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oi. Nina.. hold on tight. This time I'm actually going to have to run rather than that scampering I was doing before.&quot;  With that the girl took off in a full sprint towards the scream, feet barely touching the floor. <br>

He opened his eyes.  Oh, good Gods!  What a beautiful sight for one so near death!  She was a woman, her eyes slanted and large, blue like the moon Una, her hair silver like Lunai, and her luscious lips like the bloodstained moon Oni.  Her skin was tinged pale blue, and her slender body bore no clothing, but bore none of a human woman's marks.  Her skin was smooth and pale blue, and her long, slender legs ended in delicate fins that were tinged green at the ends.  Other of her kind surrounded her, and him, but he pad no heed to them.  She was their queen.<br>

The river nymph stretched her slender limbs to him and pulled him near, and he submitted willingly, lost in her soothing song.  She closed her full red lips over his, filling his lungs with the breath of the underwater dwellers.  She fell backward in a lovely dance, pulling him down into the dark deep, their lips never parting.<br>

She ran into the shallows, trudging agaisn the silent, swift current.  &quot;Seif, I'm coming!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
She dove underwater, being a very good swimmer, she scissor kicked downward until her ears popped form the pressure, and her lungs seared with fire.<br>
<br>
The water was swirling black.  She couldn't see anything.  But she could hear singing...voices in the water...<br>
<br>
River nymphs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dammit!!&quot; she swore, the oath issuing form her mouth in a cloud of bubbles.  She turned around, trying to see through the darkness.<br>
<br>
And there floated before her, a male nymph.<br>
<br>
Handsome he was, his skin pale blue.  His hair was almost as dark as the water, and his eyes the color of algae.  He remained silent, but outstretched his hand to her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bite me!&quot; she spat.  More bubbles.<br>
<br>
He shook his beautiful head.  &quot;I wish not to bite you, love.&quot; He drew her near with a swift, fluid motion. His voice was musical, like a song of temptation that made Eris' skin tingle. &quot;Only to kiss you...and hold you forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
He met her lips, subtly, and Eris fell victim to his charms, beginning to fall under the spell.<br>

She swam off towards shore as fast as her legs would carry her, hoping the nymph wouldn't follow her...<br>

(btw Thalia's immune to the river nymphs, as she is a nymph herself, and she's REALLY OOC right now) <p>~Z<br>

Her lungs filled with new air from the nymph's kiss, she felt awake and alert again.  And worried for Seifer.<br>
<br>
She fought viciously against Thalia's firm grip.  &quot;Nooo!&quot; she blurted bubbles again, fighitng her.  *I have to find Seifer! Those bitches are gonna kill him!!! Let me go!*<br>
<br>
She broke free of Thalia's grasp and bolted back into the darkness.  She encountered the male nymph again, but, now clearheaded, drew her dagger and stabbed him in the gut, green blood clouding around them both as the nymph let loose a shrill scream.<br>
<br>
She kept swimming downward, the nymph's song growing nearer...<br>
***********<br>
Seifer laid upon a rock, his vest and undershirt opened and revealing his chest.  His eyes filled with spell induced lust, his wrists limp and willing in the bindings.  The nymph sang to him gently, caressing the nape of his neck as she tied a necklace of smooth, riverwashed pebbles around his neck, placing kisses on his chest.  She was straddled on his waist.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Be you my lover...be with me forever</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she sang, brushing her cold fingers against his cheek.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You are mine...forever...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Forever</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Seifer murmured dreamily in his thoughts, his half lidded eyes burning with love for the seductress.<br>

He didn't see the shadow emerging from above, holding a golden dagger soaked with nymph blood.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#FF9300>(3/9/03 10:12:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm152.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seductress</span><hr size=1> Eevee gasped... there was Seifer on a rock... his shirt open and the nymph with a dagger.<br>
