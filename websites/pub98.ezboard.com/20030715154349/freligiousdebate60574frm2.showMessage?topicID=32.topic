are they defined by the majority of people living, a few people with a lot of money and power or something higher than us all.<br>
<br>
i think there is something much more encompassing than scientific law.  scientific law is a sub set of what i refer to as celestial law.  doesn't slavery just feel wrong to you?  if so why?  why does it feel wrong to kill someone or even take their shoes after you've walked a mile in them?<br>
<br>
even when the majority of this country tried to rationalize slavery as okay celestial law defined it as wrong so it felt wrong even to the slave owner's kid until he or she was brainwashed to believe otherwise.<br>
<br>
so who is right and why?  the entire slave owning usa or god and i?<br>

i hope that doesn't sound self-righteous but i was just wondering what the smart people around here think and &quot;feel&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mightyk>MightyK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/3/03 2:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: celestial law</span><hr size=1> Universal Morals?

<br>
We are a societal (is that a word?) animal. Society can not exisit without some sense of order. In order for order to happen there needs to be some sort of conformity by the society to a general set of morals. But those morals are going to vary from society to society. <br>

society can't shape scientific or celestial law only discover it.<br>

i guess a problem arises when someone is happy going against celestial law (like usama) i would have to say he is brainwashed just like he might say the same thing about me.<br>

This is how I look at it too, only I would go so far as to say that in the &quot;big picture&quot; there is no distinction between is scientific and what is moral, between physical and spiritual.  But, that's a lot to wrap our underdevloped mortal brains around <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For many years, and probably in some places still, humans could easily think that the sun revolves around the earth, but when you back away and look at it from a larger perspective you see that that just isn't so.  I think that just like that person would be sitting there actually revolving around the sun but thinking the sun was revolving around htem, there are moral laws that people are living by/not living by and reaping the corresponding consequences but not seeing it (yet....).<br>
<br>
Well...not sure I&quot;m explaining that like I mean it (I'm sure DBC will help point out the flaws <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , &quot;who are ye, who are so wise in the ways of science?&quot;), but I've got to run, baby calls yet again.<br>

There are several answers to this so I’m not sure if you are looking for general or personal responses. Are you not familiar with Thomas Hobbes and the “social contract”? This is one way or even John Stuart Mill’s Utilitarianism could be used to choose what is right and moral (in this case, that which creates the greatest utility). Most atheists act in a way that betters humanity and improves our beautiful planet, not because it is proscribed, rather because it makes sense and is logical to do that which creates the most happiness, especially since we do not believe in an afterlife. There are many biological impulses as well—you mentioned murder. It is “feels” wrong because it is against nature and would thwart the evolutionary process to go around murdering each other. This is starting to bring me back to Hobbes, so rather than recant his work, I would refer you there and to the work of modern materialists. Suffice to say that atheists have lower divorce, rape, murder, and theft rates and are better educated and more financially stable, so whatever our individual motivations, they seem to be much more effective at creating cosmic harmony that your or any other religion.<br>
<br>
”doesn't slavery just feel wrong to you? if so why?”<br>
Largely because of the time and society into which I was born, but also my ideas about human value. Your bible advocates slavery all over the place too, so even if the added LDS gospels decided it was wrong, your Jehovah was all for it in the OT particularly. No high ground for you guys here---sorry. <br>
<br>
”even when the majority of this country tried to rationalize slavery as okay celestial law defined it as wrong so it felt wrong even to the slave owner's kid until he or she was brainwashed to believe otherwise.”<br>
Which slave owner’s kid would you be referring to? Slavery was widely accepted all over the world and only started to go away around the 18th C (America was the last to do away with it) but many looked to the bible and the pro-slavery verses there which they had been “brainwashed” to believe were inspired by a sky daddy to justify and rationalize this. Look no further than your own holy books for this—<br>
<br>
What the bible says about slavery-<br>
&quot;Slaves, be obedient to those who are your earthly masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as to Christ....&quot; Ephesians 6:5<br>
&quot;When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be punished; for the slave is his money.&quot; Exodus 21:20<br>
&quot;As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from the nations that are round about you. You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and they may be your property. You may bequeath them to your sons after you, to inherit as a possession forever; you may make slaves of them, but over your brethren the people of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness.&quot; Leviticus 25:44<br>
Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, . . . and they shall be your possession . . . they shall be your bondmen forever.&quot; Leviticus 25:45-46<br>
&quot;Let all who are under the yoke slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be defamed. Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are brethren; rather they must serve all the better since those that benefit by their service are believers and beloved.&quot; 1 Timothy 6:1<br>
&quot;If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. . . . And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the manservants do.&quot; &quot;Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes....&quot; Luke 12:37<br>
&quot;Bid slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect...&quot; Titus 2:9<br>
<br>
”so who is right and why? the entire slave owning usa or god and i?”<br>
Not your slave promoting wargod, but then I’m sure he changed his mind about this like he did black people eventually…awfully indecisive and vindictive picture of a deity there—uffda! BTW—I find this claim that LDS were against enslaving African-americans odd and hypocritical coming from a religion that withheld the priesthood from blacks with no good explanation and turned the skins of people and all of their innocent children dark as punishment for non-belief in an egoistical, insecure deity. <br>
<br>
So, yes morality has changed and evolved over time--even within religion since it is man invented anyway and slavery was implemented man against man then prohibited later as we evolved socially and politically....sort of the same way xianity embraced slavery then abandoned it. I guess there's no difference there...interesting....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

mamag, thanks for the lengthy response telling me what i believe.  i could also post tons of scriptures that refer to lakes of fire and brimstone but i know none of us are going swiming there the same way i know we are a spiritual family and that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are principles defined by celestial law and not by man.  i hope i didn't sound like i am the authority on celestial law because the only part of it i have discovered is what i've had the chance to experience and live.<br>
<br>
i know everything based on how i feel and imperical data found later always strengthens what i already knew in the first place.<br>
<br>
remember what DBC was saying about the court case decided based on feelings?  that's exactly what happens and is why i want judges to understand as much of celestial law as possible so that the balance between justice and mercy is fairly given.  if two people go to court stating contradictory statements (he smashed my car window, no i didn't) then it is up to the judge to basically feel out the liar.<br>
<br>
you are telling me that killing doesn't feel wrong to you only it is the better logical economical choice?  if you killed me and took all my stuff and used my wife and kids as your slave you would have less money?  how's that?  by dismissing an ultimate truth there is no point to living a good and decent life.  don't get me wrong, i am glad you still choose to do so, but i fail to see the economic advantage of following celestial law only the spiritual comfort of bettering myself and maybe someone else.<br>

You state what you believe and I quote you and the bible you say you believe in. This is a misrepresentation, and sadly an attempt to circumvent addressing the scripture you stand behind...or perhaps you do not believe in the OT and NT? I thought Mormons did.<br>

WRONG--may you never serve on a jury in this country. Jury members are instructed on exactly the opposite of this. If two guys tell a different story about the car window evidence must be presented-the least credible of which is always eye witness accounts or even first party confessions. There could be fingerprints, dna, strands of clothing or splinters from the defendants bat or a video tape. If a preponderance cannot be found you must acquit, based not on your celestial feelings about the guy, but the evidence and facts presented. <br>
<br>
&quot;you are telling me that killing doesn't feel wrong to you only it is the better logical economical choice?&quot;<br>
No I clearly stated that killing my own species is anti-thetical to my own nature. It is against my genetics and would not have allowed us to survive and evolve. You confused arguments.<br>
<br>
&quot;if you killed me and took all my stuff and used my wife and kids as your slave you would have less money?&quot;<br>
Actually, I would be following the scriptures, but I am befuddled as to why you think murderers are necessarily theives and slavemasters. Perhaps too much bible reading? No dag, most folks don't enslave the wife and children of their victims, nor do they steal their money, but that's not the social and economic good I meant anyway and it's clear you have never read Hobbes and have no idea about the social contract so I'll try to find a link for you somewhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;by dismissing an ultimate truth there is no point to living a good and decent life.&quot;<br>
A typical xian argument. If you don't believe in god there's no point in being moral. Too bad you think the only reason to do what is right is out of selfish desire to go to a higher heaven and be rewarded with godship or to avoid heck. I am sorry for you and would like you to explain the reason atheists have such lower divorce, rape, murder, theft, and every other crime rates and better education and finance levels if your theology does a better job of providing moral guidance.<br>

&quot;i fail to see the economic advantage of following celestial law only the spiritual comfort of bettering myself and maybe someone else.&quot;<br>
I do not recognize celestial law--that is a Mormon term. There is an economic, social and outright human advantage in abiding by a social contract to recognize certain rights and codes of conduct. It's not that slapping the crap out of some people wouldn't do them some good or make me feel better, besides the fact it's not very mature or productive, if we all went around behaving this way there would soon be anarchy and discomfort for myself and my family. The stability of agreeing to live in a society with laws we say we will abide by provides a better and more secure life for me and everyone else just as helping the poor and providing educational opportunity for others helps society and ultimately myself and family in the long run---not to get to heaven or keep from burning, but in creating more intelligent, financially stable, empowered citizens. <br>

Make more sense? I'll try to find a Leviatian excerpt or site--I've only got hardcopies at hand somewhere in my storage, so it's not handy.<br>

What of those who don't feel as you do. Are these laws black and white or shades of gray? Who decides where the line is drawn. <br>

If murder didn't feel wrong to you, would that be a reason to go out and murder people? I don't murder people not because it feels wrong. I'll even admit that there are times when I think murder would feel very right. I tend to have a very strong vigilanti impulse in me. There are even certain circumstances that I would probably sit down think out then hunt and kill another person. BUT As much as MY feelings on what is right and what is wrong doesn't mean that I can do it. Logically I know murder is bad for a productive society and vigilanti acts are even worse. <br>
