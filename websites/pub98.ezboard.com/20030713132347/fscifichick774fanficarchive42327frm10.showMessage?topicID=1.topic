Author's Note: For those of you who recognize the title, I have been watching entirely too much Scooby-Doo with my kids. But, the title fit, and it has nothing to do with the premise of that episode of the cartoon show, so I'm borrowing it.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Sara sat at the break room table, flipping through an old magazine that she figured Catherine or one of the day shift women left in there. Nick walked in and grabbed a Coke out of the refrigerator. He walked behind her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ten signs you need to find a new man,&quot; he read aloud over her shoulder. She looked up at him and gave him a partial smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi Nick,&quot; she greeted. He smiled, but then scrunched his face up like he was somewhat squinting his eyes. &quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're wearing makeup,&quot; he commented. What can only be called an evil grin then surfaced on his lips. &quot;Who is he?&quot; She turned around in her seat to talk to him better.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is who?&quot; She asked, trying to hide any emotion, but almost giggling.<br>
<br>
&quot;They guy you're out to snag,&quot; he responded and then took a drink. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not out to snag anyone,&quot; she said, and turned back in her chair. He came around to sit across from her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay,&quot; he said in a tone indicating that he clearly didn't believe her. &quot;The guy you're trying to get to notice you then.&quot; She looked up to see that smug expression of his all over his face. She narrowed her eyes at him and he grinned broadly. Warrick walked in, only catching the last part of what Nick said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey guys,&quot; he greeted and sat down next to Sara. She smiled at him and both said hi. &quot;So what were you talking about?&quot; Nick leaned back in his chair, even more confident now that he thought he could get Warrick to back him up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sara's wearing makeup,&quot; Nick started. Warrick glanced at her and then back to Nick.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think she's doing it to get some guy's attention,&quot; he finished. Warrick gave a partial grin and nodded his head once. Nick sat up in his chair, not pleased with Warrick's reaction. &quot;That's it? No guesses as to who it is?&quot; Warrick shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;I already know who it is,&quot; he commented in the most casual tone he could. Warrick looked over at Sara who was now covering her eyes with her hand. He could almost hear her thinking, 'shut up Warrick, shut up', and he had to keep himself from chuckling. Nick noticed this non-verbal exchange and raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;No way Warrick,&quot; he said, taking another drink. &quot;Greg has a better chance than you.&quot; Warrick looked over at him incredulously.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think I'm insulted,&quot; Warrick replied, feigning a hurt look. Grissom and Catherine coming in through the door quickly interrupted their banter. Grissom had his game face on, which was usual, but generally didn't indicate good news. Catherine was smiling, which meant that she probably hadn't been informed of the bad news ahead of time. Catherine sat on Sara's other side and peered over at the magazine.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooh, I haven't seen this one,&quot; she commented. Sara grinned and pushed it over to her while Grissom gave them both a look that made Sara smile and Catherine roll her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;If we could pay attention to the business at hand,&quot; he said. Catherine closed the magazine and faked a smile. &quot;We've got a busy night ahead of us.&quot; He handed files to them. &quot;Nick, you're with Catherine; Warrick, you're with Sara; and I'll take the third.&quot; Nick perused the file for the location.<br>
<br>
&quot;A haunted house?&quot; He asked, a gleam in his eye. Sara frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;We got one too,&quot; she said. Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brass thinks that one of the gangs decided to get inventive with their initiations this year,&quot; he said, keeping his face neutral.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; Catherine mumbled. &quot;That's all we need.&quot; Warrick gave her a compensatory grin as he stood up, and then focused his attention on Sara, who had already gotten up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ready?&quot; He asked. She nodded and they walked out the door. Nick shook his head. Catherine walked out with him.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's wrong Nicky?&quot; She asked with a smile. He grinned and motioned to Grissom.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell ya later,&quot; he answered in an almost whisper.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that about?&quot; Catherine asked Nick as they were pulling away in their Tahoe. Nick gave a mock grumble.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sara has the hots for some guy and she won't tell me who it is,&quot; he said. Catherine gave a small grin tugged at the corners of her mouth. He eyed her suspiciously. &quot;You know who it is,&quot; he observed. Her grin grew a little wider. &quot;Tell me.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Come on!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why do you want to know so badly? Did you make a bet with Warrick or something?&quot; She asked. He rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he paused and smiled, &quot;But I might if you tell me who it is.&quot; Catherine laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cheater.&quot; They drove for a little bit longer until they hit a red light. &quot;What would you do with the information if you had it?&quot; She gave him a pointed glare, but was still grinning.<br>
<br>
&quot;Besides make a bet I couldn't lose?&quot; He asked. Catherine nodded. &quot;Hard to say,&quot; he said after a moment of mock thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh huh. You would tease her endlessly about it,&quot; she retorted. Nick laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;So? I'm kinda like her brother, it's my prerogative,&quot; he kiddingly shot back. She rolled her eyes and slapped him on the arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're an ass, no wonder she doesn't tell you anything,&quot; Catherine said as she tried to hold back her laughter.<br>
<br>
They got out of the car and grabbed their gear, slipping their sterile gloves on along the way. They walked toward the man they recognized to be in charge, showing their identification to the officer at the tape.<br>
<br>
&quot;Longfellow!&quot; Shouted Catherine. He looked over at them and after he finished talking to another police officer he came over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; he greeted. He looked tired and worn out and Catherine gave him a sympathetic grin. &quot;You bring masks? Cuz you're gonna want 'em. It's pretty ripe in there.&quot; Catherine and Nick exchanged disgusted expressions. &quot;Sorry, it looks like the bodies have been here a while though. Whoever killed them picked a good spot, everyone apparently thought they were decorations or just makeup.&quot; Nick nodded as they were walking toward the crime scene. Catherine frowned when she saw the bodies. One man and one woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grissom said there was a theory about it being gang related?&quot; She questioned as she crouched down beside the woman, who looked to have been in her late teens or early twenties.<br>
<br>
&quot;Still unsubstantiated at this point, but the fact that it's initiation time and there were hits at similar locations certainly adds credit to that theory.&quot; He watched as Catherine and Nick started collecting samples and bagging them, and he shook his head. They were in the zone now. &quot;Good luck.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TBC.<br>
<br>
This story isn't going to be too case intensive, so just a warning if you're into that more than the shippy angle. <br>

She had a blinding smile on her face. Warrick came over and looked at it, shaking his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did you find it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Followed the blood spatter,&quot; she answered. She shrugged like it wasn't a big deal, but her smile clearly indicated that she was proud of herself. He nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think we're done here for the night then,&quot; he replied. &quot;Not much more we can do with just flashlights.&quot; Her smile faded and he chuckled. &quot;I'm pretty sure it will still be here tomorrow,&quot; he said in joking condensation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, but it's not the same,&quot; she grumbled, but refused to be put in a bad mood just because they had to leave the crime scene until there was adequate lighting. &quot;So what'd ya get?&quot; She asked smiling. He grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Few fibers,&quot; his smile broadened as he paused, &quot;and it looks like Jane pulled a wad of hair out of the perp's skull.&quot; Sara tried to force a frown to take the place of her smile, but didn't quite succeed.<br>
<br>
&quot;No fair,&quot; she said in mock indignation as they started the walk back to their vehicle.<br>
<br>
&quot;You got the murder weapon,&quot; Warrick pointed out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Possible murder weapon,&quot; she corrected and he rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You sound like Grissom,&quot; he said. She reached for the driver's side door handle, but he scowled at her. &quot;And I'm driving.&quot; Sara shrugged and walked to the other side of the car.<br>
<br>
They arrived back at the lab to find that Nick and Catherine had beaten them back, but Grissom was still out in the field. Nick flashed Sara a grin as she walked into the main lab. She returned it, but really didn't want to start talking to him. She knew that he would eventually bring the conversation to what they had been discussing earlier, so she dropped some bags off after recording the evidence into the computer. She figured she could work on the blood on the knife in one of the smaller labs. About an hour later she felt someone's presence standing behind her.<br>
<br>
&quot;God Nick,&quot; she said in an exasperated tone without looking back, &quot;just let it go okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let what go?&quot; Grissom asked. She turned around to see Grissom standing there, a bemused expression on his face, and quickly swung around back to her work, hoping that he wouldn't see the red hue her cheeks had become.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing, not important. So did you find anything at your scene?&quot; She asked, in a not so subtle attempt to change the topic. He grinned and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;A night of fright is no delight,&quot; he quipped as he moved to her side. She had to keep herself from chuckling and shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;So is that a yes or no?&quot; She asked. He grinned and stepped a little closer. Most people would have considered it an invasion of their personal space, but Sara was so comfortable with him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, although I have no doubt that it will pale in comparison to what you and Warrick brought back.&quot; He watched a large smile form on her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yep! Possible murder weapon and Warrick got hair that looks like it was from the perp that still has the roots,&quot; she answered proudly. He nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Warrick told me.&quot; Grissom began to leave the lab, but turned around on the way out. &quot;Oh, and Nick said to tell you that he's going to find out who the guy is, so you should just tell him.&quot; Sara's eyes grew wide and she froze in place. &quot;What does that mean?&quot; She forced herself to breathe, but refused to look over at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing. You know how Nick is,&quot; she answered, her heart beating faster and faster. 'Damn Nick, damn him,' she thought. He raised his eyebrows a little, but other than that his face remained eerily neutral while he considered this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right,&quot; he finally said and left the lab, silently thinking that Sara should know better than to try and hide something from him. After all, it was his job to investigate.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Grissom ran into Warrick in the hallway and was acknowledged by an upward nod of his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Gris. Sara wanted me to go for a food run after we got back. You want anything?&quot; Warrick asked. Grissom shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since when are you Sara's errand boy?&quot; Grissom remarked with a twinge of sarcasm. Warrick grinned ever so slightly, silently wondering how to play this to his best advantage. He knew he shouldn't be messing with them, but there was no harm in having a little fun was there? He shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;She did find the murder weapon,&quot; he said, as if food was some type of reward. Grissom stared at him. &quot;Plus, she's been looking a little pale lately. I think that's why she wore makeup today.&quot; Grissom narrowed his eyes at him and Warrick chuckled. &quot;Of course, it could always be that one of Nick's theories was right for a change.&quot; Another questioning stare.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want anything,&quot; Grissom finally commented. Warrick raised his eyebrow. &quot;Food,&quot; Grissom clarified. Warrick nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright. Sara tell you what she wanted?&quot; Warrick asked, knowing that Grissom would catch the not so subtle double entendre. Grissom's mouth dropped a little, but he quickly shut it. Warrick had to keep from laughing. &quot;Food?&quot; Grissom scowled at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he responded. Warrick kept on his way down the hall and Grissom frowned. What had he meant by Nick's theory? Obviously something to do with what Sara hadn't been telling him. Catherine would know. Catherine knew everything that was going on within the social structure of their little family. Plus, she had been working with Nick, so he had probably confided in her. He grinned smugly when he saw her in the main lab.<br>
<br>
&quot;Catherine,&quot; he said. She looked up, the goggles still on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gil,&quot; she acknowledged, and looked down at her work again. He came closer, and now stood across from her on the other side of the counter. &quot;Something you wanted?&quot; She asked without looking up again.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is Nick's theory?&quot; He asked. She looked up at him, a smirk on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Theory?&quot; She paused. She knew what he was talking about, but if she let too much leak, then Sara would be angry with her, and an angry Sara was no fun to be around at all. &quot;About the case you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; He gave her a knowing glare and the corners of her mouth started to turn upward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah,&quot; Catherine said, pretending to just catch on. &quot;About the makeup then?&quot; He didn't answer, but kept his eyes fixed on her until she gave him the response he was looking for. She hated it when he did that. Catherine rolled her eyes. &quot;He thinks she's trying to get some guy's attention.&quot; She paused again, an evil thought coming to her mind. &quot;Not that she needs it, most of the guys around here are drooling over her the majority of the time anyway.&quot; He looked at her pointedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see,&quot; he said. She continued looking down in the hopes that he wouldn't see the smirk and smile that was now covering her features. She looked up at him with a faux thoughtful look on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe I should let her raid my closet, I have a red dress I never wear that would great on her,&quot; she commented. He tilted his head slightly and gave her a 'very funny' expression. She shrugged. &quot;Yeah, you're right, Warrick doesn't go for that sort of thing anyway,&quot; she barely managed to get out without laughing at Grissom.<br>
<br>
&quot;Warrick?&quot; He questioned, as his eyes grew wider.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's who Nick thinks it might be,&quot; she replied non-chalantly. Grissom looked confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh,&quot; he said, thinking out loud. &quot;Thanks.&quot; He walked out of the lab, missing the Cheshire-like smile that was plastered across Catherine's lips.<br>
<br>

Grissom glanced up at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Results?&quot; He asked, already knowing the answer. Warrick nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;The hair DNA came back as an 80% match for a Kevin Hughes,&quot; he replied. Grissom stared at him blankly. &quot;He used to run with the gang around Sahara and Charleston, and he was gunned down last year.&quot; Grissom took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes with one hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Seems like I should have remembered that,&quot; he said. Warrick grinned. &quot;So how does this help us now?&quot; Warrick put the paperwork on Grissom's desk.<br>
<br>
&quot;He had a younger brother, and what do you want to bet.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That he's going into the family business,&quot; Grissom finished for him and put his glasses back on. Warrick nodded. &quot;So that's the gang that's probably responsible for all of the killings?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That was my theory,&quot; Warrick said. Grissom grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good theory, especially since Sara's knife results showed fingerprints for another kid in that part of town,&quot; he said. Warrick frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;When did she find that out? She didn't say anything,&quot; he replied. Grissom got a smug look on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure she doesn't tell you everything Warrick,&quot; Grissom said. The situation being enough to almost convince him that Sara, his Sara, doesn't have a thing for the man standing in front of him, at least until Warrick's next comment. The corners of Warrick's lips curled up just barely.<br>
<br>
&quot;She doesn't tell you everything either,&quot; he replied, shooting the smirk right off of Grissom's face. Grissom was silent for a moment, trying to think of the best way to proceed.<br>
<br>
&quot;About that,&quot; Grissom started and realized that Warrick was still standing. &quot;Have a seat.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Warrick asked, taking the chair.<br>
<br>
&quot;You and Sara,&quot; he sighed, &quot;I was trying to think of a delicate way to put this since you've both been through so much, but I can't, so I'm just going to say it. I don't think you should date her, it's against regulations.&quot; Grissom sat back in his chair, waiting for Warrick's reaction. Warrick arched an eyebrow and leaned forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, it's not,&quot; he replied, not admitting or denying anything. &quot;The only way it would be against regulations is if one of us was in a supervisory position,&quot; he said, emphasizing the last part just to goad him. Grissom gave him a warning glare and Warrick smiled. &quot;Nick tell you that she liked me?&quot; He asked with as much sympathy as he could muster. Grissom shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Catherine,&quot; he responded. Warrick got a thoughtful expression on his face. So Catherine knew the truth too, interesting information to have. &quot;Although she said that's what Nick thought.&quot; Warrick gave Grissom a compensatory grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's just conjecture on his part, I think she likes someone else,&quot; he said. Grissom suddenly looked more interested in the conversation, and Warrick took notice. Time to change the subject; Sara would kill him if he didn't. &quot;So can you get Brass to get some warrants out?&quot; Grissom raised an eyebrow just a little and nodded once. Warrick got up to leave. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he said as he walked out.
