<br>
Ever since i was a little girl, it has always been my dream to sing. From then on when i knew what i wanted to do, i also wanted to help kids with my music, let poeple feel what i feel, get poeple into good moods, brighten up poeples days, i want all of that. See when i was about 10, i showed my parents what i could do, they thought i was real good. When i turned 13 i told them i what i was going to do, they wern't to thrilled.<br>
I have 2 friends that i grew up with and they are Emily and Sarah. We did every thing together, they even wanted to sing with me and be in a group but i told them i wanted to be a singer with out any one and i told them that maybe they can sing together. They liked the idea 'cause they at least wanted to sing. I thought they were crazy but that was there dream to so i encouraged them to do what they wanted as well and they did the same for me.<br>
My friends and i liked going out shopping, singing, dancing, we even had sleep overs and we all loved Michael Jackson and listened to his music all the time. I guess you could say we grew up with the J5. Michael was always 5 years older then me, i was so happy he was to, we even got to see him in concert once.<br>
I even have a boyfriend and we were going out ever since we were 12 years old and his name is Jacob. Jacob and i always did things together if i was not hanging with my friends or doing something eles, i was so happy and every one got very envy of me because i was going out with Mr. Popular and i was never popular. Thats what made him a great guy for me. He never once cheated on me.<br>
If Jacob did cheat on me i don't think i could have lived with having another one because men are so hard to trust these days. One day me and Jacob were at the park eating ice cream at age 15 and some popular girl came up to him and tryed to make a date and he said &quot;no&quot;. I was so happy with what he did and his dessions. I'm a sweet person, i am loved by some poeple and i follow my heart no matter what my dream is or maybe. Even if my parents didn't like but but i would be old enough and moved out, why would they care then? i was thinking maybe it was time to ask them soon because i was not going to do any thing eles but sing.<br>
I am a sensitive person and i can get hurt easy. I get hurt if poeple dump me for some one eles, i can get hurt if people make fun of MJ. Almost every thing, it just depends on whats said and or done. The only time i am ever happy is if i am with friends or my boyfriend or if im singing and dancing.<br>
My parents when they first heard me say i wanted to be a singer they kind of threw a fit at me. They were kind poeple but they were never kind to me when ever i mentiond the words &quot;i want to sing&quot;. Every time they would say &quot;no Megan, we dont want the tabloids and cameras following you, it will hurt you alot&quot;<br>
I never belived my parents, it was not about them, it was about me and my dream i had and i wanted to fulfill it. I knew that was not the reason for them wanting me to not sing, i had a feeling deep down inside it was something eles. I can tell you one things for sure, they liked every thing the way i did it and thought i was good and all, but they were hiding something and i knew it.<br>
One day i would come home from school at 18 years old, and i would talk to my parents about it and they finally said, &quot;ok do it, but we still and never will like this idea&quot;. And i said back to them, &quot;thanks a million, i really want to do this it has been a dream, i won't let you down&quot;. When i said those words i ment it, but the thing is could what i have said be true? or will something be like a bump on the road? i just would keep hoping for the best.<br>
