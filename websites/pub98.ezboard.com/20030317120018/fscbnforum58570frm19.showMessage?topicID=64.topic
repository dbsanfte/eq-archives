(Drev) = midnitemage</span><hr size=1> Drev crouched in a tree, his face covered in dark mud blending his light skin into the shadows. His gloved hand tightened around his rifle as he narrowed his eyes into the distance. He watched a set of head lights a good 100 yards away slip silently across the road. Slipping his hand to his ear he listened intently as a hushed, whispered message came in over the headset's.:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sssssyzbryn to Siral. Target in sight. Confirm?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Confirmed Syzbryn. Target in sight. Maniac, Brute, Thrasher, and Bryn. Get in position. Crack-Shot. You ready?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Crack-Shot to Siral. My cross-hairs are on the target.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright. Remember everyone. We only have one shot at this. We've gotta make it count. Maniac, Move in and run recon. We'll be waiting for your go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Got it Siral. I'm goin' in. Seez ya guys in a bit an wish me luck.&quot;<br>
<br>
:A few moments of silence passes with no movement from Drev as he brings his sniper rifle up and aims at the stopped headlights in the middle of the road. He slid the scope over a bit to survey the area infront and behind the car. A large amount of debris was scattered on the road blocking the cars way. Moving back to the car, he saw a large man out of the driver's seat and began to inspect the debris:<br>
<br>
&quot;Maniac here. Target is in clear sight. Everyone in position?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ssssyzbryn in position.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Crack-Shot in position.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bryn in position.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Brute and Thrasher ready and waiting.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Siral in position. We'll everyone. It's now or never.&quot; Drev commented as he took aim on the man's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;BRYN HERE! HOLD IT! THERE'S A KID IN THERE!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NO TIME BRYN! IT'S NOW OR NEVER! ALL UNITS GO!&quot;<br>
<br>
:Crack-Shot, a caitiff was the first to pull the trigger. The silenced silver bullet flew straight through the passenger side window burying itself into the man's chest. As soon as it did a loud roar echoed through he woods as the man gripped his chest. Within a few moments, in place of the man was a giant beast of a Werewolf. Drev clenched his teeth in anger as he saw the change and pulled his cross-hairs up to the creatures head letting loose a shot. The bullet grazed the creatures head taking off its ear completely. Out of the shadows Syzbryn, a Nos, and Maniac, a Malk, appear out of the shadows and each pull out a pair of MP5's and fire a spray of silver into the stunned beast. Along with the spray erupts a pair of Large Brujah Twins armed with sawed off shotguns jumping onto the car with incredible speed and firing at will. Crack-Shot and Drev reload and take aim once more. The Werewolf launches forward toward the twins and sends his huge claws through their chests grasping on their hearts and ripping them out letting the two drop lifelessly onto the car's hood and roof.:<br>
<br>
&quot;DAMNIT! FUCKIN LUPINE!&quot; Drev yelled over the headsets as he took another shot, his bullet embedding itself into the creatures neck just as his two comrades collapsed. Crack-Shot froze in fear his eyes wide and filled with pure unbridled horror.:<br>
<br>
:From behind Bryn, the lone Toreador in the group, in a blur of movement placing a shotgun up to the creatures back and fired at point black range. The lupine spins around with a swipe to her head leaving deep gashes and grabs her by the throat with the other. She drops her gun and futily tries to break free. Maniac rushes forward and jumps onto the beasts back and continues to spray into the back of its head. The multitude of bullets that have lodged into the creatures brain should have killed it, but it wouldn't stop. It, with a single clawed hand, severed the connection between Bryn's head and body, brought its free hand behind him and grasped Maniac by the hair throwing him at Syzbryn dropping them both to the ground. Drev gets his next bullet loaded and takes one more shot, pulling the trigger. The bullet flies straight at the beast's neck and severs its spinal column felling the beast finally.:<br>
<br>
 rev and Crack-Shot make their way to the carnage to check on any survivors. Nearly half of them hand fallen in the fight alone. Lucky by most standards, but a substantial loss none the less. Drev moved over to the fallen Werewolf kicking it as he picked up the severed ear he had shot off earlier. He then turns to the car and looks in. A child lay in a car seat on the passenger side peering into Drev's eyes. Drev stands up and turns only to see the huge lupine standing over him claw swiping down at him.:<br>
<br>
AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  rev sat up in a start eyes wide. He was in his van... In his clan's domain. :<br>
<br>
&quot;Dusk. It was a bad dream. It was only a bad dream.&quot;<br>
<br>
:his head lowers with a slight sigh as he rests his hand over his stomach. Lifting up his sweater and shirt slightly, he runs his fingers over the faint slashing scars over his abdomen.: <br>
