  The club was cool, strong, safe, but everybody knew about it.  She could not work or have fun watching all the cameras all the time.  She missed Chauncey.  And her brother held office again, and was running errands and patrols like a squirrel on laced nuts.  She didn't think he'd even notice her absence.  She shut off her phone and stepped inside.  The heavy (and repaired) door swung shut and locked, setting bars and codes.<br>
  And she was safe and alone in her place.  She hit a fan, it pulled her own smell away so that it didn't settle too heavily in the enclosed space.  Hat went on a coat rack, scarf and trench followed.  She tucked the gloves in a pocket. &quot;On&quot; She let her voice lisp and hit the most childish intonations and the computer started up.  It ran through her programming, flashing her messages, news, updates on the things that interested her.<br>
  She fluffed pale downy blonde hair back from her face, and rolled back her long sleeves, ignoring the scars with practiced disconcern.  She pulled a clean steel rolling table to the corner where she worked away from the computer.  Jeweler's and dentist's tools lay in neat shallow drawers along side wrenches, screw drivers, hex sets, and a variety of cutters and torches.  Various gauges of wire in gold, copper, and other metals hung in neat skeins on the wall above.  She checked everything.<br>
  Then she went to her bag next to the coat rack.  And she pulled out the puppy.  She kissed it's cool nose, and admired the shiney clear eyes.  She dandled the wide paws, and the floppy ears.  Then she laid it out on the steel table and sat down, adjusting her chair.<br>
  Slowly and thoughtfully she considered her plans.  Then she made the first cut. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hart@scbnforum58570>Hart</A> at: 2/4/03 10:19:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hart@scbnforum58570>Hart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/14/03 11:56:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=74.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> puppies</span><hr size=1> Some hours later, she pfffd a long breath out of a deep lopsided pout, trying to blow her hair out of her eyes while making the final weld.  She wanted the solder line clean and smooth so that she didn't have to go back in and buff it out with the dremel.<br>
Finally she turned off her tools.  She put everything back in its place.  Then she washed up and put on a new sweater that was not snagged and burnt by her single minded labors.  Pushing her hair out of her face with both hands, in a childishly direct and unselfconscious manner, she surveyed her work.<br>
It had been a solid if somewhat clunky base to work from.  She'd thought of picking a color for it, but her repair work had left it with an oddly naturalistic looking spotted pattern.  Like a beagle almost but in shades of metal.<br>
&quot;whhhht&quot;  she whistle a quick shrill clean beckoning call, a brisk street alert.<br>
Large dark shiney eyes snapped open.  Irises dilated, focused.  The tail began to thump happily and the puppy let out a soft almost grunt &quot;mumph!&quot; of greeting.<br>
&quot;Stand&quot;<br>
It scrabbled to it's feet, and she was glad that she had put rubber treads on his paddy paws.  There would be no scrabble of doggy clawed feet on her cement floors.<br>
&quot;Sit&quot;<br>
It obediantly dropped it's haunches with a clank and it's tongue lolled out, and the ears perked up.<br>
&quot;Down&quot;<br>
It dropped head to paws and whimpered questioningly.<br>
&quot;Roll over&quot;<br>
Butt came up.  Tail wagged manically.  It yipped excitedly and executed a neat flip.<br>
She scritched it's head, neat enameled chiton nails scraping alloy.  It sighed and the tail thumped more.<br>
&quot;Up&quot;  With a joyous yipe it flung itself into her arms.  She put it down on the floor.<br>
&quot;Be good&quot;<br>
Nose hit the floor.  Tail swung in wide flung motion.  And it proceeded to trace and memorize the entirety of the apartment.<br>
