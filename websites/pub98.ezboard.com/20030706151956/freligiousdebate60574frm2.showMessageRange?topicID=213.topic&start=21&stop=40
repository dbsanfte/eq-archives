<br>
I know that abortion does not equal mental trauma, but I don't think anyone here has suggested that there is NO trauma at all. Let's say we concede it is at least psycholgically stressful to have an abortion. The question at hand is whether it is not less so than being forced to carry a child. <br>
<br>
Oh--and in rape cases the trauma would certainly be greater, but for those that find abortion to be murder or claim the fetus us a life who's right to be born supercedes the mother's right to abort, making these incest/rape exceptions in incongruous. At least be consistent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Even in the situation where a person is raped, a mother who has an abortion rarely walks away from the process as mentally healthy as before the proceedure.&quot;<br>
<br>
Noone who has been raped walks away as mentally healthy. Would the woman be more healthy if she were forced to carry the rapist's child? <br>
<br>
&quot;This is because the body has already begun releasing certain chemicals that create the strong maternal bond.&quot;<br>
<br>
These are not strong enough to create the kind of bond you insinuate. I know this from personal experience. In fact, most women don't find pregnancy and motherhood &quot;real&quot; or hitting home in a visceral way until the 2nd tri-mester when they start showing and having more physical signs and the risk of miscarriage is much lower. I'm not saying you don't feel anything at all for a clump of cells in your uterus, but there is a definite difference in emotion when the baby is wanted and after it's been a few months and you can &quot;feel&quot; him/her.<br>
<br>
&quot;As far as adoption,(which I encourage over abortion in non-rape related cases)&quot;<br>
Why? Do the babies of rape have less right to life? Again--I am pro-choice, but am always astounded by those who make the case that a fertilized egg is life, then make an exception based on donors. The source of the sperm is morally irrelevant if you argue from the position that the fertilized egg is life and that life supercedes the rights of the mother. (maybe you are not really a pro-lifer after all, but it seems this way--please correct me if I'm wrong).<br>
<br>
&quot;In most cases that bond is too strong, resulting in a mother who is not well equipped to raise a child, but who will raise it because they believe that it is not a sign of love to give the child to someone who is better suited to the job of mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
What?!!? What makes you think women who choose to raise their own children believe adoption is not a sign of love? <br>
<br>
&quot;It is just my opinion, but I believe that rape victims suffer enough mental trauma from the incident that they should not need to face these additional traumas.&quot;<br>
<br>
We agree rape victims should not have to suffer additional trauma. What we seem to disagree on is whether terminating a resulting preganancy is more traumatic than being forced to carry the child to term and give birth then either raise the baby (a result of rape/incest) or give it up for adoption. Do you honestly purport the latter is psychologically easier? <br>
<br>
Though it is admittedley not relevant in terms of debate, may I ask if you have ever been raped or had an abortion or given a child up for adoption? You speak easily about the emotions involved as if you have 1st hand knowledge and it differs so very, very much from my own first hand knowledge of such things.<br>

Phoenix, are you new here? I probably know far better than most people the emotional issues surrounding of abortion. I had a late-term abortion of a very loved and very much wanted baby, due to lethal defects that meant his life would have been very short and and filled with suffering. Since that time I have been active in pro-choice politics and met hundreds of women (both IRL and online) who've experience abortion for any number of reasons. I've yet to meet even one who did so for stupid or selfish reasons.<br>
<br>
I tried to make it clear in my post that I thought the morning after pill less traumatic than early-term abortion; early-term abortion less traumatic than late term; almost any abortion less traumatic than giving away a live baby child and spending the rest of your life wondering about it - or watching a dying baby suffer needlessly. At 20 weeks, the maternal bond I felt for my gently kicking baby went FAR deeper than mere &quot;chemicals.&quot; <br>
<br>
I am thoroughly pro-choice. I don't think any woman should ever be forced to carry any pregnancy, regardless of circumstance. I love babies, and think they deserve quality parenting and quality of life in all cases. Only mothers can make the best decisions about their own pregnancies. Or as the bumper sticker goes &quot;If you can't trust me with a choice, how can you trust me with a child?&quot;<br>
<br>
My heart goes out to rape victims and I would hope their medical care providers would fully support them rather than reduce their choices in ANY way. I was only pointing out that your scenario of &quot;no access to morning after pill = bad parenting creates more rapists&quot; had a flaw.<br>

You may not feel it is traumatic to carry the baby, Mg may not feel the abortion is traumatic, I may not feel the rape was traumatic....none of this matters.  We are not the victims.  What the victim feels is right is what they should listen to.  Furthermore, your restrictions on what her available choices are in making those decisions are not right.<br>
<br>
You mentioned choices earlier also.  Let me say I am a citizen and I have choices.  I choose to not support religous institutions.  That is my right.  Yet the gov't taxes me and hands my money over to these religous institutions.  Kind of a pain in my ass, but as long as those institutions are providing public services, I can choke down the indignation at their need to rob me.  Now, these religous institutions, taking my money, decide that they don't need to serve the public interests when it is contrary to thier dogma.  Now we have a problem of the big variety.  They are taking public funds, they necessarily must take the regulation that comes with it.  Don't like the regulation?  Stop taking my money.

<br>
First of all, that little scenario was just a hypothetical situation, as I pointed out.  I never said that all cases end up this way, I'm just saying that they could.<br>
<br>
Second, I believe in the morning-after pill for rape victims.  However, I have met many people who wanted to abort a child because they chose to have unprotected sex, while not wanting the consequences of having a child.  I believe that if you are willing to commit a deed, then you should also be willing to live with the consequences.  That is why I make the exception for rape victims, they did not choose to be raped, they were stripped of any choice in the matter.  I also make the exception because the state of the mother greatly affects the state of the child.  Being pregnant is stressful enough, but being raped and pregnant is enough stress to cause the release of sufficient amounts of chemicals that, if not immediately harming the child, will likely cause long term damage to the unborn child.  <br>
<br>
Third, my &quot;It is just my opinion, but I believe that rape victims suffer enough mental trauma from the incident that they should not need to face these additional traumas.&quot; comment was to indicate that I think that it is much better to allow the mother to have access to the morning-after pill than to force them to undergo one of the other options.<br>

Well, let me put it this way, I am a male med student.  I work with the people who have to make these decisions all the time.  I am also very empathetic to others.  So although I don't have first hand experience with making the choice, I have been exposed to the situation enough to have a good understanding of many of the possible outcomes.<br>
<br>
Finally, DBC, it confuses me that the begining of your post inferrs that you are not in agreement with me, but the rest of your post seems to make the same arguments that I have made.  The primary role of any medical institution is to promote the health and well being of its patrons, and not to limit their care in any way.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=powertotherae>Powertotherae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Satan's Lil' Minion</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/12/03 4:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re: trauma</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Being pregnant is stressful enough, but being raped and pregnant is enough stress to cause the release of sufficient amounts of chemicals that, if not immediately harming the child, will likely cause long term damage to the unborn child.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
But being 15 and making a bad decision and being forced to carry a baby to term doesn’t cause stress?<br>
<br>
No matter how much medical training you get you are still a man and will never be able to fully understand the amount stress and the full range of emotions that a wanted let alone an unwanted pregnancy brings.<br>

As for Phoenix being &quot;still a man&quot;, it really makes me grit my teeth when people assume that men have no feelings or emotions for their unborn children and cannot experience the weight of what a pregnancy (wanted or otherwise) means.  For every jerk that abandons his girlfriend once she gets &quot;knocked up&quot; there are nine other men who stand by their partner, sharing her joys, concerns, fears and, yes, even her grief.  To discount their role in pregnancy and disregard their feelings about termination or miscarriage is to fall prey to the stereotype of men as sperm donors and bank accounts, but not parents.  <br>

I do not impose my beliefs upon others.  I find that to be a rude and unacceptable thing to do.  I realize that the circumstances are always different, and that because of that, no rule set in stone will work for all situations.  When I graduate, and am a fully licensed doctor, my job will be to ensure that my patients make an educated decision as to the care provided.  I personally don't enjoy the thought of abortions, but if that is the course of action that the patient decides upon, then that is the type of care that I will provide.  If a patient came to me because they had just been raped and thought that conception was a possibility, I would tell them about each option available.(Abortion/Adoption/morning-after pill/Child care.)  I would then inform them as to what the side-effects(both common and rare side effects) are of each option, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>if</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> they wanted, I would help them in choosing a course of action.  But I always leave the final decision in their hands, and respect that decision.<br>

Leah,<br>
I will not say that I can experience what it feels like, but I should tell you that one of the people who did my med-school interview would disagree with you.  One of the questions that she asked was this.<br>
&quot;You are a 16 year old girl, who has just been informed by your doctor that you are pregnant.  You are sexually active, and thus do not know who the father is.  Your parents do not know about your sexual life at all.  How do you feel?&quot;<br>
She had been in this situation herself, and thus had first hand experience with the emotions that would be present.  Rather than to simply list off the emotions that were to be expected, I essentially became that person.  My response could easily show the intensity of certain emotions, and how some of the emotions were less powerful.  After the interview that interviewer came up to me and said that she was surprised by my answer.  She had never gotten a response that was that intense and exact before.  So she would probably say that despite the fact that I am &quot;still a man&quot;, I understand very well the impact of the situation.  That is why my last post said that I was very empathetic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 274<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/12/03 6:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re: trauma</span><hr size=1> I don't know if I mentioned this before, I think I may have...but I swallowed a live frog once.

Even among women carrying babies, the experiences cover a vast array of variety.  One woman bed-ridden and medicated for half her pregnancy will not report the same experience of a woman who didn't even know she was pregnant until she went to the ER for stomach pains and delivered a full term baby 3 hours later. (Yes that really happens.)  The experience of an emergency C-section in a very petite woman compared to a veteran of 9 kids with a waterslide for a birth canal or octuplets from an infertile couple are all very different.

I didn’t mean that men don’t care or don’t have feelings about their children or unborn children. All I meant is that a man can never know fully what it is to be pregnant. I know that as a father you too have emotions and you think the same things as a mother does. <br>

DBC, I personally know a woman this happened to in my area. She is a really bright woman and a wonderful mom. What happened was, she was somewhat overweight, had a history of gastro-intestinal disorders, irregular periods, and had tried to get pregnant for 15 years and been told she never would. She mistook her pregnancy symtoms for the flu and intestinal distress. She ended up hospitalized with skyrocketing blood pressure and had an emergency C-section. It was only 13 hours between when they first told her she was pregnant and when the baby was born. The baby was at around 30 weeks gestation. She is thrilled with her surprise child.<br>

I also think I know what Leah meant by her comment about men not fully understanding what it is to be pregnant (and the frog doesn't count for several reasons, though it is both amusing and gross so thanks for sharing again DBC<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )! I DO take exception to the argument men don't have anything to say about this issue both from a logical argument and emotional perspective. While I don't think this is what Leah intends, and while I was raised by a single mother and support single parents, I am concerned about the marginalizing of fatherhood in this country and what I think are mixed messages on the issue. We must make them full partners in child-rearing with all the responsibility and decision making that comes with it. Ultimately, abortion is definitely the woman's decision, but both are responsible and both should be part of whatever consequences there are....course we all know who gets the lion's share here, but that's why the woman gets the final say. <br>
<br>
Phoenix--I am interested particularly in your take on what consequences beyond money a man who also participated in unprotected sex would have toward a baby then. Also--what about protected sex where contraception fails...do you make exceptions here as in rape? Are you opposed to abortions purely on the grounds of whether conception was protected or not?<br>

The father has the right to discuss his feelings and concerns with the mother.  As far as the decision about having an abortion is concerned, I don't really see him having much more say than that.  I do have to point out that if the mother and father cannot come to some mutual understanding about their positions, then it is likely that the relationship will not work.  But that is definetely a different thread.<br>

<br>
Not being very knowledgable about Jainism, I cannot comment about that.  Give me a little while to research that belief system.  Currently I identify myself as an ecclectic wiccan.<br>
<br>
Look, this may be a better way of helping you to understand my position on abortion.  Please bear with me, I'm just writing this as the thoughts come into my head, so it may seem a little confusing or garbled.<br>
<br>
I think of the termination of life as I do of getting an F in school.  In other words I think that, regardless of the circumstances, it is a horrible thing.  Now in cases like rape/fatal diseases/developmental problems, I feel that that is like getting around a 46%.  While someone who wants to get an abortion for selfish reasons would be like getting a 6%.  Obviously I would rather the 46%.  Now I calssified rape along with diseases and developmental problems because, as I said before, it can lead to these problems.  As far as to why I make those distinctions, I don't know.  My subconcious mind is not that forthcoming with information on that subject.  <br>
<br>
Now that that is said, as a doctor,(or doctor in training. ie. med student) if an abortion is what I am required to do, then an abortion is what will be preformed.  I may not like the thought of the proceedure being preformed, but since it most likely will be, I would rather it done by a trained professional.  If the doctors were to refuse to preform that service, then some people would resort to untrained individuals who are willing to do it for a few bucks, but that would introduce a great risk to the patient while not changing the fact that the baby will be killed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luvthatdyl>LuvThatDyl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/13/03 5:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re:loss of life</span><hr size=1> I do understand what Phoenix has been saying.  Eventhough him and I don't necessarily agree on evaluating the circumstances for an abortion, I understand where he is coming from.  The most important thing is that he isn't taking a stance that can lead to preventing a woman from having an abortion.  He just merely has an opinion on the matter.  I understand the whole &quot;don't do the crime if you can't do the time&quot; philosophy, but my stance is that people are human and make mistakes, and many of those who make these mistakes are kids who sometimes lack the maturity to think through all the consequences.  I also appreciate the fact that Phoenix has made it clear he will put the needs of the patient in front of his own mere opinions.  That is original crux of this thread.  Some Catholic hospitals are putting their own agenda in front of the needs of their patients.  If I need medical care and I need to choose between the staunch Catholic and his list of rules or the ecclectic Wiccan who can put his opinions aside to help me, then that is an easy choice to make.  Unfortunately not many people get to make such a choice.<br>
<br>
Overall, I think Phoenix is just making a statement on why he would choose a certain path if he were in the situation.  Yes, I know he'll never get pregnant  But a lot of people think through how they would handle certain scenarios, even if they know they will never find themselves in the situation.  Of course, when it comes to abortion, nobody can really make any claims on what they would do unless they find themselves in the middle of the situation.  There have been women who make appointments to have an abortion and find themselves walking out of the clinic without having the procedure, and there are staunch pro-life activists who have a sudden change of heart when they find themselves in a state of desperation.  But eventhough we don't know exactly what we would do unless we were in the situation, we still form preliminary opinions on various matters, especially on controversial subjects that are constantly brought up as the subject of debate.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I do agree with the philosophy of many of the other posters here.  This is a general statement, and not a statement regarding Phoenix's post.  The whole argument of the pro-life camp is that they need to put the baby's life first.  I agree with people when they say that when it comes to the life of the baby, then the mode of conception shouldn't matter.  The life of a child conceived out of rape shouldn't be worth less than that of a child conceived out of consensual sex.  A lot of people who make the distinction are just looking to punish the mother for her &quot;sins&quot;.  There are some right wing politicians who say that rape isn't even an acceptable reason for an abortion.  Their reasoning is that &quot;a baby shouldn't be punished for the sins of the father&quot;.  While I think this is cruel and twisted, I have to at least give them credit for being consistent.  <br>
