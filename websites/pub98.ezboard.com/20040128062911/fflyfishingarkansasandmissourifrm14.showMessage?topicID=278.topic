To me it doesn't make much sense to tie a 3-4&quot; pattern when the fish are getting fed the 12&quot; meals they get with the stockers. How do you all tie a longer streamer and what is the shortest length that you fish? I got some great looking Icelandic Sheep Hair to tie with, but I need to find a good pattern. Sculpins, mini-trout streamers/bucktails, whatever. We may even get some ideas on good shad patterns for the shad kill this spring.<br>

Put in eyes if you can and have the hook protuding from the head.  A dead drift pattern.  A stripping pattern would have the hook protruding from the tail end.  Not much weight needed here during the shad kill.  A heavier streamer would work as the shad kill slows down and it would need to be heavier.  <br>
<br>
Black is my favorite color to throwon 4 units with some weight.<br>
an orange or white underbody is always good as well.  Just enough weight to throw with a 5 or 6wt rod at 50 ft or so.<br>

<br>
I did a search for &quot;streamer&quot; on the board and two threads came up, whats up in Arkansas with trout streamers ?<br>
<br>
They are big in the GLs river for both steelhead and brown trout used by many trout fishers exclusively to lure the big browns out of their log jams and under cut banks.<br>
<br>
Some fellows are so secretive about their patterns they will hide them in their boats when they go by.<br>
<br>
My local fly shop owner had a tying session thursday night on some of these patterns which I will be tying up this winter.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a big trout streamer fly swap would be of come interest ?  Would love to see some of these secret arkansas patterns which I know must be there.  LOL<br>
<br>
If you want to win a fly fishing contest for the biggest trout you may want to just use streamers if the rules allow a big fly to be used.<br>
<br>
Cheers and happy holidays to all !<br>

There are a few, mostly guides, who love chunking streamers on various water levels. <br>
Upon my return from guiding in Alaska, I fished several of the same streamer patterns here that worked there, and had a great time.

<br>
Ryan is totally correct. Mark Sedotti has introduced me to Bruce Marino who is tying up some &quot;very&quot; interesing looking patterns. I imagine Jimmy Ryan and I will be fishing some of them when we get back into high water and shad kill season. Most of the &quot;really&quot; big fish we seem to catch are sight casting on low water. Don't get me wrong, there are some great fish caught on high water. I talked to a well know guide here last spring and he said that he and his clients had caught 15 fish over 24 inches last year using his &quot;special&quot; high water patterns. <br>
<br>
High water also introduces some real problems with landing big fish. We might have some issues with having to land them on light tippets, but we have the advantage of being able to bring them into shallow water. I can't imagine the difficulties that a would be brought by having to land a 40 pound fish on 5X tippet. Who ever was running the boat for Rip Collins when he landed that fish in the picture above deserved an honorable mention in the record.<br>
<br>
If there is a secret subculture here it is totally without merit. I hate to say it but there is &quot;no&quot; secret fly. Most of the big fish are hooked up and landed purely with technique. These big fish on the White are spooky and smart. If they are not landing huge fish on bait they are not likely to land them on a fly either.<br>
<br>
I'd be more than willing to do a streamer swap. It's all in how you fish them anyway.<br>

My post above is a shad imitation that simply falls slowly and you watch for the strike.  It's not designed to be stripped.  Kind of like ryans' popper he talked about on another post.  <br>
<br>
There are not that many guides throwing streamers on the upper end that I can see.  Black seems to be the best overall color.  I'm in on the swap.  <br>
<br>
The first time Ryan and I planned to throw streamers we both showed up with the exact pattern ..even tied on the same unulual hook only his had some blue flashabou tied on to his. <br>
<br>
This same streamer tied in white would also work if stripped from the proper angle from the boat and the correct mends put in.  <br>
<br>
When Haulahaulic brought his buddy up here we fished 4 units of water throwing streamers. (big buggers) towards the bank.<br>
<br>
I suggested Black but they both used olive.  Troy was getting strikes 5-1 over his buddy and it was mostly because of the mend and the angle.  When he corrected the angle and the mend (black ) bugger this time his strikes increased dramatically.  Troys buddy also caught the biggest fish a 22&quot; or so Brown trout.   <br>
<br>
One also wants to avoid self built leaders with all the knots as the knots catch debris.  Use a knotless leader from top to end and the frustration level is brought down a heck of a lot.  Especially when the leaves are dropping in oct ond nov.  <br>
<br>
The seceret to this type of fishing from the boat is the drag chain which slow the boat down a little so you can turn the motor off.  Throw the streamer right on the bank and strip it back letting it drop into the water colum somewhat.  Most of the hits seem to come while the fly is falling.  Don't discount light takes as small fish either.   <br>
<br>

All kidding aside, you can't catch fish on a bare hook. But the fly pattern is only part of the big picture. The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wrong</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fly fished wrong catches zero fish. The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>right</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fly fished wrong catches zero fish. I will always believe that a skilled fisherman will have more sucess in the long run. Even Dave Whitlock believes it. <br>
<br>
Here is a quote from the Umpqua site.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How do I get started fly fishing and how much will it cost me to get going?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>

First, save up about $500 to $1,000. Take half of that sum and enroll in a fly fishing school. When you complete the school, use your new knowledge to purchase your tackle, flies, and accessories from a fly-fishing specialty shop.<br>

I have been rereading (again) Selective Trout - Richards and Swisher.  Hey John I met Carl Richards on the PM in the early 80s steelhead fishing and talked to him for a while when we were both freezing to death in pursuit of the chrome warriors. <br>
<br>
Well off to do some final christmas shopping, then tomorrow is a steelhead fly fishing day for XMAS steelhead !<br>
<br>
Maybe I can rid myself of my 1,000's of flys for trout, salmon, and steelhead if we come to the conclusion that the fly does not matter.<br>

 Ausable one day in the late '60s. The wary <br>
 brown trout of the Ausable were on tiny BWO's <br>
 that day. Joe had brought his size 24 hackled <br>
 BWO. He wasn't having much luck, but Richards <br>
 and Swisher were catch and releasing the <br>
 browns seemingly at will. <br>
<br>
 Carl handed me some flies. &quot;Try one of <br>
 my ties,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
 I noticed that he and Doug exchanged a <br>
 glance, half-smiling..... <br>
<br>
 ....I put one of my standard-tied size 24 <br>
 Blue-Wing Olives on my tippet again, and in <br>
 ten minutes of fishing over risers I didn't <br>
 get a hit. Back I went to Carl's no-hackle <br>
 tie, and zing, a strike. <br>
<br>
 &quot;All right, fellows,&quot; I said, <br>
 leveling a cutting eye at them. &quot;Give. <br>
<br>
 Let's hear about it. Let me in on the <br>
 secret.&quot; <br>
<br>
 &quot;So you found out,&quot; Carl said. <br>
<br>
 &quot;We were going to tell you right after <br>
 lunch, but it seems you found it out.&quot; <br>
<br>
 &quot;It's like this...&quot; Doug began... <br>
 Trout Fishing Joe Brooks 1972 <br>
<br>
 It wasn't to long before their secrets were <br>
 out and expounded on in many magazine <br>
 articles and the book - Selective Trout.&quot;<br>

<br>
Don't get me wrong, the fly does matter. What I was saying is that it is only a small part of the total equation here. I know that fishing in Europe those fish are so keyed in on certian patterns that if you don't have the right fly you are blanked. Our fish have such a variety of foods that they are less interested in the particulars of a specific fly.<br>
<br>
Jack Dennis is really into tying egg sacks on stone flys because he believes that there are often times when trout will only take the females out west. Fishing for Grayling in the eastern block countries if you don't have some pink you might as well go practice your casting.<br>
<br>
We just got a little off topic on the streamers. For &quot;our&quot; fish it is only a small portion of the total equation. Maybe on the PM it matters more. The only flies that I have ever seen that made tremendous differences here are egg patterns, trout crack, and wooly buggers. It's really stupid fishing here. Our trout couldn't care less if it was a spinner, emerger, nymph, egg sac, CDC, or what ever. If it doesn't hit them in the face they aren't going to move for it. They are just fat lazy Arkies like the rest of us.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

What I have been doing wasting all my time in the east and upper mid west with these selective trout and even the darn steelhead and salmon can be selective.<br>
<br>
Whats &quot;Trout Crack&quot; thats a new term to me, I can ony imagine what it is.  LOL<br>
<br>
Well put off steelheading today due to staying up late and watching The Eiger Sanction last night. Was at The Eiger in Kleine Schidegg about 6 years on a business trip.  Awesome place to see those swiss alps.   Plus the weather was too warm today at 48 degrees.  Tomorrow will be better in the low 30s with rain and snow showers.  You know you are sick steelheader when you prefer fishing in this type of weather.  Believe me they bite better in such conditions.   <br>
<br>
Yes Arkansas is right up there on my FF to do list along with:  Oregon, Washington, Scotland, Idaho, Canadian steelhead and salmon, Iceland, Florida, etc. etc..  The woes of a U.S. fly fisher.  Love that St Croix advertisement:  &quot;There are 3.6 million miles of rivers in the U.S. which means eventually you will get fired&quot; (or divorced!)  LOL<br>

Well maybe the trout in Arkansas are a &quot;little&quot; tough to deal with....  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>

Trout Crack is a pattern that I developed about 10 years ago. We started calling it that when a guide friend of mine from Wesbank Anglers started coming down to fish about 5 years ago. He nic-named the pattern &quot;Trout Crack&quot; and the name just sorta stuck. <br>
<br>
In reference to your selective trout comments, I have noticed that if I miss the taper while tying the fly it will make a noticable difference in the numbers of fish. That pattern has been refined over the years so much that it's stupid fishing now. <br>

Your &quot;formula for success&quot; -- hmm... didn't 3M make a bunch of videos under that heading at one time?? -- talked about holdin' your mouth just right.  One of my favorite topics.<br>
<br>
There is no question that some days a guy just can't quite get his mouth set in the right manner.  I mean, what about those days when the other guy catches fish left and right on the same pattern you are using and you come up blank.  There just can't be any other explanation, right? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
