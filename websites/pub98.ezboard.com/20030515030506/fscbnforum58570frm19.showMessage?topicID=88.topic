<br>
Crowley walked into his office, and proceeded immediately through to his private quarters. He walked into the bathroom, and proceeded to strip off his clothes, which he then burned to ash in an incinerator. He then showered. <br>
Five minutes later, dressed in a robe, he walked back into his office. He took the gun from its place on the wall, walked to his desk, and then sat.<br>
He clicked the safety of the gun off. <br>
Then he clicked it back on.<br>
Off.<br>
On.<br>
Off.<br>
On.<br>
“Does doing that make it easier for you to think, Crowley?” <br>
“Good. You’re here.” Crowley said, without humor. He put the gun down on the desk. <br>
Roche seemed amused. “Ah, so we’re back to summoning me, are we?”<br>
“Whatever.” Crowley replied impatiently. “What the hell was that? What happened tonight?”<br>
“I told you that you would be tested.”<br>
“But… I had no business…”<br>
“You apparently decided otherwise.”<br>
“You tricked me.”<br>
“I did nothing of the sort. Besides, Crowley, you did well in following the path. You passed.”<br>
“I passed? What do you mean I passed? I could have endangered the Masquerade! There could have been consequences…” <br>
“Consequences, Crowley? Let’s think about the consequences of what you’ve done for a moment.”<br>
Crowley suddenly felt a deep gnawing in his stomach. It quickly grew. It felt like someone was trying to drive a fist through his gut. <br>
“What… is… that?” Crowley exclaimed, gasping in pain.<br>
“Ah, good.” Roche acknowledged. “It’s finally hit you. For a moment I was worried you had fallen to the point it had missed you..”<br>
“What?” <br>
“Its called guilt, Crowley.”<br>
Crowley thought back to earlier in the evening. Three seconds. Three seconds was all he needed to kill two people.<br>
“But those men… they were… the girl…”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“Are you saying… but I thought… didn’t I do… you said I had passed?”<br>
“I said you had passed, Crowley. I didn’t say there wouldn’t be some less than pleasant consequences.”<br>
“So this is what I’ll have to endure?”<br>
“It’s the price you pay.”<br>
After several minutes Crowley was able to recompose himself. <br>
“So your saying that… even when I follow this path you keep leading me down… even when I do all the things I’m supposed to do… I’ll still need to deal with these after effects?”<br>
“Yes, Crowley. According to your own newfound beliefs, to kill is to sin.”<br>
“But… I’ve killed many times before. Both Kindred and Kine.”<br>
“And did you believe doing so was wrong at the time?”<br>
Crowley said nothing for several minutes. Then finally, he whispered. “I understand.”<br>
“Good. Now then, Crowley, let’s review; what did you do tonight?”<br>
“I… prevented a girl from being raped.”<br>
“An act of conscience. Go on.”<br>
“Even though I knew, before and after, if the others had found out I had put the Masquerade at risk like this, they would destroy me.”<br>
“An act of courage. Pray, continue.”<br>
 “Afterwards, I was able to clean up the mess. No one but myself knows that any of this happened. The Masquerade is safe.”<br>
“You kept your cool and took care of business. An act of self-control.”<br>
Crowley nodded. <br>
“Yes, fine, I get it. But so what?”<br>
“So what? Close your eyes, Crowley.”<br>
Crowley did so.<br>
The light….<br>
It was right there. Directly in front of him. It was as if he could simply reach out and touch it. All around him the darkness still reigned. He could not even see the path he took to get here. But this portal, this… doorway of pure light in front of him seemed to beckon.<br>
“Roche… what do I do?”<br>
“If you’re brave enough, Crowley, step out of the darkness and into the light.”<br>
Crowley looked straight ahead into the light. It was very nearly blinding. He couldn’t see anything at the other side. He didn’t know what was there, or what would happen to him. But he knew he could never go back. <br>
After a moment’s hesitation, he stepped forward. <br>
It was… comfortable. Welcoming, almost. A soft, familiar feeling. Crowley couldn’t relate it to anything he had ever experienced at first… and then the strange thought popped into his mind: It was like being in the womb…<br>
And then there was nothingness.<br>
“Crowley.”<br>
He stirred, and then someone roughly nudged his shoulder.<br>
“Crowley, get up.”   <br>
Crowley was suddenly awake and alert. Kaergon Roche was standing over him.<br>
He sat up looked around. They were in a city, but not one like he’d ever seen before. It was ancient, like something predating the Roman Empire. Everywhere there was light, as if coming from the sun. And yet, it didn’t burn him. It did not even scare him.<br>
Crowley looked at Kaergon.<br>
“Am…. Am I dead?”<br>
Roche smiled and gave Crowley a hand to his feet.<br>
“No such luck, I’m afraid.”<br>
“This… this isn’t heaven, then?”<br>
Kaergon Roche laughed.<br>
“If it was, Crowley, you and I certainly would certainly be denied entrance. Its good to think positively, though, and I promise you, if you persevere in the times ahead, you will find salvation of a kind. As for where we are? Well…”<br>
Kaergon Roche waved a hand towards the city, as if for dramatic effect.<br>
“Welcome to Enoch, Stephen Crowley of Clan Ventrue.”<br>
