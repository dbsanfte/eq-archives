It's rather good and this site has separate links for each section so you don't have to spend an eternity scrolling (now that's heck!!) but even though it's just for reference from another thread I wouldn't mind discussing it either. I can't claim to be a total disciple of Hobbes, but as I recall this was rather good. Maybe we can start discussion threads on different great thinkers and their essays....Kierkegaard, Spinoza, Kant....<br>

is intuition your word for faith here?  i do exactly the same thing in reverse order relying upon intuition to guide me and then later finding facts that support what i already felt to be true.<br>

also i just started reading chapter XIII and found something that feels wrong already so i may need some proof as to why this statement from Leviathan is true...<br>

speaking of all mankind:<br>

this simply isn't true when it comes to the mentally handicapped.  if i'm reading this correctly then he is saying the weakest mentally handicapped born without limbs has the power to kill the strongest hitler.  survival of the fittest would argue that they should die off first leaving behind the strongest which frusterates celestial law.<br>

Yes, you had stated exactly that previously and I pointed out the same thing you noticed. We come to conclusions in the opposite way. I research facts and verifiable data then make a conclusion and decide how I feel about it. You decide what is true based on how you feel about it, then seek out facts that might support this or ignore those that refute your &quot;feeling&quot;. This makes me a proponent of scientific method, reason and logic and you a proponent of faith, feeling and intuition. Your choice, but not very effective in the real world where researching medicines, using engineering principles to build things, etc. is necessary, but like I said--your choice.<br>
<br>
&quot;so i may need some proof as to why this statement from Leviathan is true...&quot;<br>
As I stated, I do not agree with everything in Leviathan, but referred only to the social contract. You are getting at the heart of this argument though and despite the fact I disagree with Hobbes on some things and cannot support all his statements, I'll give this a try. I think I know what he's saying.<br>
<br>
Hobbes says, &quot;For as to the strength of body, the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret machination or by confederacy with others that are in the same danger with himself&quot;<br>
<br>
dag retorts, &quot;this simply isn't true when it comes to the mentally handicapped. if i'm reading this correctly then he is saying the weakest mentally handicapped born without limbs has the power to kill the strongest hitler. survival of the fittest would argue that they should die off first leaving behind the strongest which frusterates celestial law.&quot;<br>
He is not necessarily speaking of mental illness, though his qualification that the killing could be done &quot;by secret machination or by confederacy with others&quot; takes care of this. For the record, Hitler was nuts and not that bright--though many of those around him were smart, but evil. If you mean could a retarded person kill a person of average IQ...with a &quot;secret machination&quot; or gun or knife why not? Most mentally retarded folks are not so handicapped as to not be able to pull a trigger and many would be able to get help from the physically able.<br>
As for frustrating celestial law. Again, celestial law is an LDS term so it doesn't have anything to do with Hobbes' arguments, but it seems you are saying if a weak human kills a strong one this goes against evolution. Goodness sakes, yes there is a great deal of this already going on is there not? Do you suppose all murders are the strong and genetically more &quot;fit&quot; killing the weakest? The advances in technology and manipulation of the environment humans have accomplished puts a sort of stall on evolution for now (this is not agreed upon by all evolutionists), but what often causes a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; situation is the chagning environment, which we as humans now largely control. We can heat and cool our homes for example, fabricate coverings for our bodies, grow more than enough food and are at the top of the food chain. If anything, we are depleting our own resources and to make things more interesting what makes a male attractive as a mate may not have changed deep in our brains (women still find more masculine faces more attractive at certain points in our menstrual cycles) our societal and behavioral conditioning prohibit us from mating with them and often drive us toward more intellectual or financially successful mates. I.E., it ain't the brawniest that can best provide for our offspring anymore...aka the Bill Gates/Dilbert phenomenon we hear so much about.<br>
<br>
Anyway--I can see how there might be exceptions to Hobbes' assertion in an abstract sense, but his main point that in a society with no contracts or constraints the strongest is not even safe still holds. There are many cases of mentally, physically, financially strong folks being taken down with weapons that level the playing field (9/11) or the weaker members of society banning together (French Revolution).<br>

He did not go on &quot;feeling&quot; alone though--there were many other indications he would not fall off the end of the planet and these were what he was going on. BTW--this is another logical fallacy, but I addressed it anyway since doing so could still disprove your point:-) Really, check out that website on fallacies--it'd make things easier.<br>

<br>
Uh....no he did not follow a &quot;spirit&quot; and not being LDS or every having accepted LDS doctrine it is somewhat arrogant and totally without historical or factual foundation to claim he was guided by the HF as part of he LDS version of biblical history. Columbus was not seeking the &quot;promised land&quot; and I defy you to even once provide some objective supporting material for anther one of your unsubstantiated claims.<br>

<br>
i never said &quot;columbus was guided by god...&quot; only that i believe he was.&quot;<br>
What is the difference? Is this your response to a person asking for proof of this outrageous claim? If this is how you attribute things in history no wonder you reject reason!<br>
<br>
&quot;you on the other hand said, &quot;Uh....no he did not follow a 'spirit'&quot;&quot;<br>
Yes, and his writings on why he went bear that out. I would use his OWN words on why he wanted to set sail, not some &quot;feeling&quot; I have that contradicts historical documents and Columbus' own words.<br>
<br>
&quot;you can equally believe that he didn't which i'm perfectly fine with but why can i not believe and you can know&quot;<br>
You can believe whatever you want. You can believe there is a Magic Purple Carp in my backyard, but without any evidence or basis for this and with physical evidence to the contrary, continuing in this belief is illogical and quite silly actually. I know only what the evidence tells me and hold out the possibility that yet more evidence may be discovered that will change my mind. More scientific data...something that constitutes proof and not feeling.<br>
<br>
dag-aren't you glad your doctor uses hard science and proven medical procedures when treating you and your family rather than just prescribing whatever medicine or treatment he &quot;feels&quot; you should have? Goodness, if faith is all one needs to &quot;know&quot; things, what a waste of time medical school and all learning is then isn't it, when we could just meditate on it!!<br>
<br>
Again--sorry you are struggling so much. Like I said, I made the assumption you had been a missionary or were referred here because you had some experience with debating. If you do not and continue to refuse to argue using logic or provide any of your sources or proof, this is not the proper forum for us to continue.<br>

<br>
My interpretation of historical data is based on evidence and reason--I may be wrong. I never claimed to have omniscience or divine revelation from an infallible and omniscient being. You do. Alas, your interpretation is not an interpretation of historical or any other data by your own description. You merely go with what you &quot;feel&quot;  (or did someone in the church or at home suggest this columbus thing???). That is the difference.<br>
<br>
&quot;are you claiming that i reject reason because i don't think the same as you?&quot;<br>
No. I am claiming it because you have said over and over and over and over that you rely on &quot;feelings&quot; rather than logic, reason or data. Do we think differently though? Yes, but it's not why I think you reject reason--you told me that outright yourself. Go back through your posts and read them aloud v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y and you'll find it.<br>
<br>
&quot;have you read them all?&quot;<br>
Very nearly, but that's because I was a student of history and taught it, so this wouldn't apply to every single subject. I am only human my dear <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;you already stated that you don't know all the facts so why do you so easily dismiss what i think as untrue and what you think as fact with the exact same amount of columbus' own words that i have used?&quot;<br>
I will go a step further. I WILL NEVER know all the facts, but I base my beliefs and opinions on sound data, research and logic (unlike you). I dismissed your wild claim because there is no supporting data. Present some and convince me with evidence like a real debater and I will change my view and apologize profusely. You see that's what humans who don't &quot;know it all&quot; already can do...learn...grow...change...rather exciting. You simply must try it sometime.<br>

Aha--you wish for more qualifiers. Well if there were a thread on &quot;What do you think happens when you die?&quot; or something like that you will definitely see a sentence from me saying, &quot;I believe&quot; or just as likely &quot;I don't believe&quot;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , but when discussing matters of fact of the natural world I will probably not use these. It's just crazy to say &quot;I believe raw meat doesn't turn into maggots&quot; when we know this is wrong. I also don't say &quot;I believe there are tonsils in my throat, but ya never know they could be flesh fairies!!&quot; KWIM?? But I'll tell ya what--if I'm discussing something where there is no proof (again it would help me if you would provide an example) I will try to use a qualifier if this would help. <br>
<br>
Imagine though every time someone said something about the Tooth Fairy or Santa having to say...but that's JMHO...KWIM...just saying those aren't beings I believe in. Silly huh? That's how it is for me and god(s).<br>
<br>

Now that's funny cuz I thought you knew why you believe what you do and that I did too and that we both clearly understood each other's stance.

There was evidence to the effect the world was round for about 900 years prior that the church was actively supressing (death for the heresy) because they felt it jeopardized their worldview.  Galileo was excommunicated for it.<br>
<br>
The scandinavians (Vikings) had already landed in america about 500 years earlier and were escorting french vessles to the fisheries south of greenland regularly for a sizable fee 200 years prior to chris becoming a captain.<br>
<br>
All of this is factual and supported by the evidence of the historical record.  You should have learned it at about the 3rd grade in public school.  Interestingly enough, it was just 3 years ago that the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>flat earth society</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dissolved.

i'm sure much more of what was published at the time had to go against what he knew in ih heart.  or did everyone really know the truth and just never got around to sailing?<br>
<br>
of course i'm glad he did what he did but i think it would be a hrad pressed case to prove he did so solely in the name of proof that the earth was round.  you said yourself when he landed it wasn't like it is today when we fly to another country, &quot;ok, here we are&quot;  his feelings of what he wanted to believe was truth were now validated by his own experience and were now knowledge to him and the others aboard only.<br>

Deductions based on evidence and a study of the 15th C are a far cry from your spiritual revelations and to spread this bunk does a disservice to everyone. I admit, this does aggravate me as a former history teacher. <br>
<br>
1.Columbus was not seeking to prove the earth was round. He was attempting to find the lands that Marco Polo had to China a few hundred years before. It was about trade and exploration, not following god’s spirit. Finding a route through the Caribbean islands and bumping into North America was a boo-boo, not a confirmation of some spiritual message.<br>
<br>
2.The people of his time WANTED a new route to replace the passage now blocked with the fall of Constantinople to the Muslims. They wanted to purchase asian products directly, not through the Muslims at the places they still could. It was a race dag---spoils to the winner and that’s why some royalty was ecstatic to provide the dough.<br>
3.Columbus’ voyages proved his theories/feelings/ideas TOTALLY WRONG. He based them on texts as old as the 2nd Century (yup, that’s right, men had figured the earth was round waaaaaaaaay before Columbus and he borrowed the idea from them, not the holy spirit). To quote one author, “Columbus founded his theory on two mistaken propositions—that the Asian continent stretched much farther to the east than it actually does, and that Japan lay about 2,400 km (about 1,500 mi) east of the Asian mainland. Columbus also greatly underestimated the circumference of the earth. Columbus calculated that the Canary Islands lay only about 4,440 km (about 2,760 mi) from Japan; the actual distance is about 19,000 km (about 12,000 mi). Similar errors were made by other learned men of the time, including the Florentine geographer Paulo de Pozzo Toscanelli, with whom Columbus may have corresponded. Neither Columbus nor anyone else in Europe suspected that two vast continents lay in the way of a westward passage to Asia.”<br>
<br>
4.Even after reaching the new lands and all that happened with settlements, Columbus was so convinced he HAD reached Asia after all, he led no less than 3 more expeditions to the Caribbean. No holy spirit help there and he naturally failed yet again.<br>
<br>
5.Columbus was a vain men very concerned with status and wealth and was rewarded for his finds. He may have been brave, but it was nothing holy nor higher purpose in his travels…it was about fame, money and status and if a few thousand Natives were slaughtered and/or enslaved as a result, well so be it.<br>
<br>
6.Columbus WAS NOT the first one to reach North America—the Vikings were. They were not following the HF either.<br>
<br>
None of this is “feelings” and just because every minute of his life is not recorded on a camcorder does not mean it is equally valid with your baseless claims he was guided by a spirit. I dare say one of your leaders born well after these events thought this little gem up and has fortunately not spread it around much or folks might have some rather alarming revelations about the LDS church. <br>
<br>
Please tell me this is not the crap being fed to LDS kids!! Other Mormons---you don't also believe this and other wacky claims with no foundation from history do you? Is this one man's creation or something regularly taught small children?<br>
<br>
Any other areas of history you care to twist beyond recognition in contradiction to the facts and evidence? Sorry but doing this to history is my pet peeve.<br>

Epistomology is a fascinating subject which we should probably start another thread for. This was to discuss the social contract I discussed when you asked about how atheists can have morality without gods.
