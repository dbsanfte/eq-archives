<br>
“A vacation? Beka, you can’t be serious,” Dylan Hunt said to his first officer, Beka Valentine. The two were sharing duty on the command deck, guiding the giant warship, the Andromeda Ascendant, to the next slip portal. Where they were going, they weren’t really sure. Adventures always seemed to find them, but in the last few months they’d had enough adventures to last a lifetime. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka stared ardently at him. She’d obviously anticipated any answer he would give. “I am serious, Dylan. Come on, we’re not machines. We need some down time, a break, a rest, a holiday, a….”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Vacation? Yeah, I get it, Beka. I think you’ve been spending too much time with Harper,” Dylan laughed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Now you see why I need the vacation,” Beka said, smiling.<br>
<br>
“So, where would you like to spend this little vacation?” Dylan asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka looked toward the ceiling, her mind debating the many options open to the crew for a decent vacation. “I was thinking…Infinity Atoll. Harper could do some surfing; I could get some sun, so could you, actually; Trance could explore the plant life and Tyr could do…whatever Nietzscheans do on a beach.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“That would be nothing,” Tyr Anasazi said when he entered the command deck, hearing the tail end of the conversation pertaining to him. Beka eyed him curiously. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Nothing? Oh, come on, Tyr, don’t tell me you’ve never kicked back and soaked in the sun?” Beka said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I prefer to spend any ‘down time’ as you call it, preparing for our next battle,” Tyr said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, Mr. Doom and Gloom, while you’re exhausting yourself with one armed chin lifts, I’ll be letting the UV rays toast my skin to a healthy tan,” Beka said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Assuming I allow a vacation,” Dylan teased. Beka stared at him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I think you will. Even the great Captain Dylan Hunt needs a rest,” Beka said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Dylan sighed, but gave Beka a playful grin. “I guess you’re right.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I knew you’d see it my way,” Beka said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
A force like none the Andromeda had ever experienced hit the starship, sending the three members of the crew on the command deck spilling over their stations. Attempting to stand, they were tossed around by lesser shockwaves that still managed to knock them off their feet.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Andromeda, what’s going on?” Dylan asked, though he was shouting.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’m detecting a slipstream event,” Andromeda reported, her image still strong on the screen. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“A slipstream event?” Beka asked. “The shockwaves are never this bad.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“The ship is coming through,” Andromeda said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“On screen,” Dylan said, pulling himself up. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
A giant portal opened in the middle of space, larger than any slip portal any of them had ever laid eyes on. The strings reached out a greater distance, creating more shockwaves that bombarded the ship. The most curious thing about the slip portal was the color. Usually a bright white, the slip portal was a strange neon blue. Seconds passed and no ship exited the portal. Then, just as suddenly as the portal had opened, a small, silver ship emerged from the portal. The tiny ship blasted away from the portal as the strings receded and the light faded. The portal was closed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Dylan, Beka, and Tyr returned to their stations, still hesitant of any shockwaves that might hit the ship again. The silver ship was now floating carelessly near the Andromeda, getting closer to the warship as if it were a baby coming home to mother. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Andromeda, identify the ship,” Dylan said. Andromeda’s eyes looked up as she processed the information from the unidentified ship. She looked back to Dylan, her face confused. It was an odd look coming from a ship that seemed to know and understand everything. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What is it, ship?” Tyr asked, a hint of agitation in his voice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“The unidentified ship has serial numbers and data logs matching the Eureka Maru,” Andromeda reported. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“The Maru? But she’s in the hanger,” said Harper over the com link. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Thank you, Harper,” Dylan said. “Andromeda, open a channel.” The channel link sounded. “Unknown vessel, this is Captain Dylan Hunt of the Andromeda Ascendant. Please identify yourself.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
There was no answer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Maybe they’re injured,” Beka said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I repeat, unknown vessel, please identify yourself,” Dylan said. On screen, a young man’s face appeared. He had jet black hair tied back in a ponytail with piercing blue eyes that stared back at Dylan with a mixture of relief and confusion. He didn’t answer, he just stared. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Uh – uh…Chloe! Riley! Get up here!” he called, never taking his eyes off Dylan. They could hear the pounding of running feet as two new people appeared on screen. The girl, Chloe, looked no more than seventeen with short brown hair and soft green eyes. She gasped when her eyes met Dylan’s. The boy, Riley, looked to be a tall young man of eighteen, but his face reminded them all of a member of the Andromeda’s crew. He had a youthful face, but his sparkling blue eyes showed a man of many more years; his short, blonde hair spiked up from gel, looking strangely like a younger version of Harper. Riley stared back at Dylan with the same shock and awe reflected by the young pilot. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I don’t believe it!” Chloe gasped. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Jack…” Riley said, pushing the pilot’s shoulder. Jack blinked, coming out of his daze. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Uh, right,” he said. He took a deep breath and smiled nervously. “This is Jack Valentine, Chloe Hunt, and Riley Harper of the Eureka Maru, requesting permission to dock.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
The crew on command all stared at each other. Dylan and Beka were the most shocked of all. When a moment passed and nothing was said, Dylan looked at Beka and shrugged. He had no idea how to handle the situation. He turned back to the three teenagers staring at him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Permission granted,” Dylan said. The image of the three teens disappeared and still everyone was in a state of shock.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“So much for a vacation,” Beka said. <br>
<br>

<br>
_____________________________<br>
<br>
They waited outside the hanger sans Harper, Rommie, and Trance. The three missing crew members were on their way, none of them, except for Rommie, aware of the situation. They only knew they were needed at the hanger. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
The door opened and the three teenagers entered the ship. Jack and Riley were about the same height, an inch taller than Beka, Chloe only a few inches shorter. <br>
<br>
When they entered, they didn’t seem sure how to act. Tears sprung to Chloe’s eyes and she jumped at Dylan, wrapping her arms around his neck in a powerful hug. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“We found you, Daddy. We found you,” she said. Confused by her words, Dylan still couldn’t help but hug her back. Jack cautiously approached Beka. A hundred words appeared to be spinning around in his eyes, but he couldn’t find a way to make his mouth express them. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Mom?” he said. He took another step closer. Beka didn’t shy away. Jack reached out and put his arms around Beka, pulling her into a tight hug. Beka returned the hug, feeling suddenly closer to the young man then she’d ever been to anyone. Jack broke the hug, holding Beka at arms length, inspecting her. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What?” Beka asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You’re so much…younger,” he said, scowling as he scrutinized her further. Riley hung back. He made eye contact with Tyr but didn’t say anything. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, Dylan, what was so important that we had to come all the way down here and—” Harper said as he, Rommie, and Trance rounded the corner. The heads of all three teenagers snapped up when they heard Harper’s voice. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Dad!” Riley said. Running up to the engineer, the young man couldn’t help but smile. He had Harper’s askew grin. Color immediately drained from Harper’s face. He backed away from Riley before the teenager could touch him. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What the Hell is going on?” Harper asked. He looked at Dylan and Beka, noticing the other teenagers with them. He looked at Riley. “And who’re you?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“My name is Riley F. Harper. I’m your son,” Riley said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t say that!” Harper shouted. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper!” Trance said, touching his arm. Riley’s face fell as he watched his father search frantically for a way out. He’d never expected this reaction. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I want a DNA test,” Harper said. Everyone was silent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“All right, Harper, we can do that,” Dylan said, trying to keep his engineer calm. Harper wasn’t very good at handling strange situations with all the grace and slendor of a veteran, despite how many strange things they’d seen in the past three years. He looked at Chloe and Jack. “I think everyone should have one.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Daddy!” Chloe said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Just to be safe,” Dylan said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Might as well get it over with,” Rommie said. Harper went first, Trance following behind him. Riley stood stunned as everyone else walked past him. He saw Chloe glance over her shoulder and motion him forward with her eyes. Sucking up the sinking feeling he felt in his gut, Riley joined the group, determined to reconnect with his father. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
It was several minutes before the DNA tests were finished. The teenagers stood away from the crew of the Andromeda. They all suddenly felt uncomfortable because of the test being conducted. Riley tried several times to make eye contact with Harper, but the engineer refused to look at the young man. He could plainly see the resemblance but refused to believe the truth. Beka looked over at Jack. The kid seemed pretty confident. He looked at Beka and winked. She smiled. He definitely had her personality but she noticed it bordered somewhat on Harper’s as well. Dylan gave Chloe a reassuring smile. She returned it. He noticed her hand slowly slip into Riley’s. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“The tests are done,” Rommie said. Harper finally looked at Riley, hoping that the matter would be settled once and for all. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“And?” Dylan asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“The tests conclude that Chloe Hunt is the daughter of Dylan Hunt and an unknown woman, Jack Valentine is the son of Beka Valentine and an unknown man, and Riley Harper is the son of Seamus Harper and an unknown woman,” Rommie said. Riley looked to Harper for confirmation and acceptance. Harper gave him no reaction. The engineer stood still, staring at a piece of machinery. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, now that this little ordeal is over…what now?” Beka asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I think we should let Chloe, Jack, and Riley rest. This has probably been a lot to handle,” Dylan said. Dylan put his hand out to Chloe. She took it and walked out of medical with her father. Beka walked up to Jack.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Lemme guess…you wanna see the new Maru?” Jack said before Beka could get a word out. <br>
<br>
Beka smiled. “Let’s go, hotshot.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, ma’am,” Jack said, walking out with his mother. Riley fidgeted. It was only him, Harper, Trance, and Rommie. <br>
<br>
“Dad, I know it’s a lot to take in but—”<br>
<br>
“I gotta go do some repairs,” Harper said, cutting Riley off. Harper quickly walked out of medical. Riley swallowed hard, trying to get rid of the lump in his throat. Trance touched his arm. He looked at her, tears brimming in his eyes. <br>
<br>
“Give him time. Harper doesn’t adjust to sudden change very well. Did he ever tell you how he reacted to my change?” she asked. <br>
<br>
“No. You did,” Riley said. Trance took his arm.<br>
<br>
“Let’s go for a walk,” she said. Riley nodded, strolling out of medical with her. Rommie was alone, but not for long. Andromeda’s hologram appeared next to her. <br>
<br>
“A second generation. Interesting,” the hologram said. <br>
<br>
“Not half as interesting as how they got here,” Rommie said. <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br>
<br>
Trance led Riley out to the Observation Deck, keeping hold of his arm. She sensed something within him that made her curious. He was human, but there was something else that felt strangely familiar about him. He was looking at her, smiling. His face and grin may have belonged to Harper, but when he smiled…she gasped. <br>
<br>
“You told me it would take a while before you figured it out,” he said, leaning against the railing. <br>
<br>
“How much of me…?” Trance began to ask.<br>
<br>
“Not a lot. I can sense things, mostly just feelings and hunches that turn out to be right,” he said. “Aura has more of you in her. I mean, she looks exactly like you.”<br>
<br>
“Aura?” Trance asked. Riley ran his hand through his hair.<br>
<br>
“My sister. She looks like you when you were purple. Tail and all,” Riley said, smiling at the memories produced. <br>
<br>
“Then why isn’t she with you?” Trance asked. <br>
<br>
“You wouldn’t let her go with us. Aura, she’s very important,” Riley said. “I think someone was after her and I think they got her. That’s why we can’t stay very long. I need to find my family.”<br>
<br>
“You will,” Trance said. His face changed before her eyes. He appeared to look like a lost little boy searching in a crowded room for a familiar face. He wrapped his arms around her, hugging tightly.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t think I’d see you again, Mom,” he said quietly. Trance cupped his face in her hands. <br>
<br>
“Everything will be okay. That’s one of my hunches.”<br>
<br>

Chloe entered the crew quarters first, having already informed Dylan that it had been her room. She looked at the ordinary furniture and colors that matched every other room on the Andromeda. Frowning briefly, she moved to the bed and sat down, hugging herself in order to find some comfort. Dylan stood in the doorway, watching her. He’d always wanted children, though he’d always imagined having them with Sarah, but it was unnerving to see his daughter from the future, practically grown up, sitting in front of him. <br>
<br>
“How are you?” Dylan asked, sitting on the bed next to her. Chloe half-smiled, thinking about the question.<br>
<br>
“I feel…weird. I know this is Andromeda, but it’s not my Andromeda,” she said. “And I don’t know if it ever will be my Andromeda.”<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” Dylan asked. <br>
<br>
“We could be affecting the future as we speak. My being here could change the course of history. I could be preventing my own birth!” she exclaimed, getting off the bed. She began pacing in front of her father, a frantic gaze in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, if you were preventing your own birth, you wouldn’t be here,” Dylan said. Chloe stopped pacing. She looked at Dylan.<br>
<br>
“Oh my God! Forget about when…what about the where?” she said.<br>
<br>
“I don’t follow,” Dylan said. <br>
<br>
“What if…we’re in another dimension? An alternate reality? Oh, God, we never even considered…You’re Dylan Hunt, but you could be a Dylan Hunt who never has a daughter. I may not even exist to you,” she said, tears pouring down her face. Dylan grabbed her shoulders and pulled her into a hug, rubbing her back soothingly.<br>
<br>
“I don’t believe that, Chloe. I think you’re right where you need to be,” Dylan said. He held her at arms length, gazing into her beautiful green eyes. “Trust me. I’ve had some experience with time travel.”<br>
<br>
Chloe smiled. “Yeah, I know. You’ve told me a dozen times.”<br>
<br>
“I tell a lot of stories?” Dylan asked.<br>
<br>
“You had enough to write five holo-novels,” she said. Dylan chuckled at the thought of his own future. He noticed the downcast look in Chloe’s eyes. <br>
<br>
“What’s wrong?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“You left?”<br>
<br>
“I what?”<br>
<br>
“You told me, Jack, and Riley to go to Infinity Atoll while Andromeda was undergoing repairs. We went, but when we came back…you were gone. No message, no distress call…you were just gone. All we could do was search. The Commonwealth wouldn’t say anything,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Or couldn’t,” Dylan said.<br>
<br>
“We’d considered you guys were on a mission, but…why wouldn’t you take us?” she asked, her voice conveying all the hurt she’d been feeling since their search began.<br>
<br>
“Too dangerous probably,” Dylan answered.<br>
<br>
“Daddy, we’ve been in battles before. Living on a warship, you can’t really avoid them,” she said. <br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, in advance,” Dylan said, smiling. <br>
<br>
“Don’t worry, I’ve never been able to stay mad at you very long,” she said. <br>
<br>
“Want to go get something to eat?” Dylan asked.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I’m starving. You can only survive on Sparkys and leftovers for so long,” she said. “Although Riley insists it’s just as nutritional as any meal from the auto-chef.”<br>
<br>
“Riley, huh?” Dylan said. Chloe blushed.<br>
<br>
“We’ll talk about it in the Mess Hall,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Lead on,” Dylan said. <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br>
<br>
Harper sat in the conduit, staring at the circuit board. There were no repairs to conduct; Rommie was running smoothly at the moment. He just needed a reason to get away. Rommie’s hologram had appeared several times, trying to get him to talk, but Harper rebuffed her at each turn. He didn’t feel like talking. <br>
<br>
“Dad…” began Riley. Harper watched the young man climb down the ladder into the conduit, holding a flexi in his hand. Finally getting a good look at him, Harper couldn’t ignore the resemblance. Riley stayed by the ladder, staring at his father. He’d never seen him this way. He was scared. “Look, I can’t apologize for being your son. But, I understand why this is so hard for you.”<br>
<br>
“No, you don’t,” Harper said. He motioned for Riley to sit down. Riley sat across from his father, allowing him the space he needed. “When I was growing up - on Earth - I saw a lot of mothers having babies. They were lucky if the kid lasted to the next day. Having a kid was like preparing for a funeral. I wanted kids, but I knew it wasn’t in the cards. Even when I got off Earth and eventually made it to the Andromeda, I knew it wouldn’t be possible.”<br>
<br>
“Well it happened, Dad. I’m living proof,” Riley said. Harper smiled for the first time since meeting his son. <br>
<br>
“Yeah, I guess you’re right.”<br>
<br>
“Of course I am,” Riley said. Harper pointed to the flexi.<br>
<br>
“What’s that?” he asked.<br>
<br>
Riley crossed the conduit to sit by his father. Harper didn’t back away. He activated the flexi. A picture of Harper holding a baby in his arms appeared. Harper couldn’t hide the shock on his face. <br>
<br>
“It’s my photo album. I keep it on the Maru and I thought I’d show you,” Riley said. <br>
<br>
“That’s you?” Harper asked, pointing to the baby. Riley nodded. The picture changed to Harper asleep on his bunk in the Maru, his arm covering a peacefully sleeping baby Riley.<br>
<br>
“I went through a phase where I’d only sleep on the Maru,” Riley said, chuckling. The picture changed to a beach. Harper was in the water standing next to a surfboard. Riley, now a boy of around four, was sitting on top of the surfboard. The picture depicted Harper teaching Riley about surfing.<br>
<br>
“You any good?” Harper asked. <br>
<br>
Riley smiled, showing Harper his inherited grin. “I placed 15th in the Pan Galactic last year. It would’ve been tenth if I hadn’t wiped out in a tunnel.” <br>
<br>
“You’ve gotta be my kid if you’d tackle Infinity’s waves,” Harper said. The picture changed to Harper holding two boys in his lap and a little girl wrapping her arms around his neck. All of them were smiling. <br>
<br>
“You were kind of our unofficial babysitter,” Riley said. “You always managed to get to us first when there was danger.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, Rommie’s like a giant ‘hit me’ sign in the middle of the universe,” Harper said. “I can’t believe we’d let you stay on this ship.”<br>
<br>
“Where else could we go?” Riley asked. The picture changed to a seven-year-old Riley and Harper sitting next to a large, black Great Dane.<br>
<br>
“We have a dog?” Harper said. “Dylan would never let an animal on board.”<br>
<br>
“Well, Einstein’s not exactly a dog,” Riley said. Harper smiled.<br>
<br>
“Android?” he said. Riley nodded. He burst out laughing. “What?”<br>
<br>
“I was just remembering when I was eight. I reprogrammed Einstein’s neural nexus to speak Common. He scared the hell out of these dignitaries from Castalia,” Riley said, trying to keep his laughter down to a minimum.<br>
<br>
“Guess the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree,” Harper said. <br>
<br>
“You have no idea,” Riley said. The picture changed to Riley and Jack, now teenagers, playing basketball in Hydroponics. “He’s my best friend.”<br>
<br>
“Beka’s mine. Friendships between Harpers and Valentines run deep,” Harper said. Riley nodded. The picture changed again to Riley and Chloe, posing on the Observation Deck. Riley had his arm around Chloe who had her head on his shoulder. Harper could tell they were obviously in love. <br>
<br>
“You and the Captain’s daughter,” Harper chuckled. <br>
<br>
“I wanna marry her, Dad,” Riley said. <br>
<br>
Harper stared at his son skeptically. “Aren’t you a little young? I mean, you’re only, what, eighteen, right? Chloe’s only seventeen.”<br>
<br>
“I know. But, Dad, it feels right with her. Have you ever had that feeling? Ya know, that dip in your stomach that won’t go away whenever you’re around her?” Riley asked.<br>
<br>
“Can’t say that I have,” Harper admitted. He’d had crushes on a lot of different women, but he’d never experienced what Riley was telling him about. The closest he ever came to that was when he was around…<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry, Dad, you’ll get it. But that’s the way I feel around Chloe. She’s…everything,” he said, his eyes sparkling with love for Dylan’s daughter. <br>
<br>
“I’ll remember that,” Harper said, giving Riley’s shoulder a squeeze. Riley changed the picture again. It was of Harper and Beka, her arms wrapped around his neck, both smiling happily. <br>
<br>
“Beka could have been my mother for all I knew. You two were so comfortable around each other. I could see you loved her…it just took me a while to realize it was plutonic,” Riley said, smiling fondly at the picture. <br>
<br>
“I noticed there are no pictures of your mother,” Harper said. <br>
<br>
“Oh there are. I just don’t have any with me,” he said. It was cryptic. Harper frowned slightly. He wanted to know who the mother of his son was so he could have an idea who to look for in the future. <br>
<br>
“I don’t suppose you could describe her to me,” Harper said. <br>
<br>
“You’ll know her…eventually,” Riley said. Harper watched his son. Riley slowly smiled. Harper had to blink several times. His son’s smile reminded him strangely of Trance.<br>

Beka inspected the multiple plasma screens attached to the new Maru, which Jack was calling Silver Maru for posterity’s sake. The deck plating was solid; smoke didn’t rise from the floor. The kitchen was stocked to feed an army. The crew’s quarters looked like actual beds instead of bunks. She’d seen the engine room and everything was running smoothly. The strange thing was that her old room had been turned into another command central, serving as secondary back-up in case of sudden attack. <br>
<br>
“I’m tellin’ ya, Mom, the Maru purrs like a kitten. I think she runs smoother than the Andromeda on a good day,” Jack said, sitting at the bar, drinking a Sparky. <br>
<br>
“You spent a lot of time upgrading her,” Beka said.<br>
<br>
“It became necessary after a while. She practically got blown to smithereens escaping some Dragons. After that, Dad and Riley got to work making her shiny and new,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Dad?” Beka inquired. Jack practically spit up the sip of Sparky. He shyly looked down at the bar.<br>
<br>
“Harper. He – um – he’s kinda my…” Beka cupped his cheek in her hand, stroking with her thumb.<br>
<br>
“I understand,” she said. They heard excited footsteps entering the Maru. <br>
<br>
“Everything’s state-of-the-art, Dad! There’s stuff on the Maru that would rival most warships,” Riley said. He and Harper walked in front of the bar, finding Beka and Jack. <br>
<br>
“Hey, the gang’s all here!” Jack said. <br>
<br>
“Riley, about these upgrades,” Beka began.<br>
<br>
“I gotcha,” Riley said. “The silver hull is first-class Promethium alloy. Won’t be used for – like – twenty years. We could be dead in space and never get cold. And, it’s pretty durable. Nietzschean blasters hardly scratched the surface. The engines have specially modified thrusters. We have newly installed sensor drones operated out of Beka’s old quarters. Everything is voice activated, command codes, privacy mode…”<br>
<br>
“Privacy mode?” Beka asked. <br>
<br>
“Oh, I forgot about the best part. We took a chunk of Andromeda’s AI core and programmed it into the Maru,” Riley said. <br>
<br>
“You what?” Beka said. “But that’s impossible.”<br>
<br>
“Not really,” Harper said. “All you have to do is merge the AI core with the Maru’s circulatory matrix.”<br>
<br>
“Thought about it before, Harper?” Beka asked suspiciously. <br>
<br>
“Thought about it? Hell, we used his plans,” Jack said. Harper’s head snapped in Jack’s direction. Jack sauntered over to the pilot’s chair and pulled out several flexis. He handed them to Beka. <br>
<br>
“These are dated the year after we joined Dylan,” Beka said, looking at Harper.<br>
<br>
“Just a few ideas I had after working on Rommie,” Harper said. <br>
<br>
“You never told me about these,” Beka said.<br>
<br>
“Didn’t think you’d go for it,” Harper said. <br>
<br>
“She didn’t. Not until the Maru was two big chunks of scrap metal,” Jack said. He tossed a Sparky to Riley. <br>
<br>
“And had one very damaged pilot,” Riley added, looking at Jack.<br>
<br>
“You were flying?” Beka asked Jack. <br>
<br>
“It’s my ship too. How was I supposed to know the Nietzscheans were gonna get mad when I buzzed their ships,” Jack said. Beka and Harper stared in mild shock at Jack’s nonchalant statement. <br>
<br>
“You…what?” Beka half whispered. <br>
<br>
“Okay, I think we’ve had enough precious memories for one day. Why don’t we all get some dinner?” Harper suggested. Beka grabbed Jack by the scruff of his neck, leading him off the Maru. <br>
<br>
“I am gonna ground you so bad when this actually happens,” she said, her voice fading as she exited. Harper and Riley shared a glance. They both burst out laughing, following Beka and Jack to the Mess Hall.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br>
<br>
Dylan, Harper, Beka, their children, and Trance all sat in the Mess Hall, eating dinner and sharing stories. Harper and Beka told of how they first met, only mentioning Bobby a few times. Dylan told of a few missions he’d gone on before he became a High Guard Captain. Jack and Riley told a few short versions of a few adventures they’d had on the Maru that met with some odd and concerned looked from their parents. The two boys pushed and punched each other like brothers, laughing the whole time. Chloe was a naturally silent person, observing quietly. Harper and Dylan watched as Chloe took Riley’s hand. The looks they gave each other told volumes more than words could ever say. Dylan felt almost jealous of his daughter for finding love so soon in life. But he couldn’t help but be happy for her, though he’d have to have a serious talk with Riley. Caught up in the merriment of the moment, none of them noticed Rommie entering. <br>
<br>
“Dylan,” Rommie said. “Can I talk to you outside for a moment?”<br>
<br>
“Sure, Rommie,” Dylan said. He followed the android out of the Mess Hall. Riley’s eyes kept darting back to the door.<br>
<br>
“Riley, you okay?” Harper asked. <br>
<br>
“Yeah, I’m fine, Dad,” Riley said.<br>
<br>
“WHAT!!” came Dylan’s voice. Riley, Jack, and Chloe all flinched. Dylan stormed back into the room, Rommie right behind him.<br>
<br>
“Hi, Dylan,” Jack and Riley said.<br>
<br>
“Hi, Daddy,” Chloe said. <br>
“You used a tesseract machine?” Dylan said. Beka, Trance, and Harper looked at the teens. <br>
<br>
“Only parts of it,” Riley said. <br>
<br>
“Dylan, what’s going on?” Beka asked. <br>
<br>
“The pieces of the tesseract machine in Harper’s shop began to activate at the approximate time the Silver Maru came through slipstream. I found a similar energy signature coming from the slipstream drive of the Maru,” Rommie said. <br>
<br>
“That’s how you got here?” Harper asked. <br>
<br>
“It was an experiment,” Riley said.<br>
<br>
“You could’ve been killed! That tesseract machine is nothing but trouble!” Harper shouted. <br>
<br>
“It’s not like we had a lot of choices!” Riley yelled back. “You guys were gone! We didn’t know what to do!”<br>
<br>
“Riley…” Chloe said, squeezing his arm. Her touch seemed to calm him. Riley sighed and placed his arms on the table, resting his head in his hands. <br>
<br>
“Let’s try this differently,” Beka said, trying to be the voice of reason despite her own inclinations to yell at the kids. Chloe turned to face everyone, becoming the spokesperson.<br>
<br>
“Riley had been experimenting with the tesseract machine in secret on the Maru before the Andromeda disappeared. When we found ourselves on our own, we tracked the Andromeda as far as we could until the trail went cold in the Helix Galaxy. We didn’t have any other options,” Chloe said. Everyone looked at Riley. He sighed again in frustration, but kept from looking at Harper.<br>
<br>
“Tesseract machines can be used for a myriad of things. Given the time and the experimentation, the possibilities are endless. I attached pieces of the original machine Dad stole from the Magog to the slipstream drive. It had the ability to read energy signatures and stimulate accelerated slipstream,” Riley said.<br>
<br>
“Accelerated slipstream?” Harper asked, more curious than angry. Riley could hear the change in his voice and finally looked at him.<br>
<br>
“Basically Einstein’s Theory of Relativity pushed to its extreme limit. If you go fast enough, you can go back in time or forward. It’s all based on the polarity the tesseact is set for,” Riley said. <br>
<br>
“So, to make a short story long, we used the tesseract machine to lock on to a faint energy signature from the Andromeda and followed it,” Jack said. Riley nudged him.<br>
<br>
“Unfortunately, we must have picked up on a very old energy signature because we followed it right into the past,” Riley said. He looked at Harper and found him smiling proudly. <br>
<br>
“Who’d of thought our kids could cause so much trouble,” Beka said. <br>
<br>
“It’s not that hard to imagine,” Harper said. <br>
<br>
“Okay, now that we know how you got here, it should be easy to get you home, right?” Dylan said. <br>
<br>
“Just a hop, skip, and a slipstream jump,” Jack said. <br>
<br>
“You want us to leave?” Chloe asked. <br>
<br>
Dylan smiled. “Not yet.”<br>
<br>
Suddenly the ship jerked. Chloe and Riley slid into Jack, pushing him off his seat. Harper knocked into Beka, who steadied him. Dylan shuddered but stood firm along with Rommie and Trance. <br>
<br>
“All hands report to Command,” Andromeda announced. Everyone got up and raced to Command. Tyr was already there waiting for them. <br>
<br>
“What’s going on?” Dylan asked.<br>
<br>
“Nietzschean battle cruiser,” Tyr said. <br>
<br>
“What do they want?” Trance asked. <br>
<br>
“My advice would be to shoot now and ask questions later,” Tyr said. <br>
<br>
“Always sound advice, Tyr,” Dylan said. The ship shook again. Everyone grabbed on to something. <br>
<br>
“The Nietzcheans are firing long-range plasma missiles. My hull is stabilized but won’t be if they continue to fire,” Andromeda said.<br>
<br>
“Andromeda, get Hanger 15 ready to launch the Silver Maru,” Jack said.<br>
<br>
“Jack!” Beka said.<br>
<br>
“She’s fast and she’s got weapons better than the ones on the older model,” Jack said. <br>
<br>
“How fast?” Beka asked. Jack grinned.<br>
<br>
“Wanna see?” he said. He and Beka ran out of Command to the Silver Maru.<br>
<br>
“Trance, weapons station, Harper, Tyr, Riley, operate remote fighters. Chloe, you’ve got the helm,” Dylan ordered. Everyone took their stations. The Nietzscheans fired again; the ship shook violently. <br>
<br>
“Hull breaches on decks ten through twenty-eight,” Andromeda reported. <br>
<br>
“Is the Maru out?” Dylan asked.<br>
<br>
“The Silver Maru has cleared the hanger,” Andromeda said as another missile hit the hull.<br>
<br>
“On screen,” Dylan said. The screen showed the Maru whipping around in front of the Andromeda, heading towards the Nietzschean ship. Missiles from the Maru ejected and landed direct hits on the enemy ship.   <br>
<br>
“Yes!” Riley shouted. The fighters piloted by Harper, Riley, and Tyr came from either side of the Maru, firing back-up after the missiles. The Nietzscheans returned fire on the Maru. Jack easily avoided them, zooming over the enemy dropping bombs. Explosions erupted along the hull of the ship. <br>
<br>
“What kind of weapons do you have on that ship?” Dylan asked. <br>
<br>
“The best a Harper can build,” Riley said.<br>
<br>
“That’s my boy,” Harper said. <br>
<br>
“Dylan, the Nietzschean ship is preparing to fire a plasma canon,” Andromeda said.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, hard one eighty!” Dylan shouted. Chloe steered as best she could. Dylan watched the Maru avoid the growing energy from the plasma canon that quickly fired. The energy hit the Andromeda with wild force. Consoles blew up, spraying fire all over the deck. The impact of the explosions sent Harper, Tyr, and Riley over their stations into the empty portion of the deck by the plasma screens. <br>
<br>
“Trance, fire all weapons!” Dylan shouted. <br>
<br>
“Aye!” Trance shouted. Missiles from the Andromeda and the Maru hit the Nietzschean vessel, tearing the hull apart, creating a tidal wave of energy that hit the Andromeda, shaking the ship but not causing further damage. <br>
<br>
“The Nietzschean vessel has been destroyed. The Maru is returning to the hanger,” Andromeda reported. <br>
<br>
“Dad!” Riley shouted. Dylan and Trance rushed over to where Riley was, leaning over Harper. Tyr pushed himself off the ground.<br>
<br>
“Riley, move aside,” Trance said gently. Harper was lying on his side, a deep gash dripping blood on his hairline. A bruise had already formed on his forehead. <br>
<br>
“Is he okay?” Dylan asked. <br>
<br>
“It’s a concussion. It doesn’t look good,” Trance said. Riley let out a groan. Trance looked at him. “Riley?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t—” Riley collapsed. Luckily, Tyr was there to catch him. <br>
<br>
“He’s alive,” Tyr said. <br>
<br>
“Trance,” Dylan began. <br>
<br>
“We need to get them to medical,” Trance said. The doors to Command opened. Jack and Beka walked in, looking awfully proud of themselves. <br>
<br>
“The way she flies, I just might have those upgrades done now, Harper,” Beka said, not noticing everyone crowded on the lower part of the deck.  She saw Harper lying on the floor, blood on the side of his head, and Riley, unconscious, in Tyr’s arms.<br>
<br>
“What happened?” Jack asked, frantically rushing over to Harper.<br>
<br>
“We can’t explain. They need to get to medical,” Trance said. Dylan scooped Harper into his arms. The engineer didn’t move, didn’t moan or groan in pain. He was completely silent. Jack went to Chloe, putting a supporting hand on her shoulder. Beka raced after Dylan, Trance, and Tyr going to the med deck. <br>
<br>
“They’ll be okay,” Jack said. Chloe nodded, a tear slipping down her cheek.<br>
<br>
“I know,” she said.<br>
<br>

Harper and Riley lay on separate beds, both lying still. Harper’s head wound had been bandaged but blood still seeped through the bandage. There appeared to be nothing wrong with Riley, aside from the fact that he was unconscious. He seemed to be sleeping peacefully. Trance passed a scanner over Riley, frowning at the lack of readings. Dylan and Beka stood between the two beds. <br>
<br>
“What’s going on, Trance?” Beka asked.<br>
<br>
“Harper’s concussion is worse than I thought. There’s some swelling around his brain,” Trance said.<br>
<br>
“But he’ll be all right, right?” Beka asked, touching Harper’s shoulder. Trance kept looking at her scanner, passing it over Riley. “Trance?”<br>
<br>
“It’s 50/50 at this point,” Trance said. <br>
<br>
“But that doesn’t explain Riley,” Dylan said.<br>
<br>
“Yes it does,” Beka said. He looked at Beka. “They’re from the future, Dylan. And from where we’re standing, they haven’t even been born yet. So, if Harper dies…”<br>
<br>
“Riley dies,” Dylan finished.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br>
<br>
Jack was standing outside medical. He wanted to go in, but he was afraid of what he would see. He would never get used to seeing Harper on a medical bed, no matter how much time passed. He didn’t know what to do about Riley. His best friend could die as well and there was nothing he could do to fix it. They couldn’t have come this far for everything to fall apart so easily. <br>
 <br>
Dylan had left a few minutes ago and his mother was still inside, sitting with Harper. <br>
<br>
“Jack?” Trance said. He jumped, covering his mouth so he didn’t yelp. Trance looked just as surprised. She smiled apologetically. “Sorry.”<br>
<br>
“It’s okay. I’m not really on guard right now,” he said. He looked back into medical. Beka was leaning back in her chair, whispering something into Harper’s ear, waiting for a response that wouldn’t come.<br>
<br>
“You can go in,” she said. <br>
<br>
Jack shook his head. “I’m not sure I want to.”<br>
<br>
“They’ll be fine,” she said. <br>
<br>
“Do you really know that, Trance?” he asked. “Because my whole life, I accepted the fact that you knew things that couldn’t be explained. Riley and Aura can do it too, and I went along with it because I didn’t have any other choice. But I wasn’t prepared for this. You didn’t tell us this would happen.”<br>
<br>
“I couldn’t, Jack,” she said. <br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“I can’t tell you everything. If you knew Harper was going to be injured, you would have tried to prevent it from happening, right?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“Of course I would,” he said. <br>
<br>
“But what if by helping Harper, you condemned Riley to death? Or Dylan? Knowing what will happen can often times be more dangerous than not knowing,” Trance said. He crossed his arms, looking very much like Beka. His brow furrowed in concentration. <br>
<br>
“I don’t like it,” Jack said. <br>
<br>
“Not being able to do anything?” she asked.<br>
<br>
He nodded. “Yeah.”<br>
<br>
“Neither do I,” she admitted. Jack looked back inside at the three people in his life who meant more to him than anything in the world. He turned back to Trance, fighting a wave of tears.<br>
<br>
“Promise me they’ll be okay,” he demanded. Trance stepped closer to the young man and hugged him. She felt him hug back.<br>
<br>
“I promise,” she whispered into his ear. <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br>
<br>
 <br>
Beka sat in a chair between the two beds. She wanted to be there for both Harpers. From what she’d gathered from Jack, Harper was like a father to him and Riley his older brother. The Harpers and the Valentines were a tiny family within the Andromeda – in the future. Sighing, Beka stroked Harper’s hair with all the love of a friend and family member. <br>
<br>
“He always made me feel like I was his real son,” Jack said as he entered the med deck. <br>
<br>
“Harper’s that kind of guy,” Beka said, smiling fondly at the engineer. <br>
<br>
“I used to be jealous of Riley and Chloe. They had fathers,” Jack said, sitting near Riley’s bed. Beka frowned, but Jack smiled. “I never knew my real father. I know he died before I was born, but…it started not to matter after a while. Harper was always there for me. When you yelled at me – and that was often – he’d come and talk to me, tell me you meant well, but you had a funny way of showing it.”<br>
<br>
“Harper would know. I’ve yelled at him enough since we’ve known each other,” she said. <br>
<br>
“I wanted him to be my real father. I even went as far as to pressure you to marry him,” Jack said, laughing. Beka joined him. “But…that just wouldn’t be possible. Harper told me that he would always be my father; married to you or not.” <br>
<br>
“I take it there was a similar situation with Riley?” Beka asked. <br>
<br>
“Not totally,” Riley said, tiredly. Groaning, Riley sat up in bed. Jack put his hand on his friend’s shoulder.<br>
<br>
“You okay?” Jack asked.<br>
<br>
“If I’m up, Dad must be getting better,” Riley said. He swung his legs over the side of the bed. Jack sat next to him, keeping him steady. <br>
<br>
“So, I wasn’t a good enough mother?” Beka asked playfully. Riley smiled.<br>
<br>
“You...Trance, and Rommie were all my mothers. You did fine, but…Dad was enough for me,” Riley said. Beka nodded, accepting the answer.<br>
<br>
“I’ll go get Trance. She’ll want to take a look at you,” Beka said. Riley and Jack continued to look at Harper’s still form. <br>
<br>
“He’s always been enough,” Riley whispered. Jack gave him a quick hug. It was the most he could do for his brother.<br>
