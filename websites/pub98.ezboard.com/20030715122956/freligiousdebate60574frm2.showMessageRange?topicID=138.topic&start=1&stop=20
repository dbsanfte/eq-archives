There is the one book, which is a collection of stories compiled 335 years after he died largely from oral traditions.  Just like the Blonde jokes of today or Little Willy stories, they could have been exemplary parables that were meant to be taught and just attributed to the buddah, rightly or wrongly.  Even the name is in dispute.  J-Zeus is an excellent marketing label, far more mediterranian that Yeshuah. Testaments like that of John the Baptist read more like HE wanted to be christ and they just incorporated his conflicting dogma under a &quot;they met&quot; umbrella.  We have more evidence of less significant historic figures that is far more substantial.  There are huge gaps in the biography.  Even the book itself has a clear political agenda and has worked very effectively as a tool for controlling populations and validating power structures to this very day.<br>
<br>
What would you hold out as substantive proof of his existance?  (When making this case, contrast it against Joseph Smiths requirements to be proven.)<br>
<br>
<br>
From Alt.Atheism - &quot;Seems to me that Christians worship the incredible shrinking god. I mean at one time it was supposedly capable of flinging thousands of billions of galaxies into existence with a mere thought. By the time of Noah, it was reduced to flooding an insignificant speck in the cosmos. By the time of Moses, its best trick was moving a tiny portion of a minor sea aside for a short while. By the time of Jesus, it has to send a delegate on its behalf who leaves behind only rumors that he was able to turn water into another beverage, or render himself extra buoyant. Now it counts as a miracle if a water stain grows mold that kind of looks like a bearded face which could be claimed to resemble this supposed delegate. How much more pathetic can this god get? How do Christians manage to sing praises of its glory and greatness without feeling like fools--or at best, like new parents gushing over their toddler's ability to make a pee.&quot; <p><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Tacitus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - 1st century Roman who is considered to be one of the more accurate historians of the ancient world.  In writing of the reign of Nero, he alludes to Christ's death as well as the existence of Christians in Rome. &quot;...the persons commonly called Christians, who were hated for their enormities.  Christus, the founder of their name, was put to death by Pontius Pilate...&quot; (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Christus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - Latin for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Christ</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lucian of Samosata</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - Greek satirist of the latter half of the second century...he spoke scornfully of Christ and Christians, never assuming that they were unreal.<br>
<br>
The Gnostic source Gospel of Truth confirms that Jesus was a historical person in several of its passages.  <br>
<br>
The primary sources for the life of Christ are the four Gospels (which as I mentioned have been shown to be reliable).  However there are many other reports from non-Christian sources that supplement and confirm the Gospels.  (These are mostly from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Samaritan sources of the 1st Century.)<br>

The fact that a humorist wrote 120 years after he is supposed to have died about the organization that arose does not validate his existance anymore than articles on The Onion.com validate their excesses from the previous political administration.  The only source listed that bears any credence is Tacitus, and his does not establish Jesus' existance, only that of a political leader that was executed who led that order.  That would be equivalent to us executing Joshep Smith and his title being grounds for assumption of mormon beliefs.  <br>
<br>
The diversity of names, inconsistancy of acts and variety of permutations thru history actuially stand against the existence of JC, Christos, the christ, jesus, yeshua, joshua, etc.  Even the gospels you refer to are inconsistant.  They are ranked in order of authorship and each one expands on the version of the older one adding content and detail that was not present in the oldest.  They were not authored by the people whose names they bear and they were not commited to writing until long after his death.  The artifacts presented are inconsistant with the period.  The shroud of turin had features that are not indiginous to the people he was supposed to come from, the metal of the goblet that was supposed to be from the last supper is not of a type or age to be there, there is no evidence independant of the xian claim.<br>

What about that the book of Luke - it speaks of John the Baptist beginning his ministry of preparing the way for Jesus in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar.  Tacitus, a Roman historian, placed the death of Jesus Christ in the reign of Tiberius.  <br>

<br>
Hyam Maccoby is a Talmudic scholar who writes impeaching Paul as a pharasee.  From his book “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” he writes:<br>
<br>
In using the Epistles as evidence of Paul's life, views and 'mythology', I have confined myself to those Epistles which are accepted by the great majority of New Testament scholars as the genuine work of Paul. Disputed Epistles, such as Colossians, however pertinent to my argument, have been ignored. <br>
<br>
In addition to the rabbinical writings, I have made great use of the ancient historians, especially Josephus, Epiphanius and Eusebius. Their statements must be weighed in relation to their particular interests and bias; but when such bias has been identified and discounted, there remains a residue of valuable information. Exactly the same applies to the New Testament itself. Its information is often distorted by the bias of the author or editor, but a knowledge of the nature of this bias makes possible the emergence of the true shape of events. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Problem of Paul </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We should remember that the New Testament, as we have it, is much more dominated by Paul than appears at first sight. As we read it, we come across the Four Gospels, of which Jesus is the hero, and do not encounter Paul as a character until we embark on the post-Jesus narrative of Acts. Then we finally come into contact with Paul himself, in his letters. But this impression is misleading, for the earliest writings in the New Testament are actually Paul's letters, which were written about AD 50-60, while the Gospels were not written until the period AD 70-110. This means that the theories of Paul were already before the writers of the Gospels and coloured their interpretations of Jesus' activities. Paul is, in a sense, present from the very first word of the New Testament. This is, of course, not the whole story, for the Gospels are based on traditions and even written sources which go back to a time before the impact of Paul, and these early traditions and sources are not entirely obliterated in the final version and give valuable indications of what the story was like before Paulinist editors pulled it into final shape. However, the dominant outlook and shaping perspective of the Gospels is that of Paul, for the simple reason that it was the Paulinist view of what Jesus' sojourn on Earth had been about that was triumphant in the Church as it developed in history. Rival interpretations, which at one time had been orthodox, opposed to Paul's very individual views, now became heretical and were crowded out of the final version of the writings adopted by the Pauline Church as the inspired canon of the New Testament. <br>
<br>
This explains the puzzling and ambiguous role given in the Gospels to the companions of Jesus, the twelve disciples. They are shadowy figures, who are allowed little personality, except of a schematic kind. They are also portrayed as stupid; they never quite understand what Jesus is up to. Their importance in the origins of Christianity is played down in a remarkable way. For example, we find immediately after Jesus' death that the leader of the Jerusalem Church is Jesus' brother James. Yet in the Gospels, this James does not appear at all as having anything to do with Jesus' mission and story. Instead, he is given a brief mention as one of the brothers of Jesus who allegedly opposed Jesus during his lifetime and regarded him as mad. How it came about that a brother who had been hostile to Jesus in his lifetime suddenly became the revered leader of the Church immediately after Jesus' death is not explained, though one would have thought that some explanation was called for. Later Church legends, of course, filled the gap with stories of the miraculous conversion of James after the death of Jesus and his development into a saint. But the most likely explanation is, as will be argued later, that the erasure of Jesus' brother dames (and his other brothers) from any significant role in the Gospel story is part of the denigration of the early leaders who had been in close contact with Jesus and regarded with great suspicion and dismay the Christological theories of the upstart Paul, flaunting his brand new visions in interpretation of the Jesus whom he had never met in the flesh. <br>
<br>
Who, then, was Paul? Here we would seem to have a good deal of information; but on closer examination, it will turn out to be full of problems. We have the information given by Paul about himself in his letters, which are far from impersonal and often take an autobiographical turn. Also we have the information given in Acts, in which Paul plays the chief role. But the information given by any person about himself always has to be treated with a certain reserve, since everyone has strong motives for putting himself in the best possible light. And the information given about Paul in Acts also requires close scrutiny, since this work was written by someone committed to the Pauline cause. Have we any other sources for Paul's biography? As a matter of fact, we have, though they are scattered in various unexpected places, which it will be our task to explore: in a fortuitously preserved extract from the otherwise lost writings of the Ebionites, a sect of great importance for our quest; in a disguised attack on Paul included in a text of orthodox Christian authority; and in an Arabic manuscript, in which a text of the early Jewish Christians, the opponents of Paul, has been preserved by an unlikely chain of circumstances. <br>

The construction work was already well advanced in various oral traditions before anything was written down. From these traditions and a few rudimentary compilations of sayings and acts of Jesus, the Evangelists culled what suited their purposes and tricked out the material with their own embellishments and innovations. They might import an incident from the life of some mythic or real hero, put into Jesus' mouth some doctrine espoused by their own sect, or impute to Jesus a background, character, and deeds consistent with Old Testament predictions (or what they thought were such) about the Messiah. The Evangelists were not averse to imaginative glosses on Old Testament passages. Matthew, for example, transformed a &quot;young woman&quot; who would bear a child (Isaiah 7:14) into a virgin who would bear Jesus and converted a prophecy about Israel (Hosea 11:1) into a prophecy about Jesus. In light of the dense encrustation of artifice and myth surrounding Jesus, the eminent theologian Rudolph Bultmann groused in 1926: &quot;We can now know almost nothing concerning the life and personality of Jesus.&quot; The minimalist Jesus served up by contemporary scholarship validates Bultmann's skepticism. <br>
<br>
The line between a minimalist Jesus and no Jesus is razor thin. For a century and a half, some scholars have taken the final step. Those who have denied existence to an historical Jesus include Bruno Bauer, Robert Taylor, Joseph Wheless, John Robertson, Arthur Drews, Peter Jensen, Gordon Rylands, P. L. Couchoud, Guy Fau, and George A. Wells. Viewing the biblical Jesus as a pastiche woven from stories of various pagan gods, demigods, and heroes adapted to a first-century Jewish milieu, many scholars have noted striking similarities between Jesus and his pagan counterparts. For example, the Persian sun-god Mithra, widely worshipped in the Roman Empire before the inception of the Christian era, had 12 disciples, performed miracles, was buried in a tomb, rose on the third day, was called the Good Shepherd, identified with the lamb, considered &quot;the Way, the Truth and the Light, the Redeemer, the Savior, the Messiah;&quot; his principal festival was held on what was to become Easter, and he instituted a Eucharist or Lord's Supper. When Constantine made Christianity the official religion of the Empire in 313 C.E. (Common Era), he was influenced by the pell-mell conversion of Roman soldiers from Mithraism to Christianity. The biblical Jesus gave them a sort of home-grown Mithra. <br>
<br>
In Palestine, in the first-century C.E., Messiahs were a dime a dozen. By the time the Evangelists took up their quills, vague reports about sundry Messiahs had been conflated as episodes in the life of a crucified savior called Jesus, then a common name. In the early phases of the developing myth, details about his life and death were hazy. Later, the Evangelists would naturally suppose he was crucified when Pontius Pilate was the prefect of Judea (26 C.E. - 36 C.E.) since Pilate was infamous for his ruthless rule of Judea. The Evangelists amplified the sketchy reports they had heard by attributing to Jesus maxims, doctrines, actions, and a history befitting a Jewish Messiah. The sentiments attributed to Christ are in the Old Testament. They were familiar in the Jewish schools and to all the Pharisees, long before the time of Christ, as they were familiar in all the civilizations of the earth--Egyptian, Babylonian, and Persian, Greek, and Hindu. The famous Golden Rule, which many associate with Jesus, was advocated by Confucius 500 years earlier and then later, long before the Gospels were concocted, by Hillel, a Pharisee (a member of an ancient Jewish sect). Hillel wrote: &quot;What thou dost not like, do thou not to thy neighbor. That is the whole; all the rest is explanation.&quot; One of Jesus' signature commandments--&quot;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&quot;--is cribbed verbatim from Leviticus 19:18 in the Old Testament. <br>

Forgery maybe?</span><hr size=1> okay, now on to the gospels and their authorship.  From church historians of the times, the number and nature of the works changes as they earned validity.  Paul with his epistles makes no mention of the events in the gospels so we can see he knew nothing of their content.  He being the earliest writer (possibly as early as 30 CE) this would seem a powerful indictment of the gospels as written by eye-witness contemporaries fo JC.   <br>
<br>
The oldest of the works was Mark's written in between 70 and 90 CE.  Other contemporary authors who wrote at the time made mention of the works and his was cited first, though not always by name. Mark omits almost the entire traditional biography of Jesus, beginning the story with John the Baptist giving Jesus a bath, and ending - in the oldest manuscripts - with women running frightened from the empty tomb. (The alleged postresurrection appearances reported in the last twelve verses of Mark are not found in the earliest manuscripts, even though they are still printed in most modern bibles as though they were an &quot;authentic&quot; part of Mark's gospel.)  Papias ca. 140 CE knows all the gospels but has only heard of Matthew and Mark, Justin Martyr (ca. 150 CE) knows of none of the four supposed authors. It is only in 180 CE, with Irenæus of Lyons, that we learn who wrote the four &quot;canonical&quot; gospels and discover that there are exactly four of them because there are four quarters of the earth and four universal winds. Thus, unless one supposes the argument of Irenæus to be other than ridiculous, we come to the conclusion that the gospels are of unknown origin and authorship, and there is no good reason to suppose they are eye-witness accounts of a man named Jesus of Nazareth or even penned by a single author each.<br>
<br>
To say that Mark's historical account is &quot;skimpy&quot; is to understate the case. There really isn't much to the gospel of Mark, the birth legends, genealogies, and childhood wonders all being absent. Whereas the gospel of Luke takes up 43 pages in the New English Bible, the gospel of Mark occupies only 25 pages - a mere 58% as much material! Stories do indeed grow with the retelling. <br>
<br>
Mathew and Luke plagerize almost word for word 90% of their text from Mark.  So easy to make the cut as a gospel when you copy the known good version.  They then add some sayings and fabricate some historical details. Ignoring the fact that Matthew and Luke contradict each other in such critical details as the genealogy of JC - and thus cannot both be correct.  They also are the first to trump up a childhood JC.  Now parts of the geneology are so flawed as to be contradictory.  I will have to dog for the specifics, but one of the names occuring in both is of a tribe god eradiucated and swore would never see favour again (producing the messiah isn't favor?) and they end in John WHO WASN'T JC's DAD!<br>
<br>
Last to write is John, and as was seen in the spoinning of the tale, the older it got, the crazier.  John's version has the most embellisment and superstition crammed into it of the 4.  John's work was compiled between 110 and 120 CE, so not possibly ever written by a witness of JC on this earth.  There is substantial evidence suggesting that John was a spin off of an older &quot;Signs Gospel&quot; and contains all the miracles as a result of that influence.  <br>
<br>
Tacitus is alleged in 120 CE to have written a passage in his Annals (Bk 15, Ch 44, containing the wild tale of Nero's persecution of Christians) saying &quot;Therefore, to scotch the rumour, Nero substituted as culprits, and punished with the utmost refinements of cruelty, a class of men, loathed for their vices, whom the crowd styled Christians. Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilatus...&quot; G.A. Wells [p. 16] says of this passage: <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>[Tacitus wrote] at a time when Christians themselves had come to believe that Jesus had suffered under Pilate. There are three reasons for holding that Tacitus is here simply repeating what Christians had told him. First, he gives Pilate a title, procurator [without saying procurator of what! FRZ], which was current only from the second half of the first century. Had he consulted archives which recorded earlier events, he would surely have found Pilate there designated by his correct title, prefect. Second, Tacitus does not name the executed man Jesus, but uses the title Christ (Messiah) as if it were a proper name. But he could hardly have found in archives a statement such as &quot;the Messiah was executed this morning.&quot; Third, hostile to Christianity as he was, he was surely glad to accept from Christians their own view that Christianity was of recent origin, since the Roman authorities were prepared to tolerate only ancient cults. (The Historical Evidence for Jesus; p.16).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There are further problems with the Tacitus story. Tacitus himself never again alludes to the Neronian persecution of Christians in any of his voluminous writings, and no other Pagan authors know anything of the outrage either. Most significant, however, is that ancient Christian apologists made no use of the story in their propaganda - an unthinkable omission by motivated partisans who were well-read in the works of Tacitus. Clement of Alexandria, who made a profession of collecting just such types of quotations, is ignorant of any Neronian persecution, and even Tertullian, who quotes a great deal from Tacitus, knows nothing of the story. According to Robert Taylor, the author of another freethought classic, the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Diegesis</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (1834), the passage was not known before the fifteenth century, when Tacitus was first published at Venice by Johannes de Spire. Taylor believed de Spire himself to have been the forger.  <p><br>

<br>
I just read &quot;The Mythmaker&quot; a few weeks ago on the recommendation of a fellow Christian friend of mine.  I'd be interested in hearing reactions from other Christians who have read this book, especially somebody like Candy who is active in apologetics.  The gist of the author's argument (to me) was that Jesus never intended to claim divinity or to start a new religion, he was crucified for political and not religious reasons; and that Paul largely created what we know as Christianity and invented much of the doctrine after Jesus' death.  Of course, there's a lot more to it than that--it's a very interesting book.  I'd love to hear the &quot;other side&quot;--the rebuttal, so to speak, from scholars and theologians who dispute his arguments and conclusions.  Anybody know where I might find something like this?<br>

Before I started typing out my reply, I went digging on-line hoping to find the information that I had here on my bookshelf so I wouldn’t have to type it all out!  I found this debate transcript involving probably one of my favorite apologists.  It includes quite a bit of the info that I had here to post as well as what I would assume to be your rebuttal to my reply…let me know what you think.<br>

But, regarding your article on Paul, I have just a few things I wanted to pull out and comment on…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For example, the Persian sun-god Mithra, widely worshipped in the Roman Empire before the inception of the Christian era, had 12 disciples, performed miracles, was buried in a tomb, rose on the third day, was called the Good Shepherd, identified with the lamb, considered &quot;the Way, the Truth and the Light, the Redeemer, the Savior, the Messiah;&quot; his principal festival was held on what was to become Easter, and he instituted a Eucharist or Lord's Supper.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Regarding Mithraism, an honest reading of the NT info shows that Paul did not teach a new religion or draw on existing mythology.  A careful study of the Epistles and Gospels reveals that the source of Paul’s teachings on salvation was the OT and the teachings of Jesus.<br>
<br>
&quot;Allegations of an early Christian dependence on Mithraism have been rejected on many grounds. Mithraism had no concept of the death and resurrection of its god and no place for any concept of rebirth - at least during its early stages.... During the early stages of the cult, the notion of rebirth would have been foreign to its basic outlook.... Moreover, Mithraism was basically a military cult. Therefore, one must be skeptical about suggestions that it appealed to nonmilitary people like the early Christians.&quot; (Ronald Nash – Christianity and the Hellenistic World)<br>
<br>
Mithraism flowerd after Christianity, not before, so Christianity could not have copied from Mithraism.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The famous Golden Rule, which many associate with Jesus, was advocated by Confucius 500 years earlier and then later, long before the Gospels were concocted, by Hillel, a Pharisee (a member of an ancient Jewish sect). Hillel wrote: &quot;What thou dost not like, do thou not to thy neighbor. That is the whole; all the rest is explanation.&quot; One of Jesus' signature commandments--&quot;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&quot;--is cribbed verbatim from Leviticus 19:18 in the Old Testament.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Originality may or may not be a merit.  If the truth has already been uttered, the merit lies in repeating it, and giving it new and fuller appreciation.  The Golden Rule of the NT is a summing up of what everyone has always known to be right.  Great moral teachers never do introduce new moralities.  Their real job is to keep bringing us back, time and time again, to the old simple principles.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Paul with his epistles makes no mention of the events in the gospels so we can see he knew nothing of their content. He being the earliest writer (possibly as early as 30 CE) this would seem a powerful indictment of the gospels as written by eye-witness contemporaries fo JC.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
(Doesn’t he speak of the crucifixion? - 1 Cor. 15, I believe)<br>
<br>
Also, in Galatians, one can read that Paul’s message of the gospel was both checked and approved by the original apostles, demonstrating official recognition that his message was not opposed to that of Jesus.  The charge that Paul corrupted Jesus’ original message was long ago answered in The Origin of Paul’s Religion.<br>

<br>
Most if not all of the dating mentioned in your article differs considerably from the reference works that I’ve looked at, as you can see from the debate link above…but most liberal critics would like to place as much time as possible between when the events occurred and when they were written of.  <br>
<br>
Mr. Till (again, above link) dismisses the numerous copies of the manuscripts of the NT that we have as not being sufficient evidence…yet no one questions the other ancient historical copies of ancient literature.  It is only because we are dealing with the Bible.  <br>
<br>
I'm wanting to liken some of this to my great-grandmother’s bible that I have.  I can’t even tell you how old it is.  But it’s missing all of Genesis, half of Exodus, and half of Revelation (as well as the title page, record pages, etc…)  I’m seeing this as being the same thing.  Not a complete copy, yet I don’t doubt that it is an accurate copy.  The rest of it’s content has shown to be accurate and reliable as being a KJV bible, so why can’t I trust that it really is a KJV bible…but I feel as if I may be getting sidetracked…these subjects tie in together so easily….<br>
<br>
Help me to understand where you feel I err! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
