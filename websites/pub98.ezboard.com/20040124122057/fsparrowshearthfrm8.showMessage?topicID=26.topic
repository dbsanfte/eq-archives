There is an area on my way to school that the police love to set up speed traps.  And it's not just a sit in your car and run radar.  Many times I've driven by to see about half a dozen of them standing by the road and one of them is holding a radar gun and zapping people.  I think it's a miracle they haven't stopped me because I have a tendancy to speed through there because I'm usually running late.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I was heading through that section today when I saw a police car pull onto the road behind me.  Well obviously seeing him I'm going to do the speed limit given the fact he's behind me and also that they love to catch speeders in that area.  I did exactly the speed limit.  And finally move over to the right lane when I get a chance.  And what does he do?  Speeds past me.  He had to of been doing 5 to 10 miles over the speed limit.  And his lights were not on, he was not rushing to a scene.  Because at the traffic light I pulled up next to him.<br>
<br>
I'm like - dude!  You guys are constantly ticketing speeders through here and here you are, not rushing to a call and you're speeding!!!  Nice to see they set examples for the rest of us. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Somehow I doubt they'd listen to me if I tried to use that as an excuse if I ever do get pulled over. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> 1 <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

<br>
I remember the scene in &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; when they pretended there were bees in their car and the cops just decided to leave.  Nice work of fiction. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I got pulled over once by a state trooper who thought I was drunk.  I wasn't drunk, but he was making me nervous because he got right on my tail.  I don't like it when cars get right on my tail.  He asked me if I'd had anything to drink that night and I was on my way home from work and so I thought about the last thing I had drunk which was on my break at work and I told him, &quot;A Capri Sun.&quot;  He stared at me blankly then clarified himself, &quot;Anything alcoholic?&quot;  &quot;No sir,&quot; I politely replied.  He made me take off my glasses, but fortunately didn't make me get out of my car. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I remember the first time I got pulled over by a state trooper, it was for speeding.  I think I was doing about 10-15 miles over the speed limit.  The bad thing about when I get new tires, I can go faster without realizing it.  He freaked me out because I saw him speeding up on me really fast and he didn't have a traditional car, it was a car designed to try and blend in.  I looked at my speedometer to realize how fast I was going and to see him coming up on me that fast, he had to of been driving like 100 mph.  I can't tell you how relieved I felt to see his lights go on and to realize it was a cop behind me and not some psycho. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I pulled over immediately and he came up to me and asked me if I knew why he'd pulled me over.  I've always been taught to be honest and so I said to him rather meekly, &quot;For speeding.&quot;  The officer literally startled, I could see his body literally jump slightly.  And he kinda stuttered saying, &quot;Th.. that's right.&quot;  He seemed so shocked that I would reply to him honestly.  I still don't understand that.  I assumed that if a police officer asked you a question that you give a truthful answer.  If I said, &quot;I don't know&quot; I'd be lying, becuase I knew I was speeding.  I guess that impressed him because he let me go with just a warning.<br>
<br>
Did I forget to mention the guy was extremely good looking?  Too bad we couldn't have met under better circumstances. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

<br>
Driving home from work, I had a guy right on my tail, and I was already doing almost 15 km/h (almost 10 mi/h) over the limit.  When I got a chance to move aside, he flew by me and I noticed that he was wearing the uniform of our city police.  He was also driving a Honda Accord, which I know for a fact is NOT a type of unmarked car used in our city (all of our police vehicles have to come from FORD).<br>
<br>
I will grant that cops are better drivers than most people on the road, as they have the advanced training, but it is still annoying to know that they can speed or do whatever they want without fear of getting a ticket.<br>
<br>
One of my in-laws is a Provincial Police Officer and has said that even when they pull over a cop from another force or durisdiction, the moment they show their ID, they're let go.  &quot;Professional Courtesy&quot;.<br>
