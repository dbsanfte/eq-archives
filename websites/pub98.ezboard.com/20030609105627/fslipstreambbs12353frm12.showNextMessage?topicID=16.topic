She rose, instantly alert, as was her habit.  She had always preferred the night.  Even before she turned, she had found the sunlight too harsh for her eyes and skin.  Moonworshipper, her friends had called her.  Friends,  how ironic that she still thought of them as friends.  Perhaps because they were the last beings she had ever trusted or was it because they were the last beings who had ever trusted her.  As she combed the rats from her reddish brown hair, she pondered her solitary existence.  A few hundred years of alienation produced strange contradictions.  She would need to feed soon; she'd always enjoyed eating at the top of the food chain.  She'd hunt a male tonight.  The young, strong, ethically challenged made easy prey.  With their gender bias and hormones working against them, she knew she would eat well and incur little risk.  She felt no pangs of remorse over her decision.  She would improve the human herd by culling.  Yet she would consume only what she needed.  She still hated waste.  But now it was time for the hunt.  She must select her prey and cut him from the herd.  To do that she must venture where humans gathered.  Dressed to kill, she slipped from her lair and into the night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=galadrial@slipstreambbs12353>Galadrial</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magog</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(1/22/03 11:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightfall</span><hr size=1> Victoria rose shortly after sunset and took her customary stroll around her estate before leaving to hunt. Dressed to kill, literally, she stepped outside. At over 100 years old, Victoria was a very skilled and determined vampire. She was pragmatic, and not above a little bloodshed to get what she desired, or even a lot of bloodshed. But tonight she was simply out hunting. Spotting a solitary man walking acrossed the way she smiled evilly to herself before approaching him. <p>&quot;The hardest part of being in this world is living in it. Be brave.

He had managed to bury the remains of his victim but he wasn't sure if anyone would come to look for it or not. Too much had happened in the last few days and he would use this sleep to plan his next move. He always thought best while sleeping. He kept playing out the events over in his mind to see if he had covered his trail well. <br>
He remembered the details of the crash landing, how he had flashed his ship and made the area look like a meteor strike, how he had run across a couple on a picnic at the edge of the woods and how the male had chased him. He had fed on the male and found that humans were to his liking. Their life energy levels were off the charts and it would be weeks before he would have to feed again.<br>

Though she had fed only just twelve hours ago, gorging herself on the souls of men, it had not saited her and she was beginning to crave more.

It was never enough.<br>

She awoke at last and left her resting place dressing herself in a revealing gown of crimson velvet carefully chosen to compliment the red black hair which fell in a cascade of curls about her shoulders.

He lay still, listening to see if he had been discovered. The mirthful voices of children allowed him a moment to check the perimeter of the small chamber he had bedded down in. Children, he thought, he could handle. <br>
<br>
Then the alarm microchip sounded in his ear. Jumping up, he went to the entrance and peered through the holoshield at a group of three children poking their fingers through the shield and giggling. He could imagine the excitement that they were experiencing, poking their fingers through what seemed like solid rock. They must have known about this cave and had probably  wondered why, what had been a small cave opening was now just a continuation of the solid rock face. Deln quickly secured his gear and prepared to exit the cave. Where there was children, adults wouldn't be far behind. Just as he was about to turn off the shield, one of the kids decided to brave the entrance and enter the cave. She held her breath and stepped through.<br>
<br>
She must have been about 7 Earth years old. She was still holding her breath when she spotted Deln. Deciding that if he was breathing, then she probably could too, she let out her breath and smiled cautiously. <br>
<br>
&quot;Um, Hello&quot;, she said. &quot;Did you do that to the cave?&quot; She pointed back at the entranceway.<br>
&quot;Yes, but I'm about to take it down.&quot; Deln pushed a button on his wrist unit and the holoshield disappeared. The two kids left at the disguised cave opening gasped when the opening appeared and they saw the 2 figures in the tunnel. <br>
<br>
&quot;Are your parents with you?&quot; Deln directed this toward the girl in front of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um&quot;, she looked back over her shoulder to her friends. Gaining confidence she said, &quot;No, but we only live 1/4 mile in that direction. We're staying at my uncle's cabin. We just got here today. &quot;<br>
<br>
Deln smiled. &quot;Well, maybe I should walk you back home.&quot; He was going to have to integrate into society sooner or later and a secluded cabin with a minimum of adults was as good a place to practice as any. Besides, if things went wrong, clean-up would be easy. <p>&quot;One must be careful in hunting the wumpas.&quot;</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jshunter>JSHunter</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/freaks/fhfdd12.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/24/03 8:44:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raeven@slipstreambbs12353>Raeven</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/reggoofy/fhrgmk108.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(1/25/03 5:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/reggoofy/fhrgmk108.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightfall</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>As the sun set over the mountains Angelique took one last look around her room, her prison for so many decades.

Male, meal, she enjoyed the anagramatic irony.  This particular creature had caught her eye by slapping his date outside a local bar.  Apparently he had never read the Kama Sutra and did not know that one's mate should be treated like a most precious treasure.  Well, she would educate him tonight.  And when she had finished the lesson, she would bury his corpse deeply underground.  The worms would truly enjoy that buried treasure.  <br>
<br>
The promise of alcohol and sex was enough to induce amnesia in her victim.  He suddenly forgot all about the crying female huddled at his feet except to kick her once and unkindly remark that he was off to spend his time with a more attractive woman.  <br>
<br>
Earlier Antinomy had chosen a lovely, secluded spot for dinner.  A bottle of white wine sat buried to its neck in the cold waters of the nearby stream.  She preferred white wine with pork.  Fondling him, she led her impatient victim to the water's bank.  She chuckled slightly at his urgency.  As his hands tightened upon her, she nibbled his ear lightly.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Open the wine,&quot; she whispered and wrapped her arms tightly around him from behind as he turned to obey.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Just don't stop biting on my neck,&quot; he groaned as he grasped the bottle and pulled it from the water.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not until I'm done,&quot; she thought as she sank her teeth deeply into the male's throat and began to drain him.  She had come to love the warm, salty flavor of her prey.  But the last few bites were often bitter and tonight was no exeption.  Hence the wine.  After she discarded the remnants of her meal, she uncorked the wine herself and washed the bitter taste from her throat.  When she had finished, she cast the bottle into the stream and watched the water carry it away.<br>

Aria dressed quickly.  Laying there in depression for the whole night wasn't going to get her any where plus Vitale had work for her to do.<br>
<br>
Her master's corperation kept the young woman busy as well as the other flesh stealers.  There weren't that many of them.  Just enough to fill up the higher positions.  Humans and gouls took on the lower white collered work.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aria.&quot;  Vitale ducked his head back into the room.  &quot;I have an errand for you.&quot;  She smiled with a nod.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course,&quot;  Aria slipped on her black heels while hopping to the door.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Go into town and give this to one of our contracters.&quot;  He passed to her a white envelope.  &quot;And while you are there, please feed.&quot;  He lifted her dark hair away from her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see your skin is begining to cave in near your cheek bones.&quot;  Aria tilted her head.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you know that beauty is only skin deep.&quot;  He flicked her hair back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Only the ugly people say that.&quot;  He smirked before heading off.<br>

He decided that the 2 girls were older than the boy by an Earth year or two.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you live in the cave now?&quot;<br>
&quot;Where do you come from?&quot;<br>
&quot;Why are you dressed funny?&quot;<br>
&quot;Are you a homeless person?&quot;<br>
&quot;Do you have a girlfriend?&quot;<br>
&quot;Do you have any Pets? You should have a dog.&quot;<br>
&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deln tried to keep track of who was asking each question, while at the same time trying to think up answers. He scowled. If this was what the children were like, what would the adults be like? He quickly formulated his answers. Since the data on this planet was out of date, he had to be careful. He had watched Earth television during the week trip that he traveled this solar system, which had allowed him to update a lot of Earth's data including the language dialects and societal customs, but much of it was contradictory. Was it even normal for adults to answer children's questions at this location?<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't live in the cave, I just spent the night there.&quot; Best to stick to the truth when possible. <br>
He turned to the other girl.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Where do you think I come from?&quot; His training said, whenever possible, to let the enemy supply him with answers rather than guess something suspicious. <br>
<br>
The girl blushed, &quot;Um, You look like you're from New York&quot;.<br>
&quot;And why do you say that?&quot;, Deln smiled at her encouragingly.<br>
&quot;Because you have funny clothes and you have long dark hair.&quot;<br>
&quot;And you have a lot of those things.&quot;, added the first girl, pointing to his wrist and belt gear. &quot;People from New York always have cool stuff.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, you're right. I'm from N.Y. and I help invent stuff like this. That's my job and I just came out here to test it.&quot; That sounded plausible.<br>
<br>
They seemed pleased with the answers so he continued. &quot;I don't have a girlfriend and I don't have a dog.&quot; Again, sticking with the truth. He had never had a dog and breaking up with his girlfriend had landed him on this planet.<br>
<br>
The boy looked upset. &quot;You should get a dog.&quot;<br>
Did all adult males have dogs here?<br>
&quot;Well, I want to get one, but I live in an apartment.&quot; Hadn't someone said something like that on one of those programs?<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh&quot;, all three children said at once. It must have been an acceptable excuse. <br>
They quickly came to an opening in the trees where two adults were clearing off the debris of old leaves from the porch of a small three room cabin, while another adult was busy fixing the shingles on the roof.<br>
<br>
I must have been very tired to have missed this so close to the cave, Deln thought. He wished he hadn't lost his short range scanner in the crash. Things were about to get a lot trickier.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mom, look what we found.&quot; <p>&quot;One must be careful in hunting the wumpas.&quot;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=galadrial@slipstreambbs12353>Galadrial</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Human</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(1/26/03 10:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightfall</span><hr size=1> Victoria continued on her walk partially saited.
