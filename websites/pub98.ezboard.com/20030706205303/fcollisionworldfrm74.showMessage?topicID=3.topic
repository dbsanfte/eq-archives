Laurena laid serenly on a rock that just surfaced above the tide, her white wings wavering gently in the breeze as she revled in the feel of the ocean water spraying her creme skin.<br>
<br>
She wore a top and skirt derived from a torn sail, which was soaked from a day of swimming.  Her brown hair was wild and curled, untamed by the wind and seawater.  <br>
<br>
She sighed, watching the sun set...alone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Love, where are you waiting?<br>
I saw you in a reflection in the stream.<br>
But you swept yourself away before I could fall into you; <br>
And all I felt was cold waters of despair<br>
And the crescent moon's cruel gleam</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She tried to sing happily, but no matter how she tried, her voice carried along the breeze mournfully and in despair.  Large, almond shaped eyes stared despondently out onto the darkened sea.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Love, I need to find you<br>

It seems I will always be searching for you night and day<br>

<br>
Silent tears slipped down Laurena's face as she watched the sun sink into the sea.  The darkness was cold, and the water brought no comfort.  Shaking her wings of seaspray, she folded them over herself and prepared for sleep, shielding her body from eyes that weren't there.  <br>

where in the world was Leon? he should've been there by now. Leon was never late unless he got tied up with a girl or two. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, he heard beautiful singing. It was lovely and sweet... weaving a sort of enchantment throughout the air. Aeli closed his eyes for a moment, just listening to it. It was very soothing. He opened his eyes and looked to the direction where it was coming from. A beautiful young woman, folding her wings.

She sighed, stifling a quiet sob.  Why did she feel so sad...?  She had been happy for a while.  She liked the silence, the solitude...but...<br>
<br>
She was alone.  Utterly alone.  No one knew, no one cared that she was here.  Not that she wanted anyone to care...but then again, she did.  And no one cared.  <br>
<br>
She shivered again.  It was too cold to sleep here so close to the water.  It would be a cold night, and she smelled rain in the air.  She would sleep in the sand again...she would not go up into the jungle, with the dangers of jaguars...<br>
<br>
She stood up, stretching her wings and wiping her tears from her face.  With one last look at the fading sun, she turned and started to walk back across the large rock.<br>
<br>
She froze.  There was a man standing there, watching her.  He had blue hair and the most intense silver eyes Laurena had ever seen.  those eyes pinned her to the spot for a moment, and then she remembered her danger.  She chirped in fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah!&quot;  She backed away, and stumbled backward onto the rock. Her hand plunged into the water and pulled out a sharp looking rock.  She held it up in defense as she pulled herself to her feet, and hovered half a foot above the ground, her amethyst eyes filled with fear and her broad angelic wings flapping frantically against the breeze.<br>
<br>

It's just that I don't see that many people...here...in Lapis.  I'm sorry,&quot; she apologized again, her cheeks flushing rose pink when she realized she was rambling nervously.  She backed up a little more, afraid the young man would be angry.  Her feet never touched the ground.  &quot;I didn't mean to scare you...my singing...?

<br>
One part of her willed her to stay.  Another begged her to keep the man at bay, and keep him there as long as possible jsut for the sake of conversation with another being...and another screamed at her to take flight, and run away...<br>

<br>
&quot;I'm not lost.&quot; he slightly shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;And with dangers everywhere, it's expected for someone to be cautious.&quot; He looked away, gazing at the ocean and watching the waves roll slowly in. <br>
<br>
It was hard for him to look people in the eye when talking. He didn't quite know why, it was just something that was hard for him. <br>

He was an elf! A half elf, but...she could trust elves.  she became aware of her own pointed ears, hidden in her tangled brown hair.<br>
<br>
Slowly she descended, touching the sand with her bare feet.  she slowly approached him, afraid to make eye contact, so she continued to watch the waves.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is beautiful, is it not?&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;It's very peaceful.  That's why I came here...It's quiet.&quot;  She closed her eyes gravely. &quot;And yes...I know the dangers.

He wondered, what kind of creature was she? Her wings weren't quite like liroun wings, even though they closly resembled eachother. And they weren't angel wings, even though it would be easy to believe that such a sweet fair girl could be an angel. <br>
<br>
Aeli sat down on a large rock.<br>
&quot;I hope you don't mind me here. I'm waiting for a friend.&quot; His eyes closed.<br>
<br>
He knew what Leon wanted to see him for. It was another mission. Dragon slaying and monster hunting. He  didn't like it, but he'd do it for his friend. <br>
A deep sigh came from his chest as he looked back out at the ocean. It was like the beach he had woken on. He ran his hand through his hair.<br>
What would make his memory come back? Did he even want his memory back?  <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

<br>
&quot;Of course I don't mind,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;You may stay as long as you like.  I am not the mistress of this beach.  This beach...it has no mistress.&quot;  She smiled softly, sitting down by him, but not too close, still warned by years of instinctive fear.  &quot;It is too close to the sea...which is its own mistress in itself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her peaceful eyes looked out upon the sea.  After a moment of silence, a seagull flew over them, coasting on the wind.  It cried out once, then twice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eeeeah! Eeeah!&quot; she cried back, chirping in the bird's language.  At her repsonse, the gull flapped away, into the jungle.<br>
<br>
She looked at the stranger on the rock next to her.  &quot;I hope your friend does not encounter trouble,&quot; she said, concern delving deeply in her amethyst eyes.  &quot;There is a storm coming, a strong one.&quot;<br>

Leon blinked as he looked at Aeli. Usually Aeli would say nothing when around others. He barely said anything around Leon...  <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

She smiled at Leon politely.  &quot;How do you do, Sir Leon?  It is a pleasure to meet you. I have already met Sir Aeli.&quot;  <br>
<br>
She bowed, her wings fluttering over her bent back.  &quot;I'm sorry...to have been so rude.  I do not see many people in these days.&quot;<br>
<br>
By now the sun had long since set, and the sky was illuminated by the three moons, Una the Blue, Oni the Red, and Lunai the Silver.  The triple moonlight bathed them all in soothing light as she spoke.  Her voice was musical though she did not sing, and had the tune of a startled bird.<br>
<br>
&quot;So please forgive me.  Need you somewhere to stay? It is to squall terribly tonight, so you may want to find refuge in the jungle.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 423<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/13/03 12:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm... storm?</span><hr size=1> &quot;A storm? Yeah, i thought so. I don't think we'll be getting any refuge anytime soon though. Pretty far away from the cities and such. Are you going to stay here during the storm? You could come with us to a nearby friends house. Right Aeli?&quot; He looked over at Aeli.<br>
Aeli was staring out at the sea, watching the black storm clouds slowly cover the stars.<br>
<br>
Such a shame that a storm would come on such a serene and clear night, Aeli thought. The breeze picked up a little, blowing his hair about. <br>
Leon put held his hat with his hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli? You there?&quot; He waved the other hand in front of Aeli.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry Leon. She can come stay at my house with us if she wants.&quot; He looked back over to Leon and Laurena. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

But we should make haste.&quot;<br>
<br>
She would have refused, if not for Aeli's invitation.  sh ecould not seem to part with his eyes, so intense and calm at once.

<br>
He looked back at the sea and noticed the sky was half black. Stars studded the other half, still twinkling in all thier brilliance.<br>
The waves were becoming more violent by the moment and the wind  had picked up even more. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well come on Aeli, we gotta get somewhere fast and finish our talk.&quot; Leon looked towards the horizon.<br>
<br>
Aeli got up and nodded, looking at Leon then Laurena. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

The clouds were black.  The sea became violent, the wind ripping at her body and tassling her wild hair.  She shuddered.  The dark storm clouds reminded her too deeply of something else.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 432<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/13/03 4:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: haha...^^</span><hr size=1> &quot;alright then... onward!&quot; Leon said as he took off down the beach, his coat whipping in the wind behind him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're alright with this?&quot; Aeli looked Laurena's way, his blue hair blowing in his face.<br>
<br>
He felt a drop of rain on his face... then another. He quite liked rain, it was so refreshing. <br>
a crack of lighting ripped through the sky in the distance and a faint rumble of thunder followed.<br>

She looked up intot he stormy sky, also taking pleasure in the rain.  Sun, rain, snow, it did not matter...all was life.<br>
<br>
But then hail began to fall, in great icy clumps, among the refreshing rain as the clouds banished the moons into darkness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come, let's hurry, or we'll lose your friend!&quot; she said, smiling comfortingly.  She rose her wings, and shielded him from the hail with her right one.
