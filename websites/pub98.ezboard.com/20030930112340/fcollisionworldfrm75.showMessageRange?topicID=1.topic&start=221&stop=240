She still had no idea where she was running to, but soon enough she would find it would not matter.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Kai-Ta materialized in front of her, and the next thing she knew she was being thrown into the cave wall.  Pain struck her but she did not cry out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello again, little Luna,&quot; Kai-Ta bit mockingly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello yourself,&quot; Athena breathed quietly.  There was no need to bring anyone else in the caves into this.  They had their own problems...and she was to die anyway.<br>
<br>
Kai-Ta laughed.  &quot;So mature for such a little thing.  Why did The Mistress put up with you for so long, brat?&quot;  She held out her hand, and Athena felt the woman's power gripping about her pale throat, tightly.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Because...&quot; Athena choked, and went silent as the pressure proved too much to speak.  She stared at Kai-Ta, her eyes glowing dully in the darkness, and dimming as the life was drained from her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, what was that?&quot; the captain quipped, willing the invisible fist to grip harder.  &quot;What did she see in you?  The most powerful beings in the world have fallen before her at her mere glance, terrified by her power, and yet you, a puny little wretch, have been able to stand beside her without harm.  How and why?  What did she see in you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Athena closed her eyes to Kai-Ta's words.  But she still heard them.  Quietly gasping for breath, Athena opened her eyes and stared at her.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Because she found me useful,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Athena thought spoke, booming in the captain's mind like thunder and making her twitch slightly in discomfort.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Because I hold within me a fragment of Maiem's soul, the first creature born on Mahtim after the Gods.  She found me useful.  But now she needs me no more and she comes to claim my life.  You are of great use to her now.  But when I am gone, and your purpose is fulfilled, she will discard <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>you</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> too.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Kai-Ta listened with her wide eye, the mental hold on Athena's throat loosening in shock for a moment.  And then she snarled.  &quot;You lie,&quot; she hissed.  &quot;Little wretch.  The Mistress has sent me because you are no longer in her circle of trust.  You've become all goody goody, haven't you? That is why.  The Mistress must keep a company of pure evil to survive.  Traitors like you will bring her downfall.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You lie to yourself,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Athena claimed quietly.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Mistress has no company.  Her hatred and love for immortality keeps her alive.  Nothing can bring her downfall save the power of the Paladin.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Kyonae Falcona,&quot; Kai-Ta murmured.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She is using you as she has used me,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Athena continued.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And when she has had her fill she will destroy you.  She cares for nothing except veangeance.  The Mistress aims to bring about the Final Cataclysm and send everything back into the Eternal Null, and you know it.  The only world where she and no one else can exist. So kill me now, and spare me the sight of Mahtim's destruction! </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kai-Ta hissed.  &quot;I'll kill you,&quot; she spoke aloud, as if assuring herself.  &quot;I'll kill you, little wretch of a girl, and in your death the time loop will be severed.  Your older self shall die immediately and be cast into the Shadowrealm, and your soul shall obliterated for violating the laws of Time! And then, The Mistress Evil shall reign all that is rightfully hers!!!  And I, Kai-Ta shall be Queen of the World!&quot;<br>
<br>
Athena saw stars.  A ringing pain filled her head and made her nose and ears bleed, and then, blood trickling from dark lips.  Kai-Ta had knelt down in front of her, her actual hand wrapped around her throat now and digging into her pale skin.  Her other hand went to the eye patch and flipped it up, revealing an eye that had no pupil or iris.  It was pure white, and it glowed, a burning light upon her blue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time to die, Luna,&quot; she spat.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=digitalv7>DigitalV7</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.silentangel.net/images/Majic%20Jin%20picture%20iconv2%20trans.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 275<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/25/03 3:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=222>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Coming For Athena</span><hr size=1> Iku looked at the little girl and then at the people around her. &quot;Stop right there!&quot; She was always one to act before thinking. <br>

&quot;No.&quot; Iku said simply. &quot;But that's never stopped us before.&quot; <br>

<br>
&quot;Run!&quot; Athena gasped, trying to put feeling back in her half-strnagled throat.  &quot;Warn your other friends...warn Amanda...run! She'll kill you too!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up, brat!&quot;  Kai-Ta turned around and swiped her hand at her.  She never even touched her, but Athena was tossed to the ground and tumbled to a stop on her back, nail-marks ripping through the cloth on her shoulder and drawing blood.<br>
<br>
She turned her attention back to Iku, Emiko and Giichi.  &quot;Back off and mind your own business, weaklings.

It wasn't the words. It was the person that said it, that had stopped the voices. He stood up slowly. He had heard that voice before, and it had been closer. She had heard it through the walls and through the air around him, he just had never noticed it before. She was the reason that his voices had been blocked in the first place.

&quot;Probably that girl we encountered before...when we were spying...which I don't approve of mind you.&quot;<br>
&quot;Shut up Joruri.&quot; Emiko spat, and then she looked at the woman. &quot;I'm not here to help some little kid. Like Iku is,&quot; She paused, &quot;However I haven't gotten to beat anyone up in a long time! So you see! This is perfect timing! I've got a lot of stress to get rid of!&quot;<br>
Iku rolled her eyes. &quot;Well while you two hack this out, why don't I take the kid and leave.&quot;<br>
Giichi nodded his head. &quot;Let's leave, let's get outta here.&quot;<br>
Emiko growled. &quot;WHAT kind of KING are you going to be if you back down from a battle?! Jeesh, haven't I taught you anything!&quot;<br>
Hoshiyo watched them and then turned her head to the woman that was attacking Athena. &quot;I have heard that a large organization is collecting members, a group called the dynasty, and I am aware that your master is a part of it. If I were you, I'd back out now.&quot;<br>
Joruri looked at Giichi. &quot;What's she talkin' about?&quot;<br>

Her teeth gritted in desperate anger, her eyes glowed like blue fire.  She rose her hands that were covered in her own blood.  Kai-Ta turned around, but she had never had a chance.<br>
<br>
A streaking plume of electric blue light filled the cave, and threw Kai-Ta back into the wall, destroying the Mystic's concentration and knocking her out for the moment.<br>
<br>
She looked at the trio and flinched away, unable to trust anyone at the moment.  And then she sensed behind her a figure holding two balls of light.<br>
<br>
She spun around and was instantly shrouded in a shield of protection.  It was the one named Caleb!  She glared at him silently, saying nothing.  What a wretched sight the eight year old was.  She bled from wounds on her shoulder, her hair standing slghtly on end from her power.  Her eyes glowing. She was ready to attack him.  <br>
<br>
But she decided not to.<br>
<br>
(What are you doing, you fool?!) the nagging demon of a voice taunted in the back of her mind.  (If you let him kill you, you will severe the time loop! Yourself in the future will die! You will cause the destruction of Mahtim, and Evil will win!  What are you doing?)<br>
<br>
(Evil will not win.  It can never win.  It will only turn in on itself, as it has already begun to do.  I have won...Mother will be so ashamed of me...I'm sorry.)<br>
<br>
Slowly, Athena let the shield around her dissipate.  She left herself to the full mercy of Caleb.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would rather die at your hands than the hands of Evil's hitwoman.  Kill me now...and spare me the end.&quot;<br>
<br>
Athena closed her eyes and waited for the end...<br>
<br>
&quot;No!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
A shadow burst from the darkness, clad in a blue cloak.  The feminine figure snatched Athena up in her grasp and held her close. The child looked up as the stranger angrily pulled back her hood and revealed a black haired, blue eyed woman,  though she looked nothing like Athena.  She looked young, and innocent, but wise. A silver crown tilted sideways on her head.  She glared at Caleb angrily.<br>
<br>
&quot;This child is NOT a demon!&quot;  Queen Raina of Dratilia cried, holding Athena near.<br>
<br>

&quot;No, no you won't. Not if I can help it.&quot; He said softly. &quot;You, cleared the voices. I can't let you die, not someone so young.&quot; He said easily. And looked to the other three. &quot;Which side are you on huh?&quot;<br>

<br>
Athena and the Queen were pushed behind Caleb, who fought against Zeroz bravely. Athena was astounded by his courage against one so much stronger than he. The arms around her tighened as the battle proceeded.<br>
<br>
&quot;It will be alright, dear,&quot; Raina soothed. &quot;Everything will be just fine...oh thank the Goddesses, all of them, that he wasn't speaking of you...&quot;<br>
<br>
Athena wanted to ask the queen WHAT in the name of the gods she was doing here, and why she had come for her. But she had been struck mute, amazed at the force of sheer good that flowed from Caleb's being.  She sensed these things so deftly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hand her over, wretched beggar queen!&quot; Kai-Ta shrieked, enraged that she had allowed herself to be distracted and furious that Zeroz was taking her spotlight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Never to you, Kai-Ta!&quot; Raina spat back.<br>
<br>
Athena watched, and knew what Zeroz was about todo even before his demon eyes swayed toward Emiko.  She struggled, but Raina held her firm, not knowing the reason why she wished to bolt into the battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now burn in void fire,&quot; Zeroz said as he pointed the deadly sword in Emiko's direction.<br>
<br>
&quot;Noo!!&quot; Athena cried, wriggling her arm free of Raina's grasp, and outstretching her palm.  A beam of blue light shot across the battle scene, a protection spell, racing the inferno for Emiko's fate.<br>
******<br>
<br>
&quot;What in the hell is going on over there?&quot; Lani muttered, hearing the noise.<br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno...but we'd better be aware,&quot; Yani warned her, &quot;And stay at our post.  You know what happened last time we disobeyed Kai-Ta...&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Look away, child, look away!&quot; she whispered. &quot;There is nothing we can do now...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly the image of what was to come flashed in her mind.  Caleb, and Zeroz, standing one on one...and a livid Kai-Ta watching them, waiting for her turn to strike...<br>
<br>
&quot;NO!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Athena, be still!&quot;  Raina hushed.  &quot;Stay here!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No! He is facing death!&quot;  She struggled in the queen's arms, but found it useless.  And she had not the heart to use mental force upon the woman.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It is his choice.&quot; She held her closer.  &quot;It has nought to do with you, child...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It has everything to do with me!&quot;  Athena struggled so she faced the royal woman.  &quot;If it weren't for me, none of us would be in danger! Now let me go!&quot;<br>
<br>
She broke away from Raina finally and bolted for the adjoining cavern where Caleb and the demon Zeroz were facing off.  The man looked tired, weary...a resigning look in his eyes that told her he was accepting his end...<br>
<br>
&quot;No! Caleb!&quot;  She ran to his side, much shorter and younger than he, but still a threat. Her eyes were glowing softly with power.  She did not have much, but she would give her last if need be.  &quot;This is my fight!  If you won't save yourself and run, at least let me help you!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Kai-Ta stood to the side, enraged.  The traitorous little brat!  Artema would never let her live now.  Slowly she began to recite something in her mind, the words mere gushes of breath across her barely moving lips.<br>
