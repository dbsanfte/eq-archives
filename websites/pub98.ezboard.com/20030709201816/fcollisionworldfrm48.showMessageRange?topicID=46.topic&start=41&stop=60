&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll go back in...three days. Tell Lucifer that.&quot;<br>

Sakamae stared at him, her hands balling into fists. &quot;Do you know how long I LOOKED for you?!&quot; she yelled. &quot;Lucifer almost killed me AGAIN after I reported I couldnt' find you the first time! If it wasn't for your minions Michiru and Rachiru, I NEVER would've found you!&quot;<br>

Ayashi merely tuned out the two quarreling and looked back at the human group with apologetic eyes. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he said, &quot;they're not on best sides with each other.

<br>
Today was a very hectic...and strange...day. How did it all begin? Oh yes, he was trying to find Aya, and--<br>
<br>
Oh no.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Aya</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. He forgot about Aya!<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear...&quot; he murmured, suddenly seeming quite content one moment and then very...frightened(??) the next. His ice-blue eyes widened at the thought of somethign happening to Aya and then her being hurt... he would be punished severely, even if he wasn't an angel of Heaven anymore...<br>
<br>
Kokoru arched an eyebrow at Ayashi's quickly-changing emotions. &quot;Oi..Ayashi--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;KOKORU! I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET!&quot; screamed Sakamae.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
&quot;Yukari,&quot; he said softly, &quot;how long will you be here...with me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Kokoru was trying to call Rachiru and Michiru back from Hell, to relay a message with Sakamae.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fires of Hell through Earth, send me the minions between your Void,&quot; he hissed, his eyes glowing and calligraphic markings appearing on his forehead.<br>
<br>
Sakamae merely watched, tryign to see if her older brother had actually learned some more spells from last time she saw -- and battled -- him.

<br>
<br>
Fina watched in interest... taking in what was happening. Yes, she's fought demons before, but never any like this. These were true devils. Talon was now perched on her shoulder again. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

Sakamae rolled her eyes. &quot;Because you're not in direct alignment with the nine rays of Hell, idiot. Just a little farther to the left.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kokoru did as told, and Michiru and Rachiru appeared suddenly. Kokoru relaid his message, and Michiru and Rachiru nodded and went off to tell Lucifer.<br>
<br>
Sakamae sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go away,&quot; said Kokoru.<br>

<br>
Ayashi sighed, and looked at them out of the corner of his eye. He was about to say something to Yukari, when his vision seemed to split, like glass cracking, and he gasped. He looked down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yukari...Yukari...&quot; he murmured, but she didn't answer. He looked around...everything was frozen...nothing moved...<br>
<br>
&quot;SAKAMAE!&quot; two voice shouted as one, and the female devil frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's Kokoru's fault,&quot; she said heatedly. &quot;He antagonized me.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;I know that, moron,&quot; snarled Sakamae. &quot;I'll fix it, jeez.&quot; Then she murmured some random incantation, and slowly, the haze of timeless space seemed to disappear, and things began moving again. The deafening silence was replaced with soft noises.<br>
<br>
&quot;You imbecile,&quot; snarled Kokoru.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yarou!&quot; shrieked Sakamae.<br>
<br>
Ayashi stared at the two, dismay in his eyes. If Kokoru hated his sister so much to attack her so freely, and Sakamae didn't care enough to hide her powers more...then they were going to send each other to oblivion before Sakamae left... The light in Ayashi's crystalline eyes disappeared, and he merely sat there, his arm still around Yukari, btu it was limp- not full of protection as it had been before. <p>&quot;...Holding on to an unfulfilled wish, I travel high above the lonely sky...&quot; -Tooi Yoake</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 921<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(6/6/03 12:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yeah, if they're gonna get killed, Kokoru wouldn't miss </span><hr size=1> Yukari let out a weighted breath of air, concerned about Ayashi.

Surprisingly, they didn't land near Ayashi and Yukari...they landed right in front of Fina...and they left a large hole in the sidewalk where they fell.<br>

Kokoru blinked, and a few lines of a blush stained his cheekbones, but it was hardly noticeable. He wasn't about to tell a stranger that he had come down to Earth to try and win a male angel over...but what else could he say? He sucked at lying...<br>
