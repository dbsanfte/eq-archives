Special Edition: This edition is special as it is probably the last opinion piece being produce by the TIO before it gives way to a new project.  It was made to cover modern day Menelmacar in all it's glory.   I'm at work and it hasn't been spell/grammar checked.  But it is a story read it's content if you'd like.  Peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
In one of the older issues of TIO I discussed the Menelmacar revolution in a responce to the Skylines enquirer style article.  So the revolution as it was called, which would of been better to just be called reform took place.  Was it a success? <br>
<br>
To answer that question we must review the current state of the Menelmacari people and their productivity.  There are different ways to measure productivity, comparing it to other nations, comparing it to it's best time period, reviewing post counts, new projects, new laws, foreign relations, and internal affairs.<br>
<br>
The Menelmacari peole over all seem quite content with the change.  Lets review some behavior by the current population of citizens  We'll start with those whom are new, or who seemed relecuctant to participate in the reformation.   One citizen who was reluctant to participate in the revolution known as Zary to the Menelmacari people.   He is the governor of Balar, but prior to the revolution which he eventually endorsed he had no posted in some time.  Since the reformation he has not posted at all, I personally have only spoke with him on a few occasions where he seemed to busy to talk to me.  Hopefully he again returns from inactivity.<br>
<br>
So we must find differnet voices.  On the boards Ric Lyon recently returned to Menelmacar after the reformation he came back with several skeletons in his closet.  He is having a hard time adjusting to the new Menelmacar.  No is used to the constant fighting with OAM and recently reignited this feud by announcing that had destroyed themselves.  Which to everyones suprised Mari Greenwood known Politikkkan supporters revived it just for her and Bill to have a home for the two of them, and their inactive queeen.   <br>
<br>
Ric Lyon fueled the dispute by suggesting again the Menelmacari people be friends with the traitors.  He was rebuked quickly by none other then myself.   Other then this one event Ric Lyon is still coming to terms with the new state of affairs in Menelmacari, it is no longer the 'barely' surving nation it was in it's past and I particular have great hopes for Ric's success in Menelmacar.<br>
<br>
Moving on to discuss other citizens there is Pathfollower who joined Menelmacar after Sirithil destroyed it the first time, first appearing on the Menelmacari boards as agent of change.  From that point on he became a strong voice in Menelmacar always well educated his opinions are always noted for the comical way they are portrayed.   Path follower has serves in the Menelmacari government before the reform as the Prefect of State.  Since the reformation has proposed several issues in the conclave some fueling more contraversy then necessary.  One forcing myself to ask him &quot;Are you drunk?&quot; However Pathfollower always the productive citizen recently like my team lost in the Menelmacar Atheletic Association.  (We'll get em back Path!)<br>
<br>
Looking at other prominent citizens Robert Belci who is also the president of Cranda and former Prefect of Immigration has always been a supporter of change.  The new government seems to please Belci very much with him now getting the chance to be the govenor of Northern Haradwaith.  Belci has made some contraversial suggestions however asking that some of the Menelmacari land be given to Cranda since it is a smaller nation.  Besides this Belci has been a productive citizen and has enlisted himself as Ambassador to Cranda.<br>
<br>
Once more Karlesson former prefect of justice, has recently been appointed Chief Judge and with Archetype and the other citizens is pounding out a legal code to suite the new government. He's been a hard worker and operater of the Menelmacar Atheletic Association.  <br>
<br>
While there are many other citizens to mention instead we should look at another avenue of production.  New citizens, recently Menelmacar has gotten several new applications for citizenship.  Ric Lyon recently returned after becoming disillusioned months back wanting a &quot;united Menelmacar&quot;.  Other people to note brand new to micronationalism is my wife Snowwhite22 who is joining Menelmacar, Lady of the Wool a friend of both myself and BananaSherder has also applied for citizenship.  <br>
<br>
GraelB another friend of BananaSherder who recently join the collective unconscious who wanting a broader micronational experience was invited by myself to join Menelmacar.  Grael has applied and even offered to help pay for Goldmemership.  Hoefensfill founder of a small community called Karnali was invited by Ric Lyon and Archetype to join for his constant productive voice in Menelmacar.  Hoefensfills also known as Hoen is a reformed bomb maker, who seems to have reformed his lifestyle.  <br>
<br>
Reviewing current Menelmacari projects it is obvious the boards are being updated with the help of the Trevon from the Babkhan Red Lyon society, a well known Chaocrat.  He is a beloved non-citizen of the Imperium who have trusted him enough to offer him Admin to ease his helping of the boards.  Archetype has also been engaged in producing new graphics from the Imperium banner, crest, and background.  He will soon be working on the Add topic/poll/reply buttons and custom emoticons.<br>
<br>
Another noticable project is the independent organization Menelmacar Atheletic Association which had a great start.  Currently Wildflower Emprires team the Warriors, and the Menelmacar team the Ravenous Marmorts will be fighting it out for the winner of this session.  <br>
<br>
Another on going project has been TIO this very opinion source which may be closing down soon to give way to a more comical genre run out of the same office.  It's to be decided but int he mean time I will continue to display my random rantings which also are comical when people take them to seriouslly.<br>
<br>
Menelmacar's most ambtious project is probably just to have fun.  The main board and prancing pony inn is composed of a large tourist industry of 'having fun' the participants seem to be engaged in random jokes, debates, and the geneneral talkings of a healthy community.   Archetype has recently revived a psychofied chat a weaker version of the CUian Psycho Chat craze that took place several months back.  Allowing the citizens to have a good laugh together while discussing various topics such as Albatross, Hentai, Turtles, and even politics.<br>
<br>
Post count is another issue, when the posts got to low and outsiders began their typical doomsday chants Archetype removed the feature.  Since the reformation however the Conclave has received a steady stream of issues, and votes as well have the various forums.<br>
<br>
It's obvious the nation is busy with reform, and being a community.  A rather succesful turn around.  The Menelmacari people have one legacy that doesn't appear to die anytime soon.  That is it's ability to survive almost anything poor political losing micronationalist can throw at them, or take from them as the case may be.<br>
<br>
The reformation is a success with a new constitution, a new government structure, new citizens, and a new feel in the Menelmacari population.
