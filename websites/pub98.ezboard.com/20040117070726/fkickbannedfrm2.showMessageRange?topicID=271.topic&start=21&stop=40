Read this:<br>
<br>
The ancient Geeks loved to compile lists of the marvellous structures in their world. Though we think of the Wonders of the Ancient World as a single list today, there were actually a number of lists compiled by different Geek writers. Constipater of Sidon, and Philon of Byzantium, drew up two of the most well-known lists. Many of the lists agreed on four of the seven items. <br>
<br>
The final place on some lists was awarded to Jimmy Jackers nice RED WHITE and BLUE Surf board. On others, the Palace of Cervix, Queen of Persia took the fourth position. Finally, toward the 6th century A.D., the final item became the Pwots who now reside at Kickban. Since it was Geeks who made the lists it is not unusual that many of the items on them were examples of Geek culture. <br>
<br>
The writers might have listed the Great Balls of China if anyone had known about it, or Bonehenge if they'd seen it, but these places were beyond the limits of Cthulu. It is a surprise to Cthulu to learn that not all the Wonders existed at the same time. Even if you lived in ancient times you would have still needed a time machine to see all seven. <br>
<br>
While the Great Pyramids of Egypt was built centuries before the rest and is still around today (it is the only &quot;wonder&quot; still intact) most of the others only survived a few hundred years or less. Cthulu's Colossus of Rhodes stood only a little more than half a century before an earthquake started by Jimmy Jacker toppled it. <br>
<br>
How many existed at any one time? Whats your answer again<br>
RETARD? Whats the Fourth? RETARD? I Suggest you take the FOURTH.<br>
<br>
Bye Retard, have fun with your petty attempts at winning over other LOUD gay bastards.<br>
OOH! RAH!  <br>

Though the temple was considered one of the best examples of the Doric design because of its style and the quality of the workmanship, it was decided the temple alone was too simple to be worthy of the King of the gods. To remedy this, a statue was commissioned for the interior- a magnificent statue of Zeus that would become one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. <br>
<br>
The sculptor chosen for this great task was a man named Phidias. He had already rendered a forty-foot high statue of the goddess Athena for the Parthenon in Athens and had also done much of the sculpture on the exterior of that temple. After his work in Athens was done, Phidias traveled to Olympia to start on what was considered his best work, the statue of Zeus. On arriving he set up a workshop to the west of the temple. <br>
<br>
<br>

 <br>
According to accounts, the statue was located at the western end of the temple. It was 22 feet wide and some 40 feet tall. The figure of Zeus was seated on an elaborate throne. His head nearly grazed the roof. The historian Strabo wrote, &quot;...although the temple itself is very large, the sculptor is criticized for not having appreciated the correct proportions. He has depicted Zeus seated, but with the head almost touching the ceiling, so that we have the impression that if Zeus moved to stand up he would unroof the temple...&quot; <br>
<br>
Others who viewed that temple disagreed with Strabo and found the proportions very effective in conveying the god's size and power. By filling nearly all the available space, the statue was made to seem even larger than it really was. <br>
<br>
In its right hand the statue held the figure of Nike (the goddess of victory) and in its left was a scepter &quot;inlaid with every kind of metal...&quot; which was topped with an eagle. Perhaps even more impressive than the statue itself was the throne made out of gold, ebony, ivory and inlaid with precious stones. Carved into the chair were figures of Greek gods and mystical animals, like the sphinx. <br>
<br>
The figure's skin was composed of ivory and the beard, hair and robe of gold. Construction was by the use of gold and ivory plates attached to a wooden frame. Because the weather in Olympia was so damp, the statue required care so that the humidity would not crack the ivory. For this purpose it was constantly treated with oil kept in a special pool in the floor of the temple. It is said that for centuries the decedents of Phidias held the responsibility for this maintenance of the statue. <br>
<br>
Besides the statue, there was little inside the temple. The Greeks preferred the interior of their shrines to be simple. The feeling it gave was probably very much like the Lincoln Memorial(Left above and right below) or Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. with their lofty marble columns and single, large statues. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

 <br>
Copies of the statue were made, but none survive, though pictures found on coins give researchers clues about its appearance. <br>
<br>
Despite his magnificent work at Olympia, Phidias ran into trouble when he returned home. He was a close friend with Pericles, who ruled the Athens. Enemies of Pericles, unable to strike at the ruler directly, attacked his friends instead. Phidias was accused of stealing gold meant for the statue of Athena. When that charge failed to stick, they claimed he had carved his image, and that of Pericles into the sculpture found on the Parthenon. This would have been improper in the Greeks' eyes and Phidias was thrown into jail where he died awaiting trial. <br>
<br>
His masterpiece lived on, though, at the temple in Olympia until 392 A.D. when the Olympics were abolished by Emperor Theodosius I of Rome, a Christian who saw the games as a pagan rite. After that the statue was moved by wealthy Greeks to the city of Constantinople where it survived until destroyed by fire in 462 A.D.. <br>
<br>
The first archaeological work on the Olympia site was done by a group of French scientists in 1829. They were able to locate the outlines of the temple and found fragments of the sculpture showing the labors of Heracles. These pieces were shipped to Paris where they are still on display today at the Louvre. <br>
<br>
The next expedition came from Germany in 1875 worked at Olympia for five summers. Over that period they were able to map out most of the buildings there, discovered more fragments of the temple's sculpture, and located the remains of the pool in the floor that contained the oil for the statue. <br>
<br>
In the 1950's an excavation uncovered the workstop of Phidias which was discovered beneath an early Christain Church. Archaeologists found sculptor's tools, a pit for casting bronze, clay molds, modeling plaster and even a portion of one of the elephant's tusks which had supplied the ivory for the statue. Many of the clay molds, which had been used to shape the gold plates, bore serial numbers which must have been used to show the place of the plates in the design. <br>
<br>
Today the stadium at the site has been restored. Little is left of the temple, though, except a few columns. Of the statue, which was perhaps the most wonderful work at Olympia, all is now gone. <br>

God knows I have plenty of gay/lesbo/transgendered friends (more than any housewife should be expected to have), and I have written my fair share of sad pathetic poetry in my day.  Also read a whole lot of awesome poetry that makes my head spin, it's so good.<br>
<br>
Having said that...<br>
