Many times I have tried to manipulate her, but she has a stronger will than even I.  Of course, I am of greater power. But where she goes, I would not know.  Maybe she is returning to the Caves.  She showed weakness before the one called Count.  But she would have us expect that.&quot; Her eyes were full of thoughful malice.  &quot;...Foolish brat.  She'll learn the toll for betraying me...leave the killing to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
All of sudden, Artema's body shuddered.  She fell to her knees, holding her head, and let out a shrill, high pitched scream of anguish.  She let go of them, her eyes wide with fear. Her face was not her own.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO!&quot; she screamed, her voice different and lighter-toned than the sorceress' deep purr. &quot;Don't let her kill Athena! Not my child! No!!! Athena!!!&quot; she screamed, and suddenly slumped forward.<br>
<br>
When Artema rose again, she was composed.  Her hair was slightly disheveled, but with a smooth, fluid movement she calmly smoothed it over, and looked at her companions with a cool, tranquil air about her, back to mother.<br>
<br>
&quot;The insolent bitch,&quot; she growled softly.  &quot;Almost as annoying as her daughter.

Then she composed herself.  &quot;But if we were to destroy this body, I would need another shell.  Though I doubt it will come to that.  One feeble cry from her mother and she'll come running.&quot;  Her eyes glinted in the dim light.  &quot;And even if it doesn't work, I am a mistress of mind games...along with many things.

&quot;This is Zeroz leader of my armies, or ex-leader since my armies aren't here. But still he's a good fighter I believe he could help us in our attack, that and if been looking for reason to use him he has been in the void for quite a while.&quot;<br>

&quot;I don't know what is worse being in void or being in this lowly world with you, Lenoig, and the little friends you have made&quot; Zeroz growled out and took a seat in the corner. <br>

Artema smiled silently at Zeroz.  &quot;Of course,&quot; she sneered, though as politely as only a sorceress can manage.  &quot;no one would expect you to work in the presence of lowly, moral females.  'Tis a good thing there are none here.&quot;  She paused.  &quot;I have already sent for help as we speak.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly three figures appeared behind her.  One was tall and slim, and very official looking, straight, short and daggered silvery white hair and steely gray eyes, or one at least.  the other was covered by an eyepatch.  She wore a blue, and slightly scanty uniform.  The teleportation did not phase her in the slightest.  Behind her appeared two cadets, twins by the looks of them, in tight black uniforms with shoulder length red hair and purple eyes.  One was male and one was female. Stunned by the mental flight, they stumbled to the ground and entangled in each other's limbs, quarreling and kicking.<br>
<br>
The captain's eye shifted slightly to the side and widened.  The twins cried out in pain, as if they were dogs cowering at a whistle only they could hear.  They quickly got to their feet, and stood at attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ma'am, yes ma'am!&quot; they cried fearfully, saluting shakily at unsaid words.<br>
<br>
The woman smirked slightly at the intimidation.  Then she bowed reverently before Artema, the gesture fluid and unasked for.  &quot;My Queen,&quot; she spoke.<br>
<br>
Artema smiled.  &quot;This is Captain Kai-Ta of the Osirian Army.  Our general is busy at the moment in other matters.  These are her recruits, Lani and Yani.  Kai-Ta is a Mystic.  She more than matches Luna's powers and is skilled in the ways of the mind.  Lani is an axebladeswoman and Yani is a martial artist,&quot; she added quickly, not really caring.<br>
<br>
&quot;They are dumb as bricks, but they can fight,&quot; Kai-Ta spat bitterly, making her cadets tremble.  &quot;How do you want the little brat, my Queen?  Dead? Or Worse?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alive, if you can manage it,&quot; Artema sighed.  &quot;But dead if you must.  It matters not to me, really.  Surprise me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My pleasure.&quot; Kai-Ta smiled bitterly, looking around at her Queen's surrounding companions, including Lord Faro and especially Zeroz.  &quot;Zeroz,&quot; she spoke with a hint of gleeful malice in her tone.  &quot;The Temple of Firadra, after the Cataclysm.  You led that little massacre, didn't you?  I was very impressed.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;I am good at what I do&quot; Zeroz hissed out then looked at all the new arrivals. &quot;But it was quite easy since there were only mortals to battle, a few magicians and priests, but no mere human can stand up to the fury of the void.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He gets a little carried away&quot; Lenoig remarked. &quot;But now it would be quite interesting to see how your little friends do, hell perhaps they even succeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Or perhaps I will have to join them&quot; Zeroz remarked and almost managed a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;That could work&quot; Lenoig remarked and looked at Atemis. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/20/03 8:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Echoes Bar</span><hr size=1> &quot;I have no doubt you are good at what you do,&quot; Kai-Ta hissed in the same tone, her hand on her hip.  &quot;But don't get me wrong.  I am also good at what I do.  And though they really don't look the part...&quot; she cast a glance of disgust toward her recruits.  &quot;They have a few skills of their own as well.  I usually work alone, but the commander stuck them to me.  Were it not orders, I would have left them to die in the forest.  I am no babysitter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey!&quot; Lani cried, stepping forward.  &quot;Who are you calling a baby, you one eyed bit--&quot;<br>
<br>
Kai-Ta merely shot a hateful glance at the insubordinate, the air humming briefly.  Lani choked on her words, as if she had swallowed them and they had gone down the wrong way.  Her humongous axe dropped with a clang to the floor and she followed soon on her knees, going white with her eyes bulging.  Yani stood at attention, reluctant to help his twin on pain of the same fate.<br>
<br>
Kai-Ta stepped toward the writhing girl, looking calm and collected.  Her one visible eye widened and narrowed slightly, as if she were speaking.  Lani cried out, shaking her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing, it was nothing! I have nothing to say!&quot; she cried aloud, clutching her head in her hands.  There was blood trickling from her ears and her nose.  <br>
<br>
Kai-Ta's eyes narrowed in disgust. With a toss of her graceful head, Lani was thrown without aid of physical force into the back wall, smashing a chair and knocking over a small table.  She hit the wall with a smack, trembling in intimidation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Weakling.&quot;  She looked at Yani fiercely.  &quot;Take her to the bathroom and clean her up.  Then clean up that mess she made.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ma'am, yes ma'am,&quot; he gulped, saluting.  He ran to his twin and helped her up, dragging her to the bathroom.  &quot;Must you always make so much trouble?&quot; he hissed.  Lani only moaned in response.<br>
<br>
Kai-Ta looked at Artema, her one steel eye glinting fiercely with bloodlust.  &quot;I am eager to go, Your Majesty.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, Captain.&quot;  She looked at her companions.  &quot;Are we ready? Kai-Ta can teleport, and she is strong enough to take anyone who is willing to go.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/21/03 1:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=113>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Echoes Bar</span><hr size=1> &quot;Guess your not the only one who has heard of employer brutality&quot; Zeroz spat out towards Lenoig who only returned his usual smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can be glad we're not in the void little man or I would have ripped you apart and consumed you&quot; Lenoig told Zeroz and widened his smile at his current thoughts. &quot;But lucky for you we're not in the void so you’re free to go and play with our new friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If that is what you order&quot; Zeroz told Lenoig with hatred and stepped to Kai-Ta. &quot;Then let us go and get this over with quit&quot; Zeroz said and put on a pair of sunglasses and summoned an extremely large void sword with a picture of a flame draw on the side of the blade. <br>

<br>
Scarlet listened quietly. &quot;With an attitude like that Zeroz,&quot; She spoke, addressing his hatred to women, or weak females, &quot;you will most surley fall prey in the pecking order in the Dynasty.&quot; She looked at everyone in the room. &quot;You all here I have choosen, I want to see if you are good enough to become part of the actual group. Not just hitmen in lower ranks. Of course,&quot; She paused. &quot;You'll have to understand that what you've seen so far, is but little of the actual. Soon many will gather here in this place, and they will want to test you, they are more powerful than I am, and of higher rank. Zeroz, when they arrive hold your tounge, for most of them are women, and I'd advise you to be polite. Because most of them will not hesitate to kill you, it is a game to them, and you are but a pawn.&quot; She turned to Lenoig. &quot;With that said, I think you will all be happy to know, that the time has almost come to make our move against Acrid. But before we can make it, we must capture, Luna.&quot; <br>
<br>
She turned to Artema. &quot;So I'd advise that we capture or kill her as quickly as possible.&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

<br>
Lani and Yani came back from the bathroom, Lani's one eye was black but she could see fairly enough through it, a deep purple bruise on her cheekbone.  They came near her as she outstretched her arms.  Once everyone who was coming gathered about her, she stared at Artema, a faint light comign from underneath her eyepatch.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will not fail you, my queen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Artema only smiled.  &quot;You had better not.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kai-Ta closed her eye, though light still came from beneath the obstructive black patch.  And then, with a faint, shrill hum, all who gathered near the Mystic captain were gone, including the Mystic herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Little Luna will not have a chance,&quot; said Artema with bloodlust in her voice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/21/03 4:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=117>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Echoes Bar</span><hr size=1> &quot;Well lets see how things are going&quot; Lenoig said and created a floating image that showed the inside of the caves. &quot;Damn that took more out of me then I liked&quot; Lenogi remarked and sat down looking at the image. &quot;But still recieving pretty good signal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crystalsailorvenus>CrystalSailorVenus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://ffworld.free.fr/ffworld/images/avatars/ff10/7.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/23/03 6:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=118>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ffworld.free.fr/ffworld/images/avatars/ff8/53.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Echoes Bar</span><hr size=1> Psychi walked into the bar, muttering dark things.
