I was partly kidding with my comment but that comment of hers and the smirk, well those were flirting words right there. But I knew she was not into that sort of thing and I was to sore right now to bother trying. The steam that rose from the hot water was so inviting, calling me to sink into the depths they came from and when Taylee was done, I stood naked before her with my things in front of me.<br>
<br>
With the bath now ready, I set my things down beside the makeshift tub just in case. My fingertip tested the water's temperature and I smiled to feel that it was just right. Without any hesitation I climbed in and settled with a happy sigh into the hot water and quickly began to wash the filth off me with my hands. To say that the feeling was incredible was an understatement and soon I was clean from the crap on my fair skin. My fingers worked to wash out my womanhood as best I could, my mind still seeing that sticky huge piece of meat plunging into it. Thankfully I did not see what ever else might have happened, I felt like they all had taken a round and each cumming in turn on me. Oh they were so dead when I got better.<br>
<br>
The bath made me feel so much better and so I sat there soaking for a few minutes longer. All that was left was to wash my hair so I climbed out of the tub at length and bent low before Taylee with my back to her. I dunked my head into the water and quickly washed my hair before standing up again and throwing my hair behind my shoulders. &quot;Hmmm so much better...&quot; I smirked at her as I made my way past her side and running my hand across her shoulder. &quot;I feel so... alive and perky don't you know?&quot; my breath was against her neck as I brushed against her back to her other side, my nails tracing across her throat. &quot;I'm sooo... hungry.&quot; my fangs snapped in her ear before I backed away slowly and moved towards my weapons and clothes which I picked up and took over to the table.<br>
<br>
As I dried myself in the warm glow of the lanturn that caused my flesh to look soft and smooth, I had to smile to myself. Perky was not exactly how I felt, more like hungry and a little horny. Blood would make me feel better and probably heal my wounds but even with that sexy blonde supply before me, I had made her a promise. Once I was dry, I would have to get dressed and go hunting for food before I turned into a very hunrgy horny bitch that would only cause trouble for myself. And trouble was something I had gotten enough of already tonight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

<br>
When Rayne stepped into the tub, Taylee turned away making herself busy looking around so the other girl could have a little privacy, but she glanced back occaisionally...whether to make sure the girl was allright or to make sure she wasn't sneaking up, Taylee wasn't completly certain. The one thing the blonde could tell, was that Rayne was at least enjoying it.<br>
<br>
Hearing the girl getting out, Taylee turned thinking she was done but watched as Rayne bent over to wash her hair. The blonde stepped forward with a frayed towel she had found as Rayne stood up, and watched as the redhead moved past her. Taylee stood totally still as she felt Rayne brush up behind her, and she sucked in a breath, holding it as she felt the girls breath on her neck.<br>
<br>
Taylee had not forgotten the feel of the bite...or the feeling of being fed from. It was something she had craved long after Carson was gone. And even though she wouldn't give in, her body still wanted to betray her. It took several minutes with her back to the dhampire before Taylee could turn and act normal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/30/03 6:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home Sweet Home</span><hr size=1> The warm glow of the lanturn dried my skin as I slide my hands over my arms which propped up my firm breasts. To say I was feeling pretty good right about now was an understatement, its amazing what a bath though how pathetic can make you feel. As I gazed down over my breasts, I noticed that the bruises and scratches were already disapearing. I was healing, hungry, horny and all I had before me was Taylee who I really wanted to pounce but wouldn't. <br>
<br>
With my skin now dry, I slipped back into my clothes to cover my nakedness. I also strapped on my weapons before tying back my still damp hair. There was no way I could stay here in this shelter with how deprived of blood I was. No I had to go back out and fuck George if he tried to stop me. Abruptly I turned from the table and made my way back to Taylee. Like before I walked behind her but this time I placed both hands on her shoulders. Slowly I slipped them down her arms, then up her flanks before resting them just under her breasts. Like before as well, my breath was on her neck as I rested my chin on her shoulder while I pressed myself up against her from behind. &quot;You know... Taylee...&quot;<br>
<br>
I lingered behind her, lightly gripping her flanks with my fingers as I whispered in her ear softly. &quot;Its best if we get me out of this shelter... You see though I am dhampire, I still crave blood. I need it to survive or I go crazy... worse then you are experiencing right now...&quot; I brushed a hand across her neck softly before continuing. &quot;Now I promised you I wouldn't feed from you... but that means I need someone else... You could come with me and I'll show you a taste of the life vampires live... or Ghoul... you can remain here were it is safe...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

<br>
Taylee heard Rayne's voice close to her ear, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;You know... Taylee...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and her body screamed to let the dhampire bite her. It would be so easy to just relax back against the girl behind her, but her mind held firm, denying that action.<br>
<br>
Taylee couldn't supress a shiver when she felt Rayne's hand caress the back of her neck as the girl continued speaking, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Now I promised you I wouldn't feed from you... but that means I need someone else... You could come with me and I'll show you a taste of the life vampires live... or Ghoul... you can remain here were it is safe...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
In a voice much steadier then she felt, the blonde girl answered, &quot;What makes you think I haven't had enough of the life Vampire's lead?&quot; She heard the challenge in the other girls last words, and continued, &quot;But since you've been hurt, and it wouldn't be in George's best interest for you to go crazy here, I'll come with you...just for now.&quot; She still hadn't tried to move away from the redhead's embrace.<br>

The excitement was clear and I could tell she liked recieving attention to her neck. However if I ever did bite her, it would sadly disapoint her because my bite was not pleasant, or painful. It was simply a mix of both that you did not know if you liked or hated experiencing. Her comment turned my smile into a smirk as I teased her with a light lick of my tongue up the side of her neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know... this life is not about fearing for you life and being forced into becoming a ghoul...&quot; I whispered into her ear softly as I inched my hands upward in their grip just under her breasts. I also pulled her back a little further against her so she could clearly feel my body against her back. &quot;You can not be a dhampire like me... but the thrill of experiencing both worlds... Power.. heightened senses... Sure I kill vampires but its the life I have chosen... Its otherwise not a bad life... I could grant you the opportunity to remain a ghoul for as long as you wanted...&quot; I licked her neck again as I concluded my indecient proposal. I knew she might just be curious enough to ask me how.<br>
<br>
&quot;And fuck what George thinks... Your an independ girl, you don't need that teen who probably hasn't experienced a hard on yet to know what it is...&quot; I cupped her breasts in my hands and planted a kiss to the side of her moist neck before stepping back slowly and moving to stand near her side. &quot;I just need some food... and I'm sure you do to so lets go shopping girl. I'll only go crazier as long as I am in here.&quot;<br>
<br>
I grew silent, curious to see what her reaction would be now. The need for blood was really messing with my emotions, making me wish I never promised Taylee anything because I wanted to jump her right here and now. I was ready to go outside, all she had to do was lead the way or tell me she was ready to follow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

Power.. heightened senses...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
She felt the dhampire's hands slide up caressing her body but caught momentarily by Rayne's web of suduction, she couldn't move. When the other girl kissed her neck and then stepped away releasing her, Taylee jolted back to her senses. She heard Rayne say, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I just need some food... and I'm sure you do to so lets go shopping girl. I'll only go crazier as long as I am in here.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taylee looked at Rayne, a frown creasing her brow, &quot;Ok, we can go, but....what did you mean about remaining a ghoul...for as long as I wanted?&quot; she asked, then hurriedly added, &quot;Not that I want to be a ghoul...I'm just curious.&quot;<br>

Maybe later I would see if I could tease her into willingly giving herself to me and thus sparing me from breaking my promise, but all that could wait. Instead I stepped up beside her and wrapped one arm around her slender waist and turned her towards the door as I thought up how to propose my indecent idea.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Taylee my dear... I hunt vampires and drink their blood. Its vampire blood that gives me extra strength and also ghouls mortals...&quot; I glanced sideways at her with a seductive smile on my lips. &quot;I could give you the edge against them by giving you vampire blood to drink, which would ghoul you. The more you drink, the longer you will be ghouled and the more powerful you will be as well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Taking your life won't be so easy for anyone anymore to play with as they see fit.&quot; I nipped at her ear before we stepped out to where George was working in his livingroom.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh George, don't bother stopping us but we are going out shopping... A girl thing you might say. Watch the baby for us? See ya.&quot; I smirked at him as we walked past and headed outside. It was the first time I had gotten a good look at the bomb that had gone off earlier and the place was a real mess. Body parts of Were creatures still lay about and I kicked a limb as we passed by. &quot;Serves them right... stupid fucking pieces of shit.&quot; I spat on the ground. &quot;I will have my revenge...&quot;<br>
<br>
Around us I could see nothing but warehouses with the harbour only a few blocks away. This was dangerious territory to be in right now for we were in the middle of a very large vampire community. It was doubtful there would be any food places near here so Taylee and I would have to walk a little ways. The possibility of me catching a bite to eat on the way there was high but I would have to be careful. To much attention here and it would be all over for both me and this lovely ghoul beside me. My arm was still around her waist because until she moved, I wanted to tease her as much as possible. &quot;So... Taylee... where are we off to?

She didn't say anything to George either, giving him an apologetic look instead. He couldn't know that what she was doing by going with Rayne was to help him as much as herself right now, because she knew that sooner or later as much as the two of them disliked each other someone was going to get hurt.<br>
<br>
The blonde girl watched as Rayne kicked pieces of the blown up Were's out of their way as they picked their way through the rubble of the explosion. As they moved away from the building Taylee heard the other girl ask her, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;So... Taylee... where are we off to?

<br>
She shook her head, &quot;No, not really....you're the one that was making all the promises back there. You tell me..where we're going.&quot; The blonde pulled out of the dhampire's embrace, turning to look her in the eye. Taylee wasn't about to let Rayne in on any of her safe places. If the girl wanted Taylee along so bad she could share some of her secrets.<br>

It did not seem as though she was challenging me but it was just my habit to act like she was. My breath was hot on her face as I stood very close, my lips almost brushing hers. &quot;So... I did make promises...&quot; I whispered as I placed my hands on my slender hips. &quot;And I always keep them unless released from them...&quot;I teasingly directed my breath across the side of her neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for someplace to go... well we are in the harbour area and surrounded by vampire lairs. I suggest we go more into the city and away from here. That of course means that we won't be returning here when we are done.&quot; I looked her in the eye and slipped both my hands on her waist with a smirk on my lips. &quot;I did offer my safe house earlier and we could always go there... Actually we'll have to go there.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a toss of my head to the side, I stepped backwards and away from her slowly. This was her last chance to go back inside or come with me as I turned and began to walk slowly down the street. In my area there was food stores for mortals, protected by high security so as to not become vampire feeding grounds but I knew I would find something to eat there. Even with the high security, a vampire or two always hung about and I was planning on killing one while Taylee went grocery shopping. It was a great plan and then we'd go back to my place for a better place to stay then something so run down as George's place.<br>
<br>
&quot;So... coming?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

The ghoul's eyes narrowed slightly as she listened to the girl speak. It wasn't hard to figure out what Rayne was reffering to when she talked about the promises she'd made, and Taylee knew she was probably regretting that she made them in the first place. But the blonde girl was no fool and wouldn't let Rayne out of them so easily, no matter how much she might be tempted.<br>
<br>
Rayne mentioned her safe house before stepping away, and Taylee had to agree, although silently, that it was probably the best place to go right now. It had to be better then where they were now.Taylee watched as Rayne started to walk down the street, before the dhampire stopped, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;So... coming?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
A smirk crossed Taylee's face. &quot;Well I don't have any other plans tonight,&quot; she replied with a bit of a sarcastic edge, before a laugh escaped, &quot;So...why not.&quot; The blonde girl glanced back to where she knew George must still be working, a twinge of regret flowing through her. 'But,' she told herself, 'I'll most likely run into him again sometime.'<br>
<br>
Throwing her damp jacket over her shoulders, Taylee hurried to catch up with Rayne, who was waiting, almost patiently. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#8B4513>(10/9/03 7:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home Sweet Home</span><hr size=1> &quot;Ohhh sarcasm... girl I love you already.&quot; I smirked as Taylee caught up to me. She had some fire in her and I liked that, there just might be hope for this girl yet. With a one finger salute of farewell to George's rundown home, I turned with Taylee and continued on our way out of the area. Since I knew the city somewhat, mainly by landscapes, it was going to be easy enough to find my way back home. With the memory of recient events however I was more then satisfied to stick to the streets.<br>
<br>
My weapons in plain sight probably kept away anyone that might have seen us and wanted some trouble because Taylee and I encountered very little on the way back through the city. It was a long walk however and I was amazed that the little shit George could have gotten Taylee and the baby through the sewers this distance so quickly. I kept a watchful on our surroundings as we walked, noticing more familer locations as Taylee and I progressed further back into the city.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey you know...&quot; I licked my lips lightly. &quot;Those vampires that played with you earlier. I could always go kick their ass for you. It would be fun and I could always use a good fight.&quot; I looked at Taylee as we walked down a street not far from the grocery store. Of course we wouldn't need to go there tonight, I wanted to eat and go home first for a while. But since it seemed Taylee would be my guest for a while, we had to do something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

She decided it must either be the weapons the dhampire displayed or the obvious 'don't fuck with me' attitude that seemed to keep trouble away as they headed through the city, because she'd never openly walked the streets without attracting all kinds of trouble before.<br>
<br>
Taylee heard Rayne mention going after the vampires that she'd seen earlier, and as the redhead looked over at her, a feeling of dread washed through her. Taking a steadying breath, she looked back at Rayne, &quot;I-I don't think that would b a good idea. Cale isn't someone you should mess with, and I'd rather he didn't know where I was.&quot; Taylee shrugged, &quot;The woman...I don't know who she was, so I guess she's fair game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just thinking about Cale made Taylee scared, and she began to look in the shadows as they walked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#8B4513>(10/11/03 7:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home Sweet Home</span><hr size=1> &quot;Fuck Cale... stupid prick.&quot; Rayne muttered aloud as she glanced into the shadows as Taylee did. &quot;That guy couldn't find an asshole in a group of gay men... and besides, if you think he's something kinda wonderful...&quot; the dhampire licked her lips as she looked back at the blonde seductivly. &quot;You haven't seen me in action yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And stop worrying about the shadows hun, I can hear and see anything that hides there unless they have the ability to hide their thoughts or hide their form in shadow.&quot; she smirked as she clicked and unclicked her weapons dangerously in as Taylee assumed, a 'don't fuck with me' additude. She liked these deserted streets but as they neared the populated sector, more and more people could be seen. The two made an odd looking couple, drawing attention to themselves by Rayne's show of weapons. The grocery store was still a few blocks ahead of them though when Rayne came to a stop and turned to face Taylee. It was time to go their seporate ways for the moment and Rayne had a very good idea. It least in her own opinion that is.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok Taylee, here is the deal... You need food as do I and there is always vampires lurking in the shadows around the market.&quot; Rayne began to lay out her plan. &quot;You need the food on the inside, I need the food on the outside so here is the set up. I'll sneek around outside and find a vampire, you go inside and get your food. Once your done, I'll tell you telepathicly where I am and you come this way. We'll lead the vampire into a quiet place, I'll slay it and then we both go on our way to my safe house.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And if you have any problems with being the bait, well you won't be in any harm because I do not want to be harmed either. We'll be finding a lone vampire and I am sure you'd rather I kill it out of the way of mortals to spare them the harm they would recieve if they got in the way...&quot; Rayne placed her hands on her hips as she stood with one lfoot before the other. &quot;Unless you have other ideas? Another blood source?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

If she told the dhampire that she feared Cale and why, it could be power the other girl could hold over her.<br>
<br>
As they got closer to a more populated area, Rayne stopped her. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Ok Taylee, here is the deal...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She listened as the dhampire laid out their possible plan of action, and when she finished, added slyly, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Unless you have other ideas? Another blood source?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taylee looked at the girl standing with her hands on her hips and smirked at the last comment. &quot;No, I don't have another source...I'll keep you to that promise you so gracously gave me, earlier,&quot; the blonde answered her with a soft laugh. She knew it must be driving the redhead crazy. &quot;But your plan sounds like it'll work....just make sure you're still here when I do lead a vamp this way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taylee turned and began to walk towards the small store. She still didn't totally trust Rayne, but she figured the girl wasn't letting her walk into a trap. Not when this could benefit her as well. <br>
<br>
'Damn,' Taylee thought as she pushed her was through the double doors, 'When was the last time I ate?' She knew it had been down in the underground city, with....Vania...&quot;Fuck,&quot; she swore softly, thinking, 'What happened to her?' but she didn't have time right now to worry about the lost girl.<br>
<br>
Grabbing a couple of items from the sparse contents of the shelves, Taylee made her way to the front of the store. Then putting her things down on the counter, she fished in the pocket of her coat, bringing out a couple of wadded up bills, hoping it would enough. The old lady behind the counter scooped them up greedily off the counter with a grunt and after bagging the blonde girl's purchases, handed her a small amount of change. Taylee sighed, stuffing it back in her pocket. 'So much for having any money left,' she thought making her way out into the dark.<br>
<br>
Slowly walking away from the lights, Taylee could almost feel the eyes that followed her. God, she hoped Rayne was close, because the prickling of her skin told her someone was behind her. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A> at: 10/12/03 4:07 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showMessageRange?topicID=2.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showNextMessage?topicID=2.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=34><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.emailToFriend?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.threadControl?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="kalaberiafrm36">Mortal and Kindred Laws<option value="kalaberiafrm37">Character Biographies<option value="kalaberiafrm38">Character Plotting<option value="kalaberiafrm45">Times Square<option value="kalaberiafrm40">Central Park<option value="kalaberiafrm41">Stanton Isle<option value="kalaberiafrm42">Abandoned Subway<option value="kalaberiafrm43">Chitter Chatter<option value="kalaberiafrm44">Advertisements <option value="kalaberiafrm46">Admin and mods<option value="kalaberiafrm47">Warehouse District</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia>MidnyghtRising</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47>Warehouse District</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br> <a href=http://www.runesofdesire.com><img src=http://runesofdesire.com/rod6.jpg></a><br><br>
