As somebody who watched my 42-year-old mother die a slow and painful death from cancer I seriously thought about it when she was at her worst. There comes a point in cancer when no medication works and you are forced to watch someone you love moan and writhe in pain. You are then faced with the fact that person is not only going to die but die horribly and I personally wanted it to stop. Even though I wanted her to live and I think as her child some small part of me was thinking she should still pull out, that this was not happening. I couldn’t bare to see her crying (even though she was in a lite coma) and when we would clean her she would grimace. <br>
<br>
Before we brought her home to die she was in the cancer ward for 3 days. I stayed the whole time with her. It was the most horrible experience of my life. There were tons of forgotten people there in such pain that at night I couldn’t sleep cause all I could hear was people crying and screaming out in pain.<br>
<br>
I have no idea where this is going!!! I just think sometimes it would be more humane to not let people suffer.<br>

I have a living will with my request for certain procedures not to be used (no machines to keep me alive unless I'm pregnant sorta thing) but I wish I could make a living will that would state my wish to die if I were ever in that sort of position, or was wasting away with alsiemers or any number of other illnesses where I don't consider it to be life.<br>
<br>
I don't think it should be done unless asked and the person can be proved competiant when making that choice. But I wish it could be done. <br>

I don't ever want my child to have to watch my die like that. And I don't want my husband to have to watch it as well. It isn't fair. <br>

I will take the position that it is morally wrong to prolong pain, anguish and human suffering. I've given this a lot of thought obviously, with my med termination history. <br>
<br>
Seems to me the only way one can justisfy allowing another human to suffer needlessly (that is, suffer when there is no hope of recovery, only impending death) is to bring god into it and say &quot;it's up to god&quot; or &quot;god wants them/us to learn something&quot; or &quot;we have to give god a chance to make a miracle&quot; or in the case of a severely compromised fetus &quot;god is sending them here to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>do</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> something.&quot; Take god out of the equation and there really is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>no justification</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for allowing needless human suffering.<br>
<br>
That said, I will add that there is certainly a slipperly slope to be concerned with where euthanasia is allowed. Who determines whether a person is truly being relieved of suffering or whether it is their caretakers who are being relieved of the burden of their care? That is a toughie.<br>
<br>
From my memory (especially as a Michigan resident) it seems that in all cases Dr. Jack Kervorkian used the utmost care in determining that his patients truly wanted to die.<br>
<br>
I also remember when my friend's mom died of cancer, she was in so much pain and she was angry that they wouldn't just let her die. She said &quot;it is so unfair that prisoners on death row can die but I am sentenced to live with this pain.&quot; It was awful. Even her mouth was filled with chanker sores.<br>
<br>
Another memory is my grandma dying of conjestive heart failure, in the hospital for the upteenth time, intubated, unable to talk and writing a note to me that said &quot;Christ on the cross had NOTHING on this!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;<br>

But, I think that by crossing the line to assisted suicide we open the door to serious problems.  Unfortunately there are people out there who would use this loop hole to &quot;off&quot; an aging or sick family member just so they don't have to be burdened with the care.

Since this is a board to &quot;debate&quot;/discuss religious topics, I will add that my personal faith based opinion is that only God should have the final say on when a person is to die.  When we take that into our hands, I think we are crossing a boundary that shouldnt be crossed.  <br>

I do think however that physicians are not doing enough to alleviate the pain in critically sick and dying patients out of fear of that those medications will actually speed up the dying process and thereby open themselves up to lawsuits.   - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tupogirl>tupo girl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/6/03 3:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: assisted suicide</span><hr size=1> Shirene, you expressed more eloquently what I was trying to say.

In my law class recently, we had to draw up a mock &quot;act&quot; - we chose euthanasia as the topic for our act.  It was actually a lot harder than we thought it would be, but to make sure that there weren't any loop holes to allow the above situation to occur was relatively easy.  I don't think that a well thought out act would have any loop holes that could be utilised in that way.

I think for a law to work it would have to be done by a person when they were compatate. And in sound mind. Not sure about the sound body. I think if you brought in professionals to interview the person to make sure they weren't being pressured into it by their relatives, it should be allowed.<br>
<br>
It is CRUEL to prolong a human life just to suffer. Or to live a life that they would never want. We have no right to force a person to continue living if they do not wish to live on. <br>

So then we shouldn’t resuscitate people at all? Don’t you think that is kind of the same thing? We keep people alive everyday.<br>

Oregon has legalized assisted suicide, and last year 38 people killed THEMSELVES (not &quot;were killed by family members&quot;).<br>
This is something I feel extremely passionate about. I would rather be dead than a vegetable, a quadrapalegic, or rotting away with cancer or another terminal disease.

Physician-assisted suicides in Oregon more than double since first full year law in effect <br>
Wed Mar 5, 4:58 PM ET  <br>

By WILLIAM McCALL, Associated Press Writer <br>
<br>
PORTLAND, Oregon - Thirty-eight people in Oregon killed themselves with help from their doctors in 2002, the highest number in the five full years that the state's physician-assisted suicide law has been in effect. <br>

<br>
Oregon is the only U.S. state where terminally ill patients can legally obtain lethal prescriptions from their doctors. <br>
<br>
<br>
A state report in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine (news - web sites) showed that doctors wrote 58 prescriptions in 2002 for terminally ill patients who qualified under the voter-approved law, and 38 committed suicide. <br>
<br>
<br>
That is more than twice the number of patients who took their own lives in 1998, the first full year the law was in effect. That year, doctors wrote 24 lethal prescriptions and 16 patients used them. <br>
<br>
<br>
Most of those who ended their lives were older, well-educated cancer victims, said Dr. Mel Kohn, state epidemiologist and co-author of the report. The primary reasons cited included loss of independence, a decreasing ability to participate in activities that make life enjoyable and loss of control of bodily functions. <br>
<br>
<br>
Assisted suicides accounted for 0.1 percent of deaths, far less than the 2 percent to 5 percent experts had predicted when the law was being drafted in the early 1990s, said Dr. Steve Miles, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota Medical School. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;People say they want the option, but very few people are really interested in availing themselves of this option,&quot; Miles said. <br>
<br>
<br>
Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, said the Oregon law has forced the health care system to improve its end-of-life care and pain management. <br>

The Oregon law has survived a federal court challenge and a repeal effort, and was supported by a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court (news - web sites) ruling that said that there is no constitutional right to assisted suicide but that states have the authority to pass such a law. <br>

I think for myself if I ever got that ill, I would perhaps refuse medications and treatments except for pain relief. Not being that ill, I can't imagine what it's like though.<br>
<br>
I guess that brings up another question in my mind - is suicide murder? If the person wants to die and needs help - is that murder if someone chooses to do so?<br>
I'm curious as to what other's thoughts are on those questions.<br>

<br>
I believe people have a right to die. And to die with dignity. What is the dignity of wasting away in pain, soiling yourself, unable to get up from your bed, totally dependant on others for even a sip of water.<br>
<br>
There are some illnesses that even the strongest pain killers do not put a dent in the pain. <br>
<br>
And what if you come down with alztimers (sp)? I don't consider that to be living at the end. I would want to die. <br>
<br>
A person should have the right to choose. They should have to the right to choose to live and fight for life as well. Hey, you want everything done, by golly, everything should be done for you. And no one questions that wish. But prolonging someone's life when it isn't wanted or desired has been known to happen. <br>
<br>
How sad. <br>
<br>
On that note, not sure if any of you watch ER, if you do maybe you remember the episode where a 17 yo wanted an DNR but his mother wouldn't approve it. At what age do you think a minor is capable of saying, &quot;hey I have had enough&quot; and you let them go?<br>

I saw that ER. I don't know what would be an appropriate age. 12 perhaps? I think maybe it would depend on the length of time and severity of the illness the person was dealing with, though that might be a hard thing to distinguish.<br>

This topic has suddenly turned timely for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I just found out that a dear aunt's cancer has returned and matasitized (sp) in her bones in several places. I believe they have given her 5 years for the best out come, with aggressive fighting the illness. I think she is 10 or 11 years older then me. I hope there isn't a time when she wishes she could end the pain because there is no law in Georgia. And of course, the Catholic Church frowns on suicide. <br>

I've been wanting a tattoo, but not sure I want one on my chest! Still its something to think about. I feel very strongly about my living will. I think once I am totally through having children, I might have it done. It is something to think about.<br>

My mother battled cancer for 20 years, she had multiple varieties and went thru chemo and radiation when they were still being developed as a technology.  In the end, she was much as everyone else described.  Immobile, screaming in pain, soiling herself, and the treatment was no less agonizing than the slow deterioration.  Her greatest fears leading into the last days were that she would end up like that.  Have her kids see her so patheticly devastated.  She was embarassed, ashamed and guilty.  She hated that for her to decide to give up was unacceptable and sneered at by people who never knew what she faced every day.  She wanted to leave the kids something, but knew the treatment would totally eradicate her savings and the state would seize it.  She wanted to end on a happy note, a party where she said goodbye to everyone she loved, then went to bed and never woke up again so that everyone remembered her the best.  She was denied any of that.  As her child I didn't want my mommy to die.  I wanted her to see my kids, be there for me to lean on and learn from, advise me and reassure me.  It was entirely selfish of me.  Watching what she went through destroyed some of the relationships in my family.  Some could not handle it and distanced themselves, others fell apart and just gibbered uselessly, the couple of us that were left got screwed into taking care of everything.  Giving her injections, wiping her soiled and chemo corrupted body, feeding her semi-consious and deleroius.<br>

I just want to say that I think you and I have been through a similar experience. I was the only who was able and willing to take care of my mom and I was only 22 years old. Your whole post struck something so dark and quiet inside of me.<br>
