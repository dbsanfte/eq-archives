He was in his main hall. THe ceiling reached amazingly high, and stone gray walls were lit up by the large fireplace in the corner.<br>
A large table stood in one corner and a set of chairs and sofas was in the other. A red carpet led out of the large room and into the hallway.<br>
His gold earring glimmered in the light of the fireplace as his black cape swished behind him.<br>
Under his black cape was a long sleeved red tunic with embroidered gold knot designs about it. Loose gray pants were worn under this and black tie-up boots that reached to his knees.<br>
A long sword hilt hung from his belt, a sword with a red handle, which was amazingly crafted, was in it.<br>
<br>
his brows showed annoyance and worry.<br>
His curly black hair was drenched with perspiration and his red eyes glared...<br>
&quot;WHere is Enari? He should be here by now....&quot; Pheonix strode back and forth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sire, would you like for me to get you something to eat?&quot; A man's voice called from the side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Garn... go away you idiot.&quot; He gruffly hollered at his blonde haired, gray eyed gaurd.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sir... Garn hung his head as he walked out of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe... I'll..&quot; Pheonic stopped pacing and smiled wickedly.<br>
<br>
He walked out of the room, proudly... and left his castle for the time being...<br>

<br>
The gaurds were resting in the hallways... slacking off like usual a bright beam of light appeared out of nowhere... <br>
it's brilliant light dimmed and showed Enari... mad as a hornet.<br>
<br>
&quot;ma...master Enari!!!!!&quot; One guard said standing up straight.<br>
<br>
all the other gaurds stood up quickly and hid thier beer bottles.<br>
<br>
Enari glared at them.<br>
<br>
(**continued from mystic forests**)<br>
<br>
Pheonix appeared out of nowhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you've returned my loyal servant.&quot; Pheonix grinned evily at Enari.<br>
<br>
Enari glared back at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is the girl?&quot; Pheonix eyed Enari thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...&quot; Enari started... only to be interupted.<br>
<br>
&quot;You failed? Don't tell me you failed? It was a girl for goodness sake! A GIRL!!!!&quot; Was Pheonix's angry reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;There was a distraction. And many events that altered the outcome.&quot; Enari's cold glare gave Pheonix the shivers.<br>
<br>
&quot;What kinda of distraction?&quot; Pheonix's higher male voice asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... interferring mortals. That's what. A dragon was summoned. A THUNDER Dragon.&quot; Enari shot at Pheonix.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh...&quot; Pheonix stared off into space.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to you keep an eye on her until i need her then.&quot; Pheonix grinned at Enari.<br>
<br>
Enari cringed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Go! now!&quot; Pheonix pointed out the door.<br>
<br>
Enari glared the obeyed... walked out of the door slowly but menacingly.<br>
<br>
**Enari's story continued at mystic forests**<br>

<br>
&quot;how is the prisoner?&quot; He asked his gaurds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um... he's um... in the tower still sir.&quot; One stuttered from under his armor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Has he eaten today yet?&quot; Pheonix snickered as his men cringed.<br>
<br>
&quot;no....&quot; One almost whimpered and stepped back.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHY NOT?!?!&quot; Pheonix walked over to him and glared.<br>
<br>
&quot;He... he won't eat sir...&quot; Was all Pheonix got out of the gaurd.<br>
<br>
Pheonix grunted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why won't he eat?&quot; He walked off agrivated.<br>
<br>
Pheonix trudged up the winding staricase for a few minutes.<br>
The shadows hid things horrible and nasty. The walls were covered in grime and dust.<br>
Yes, the towers of his castle weren't a liked place.<br>
<br>
Finally he reached the top and unlocked the wooden door with a key that he had just gotten from his pockets.<br>
<br>
Inside was a prison of sorts. The only light came from a small barred window about 10 feet from the ground.<br>
A young man sat, with his hands and feet bound to the walls, on the bare stone floor. Soup in a bowl was on the cold hard ground in front of him, as was a cup of water.<br>
<br>
The young man's eyes were closed, but he was awake.<br>
His hooked ears jutted out from underneat his black hair and his violet tunic was covered with dust.<br>
<br>
&quot;How are you doing master Marth?&quot; Pheonix's persausive voice broke the silence.<br>
<br>
Marth said nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well aren't you going to eat?&quot; Pheonix walked over to the quiet Marth.<br>
<br>
Marth still didn't talk... but opened his eyes and looked up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, playing the strong silent type today are we?&quot; Came Pheonix's mocking reply to the cold silence.<br>
<br>
Marth stood up to the best of his ability... staring Pheonix straight in the face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm? What is it?&quot; Grinned Pheonix.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate you. You will not get away with this!&quot; Marth stated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh... by the way. That prophetess is already transported. We only have a short while until she comes and we can make the sacrifice.&quot; Pheonix's eyes were filled with malice and a burning passion.<br>
<br>
Marth lunged forward, but was held back by the chains.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you doing this? Why are you going to sacrifice her to the evil one? WHY?!?!&quot; Marth's concerned yell was heard throughout the castle.<br>
<br>
&quot; becuase...&quot; Pheonix backed off and started pacing.<br>
<br>
&quot; 'a maiden of pure heart and mind... a healer and a prophetess... will be sacrificed to ressurect the most evil of evils. The power of the evil one will be betowed on the sacrificer and he will have abosoloute control' &quot; Pheonix quoted a passage from an old prophecy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you holding ME here?&quot; Marth questioned with a look of hatred across his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;becuase young man... i must have 'a young man, noble and wise, protector of what's right and defender of innocent peoples. A man with a bravery that surpasses all.' &quot; Pheonix quoted again.<br>
<br>
&quot;You won't use me!!!!&quot; Marth lunged again, trying to get at Pheonix.<br>
<br>
Pheonix laughed with all the cruelness and evil he possibly could, the walked out and shut the door behind him.<br>
<br>
Marth rested his back on the wall and slowly sunk back down until his was sitting.<br>
<br>
A look of sadness and of concern was written on his face as he looked down.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will die before he uses me... someone must warn the girl...&quot; He whispered.<br>
<br>
Pheonix walked down the stairwell holding his head high and proudly. <br>

&quot;Eevee!&quot; Marth happy voice called out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah yeah... need my help again?&quot; the ball of light said... <br>
the light dimmed to a sort of glow and a small young woman's figure was seen.<br>
She had a slendy body... and was about 2 inches tall.<br>
Her pink hair was in messy pig-tails and her lavender eyes glared at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;It took you long enough.&quot; Marth shook his head.<br>
<br>
Eevee sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine.. i'll help you. But only cuz i liked you.&quot; She shook her head as sheput her hands up and shot a sparkling beam at his shackles... which opened and Marth was free!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Marht rubbed his wrists... and Eevee beamed the door's keyhole and Marth opened it carefully...<br>
<br>
footsteps were heard.<br>
<br>
&quot;GO EEVEE! Meet me at the town of Ryuni&quot; He whipsered.<br>
<br>
&quot;why? why should i listen to you?&quot; She argued back.<br>
<br>
&quot;just GO!&quot; He glared at her.<br>

Then he rushed to where his bounds were and pout them around his wrists, not locking them or closing then, but making it appear that they were bounding him.<br>
<br>
He sat on the floor and waited... and a ghunein came barging through the door. <br>

&quot;Look at 'em go!&quot; Another shouted.<br>
<br>
Marth cringed.<br>
He didn't even wanna imagine what was going on.<br>
Stepping forward Marth opened the door slightly... but it creaked despite his efforts<br>
<br>
&quot;wots that?&quot; Someone asked... with a dizzy voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;dunno Laon... just get back 'ere or go ta bed.&quot; Yet another said.<br>

Marth sighed as he peeked through the small crack.<br>
<br>
A bunch of gaurds.... drunk.<br>
One was err... well. Stripping.<br>
<br>
Marth scrunched his eyes closed... the peeked out again... looking to the left this time.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's a hallway.&quot; He told himself as he slowly and surely opened the door... slipping down the hallways like a shadow in the darkest of caves.<br>
<br>
He came upon a doorway at the end and opened it... thinking it was the backdoor out. Boy he was surprised.<br>
<br>
Two ghunein and three gaurds were in that room partying.<br>
<br>
Marth stood right in the entrance and they all looked up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Agh! ESCAPED PRISONER!!!!&quot; One yelled and the ghunein hissed.<br>
<br>
Marth slammed the door and ran down the hallways... looking for  a weapon... any weapon.<br>
<br>
He heard the footsteps behind him and jumped as high as he could... onto a ledge... where there was two swords in a display.<br>

The ghuneins hissed and the two guards ran at him.<br>

He quickly dodged thier attacks and whacked them on the heads, knocking two out cold.<br>
<br>
THe ghunein came at him quickly, and he dodged to the side and sliced through one then jumped high in the air.<br>
<br>
<br>
He came down on the second ghunein, stabbing it through the head, then pulled the blade and and glared at the last ghunein, who was hissing at him beyr creepily.<br>

&quot;Hahah! Blasted little bastard...&quot; He mocked as he stood up proudly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You!!! Pay you willll!!!&quot; It screeched at him... it's pale skin now almost glowing... and it's huge black eyes buldging.<br>
<br>
It's needle-like fangs were dripping as it charged at Marth with an axe.<br>
<br>
Marth blocked the attack, struggling in power for a moment, then ducking and coming up behind the ghunein and stabbing it through the back.<br>
<br>
It sceeched and fell limp... black blood split all over the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's going on?&quot; Someone yelled from down the hallway.<br>
<br>
Marth ran, with the blades, and jumped on a ledge, where a window was.<br>
<br>
He looked out.... <br>
<br>
::long drop...:: he thought to himself... then looked over to see the gaurds staring up at him and yelling.<br>

He quickly swam to the other side... screams and hollers coming from the castle.<br>

<br>
&quot;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--------&quot;<br>
<br>
CRASH!!!<br>
<br>
The dragon collided intot he window, but transformed immediately into a human being as the glass shattered and hit the wall as a human woman, not causing much damage. The dragon's rider's scream was cut off as he collided into Phoenix, knocking him to the ground and landing on top of him.<br>
<br>
He was silver haire, silver eyed.  He was dressed in blue and white.  His figure was slender and feline-like, almost feminine.  After the initial shock of flying thorugh a window, the commander looked up at Phoenix and smiled ferally, giving him a once over look from his rather convenient point of view.<br>

&quot;Wonderful, dear.&quot;  He looked at the shattered window. Oh, fortune's fool, it had been a lovely stained glass window.  With a flick of his wrists, the window reassembled without a scratch.<br>

He looked to Phoenix, looking him up and down analytically.  He tossed the messy silver bangs from his eyes coolly, a hand on his slender, half bare hip.  &quot;Sorry for barging in.
