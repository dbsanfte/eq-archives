So supposidely this is an important deal here. Right?<br>

i believe in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all of humanity.  something that goes along with this is education.  there are many &quot;free&quot; democratic countries where the individuals don't know their rights.  you can grant all the freedoms in the world to a group of people but if they don't know and understand them they are useless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/18/03 9:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Political Question</span><hr size=1> I disagree DAG.  Many citizens in America don't know and understand their rights yet enjoy them all the same.  Peaceful assembly, freedom of press and speech, freedom of religion (look how many screw that idea up!) rights to bear arms, protection of copyright, patents and trademarks, truth in advertising or lending, credit disclosure, etc.<br>
<br>
We have tons of rights, not even many lawyers understand most of them (possibly only the supremes do!)  Understanding them does not prevent you from enjoying them. <p><br>

Look at nations like Japan that were re-established recently, or possessing similar resources.  It is self-limiting to associate it solely with population.  We have fewer historic policies to overcome (yet we are slowing down as we build up those same histories) and we in fact HAVE more rights than people in India.  We also have a more capitalistic free-market economy (not classically free, but certainly more so than others.) <p><br>

I see a difference between a religious country and government sponsored religion here in the US.  The religious countries are still political systems that need to function in the world regardless of whether they bring religion into it.  Our society functions without religion, and the only reason for government sponsored religion is for our politician's religious beliefs to be pushed on the public in violation of our constitution.  It is sometimes in our best interest on a secular level to provide aid to other countries regardless of their views (assuming their views don't lead to war or terror).  If we refuse aid just based on a country's religious preference, then we are sort of discriminating against their beliefs.  Refusing aid to churches here in the US doesn't matter so much because people can get aid from secular organizations.  If we were to tell the Muslim countries that they can't receive aid, then we would make them feel like they could only get help if we violated their culture.  Pulling aid because of human right's violations or terrorism is one thing, but pulling it because of their religion is another.  Regardless of what they practice, they are still an entity with people to feed and educate.  When it comes to Israel, this country wasn't put together for religious purposes.  This country was put together to protect a group of people from persecution.  They still have freedom of religion in that country despite being labeled a &quot;Jewish State&quot;.  They just need to retain Jewish majority because they are a democracy, and if too many non-Jews are voted in by the majority, then the people lose their protection and risk anything from persecution to another Holocaust.  Many of the Jews living there are totally secular and many are atheist.  This also goes for the politicians, and some of the politicians are Muslim Arabs.  A lot of people see this as a religious state, but no religious practice or belief is dictated from the government.  They just don't necessarily have SOCAS, but neither do the European nations.  Israel is high up on the aid list, but this benefits the US in that we have an ally in the Mid East and the education system over there helps to produce scientists and such that work with the US to further mankind's progress.  Egypt also receives a lot of US aid, and eventhough we get a lot of terrorists out of that country, the better we can make that country in terms of education and such, the less their problems will be thrown our way, not to mention great people come out of these oppressed countries when they are provided with the advancements that America offers.   Dictating that Egypt steer away from human rights violations is one thing, but dictating that they set up their laws just like our's hurts the Egyptians, and ultimately has a negative effect on the US.  Our laws apply within these borders alone, and the only time we have a right to tell people to change is when others are getting hurt.  If we pull funds from every country that lacks SOCAS, then we would stand alone.  JMO.<br>

I'm personally wish we weren't as deep into foreign aid as we are. We could use the aid here in the US. But then, I'll readily admit to having a slight isolationist attitude.

How can it be a true democracy if you're limiting who can play?

ITA with Kate here and I think this is the same as many issues and freedoms we may enjoy here that other countries don't. I don't think we can impose SOCAS on other countries, on the contrary, I think opening the economy and just exposing them to our freedoms will do more to help the movements toward freedom within. It's also not my place to tell those that prefer no separation that they can never have it. I think democracy is best, but hey--if a democratic country has citizens who wish to have church and state as one (as has been the case in most countries throughout history) I don't think the US has the right to step in.<br>
<br>
That said--I find it interesting how we are so much more threatened by certain church-state combos (I know the original poster said she wasn't distinguishing, but I think most Americans do it in their own minds). Greece, England, Mexico, Brazil....there are many places that have so little separation we would be appalled at the differences, but they are mostly xian so we don't notice or seem to mind as much. When I say &quot;we&quot; I mean most Americans, not necessarily those of us on this board.<br>

<br>
I do think you make a good point here, but the policies are a matter of survival.  It isn't about Arabs or Christians taking over and changing the &quot;essence&quot; of society, it is about preventing Jewish people from being slaughtered.  After 2,000 of persecution, slaughter, exile, forced conversion, etc., it was finally determined that the only way to stop it was to give this group of people a home.  The reason it is still considered a democracy is because the people there can still vote for who they want.  Even if all the Jews voted for an Arab PM, this Arab PM would be elected.  The reason that the Jews won't do this is because of fear, not discrimination.  Hitler was elected, but he changed Germany from a democracy to a dictatorship.  The Jewish people can't afford for this to happen again.  As for America, we do have the right to turn down people's immigration status.  If we had an influx of people from the Middle East come in, and they outnumbered everyone else, then I think it is safe to say that the US would halt immigration from these places for fear that they would elect someone like Arafat or Hussein as president.  Sometimes people need to step in if they feel threatened, and safety of citizens come first.  Israel is a democracy because everyone there can elect whoever they want, including the Arab population of that country.  There are Arab politicians there as well.  The prime mission of Israel is for the Jews to have their safe place, and if they feel that electing an Arab president is what is safe, then their democratic status allows it.  Every country has immigration laws, but that doesn't change the fact that the majority rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I think Israel should put some kind of safeguards in place such that *no one* is ever subjugated or violated or persecuted or whatever, but if they're going with the whole democracy thing they need to rethink what that means.&quot;<br>
<br>
By &quot;safeguards&quot; I am assuming you mean laws.  As history has shown us, a law is only as good as the dictator who decides to follow it.  If Arafat became PM of Israel, then these &quot;safeguards&quot; wouldn't do squat for the Jewish population.  <br>
<br>
Kate, I'm not referring to you here when I say this, but I am making a general comment towards people who have issues with a Jewish state or think it is a form of racism or apartheid.  There would be no Jewish state if it wasn't for all the people who have harmed Jews in the past.  Sure, you might have a few ultra-orthodox people who want one because of the bible, but the rest of the Jews and the non-Jews who support Israel do so for secular reasons.  People blame the Jews for Israel's creation, but the Jews were not the ones who asked to be treated the way they were.  The reason so many other races and religions have survived is because they had their own borders and military.  The reason Jews make up less than .25% of the world population is because they didn't have their own borders and military to protect them.  If it wasn't for other people's behavior, then we wouldn't be having this discussion because Israel wouldn't currently exist.  Everyone blames the Jewish people for Israel's creation, yet it is their very own ancestors that led to Israel's creation.  I'm not a religious person, so I wouldn't care less if there was a Jewish state if it wasn't for people's safety.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That said--I find it interesting how we are so much more threatened by certain church-state combos &quot;<br>
<br>
I think people are only afraid of the church-state combos that are threats to the rest of the world.  Most of the Christian countries coincidentally happen to be democracies, and people aren't afraid of democracies.  The Christian countries used to be a threat to people, and this ties in to my statement above about Jewish people were always in danger, but nowadays most are modern democracies, and people don't see that as a threat.  The reason the Muslim states come under fire is because a lot of them tend to have dictatorships and monarchies.  Turkey can be construed as a Muslim state, but people don't see them as a threat because they are a democracy.  Iraq scares people, not because they are a Muslim state, but because people fear their dictator.  So I don't think it is a matter of discrimination, but more of a fear of the types of governments some of these places have.  I hope I made sense there.  <br>
<br>
&quot;if a democratic country has citizens who wish to have church and state as one (as has been the case in most countries throughout history) I don't think the US has the right to step in.&quot;<br>
<br>
I totally agree.  If Israel wants to be a Jewish state and Turkey wants to be a Muslim state, then we have no right to step in or try and undermine their democratic process.  I can't speak for Turkey, but I do know that a lot of Israelis are trying to push back the religious part by doing things such as keeping more public places open on the Sabbath, etc.  However, this is something they need to deal with internally, and it is none of our business.  It is their constituents that are putting pressure on politicians to do these things, and that is the democratic process at work.<br>

Go ahead and include me, because I do think the Jewish state as it stands is very similar to apartheid.  It doesn't matter that in the past people went through horrendous repression, that doesn't mean they have the right to inflict that on someone else... and I'm sure the whites in South Africa felt very similar about not letting too many blacks have any standing in their government, because they might change things too much from what they wanted.<br>

Turkey likes to pretend it's a democracy, but it isn't.. it's a military-backed gov't, which if it doesn't like the results it gets from its people, changes the rules of the game.  The vast majority of the people want a different lifestyle, but they are forced into living the way the military has decided it wants things.  I have a close friend who is Turkish, married to an American, and her daughter was refused Turkish citizenship because they spelled her name differently than what is allowed.<br>

It was 1987.  At a lecture the other day they were playing an old news video of Lt.Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the Reagan Administration.  There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree, but what he said was stunning!  He was being drilled by a senator; &quot;Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ollie replied, &quot;Yes, I did, Sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, &quot;Isn't that just a little excessive?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, sir,&quot; continued Ollie.<br>
<br>
&quot;No? And why not?&quot; the senator asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because the lives of my family and I were threatened, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Threatened? By whom?&quot; the senator questioned.<br>
<br>
&quot;By a terrorist, sir&quot; Ollie answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;His name is Osama bin Laden, sir&quot; Ollie replied.<br>
<br>
At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued. &quot;Why are you so afraid of this man?&quot; the senator asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because, sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of&quot;, Ollie answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what do you recommend we do about him?&quot; asked the senator.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sir, if it was up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.&quot;<br>

The senator disagreed with this approach, and that was all that was shown of the clip.  By the way, that senator was Al Gore.<br>

What's wrong with this picture??&quot;<br>
<br>
The Arab citizens aren't getting oppressed.  They have more freedom than any other place in the Arab world, and all the same freedoms as the Jewish citizens.  Just because they are the minority, it doesn't mean that they aren't part of the democratic process.  Every Arab that remained within Israel's borders after the war of independence got full citizenship along with the Jews. <br>
<br>
&quot;.. it's a great idea, making inhospitable landscapes a lush paradise, but unleash it in an area where there are already people living and it's a recipe for disaster.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just because they lived there doesn't mean that they had claims to the land.  There has never ever been such thing as a country called Palestine.  The Romans named the land Palestine to destroy all traces of Judaism, and the &quot;Palestinians&quot; plopped some tents down on the land and named themselves after it.  Before WWI the land had been being run by the Ottoman Empire for several hundred years, and then it was handed over to England in a fiduciary capacity until it could be divvied up between the Jewish and Arab states.  There have always been small pockets of Jews living on the land since the fall of Judea, and it was the 1880's when the Jews started immigrating back in large numbers to escape persecution.  The land was a sparsely populated wasteland, and the Palestinians were living in tents and makeshift homes.  When the Jews showed up they brought civilization, and more Arabs started immigrating to that area because they could make more money working for the Jews than their Arab counterparts.  The only reason the Arab population was so high in 1948 was because so many had come there in the past to work for the Jews.  Then they had the nerve to say it was their land.  When it came to the Arabs living there in 1948, the Jews didn't tell anyone to leave.  The Arab countries came in and told many of the Arabs to leave temporarily so they could come in and wipe out the Jews without them getting in the way.  When they failed to take over the land, the Arab countries left those people in refugee camps where they sit until this day.  All the Arabs who stayed got full citizenship of Israel with all the rights associated with it.  If the Arabs in the territories would behave like the Arab-Israeli citizens, then they would have the same rights as the citizens, but without the voting priveleges.  US territories don't vote for our president, so we shouldn't demand that Israeli territories vote for an Israeli PM.  <br>
 <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes there are, but they are penalized or ejected by the gov't if they say the &quot;wrong things&quot; or if they speak too strongly in favor of Palestinians.&quot;<br>
<br>
They get ejected when they speak strongly in favor of terrorism.  They do not get ejected when speaking up for the Arab population within Israel, or if they just merely voice opinions on how the terrorism is being handled.  Even Jewish politicians have spoken up and gotten angry if they feel the IDF has gone too far in the territories.  I've seen the quotes from both sides, and I have also seen the quotes that have gotten some of these Arab politicians into trouble.  When the Arab politicians pushed for bilingual street signs in Tel Aviv (Hebrew and Arabic), they didn't get booted.  Instead they got their way.  The Jewish politicians agreed that it would make it easier for the Arab citizens, and they wanted to cater to that. <br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't mean just laws.. I mean whatever safeguards need to be in place, until things calm down (maybe over generations who knows?). But the essence of democracy must be there for all the people, not just those with the right religious views.&quot;<br>
<br>
These safeguards would be trashed if the wrong person was elected.  Also, the Jewish population does not all share the same religious views.  They range from Orthodox to Atheist.  As for the non-Jewish population, they have a right to their views as well.  Israel is the only leader that has ever allowed all three monotheistic faiths to freely worship in the Holy Land.  The Muslims, Christians, etc have democratic rights.  They vote, they have freedom of speech, freedom of religion and many of the other same freedoms we have here in America.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go ahead and include me, because I do think the Jewish state as it stands is very similar to apartheid. It doesn't matter that in the past people went through horrendous repression, that doesn't mean they have the right to inflict that on someone else... and I'm sure the whites in South Africa felt very similar about not letting too many blacks have any standing in their government, because they might change things too much from what they wanted.&quot;<br>
<br>
It DOES matter that people had oppression in the past.  Do we just forget history and allow it to repeat itself?  The problem needed to be fixed instead of continuing on the way it was.  They are also not inflicting this on their minorities.  The problem isn't with the Arabs within Israel, it is with the Arabs in the territories that don't fall under Israeli citizenship status.  Israel is not oppressing them for the fun of it.  Israel is dealing with the problem of terrorism.  When Israel took over the territories they built 4 universities for the Palestinians, they gave them modern amenities such as utilities because as of 1967 a majority of the people didn't have them, they gave many of them jobs that pay better than anywhere else in the Arab world, and they allowed them to live freely unlike the other Arab states.  When the terrorism got out of hand, Israel had to step in and do something about it.  I don't agree with a lot of Israel's tactics, and that is where you and I are in agreement, but the terrorists are the ones who brought this onto the population to begin with.  No terrorism=no oppression.  The comparison of Israel to South Africa or the nazis was a creation by propogandists.  The people in South Africa and nazi Germany didn't bring this on themselves.<br>

It is not appropriate to try and compare how they live in Israel with how they would be living in other Arab countries -- Israel is claiming to be a democracy, to be the bastion for civilization and human rights in the region.  If they make this claim, then they have more to live up to.  <br>

Blah blah blah.. This little tidbit is always dragged out, but it's moot (in my opinion).  So is &quot;we won the land in war fair and square so it's ours&quot;.  I thought we as human beings had moved beyond this whole mode of thinking.  There are people living there, who have been for generations.  They haven't been absorbed into other countries, so unless you're going to come up with some sort of forced evacuation plan, you have to deal with them being there.. and they are human beings, they deserve some sort of basic level of consideration, again if you're claiming to be this great &quot;Western-style&quot; democracy.<br>

I've read so many histories of Israel/Palestine, who lived where when, who was a country and who wasn't, who got pushed off first, etc. etc. there are as many differences of opinion as there are books about it... but it's all pointless.  We need to stop living in the past, and look at this situation for what it is -- a lot of people living in an area who need to figure out a way to live together, prosper and get along.<br>

Okay, you only read the first line of my post.  I meant that it doesn't justify oppressing somebody else.  Obviously we never want to forget history, so we won't repeat our mistakes.  Here we've made such a strong attachment to history, we're repeating it and don't even realize it.<br>

I hope that would be true.. but judging from Human Rights reports in the area, I can't be confident it would be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luvthatdyl>LuvThatDyl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/20/03 6:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  political question</span><hr size=1> &quot;It is not appropriate to try and compare how they live in Israel with how they would be living in other Arab countries -- Israel is claiming to be a democracy, to be the bastion for civilization and human rights in the region. If they make this claim, then they have more to live up to.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is appropriate because the very nations that are outspoken about Israel's treatment of Arabs are a heck of a lot worse.  They are hypocrites.  The so-called facts regarding this whole issue are coming out of these very nations.  Yes, Israel does have more to live up to than their neighbors, but why should they have more to live up to than all the other democracies in the world?  Sure, every nation should constantly strive to better themselves, but if Israel is anything less than perfect, then everyone jumps all over them in order to please Israel's oil-holding neighbors.  On the evening of 9/11/01 did you see one single nation stand up to the US and remind them to &quot;show restraint&quot;?  When countries questioned the US's treatment of the terrorist suspect, did they start looking into our internal matters and telling us what we should be doing in various neighborhoods with our various citizens?  Israel is no less civilized than any other democracy, but they are constantly under the microscope like they are some sort of nuisance to society.<br>
<br>
&quot;Israeli Arabs may have &quot;full citizenship&quot; but they are not equal citizens.&quot;<br>
<br>
They are equal citizens.  The link you provided me could have had been easily mistaken for an article describing minorities in any democratic country, including the US.  Israel has the same problems as the US when it comes to minority relations.  If the US screws up and skips fixing up an African-American neighborhood, then that doesn't mean the US has lost its democratic status or that the people of that neighborhood all of a sudden lose citizenship status.  It just means that they need to work harder on meeting everyone's needs.  How come when America does it they just need to fix things, but when Israel does it they are compared to nazis or South Africa?  Israel has a lot of problems to fix, I'll agree with that, but it seems that they are being held to a higher standard than any other nation on this planet.  If they aren't the perfect wonderland where their minorities are concerned or they don't sit by and allow people to throw grenades into their preschools, then they aren't worthy of existence.  Israel knows they have internal problems, and the people there are on the road to gradually fixing them.  Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was Israel.  At least they are working towards fixing these problems, so they are on the right track. <br>
<br>
&quot;Blah blah blah.. This little tidbit is always dragged out, but it's moot (in my opinion). So is &quot;we won the land in war fair and square so it's ours&quot;. I thought we as human beings had moved beyond this whole mode of thinking. There are people living there, who have been for generations. They haven't been absorbed into other countries, so unless you're going to come up with some sort of forced evacuation plan, you have to deal with them being there.. and they are human beings, they deserve some sort of basic level of consideration, again if you're claiming to be this great &quot;Western-style&quot; democracy.&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all Kate, I like you and respect you, and I try to show you the common courtesy of not referring to your statements as &quot;blah blah blah&quot;.  The fact that the Palestinians never had claims to this land is a very valid point.  It isn't like the situation with the Native Americans where they were living all over this land that nobody else owned, and then were slaughtered.  There has always been ownership of that land since the Palestinians have been there, and their name was never on the deed, so to speak.  If the Native Americans showed up after the colonists, then the story would have a whole different twist.  They also are being treated as human beings, more so by the Israeli government than any other government that claims to care about them.  Since when did &quot;nonhumans&quot; gain the right to vote?  Israel had every excuse in the world as to why they could have forced their Arab citizens into exile, or why they could have gotten away with killing many of them.  Instead they allowed them to stay and live among the Jewish citizens.  The Arab population just moved from government to government, but the ones who chose to stay got to do so.  Yes, there are problems being the minority like with the US, but their citizens also have the option to control their own destiny like with the US.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I guess I was thinking more internationally, such that the safeguards couldn't be so easily overturned.. International monitoring, an international presence, whatever it would take.. &quot;<br>
<br>
This has been tried, and it has failed.  It failed in the 1920's when Great Britain reneged on their treaty and issued the White Papers that restricted Jewish immigration to the very land they were promised.  It failed when Great Britain took 4/5 of the land promised to Israel in the treaty and turned it over to the Arabs in order to form Jordan.  It failed in 1967 when all the countries who promised to protect Israel turned the other way when several Arab countries publicly announced that they were moving into attack.  The US didn't step up until after the 1967 war because they realized how strong Israel was on their own, and they wanted a strong and powerful ally.  Before then, the US couldn't care less about Israel.  The reason Israel can't rely on others as a safeguard is because they have all failed the trust test.  Israel has discovered that they can only rely on themselves, and then just hope that others can come to back them up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, you only read the first line of my post. I meant that it doesn't justify oppressing somebody else. Obviously we never want to forget history, so we won't repeat our mistakes. Here we've made such a strong attachment to history, we're repeating it and don't even realize it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree that there is no justification for oppression.  However oppression will be the end result when someone is put into a position to possibly defend themselves.  If everyone in your neighborhood started committing crimes on a regular basis, then that would require larger police presence.  The constant intervention by the police to prevent more crimes and the shootouts with criminals in the middle of your street that cause stray bullets to fly into living rooms would be characterized as oppression by the residents in your neighborhood.  The people who are the most outspoken against the police are the ones who are always getting into trouble with them.  Usually the response to these people by the public is &quot;stop breaking the law&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope that would be true.. but judging from Human Rights reports in the area, I can't be confident it would be.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Human Rights reports have nailed both sides.  I'm not arguing that there are no violations by the Israeli soldiers.  I think it is wrong to punish a family for something their relative did by bulldozing their house and leaving them homeless.  I am not afraid to admit that here, and this is one of many things that Israel needs to stop.  I understand why they are doing it, but it doesn't make it okay.  But it wouldn't be happening if the terrorism didn't exist, and it doesn't happen to the Arab-Israeli citizens because they are rarely the ones committing acts of terror.  The IDF didn't have such a strong presence in the territories until the intifada started in 2000.  The territories were under PA rule.  When the terrorism gets bad, the IDF increases its presence.  When the terrorism hits a lull, then the troops start to pull out of these areas.  You would think common sense would prevail for the terrorists who live in these territories, and it is common sense for many of the Palestinians living in these territories because the terrorism approval rating has dropped significantly lately.   Israel has already proved that when terrorism lessens, then so does their presence.<br>
