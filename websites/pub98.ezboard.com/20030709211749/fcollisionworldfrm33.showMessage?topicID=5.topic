Continued from Streets . . .<br>
<br>
Nina burst through the Hospital's emerency doors with an unconcious Zil slung over her shoulder, ignoring the stares she recieved due to her disruptful presence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss, you can't come in here this way! You'll have to turn into the front office first!&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned to glare at the frightened official, wordlessly she set down her bounty on a stretcher parked in the dimly-lit hallway and tossed aside her coat from what she had used it to conceal . . . Nemesis' tentacles writhed slightly before falling limp again, curling around Zil's body in a wounded fashion.<br>
<br>
&quot;You want me to take THAT to the front office as well?&quot; she retorted, fanged teeth glinting in anger.<br>
<br>
The ward clasped a hand to his mouth and gagged, &quot;I'll . . . see what I can do . . .&quot; as he hurriedly walked off in the opposite direction, whether to get away from the revolting sight or from the enraged woman one cannot say . . .<br>
<br>
Nina sighed heavily, eyebrow twitching in annoyance. This wasn't suppose to happen . . . he said he wanted her alive . . .<br>
<br>
Shaking her trenchcoat free of goodness-knows-what, she wandered off down the hall to find something that could wash a bloodstain out . . . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zil15>Z I L 15</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/12/03 6:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: An unexpected divergence . . .</span><hr size=1> Zil's eyes quickly snap open as she shakes off another horrid nightmare.  <br>
Her senses quickly return to her and she bolts upright.  Where the hell was she??<br>
She looks around the room:  monitors, stretchers...<br>
'Oh good God, no!' She thinks.  <br>
She glances around and, spotting her discarded trench coat on a chair nearby, she rips the IVs and needles out of her skin.  <br>
She winces a little in pain, but it's nothing compared to what she's used to.  She hears the annoying and loud monotone beep of the heart monitor next to her.<br>
&quot;Dammit!&quot; She curses and quickly pulls the machine's plug out of the wall.<br>
Hearing the door behind her open, she quickly grabs a gun from her trench coat and points it at the head of the unsuspecting nurse.<br>
&quot;Leave.  Everything here is fine.  And if you so much as look as a secuirty guard funny, you'll have at least 50 bullets in your head.  So I say again: Leave.&quot;  <br>
The nurse swallows hard then nods her head and leaves, closing the door behind her.  <br>
Zil sighs and glances at her wounds.  Nemesis had just retracted under her skin.  She looked like herself again...for now.  But it would only be a matter of time until she transformed again...<br>
Sighing, Zil tossed on her trench coat and prepared to leave the hospital... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fearixbloodlust>Fearix Bloodlust</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/12/03 7:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE: An unexpected divergence . . .</span><hr size=1> As Zil turns to the window for a possible escape, she finds herself falling to the ground in cover from the the window shattering above her, glass slightly piercing against her skin. With a heavy thud from his metal boots, Fearix lands perfectly crouched down in front of Zil.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss me?&quot; Fearix says with a slight smirk on his face. Zil rolls her eyes, and pushes him over. Fearix grunts and pushes himself up off the ground. &quot;The hell's your problem?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You try being knocked unconscious and waking up with various tubes sticking into you,&quot; Zil replies in an angry tone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't say that I haven't.&quot; Fearix quickly scans the room to take in his surroundings completely. The room was your average hospital room for one person to stay in, but by the looks of the blood and ripped IVs on the ground, the room hadn't been enough to sustain Zil's stay. &quot;Do I want to know what's going on?&quot; <p>They'll never see <br>

<br>
Nina was on her way back from the soda machine, finally giving up on her soiled coat. She sipped tentatively at the drink, surveying the bustling hospital scene.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, she sensed something . . . or more so, the katana she had lay upon a nearby sofa. It gave off the minimalist vibration and, upon unsheathing it halfway, the blade glowed a dull blue.<br>
<br>
Rarely did she understand why her faithful weapon acted that way, usually it meant that a foreign magick was in its presence.<br>
<br>
Narrowing her eyes, she clasped the sword to her hip and strode for the wing that orderly had indicated to her.<br>
<br>
She'd be damned if her prize bounty was in the midst of an escape . . . <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninainhertz>Nina Inhertz</A> at: 3/12/03 9:15:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fearixbloodlust>Fearix Bloodlust</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/12/03 9:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE: An unexpected divergence . . .</span><hr size=1> &quot;What is it, Fearix?&quot; Zil asks, noticing Fearix's ears twitching.<br>

 However, Fearix and Zil weren't ones to easily let their guard down . . .<br>

You want the bounty on her head?&quot; Fearix asks confused. From what he had recalled, both Zil, himself, and the rest of their crew all had bounties on their head, mainly placed by the ever so clever Umbrella. Ever since his father's murders of thousands in the past year had given him the title of a bounty as soon as everyone found out he was to inherit the world of death where his father already had his monarchy. Zil had left their group of runaway bounties, but any new information on the complicated incorporation, Fearix would go out of the way to find Zil and let her know. &quot;You don't even know the price on m-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fearix, I think that's enough,&quot; Zil says a bit loudly and with a slightly irritated voice. Fearix just continues to hold his fighting stance, the scent of blood passing by his nostrils, the cravings becoming worse. He is in a hospital.... Never the less, fresh meat still stood before him, providing she attacked Zil. Fearix watches the woman who claims herself to be a world-known bounty huntress through the dark, seeing every detail of her and the room through his glaring red eyes. <p>They'll never see <br>

She tentatively carressed the sword that lay on her lap. Its dull blue glow had intensified into a more pristine color. Clearly it yearned for blood. &quot;I figure I'll take things in short strides.

((Little bitch...)) I sniffed the air carefully, pinpointing Fearix's scent along with Zil's. Everyone stopped and stared at me. My six wings flexed uneasily and my red eye twitched in annoyance. ((To think, I used to be human like them... @#%$ Umbrella...)) A nurse appraoched me wearily and scared as hell. <br>
<br>
&quot;Pl-please-&quot; I leaned foreward to her and cocked a brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;You got something to say?&quot; I revealed my fangs as her eyes widened. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're just like the one that came in earlier!&quot; ((What?)) I grabbed my glaive and extended it, pinning her to a wall.<br>
<br>
&quot;Which room?&quot; She babbled out the room number in a panic as I glanced about the signs. I pulled the glaive away and nodded my thanks. The pale nurse slid down and fainted as I started down the hall. ((detour.)) I headed to the blood bank, storming past the other doctors and nurses. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're not allow-&quot; I turned my head to him and growled as he ran off. ((Moron.)) I pulled on the handle. ((locked.)) I opened my mouth as an acidic venom came from my throat and melted the lock. I pushed the door open and grabbed seven blood bags, turned and headed towards the room while draining 3 of them. I stashed the rest on my belt as I hoisted up my glaive to a defensive position. ((Hope they didn't miss me too much.)) I casually came into the room, my two front wings shielding my body as Zil shot twice. The bullets clanked off my metal-like feathers but I kept my gaze on the sorceress. I pulled my wings back after Zil faced the sorceress again. I revealed my mystical looking glaive and held it tightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't mean to crash the party.

He smells the faint scent of blood on her breathe, even from his distance of the room, and soon notices the blood packs on her waist, inticing his hunger even more. Fearix slightly licks one white fang, but quickly draws back, realizing the seriousness of the situation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, Hammy,&quot; Fearix mutters under his breath. Hotaru growls, a vein almost popping out of her forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT did you call me?!&quot; Hotaru grunts out, then places her hands on her hips. &quot;By the way, thanks for ditching me while I was unconscious.&quot;<br>

Although the new prescence of another of their kind might complicate things, she retained her nonchalant attitude and continued staring at the ceiling until the two concluded their pleasant reunion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who sent you,&quot; Zil repeats her question.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well. for one thing, I wouldn't lend my services to this pansy-assed Umbrella corporation . . . honestly . . .&quot; She pauses, trying to remember exactly who had inquired of her services, &quot;It was this dark warehouse where some guy had some of his lackeys jump me . . . sort of his own twisted way of deciding whether I'd be good enough . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What did he look like at least?&quot; Zil pressed impaitently.<br>
<br>
Nina paused for dramatics, much to their annoyance, &quot;I'd say medium build, dark black hair, brown eyes . . . small scar under his left eye, barely noticable . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Zil blinked, arching an eyebrow in mild interest. &quot;Was his name . . . Reiben . . .?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nina studied Zil's expression, which was almost hopeful in a sense. But she was suddenly overwhelmed with boredom and sitting all this time on the bed had made her legs stiff. she suddenly grinned with malevolent intent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not telling!&quot; She exclaimed with a snicker. And with those seemingly random words she flung herself out the window. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zil15>Z I L 15</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/19/03 1:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ZzzzZZzzzZZzz . . .

As soon as Zil reaches the ground she begins the chase after Nina.  <br>

Let's all jump out the window at random!!</span><hr size=1> Fearix just stares at the window with a blank face, and shakes his head in annoyance. It had been so childish, first starting with the sorceress, followed by an Umbrella Experiment, followed by an Angel all jumping out the window for fun. With a heavy sigh, Fearix too perches himself on the window, and falls out face first, feeling the wind on his bare chest as the bat wings emerge from under his trench coat. Instead of following the motley crew, Fearix flies up towards the top of the buildings as his trench coat falls to the ground somewhere.... Most likely on top of Hotaru's head, just to make everything convenient. Fearix finds himself landing on top of a building nearby, the night air filling his lungs as he looks down at the crew below him, keeping a close eye on Ms. Nina. Hotaru senses his presence, and looks straight up to have Fearix give her a slight wave. Hotaru holds up Fearix's trench coat and gives him the finger. (Classic!)<br>
<br>
-Okay, I might roleplay as Savaric really soon, just for kicks cause he's wicked powerful and evil, but right now I'm in vampire mode, so we'll see ^^- <p>They'll never see <br>
I'll never be<br>
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger<br>
Burning deep inside of me<br>
<br>
But through my tears breaks a blinding light<br>
Birthing a dawn to this endless night<br>
Arms outstretched, awaiting me<br>
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree<br>
