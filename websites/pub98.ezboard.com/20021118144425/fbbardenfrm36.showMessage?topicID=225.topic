It's a 501-type of error, by the way. When I try to go to Yahoo! again, it does come up.

You either use GET or POST. For example...<br>
<br>
GET /index.html HTTP/1.0<br>
<br>
would return the index.html file to the browser for parsing.<br>
<br>
For some reason the browser is attempting to POST data to the Yahoo site instead of GETting it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>     <br>
Not implemented 501:<br>
This error occurs when for example, you have pressed the submit button on a form. The server replys with this error message because it dosen't support the feature that you have requested. This is not a real common error, but typically occurs when new features or forms are implemented. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sounds weird, not heard of that happening before (as it says it is a less common error message). I would imagine it is something to do with the yahoo site rather than your machine or possibly the method you are using to get to the site.<br>
<br>
What URL are you using to access the site? (e.g. www.yahoo.com/bleh/)<br>
<br>

<br>
I ask this because the link on the ikonboard may be malformed and trying to send data to the server instead of getting data from the server. If that is the case you should inform the ikonboard admin and ask them to ammend that specific URL link.<br>

<br>
Basically a 501 error is a very wide ranged error message. Basically it means that something went wrong server side and as a result the page hasn't loaded. These are commonly due to the inappropriate use of various http methods such as GET, PUT, DELETE, POST and HEAD for example. However in this case it can't be client side, because you are simply asking to browse to the yahoo site.<br>
<br>
I was racking my brain and I remember when I used to code a lot of perl CGI scripts for my website. If there were any errors in the code I would get a 501 error.<br>
<br>
So, I think that this, as I said before, is a problem with one of the server side scripts on the yahoo site. It is possible that it is a cookie problem (if you have a yahoo ID it may be having trouble logging you on with your cookie for example), so clearing your cookies and then logging in to the site again may be beneficial.<br>
<br>

<br>
Usually when you go to www.yahoo.com directly the referrer will be www.yahoo.com. Maybe for some reason ikonboard is messing that up, and as a result the yahoo server side script is dieing. <br>
<br>
That also, might account for it being OK second time round. Just a thought :P<br>

<br>
Something must have gonna AWOL server side, don't worry it isn't anything that you've done.<br>
<br>
It was working the other day when I visited it so someone must have been playing around with the server side scripts and changed something somewhere.<br>
