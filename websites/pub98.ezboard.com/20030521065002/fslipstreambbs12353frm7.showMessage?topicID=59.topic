It's a sad thing when an episode can be praised for simply being passable, but that's where we are. This episode has some bright moments, and it is passable. In that, it's a huge improvement over much of the season. What we have here is an old-fashioned &quot;Who Done It?&quot;, with a few twists. In this case, the victim is a brand new Commonwealth starship. Flying in the Maru, a selection of our heroes attempt to uncover the culprit for this disaster. In the meantime, Dylan and Tyr swoon for a girl and have trouble walking around without embarassment, while Beka puts up with it all. But the best part of this episode is the close, and not simply because it is over. There's a lot of dippiness to get to that good part though, so bear with me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Opening quote:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The universe is bound in equal parts by arrogance and altruism. Any attempt to alter this would be suicide.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
It'd be nice if the opening quotes had something to do with this episode. A more appropriate quote considering Tyr and Dylan in this episode: &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Do not allow yourself to be led around by your forcelance. You may not like where it takes you.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
The episode opens with Dylan, Tyr, and Beka on the Eureka Maru. Tyr is amused by Dylan polishing his boots, for a ceremony launching a new Commonwealth ship, the Dewey Sunshine. And why are they conducting this ceremony via the Maru? The writers needed to come up with a lame excuse to get them off the powerful warship, and boy is it lame.<br>
<br>
Dylan: To tell you the truth, I would like to have arrived on the Andromeda. But thanks to Mister Harper's improvements in the airscrubbers and the waste extraction, we're stuck here in this bag of bolts.<br>
Beka (via intercom): I heard that.<br>
Dylan (correcting): Lovable bag of bolts.<br>
<br>
Cute exchange, but an extremely flimsy premise to get them into a situation where they're helpless. It's taken me a long time, but I've finally figured out that the Maru is being used the way shuttlecraft were used on Voyager. They trap a handful of crew members on a shuttlecraft, which was away from the mothership for some dumb reason, and then hijinks ensue. At least that was the idea, it never worked well on Voyager, either. <br>
<br>
What an insult this is to Harper, the man who has saved the day on repeated occasions with his technological skill, driving back tunnel aliens, giving Rommie a marvelous avatar, and so on. And we're expected to believe he's a worthless screwup? Come on, he deserves better. Worse, they never even attempt to contact Andromeda to come save their butts. What sort of communications are they using, smoke signals?<br>
<br>
Beka: Dylan, Tyr. Cockpit, now.<br>
<br>
Cool, when they're on HER ship, Beka is the boss, flunkies report to the bridge! I love it.<br>
<br>
There are some Nietzchian fighters en route to the rendezvous, it is emphasized they are of a particularly mean variety of Nietzchians. Uh, as opposed to what, vegetarian Nietzchians? We get it.<br>
<br>
They arrive at the rendezvous, the new ship is just floating in deep space. This is an odd way to launch a new ship, did someone other than Dylan already break the champagne bottle across the bow? Dylan and company report to the other captain that they may be in danger of a Nietzchian saboteur.<br>
<br>
If you'll recall the theme of recent episodes like <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Unconquerable Man,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it must be continually reenforced that not only is Dylan Hunt a great starship captain, but that all others they come across are incompetant boobs and idiots. This is intended to build up the hero by showing how he's not like those other rejects. This week, we meet the latest example.<br>
<br>
Crimson captain: Captain, the concept of genetically-distinct prides is considered... pre-commonwealth. On my ship, I recognize merit. A quality summed up by the reformed high guard's new motto, &quot;We are a force of merit.&quot;<br>
Beka (incredulous): This guy's toast.<br>
Dylan: Captain Grissom, right now, there are five Kenja fighters on course for your ship. I'm afraid they don't share your enlightened views.<br>
<br>
Now I'm not sure what this is supposed to ridicule. Should you prejudge people by their ethnic group, and assume they are criminals before they do anything? That's the &quot;good&quot; view being pushed by the writers here, it's the view the heroes adopt. Why is the other captain &quot;wrong&quot; for assuming the new Commonwealth should be for all, not just those deemed to be &quot;right&quot;. And who determines what people are the right people? Not a good set of questions to raise. If they wanted to show the new captain (who looks like Doctor Bashir from DS9) was out of his league, there were plenty of other ways.<br>
<br>
Just by the other captain's sheer incompetence, the Dewey Sunshine suffers a series of catastrophic failures. The captain just has time to order everyone to their escape pods, before it goes kaboom, using the same breaking effect they showed us a dozen times in last week's episode (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The A$$ Backwards</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->). From the speed at which it blew up, it's a wonder anyone managed to eject, or that the escape pods could survive such an explosion.<br>
<br>
After the commercial break, we engage in one of the most innovative sequences I've seen in science fiction. There are hundreds of escape pods, possibly 400 of them according to Dylan. The next few minutes are spent detailing them bringing these people onto the Maru. It appears the pods were not made of enough mesh, budget cutting and all that. The pods are leaking air and occasionally blow up, causing an interesting hazard for the rest of the episode. Since they can't fit all of these people onto the Maru, they take whom they can and have the rest of the pods latch together in some sort of storage system. The pods form latched rings around the Maru, sort of like a LEGO set. It's a very innovative idea, and shows some thought went into the background technology of this episode. Kudos to the writers.<br>
<br>
Things get pretty crowded on the Maru, and our heroes are accosted by a senator who was on the ship. She is terribly cloying, but fortunately we don't spend the whole episode with her. (But she's obviously suspect number one from the moment she steps on board.)<br>
<br>
Cloying Senator:  Oh, how they fought like hungry rats, at all the escape-pod stations. The looting, the thieving, but I owed a duty to my Commonwealth.<br>
<br>
What? The captain ordered everyone to their escape pods. And then .25 microseconds later, the ship blew up. Exactly how much time did these people have to start looting and thieving? To me it looks like you'd have been pretty lucky to dive headlong into the escape pod and close the door before the ship blew up. Now if it had taken the ship 8 hours or so to break up, then her dialogue might make sense. It doesn't!<br>
<br>
Dylan: Well, then it's lucky you were able to make it onto the first escape pod, senator.<br>
Cloying Senator: (laughs) Well yes. I guess the grim reaper felt that I still had more to do for my citizens.<br>
Tyr (to Beka): Even the grim reaper didn't want her.<br>
<br>
The senator shares with Dylan her theory that the Nietzchians sabotaged the ship, she plans to have them outlawed in the new Commonwealth. There's a cute scene where Tyr comes over and glares at her, but let's think about this. Wasn't this the same assumption Dylan had? Ah, so I guess it took seeing the senator's prejudice firsthand in order for Dylan to question his own. <br>
<br>
More survivors come on board, and Beka leads Dylan away to talk to him. All talk is centered around slipstreaming out of there and rendezvousing with the Andromeda. This sort of tunnel vision might have made sense in the writers' minds, the rest of us might wonder why they couldn't simply signal the Andromeda and have it fly there to meet them and blow up any adversaries. (This is never answered, it's always assumed the Maru must travel to the Andromeda, not vice versa.)<br>
<br>
Beka: Excuse me, excuse me, captain comin' through.<br>
<br>
That's right, she's in charge, so get out of her way. And we arrive at yet another catch, the added escape pods prevents the ship from slipstreaming. (This is fudged later.) But Tyr has new information, an analysis of the explosion shows it most likely to be sabotage. And one of the saboteurs may be on the ship! (Da da da, it's Murder on the Orient Express.)<br>
<br>
For some reason the senator is on the bridge, she whines about saving more people and how untrustworthy Nietzchians are.  Well, at least she's an accurate depiction of a senator.<br>
<br>
Tyr: I've prepared an airlock for you, madame.<br>
<br>
Cute! It's too bad they never got around to that.<br>
<br>
Beka: Dylan, Tyr! Engine room, now!<br>
<br>
There's a little fight brewing, the Nietzchians and the &quot;Kludges&quot; (the Nietzchian's own word) are blaming each other for the disaster. Tyr and Dylan decide to break things up, Tyr shouts &quot;Captain on deck!&quot;. Huh? The captain was already on deck, Beka was holding back the participants. I've posted three separate occasions that reenforced the obvious, that Beka is the captain of the Maru, she's in charge. Yet with this line Tyr throws that all away. Dylan and Tyr should have emphasized how Beka is the captain, and everyone must do what she says. But sadly, Tyr was apparently referring to Dylan arriving on the scene. -sigh- It's hard to praise the bright points in an episode when they are nullified by other lines in the same episode.<br>
<br>
Considering the troubles this season has had showing extras, it's nice to see the extras adequately staffed to show a bunch of survivors crowded onto this ship. This isn't something you'd notice on another series, but again, remember what I said earlier. This episode gets praise for being passable. Another pod is brought on board, with the first officer. As soon as Dylan sees her, his interest level is raised to full attention. (Aiming for subtlety here.)<br>
<br>
Erin and Tyr go into an empty shuttle bay to search for a leaking pod. Um, wasn't space at a premium? Why is this area empty of people?  First Officer Erin has a very unusual outfit for a first officer, did Rhade wear anything like this? It's nice to know that women's outfits are slutty and non-functional in the future, wouldn't want them to be in practical uniforms, would we? Erin tells Tyr she will &quot;take point&quot;, and moves ahead of him.<br>
<br>
Dylan is looking around for anyone who looks suspicious, which usually works on this show, but finds no likely suspects. Beka has some advice.<br>
<br>
Beka: Nietzchian first officers have been known to betray a captain.<br>
<br>
We return to Erin and Tyr, Tyr is opening portholes, as Erin follows behind scanning each one for problems. Um, then what was that dialogue about her &quot;taking point&quot;? That's the problem with a lot of dialogue on this show, it's often meaningless and contradictory.<br>
<br>
The Nietzchian agitator reveals the first officer is also a Kenja Nietzchian, the ones flying those ships in to get them.<br>
<br>
Dylan: Yeah... and she's with Tyr.<br>
<br>
Dylan runs off as tense music plays, which is unintentionally funny. Poor defenseless wuss Tyr is in danger, what will we do? Someone has to rescue him! I can understand if this Erin was alone with a newborn infant, and they tensely worry she might do something. But come on, is Tyr a big baby? Well he is in this season. <br>
<br>
We return from commercial break to see Dylan walking into the empty cargo bay, he's ready to save his hapless warrior. Erin and Tyr stop the pod from exploding, in an unbelievable way. A zillion volts of electricity shoot through Erin as she and Tyr grab wires and stuff to shut it down. At this point I'd be more inclined to believe she's a cyborg or a robot than a Nietzchian. No one needs rescuing, Dylan accepts Tyr's explanation that Erin is not the saboteur. <br>
<br>
Later Beka comes to Tyr and informs him there are problems in the cockpit, that being Dylan with Erin. Given Dylan's well-known track record with seducing women and offering them Commonwealth jobs (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lava and Rockets</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->), Beka is right to be concerned. For her ship, that is.<br>
<br>
Erin impresses Dylan with her mind, and they yield to lip wrestling. Beka and Tyr barge in.<br>
<br>
Beka: Out of my cockpit!<br>
<br>
Great scene, about time Beka put her foot down about his reckless behavior. Beka and Tyr think Erin was working with those Kenja ships, but that turns out not to be the case. Open fighting breaks out amongst the survivors, I guess this is the requisite mindless fight scene, mandated by the empty suits on high. The senator gets mixed up in it, but sadly is removed to safety before someone clocks her in the head with a crowbar. Wimpy Tyr gets knocked out, and Dylan has to rescue the Nietzchian Princess, I mean first officer. She gets a boot to the face by the panicking Nietzchian agitator, and he flees to the escape pods.<br>
<br>
We go to commercial, and get a preview for next week. Looks like another spark-fest, as sparking enemy armor substitutes for plot or character development. (Not that there's a track record for that sort of thing.) Dylan and Tyr chase this guy, who opens the hanger doors. What looks like would take half a second to decompress the chamber takes a very long time, as Dyla and Tyr have time to hand crawl to a pod and get in. They are blown out to space. The other guy's pod blows up, and our heroes are alone out there. This leaves it to Beka and Erin to save the day, Erin reluctantly goes with Beka's plan to reach a slippoint. <br>
<br>
In a cliffhanger moment, it appears the Maru explodes as it is blasted by the approaching Nietzchian fighters. But it turns out to have been a ruse, Beka simply blasted off all the rescue pods that were entwined around the ship, destroying some ships and driving off the other Kenja. This completely contradicts the premise stated earlier that there was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>no way</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> they could carry that many people on board. That was kind of why they had all those pods linked up around the Maru's hull, there were people still inside them. I won't think about this further, I'm just noting it and moving on.<br>
<br>
Dylan and Tyr hatch a crazy plan to blast back to the Maru, and our heroes are reunited as they reach the slippoint. They were so cheap for this episode (HOW CHEAP WERE THEY?), that they had an anonymous voiceover from the Andromeda acknowledging them in, meaning they didn't even want to pay Lexa Doig for a voiceover. Now that's sad! And why is it cheaper to pay an extra to say that line than Lexa? The episode then suffers from the God of Editing, as the very next scene is of the Maru flying into the Andromeda's hanger bay, we skipped the slipstream.<br>
<br>
To tidy things up, it's revealed the senator was a fraud. Actually it would have worked fine if the premise had been the senator was a real senator and a saboteur. Like that's unbelievable, right? <br>
<br>
Beka reveals the Dewey Sunshine was done in by a comet. There was no saboteur. Beka notes the improbability, but that's not enough to cover for this sorry explanation. And this just raises the prior question of why this vessel was sitting out in deep space, rather than being christened in a safe spacedock. On the plus side, now that we know comets are this deadly, Dylan should put Harper on this. Imagine one comet being fired at the Magog Worldship, and it blows up. (Well, it's as likely as what they're asking us to buy here.)<br>
<br>
And here we come to one of the funniest moments I've seen in the third season, because it makes fun of the slouching premise of the second season, of Dylan being this babe magnet. After Erin leaves, Beka has a big grin on her face. She turns her back to Dylan, and starts pretending she is Erin being kissed by Dylan, with her arms reaching around for effect.<br>
<br>
Beka: Oooo, Dylan... Ooh, Erin... The universe is SO small...<br>
<br>
Tyr laughs, and Dylan gets a grin, too. It's about time someone made fun of our amorous captain, I thought he got off too lightly in a number of episodes with similar &quot;romances&quot;. So a great close to a passable episode. But being passable doesn't mean it was great. I advise the audience to head to the escape pods!<br>

You covered my two major gripes.<br>
1. Dylan as a babe magnet. This really gets my goat.<br>
    I wonder how Beka and Trance manage to resist.<br>
<br>
2. Why the hell is this ship out in the middle of nowhere<br>
    to be launched? Why is no one else there? Like you<br>
   said why aren't they orbiting some planet.<br>
<br>
3. Question; I might be wrong but they didn't have enough<br>
     fuel to reach Dylan and Tyre what are they burning when<br>
    they fly into the Andromeda? <p>_________________________________________________________________<br>

<br>
Yeah, I was just going to call it the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Crimson Sunshine,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but then I worried some wouldn't get the joke and correct me. So I decided to go all out. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>1. Dylan as a babe magnet. This really gets my goat. I wonder how Beka and Trance manage to resist.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Hey, at least they're noticing audience reaction and writing around it. I doubt if the writers hadn't read derisive comments about Dylan's lovin' would this have been the closing scene.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>2. Why the hell is this ship out in the middle of nowhere<br>
to be launched? Why is no one else there? Like you said why aren't they orbiting some planet.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I guess someone wanted the ship blown up. I would have pictured a thousand warships, news media, spectators, private yachts, the works on hand to witness this great occasion. (Makes one appreciate Enterprise for their CGI budget.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>3. Question; I might be wrong but they didn't have enough<br>
fuel to reach Dylan and Tyre what are they burning when<br>
they fly into the Andromeda?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Survivors. Beka and Erin had to shovel about half of them into the furnace to make it, but there were no complaints from the others. <br>

I honestly think if any women would have to choose a guy from the crew it would be either Tyr or Harper....strenth and cunning or intelligence and wit.

I can't imagine that ever happening with Kirk in charge. Imagine the Enterprise conducting rescue operations, with Kirk scanning the survivors for some hot thing. Five minutes after he spots her, he's got her in a private room and they start kissing. (Not to mention offering her a job in the Federation like Dylan did Molly in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lava and Rockets.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)<br>

Captain Kirk was many things, but he was no Dylan Hunt. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

That's what I get for missing staff meetings.<br>
<br>
I have said since the second season that his character was getting the short end of the stick. When they started this series, Tyr was created for him. With those people gone, Tyr no longer fits in their creative schemes.<br>
<br>
I'm at a loss to give sensible commentary on this. All along, I've been complaining that they've been giving Tyr nothing to do, he hasn't fit in with their writing.<br>
<br>
Solution? Get rid of him. Unbelievable! Talk about throwing out the baby with the dishwater. :&lt;<br>

You answered precisely in the second paragraph. Although the downturn in Tyr's role on the show certainly wasn't his chief decision in leaving, it didn't help. If you had seen your character go from what he was from the first season, to what he is now, would you want to keep at it or try something else? I don't blame him at all, and wish him well.<br>
