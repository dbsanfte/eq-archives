It was fairly old.  He pulled on the handle, and walked inside.  Imediatly, he noticed the long hall inbetween two row's of long benches. (Padded of course.)  <br>
<br>
He started down the hall, the balcony was behind him now, and there were several rooms to his left.  <br>
<br>
When he was near the middle, he stopped, and slid into a bench, taking a seat.  The padding was fairly new, and felt like cloth.  He leaned back on the rest, and closed his eyes.  He opened them shortly, and viewed the front.  There was a large statue of Jesus on the cross, accompanied by a beautifully made gold tapestry behind him.  Ahead of the statue, there was the alter, covered by a dull, silver cloth, with a cross in the middle.  The cup for the wine was there, and a red glass with a candle lit was inside.<br>
There were chimes also, above the alter, on the high wall to the left and right of the alter, all made of copper it seemed.<br>
<br>
He looked around, this was a marvelous church.  It must've taken years to build, and it was huge.  Of course, there was probably more rooms to this awesome building.  He leaned forward in thought.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=damonkeyhasvoicesinherhead2>DaMonkeyHasVoicesInHerHead2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 12:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clouded Mind...</span><hr size=1> Calley and Carlin wander into the church building slowly.

He heard quick footsteps, and looked behind him.  There were two children.  He smiled, and looked back forward.  <br>
Suddenly, it felt as if the world had been turned upside down.<br>
&quot;Whoa...&quot; he thought.  &quot;What is that?&quot; he continued in thought.  He looked around again, and near the preachers room, he caught two silver lights, from under a hood, staring right at him.<br>
&quot;What the?!&quot; he instantly thought, as the figure disappeared into the room...<br>

<br>
She was tempted to go talk to him, but remember what happened last time she talked to a stranger. Maybe she would take her chances...<br>

She walked over and sat down next to him.<br>

&quot;I have no place better to go...&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I just got out of some weird noodle town, and decided hey, if I can go to a town that worships noodles, why not see what it's like inside a church? It doesn't look like a whole lot of people come here... like you said...&quot; she said, watching the two kids with tails run into another room. <br>
<br>
She didn't find it odd. She had seen weirder things. She sighed, remembering back on those things, shaking her head. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zerhan@collisionworld>Zerhan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/9/03 10:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That place was weird...

&quot;Ramen Town, right?&quot; he asked, not really caring for a response.  He looked up, leaning forward, elbows on his knees and hands in front of him.  &quot;Well, I'm not here for really any reason.  I justed needed to think about some stuff.&quot; he said, his earlier thoughts returning to himself.  &quot;But, it's nice to talk to somebody for a change...&quot; he said, his voice trailing off.<br>

Calley and Carlin plop down inside the room and look around curiously. They felt a strange energy in the room, and wanted to find out. But since they didn't have the ability to find out where the energy came from exactly and they didn't want to search the entire room, they would wait for awhile to see if anyone reappeared. If not, they would tear the room apart, like most things when they searched for something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kawaiisailorokashi>Kawaii Sailor Okashi</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/raza1919/100_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/13/03 3:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/raza1919/chobits045.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getaway</span><hr size=1> ((OOC: This is CrystalSailorVenus.

Katana shrugged. &quot;Yeah. That's what it was. It was weird...&quot; she said. She looked at Zerhan. &quot;So why are YOU here? You don't seem like the type of guy who would spend time in a church...&quot; <p>&quot;I am a dreamer... don't take that from me...&quot;<br>
