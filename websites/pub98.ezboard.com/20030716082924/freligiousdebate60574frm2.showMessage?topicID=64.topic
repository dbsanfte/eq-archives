What?</span><hr size=1> From an article by a rather interesting bloke named Eliezer S. Yudkowsky on a site on Singularity. He has some rather stunning and fascinating information, theories and predictions, but it would take quite a few threads to get them all out. I'm interested in his answer to the question of whether there is a god though quoted below since atheist morality keeps coming up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What difference does it make, in terms of concrete choices?  Would you suddenly stop trying to be a good person if it were revealed that there is no God?  Would you suddenly become an altruist if you learned there was?  What's right is right, whether or not God exists, and the qualities that make a good person are widely agreed upon in any case.  Is there any reason to care, aside from pure curiosity? <br>
<br>
Of course not.  You cannot &quot;serve&quot; God.  You don't serve entities.  You serve purposes.  Asking &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; and getting back &quot;God&quot; is like asking &quot;What is two plus two?&quot; and getting back &quot;Spackling paste.&quot;  It's not even a religious issue.  It's a category error, pure and simple.  When I ask what two plus two equals, I expect a number.  When I ask what the meaning of life is, I expect a goal.  That doesn't mean that God can't exist and be a goal in some sense I don't understand at all, because the Universe is a weird place; but it does mean that equating God with a goal will lead you to make a lot of silly mistakes by trying to &quot;serve God&quot; the way you'd serve another human being. <br>
<br>
If you're religious and you want to be really hubristic, you can say:  &quot;Serve God?  Of course not, but I serve the same purpose God does.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
We could disuss several things around these excerpts, but the real question I have for theists is--<br>
<br>
If there is no god (let's suppose it were proven for the sake of argument) would you continue to serve the same purpose you do now? Behave in the same manner toward others? Aside from going to church, would you still donate time and money to charity, do good works and show up for work tomorrow?<br>
<br>
ST<br>
<br>
 <p>&quot;I don't have any evidence of that... Just in terms of allocation of time resources, <br>
religion is not very efficient.  There's alot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.&quot; <br>

You would find peace. A/As find peace without God. <br>
<br>
I would live my life the same way. I Might stop using the really bad habit of saying &quot;damn it&quot; but the I really need to stop it now...DD has picked it up. Anyway...<br>
<br>
I like the person I am. I am kind, decent, loving. I work harder at being more patient. But to find out God really does exisit wouldn't make me want to be a better person. I already want to be a better person on my own. I wouldn't change why I was the person I am just because God was now definately watching me. <br>
<br>
One thing though....if its a born-again's version of God.... then I might act out some more just to make sure I can't slip into heaven through some crack in the system. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I know a/a's have peace, but I think they could be different kinds of peace. If, after believing in God and heaven, etc, and found out there wasn't, I'd lose the peace I had, the peace I get from my beliefs. Does that make any sense?

<br>
Yeah I can understand how it would be a bigger blow to someone who believes and get peace through that belief then for those of us who don't believe or believe something very different. I think there is a higher power. I just don't believe he/it cares nor am I sure about a heaven. However, I do have peace knowing that I will live on. I will live on in the lives of my children and my husband if he were to outlive me. In the lives of the people I have touched and who then touch others. In a way its a type of immortality. <br>
<br>
But it isn't the reason on why I am a moral person. Wel a moral person by MY standards because I do have different morals then alot of christians. <br>
<br>
The only way I would lose my peace by there being a God is if he's the fundies God <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . All the other versions of God I can deal with. But hey, look at the great company I will have in hell with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . And I guess that would also be a measure of peace. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

To many, &quot;fundamentalist&quot; has become synonymous with &quot;If you don't believe exactly as I do you are going to burn in hell&quot; because that has been our experience.  Obviously not every fundamentalist is like that--you certainly aren't, Candy.  But I think the plethora of problems caused by certain people on the board you host is a good example of why some of us feel that way.  <br>

<br>
On your BC Christian Families board, where everyone would probably define themselves as &quot;fundamentalists&quot;, there are a select few who have earned the title &quot;fundie&quot; (and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> won't mention names, either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but we all know they're lurking here, despite lengthy protestations to the contrary. . .)<br>
<br>
The distinct difference lies in their attitude toward those of different beliefs (even subtly different beliefs), and their eagerness to shut their eyes (and their minds) to information  that doesn't jive with what their faith tells them.  You, on the other hand, make a profound attempt to reconcile the two, and even though you and I land on opposite sides of the fence, I respect your right to believe as you do and I respect the effort you make to inform yourself.<br>
<br>
And, I have to agree with Jessica that the revelation of the &quot;fundie's deity&quot; would be particularly hard to swallow, since I have a strong moral opposition to some of His views (on homosexuality, for example. . .)  <br>
<br>
But, at this point, I'm sure not going to lose any sleep over the prospect <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You may feel fundamentalist in your views, but what I mean by fundie, and what most mean by fundie, are intolerant people who presume that if there is a G-d, they have his personal number, and can make judgments for Him.<br>
<br>
It's one thing to be staunch in your views, and adhere closely to your religious beliefs. It's a whole different game when you start making prounouncements on other people's quality of life, as it relates to your personal beliefs.<br>

<br>
What behavior would this be exactly?  Is &quot;behavior&quot; in the context of a picture of A/A' s fornicating out in the desert and beheading people's cats, or is it more in the sense of not blindly accepting other people's ideas as our own?  I wouldn't have much in the way of &quot;behavior&quot; to change.  If God revealed himself to me, then after I got my head checked I would be good to go.  Once God revealed himself to me, I would ask him to iron out all the inconsistencies in the book man wrote about him so I could follow the true path he wants me to be on.  If he tells me that my potty mouth and rock music are much more evil than just forms of expression, then I would give them up.  Other than that, I am a decent person, and my guess is that God would be pretty happy with who I am.  <br>
<br>
As for the context in which I use &quot;fundie&quot; or &quot;bible thumper&quot;, I only apply that to people who either push their unwanted views on others, people who can't think for themselves because everything is &quot;God's plan&quot; or people who are intolerant of other people's beliefs because they are always &quot;right&quot;.  I don't think there is anything wrong with having strong faith.  I think faith can be a beautiful thing if used responsibly.  <br>

You betcha!  Depending on which god was proven, the nature and extent of the proof, I would adopt those doctrines and habits that were necessary to meet god’s standards for salvation.  (Eternal heavenly bliss?  Temporary mortal gratification?  Eternal damnation? No contest.)  Mind you, the proof has to be pretty steep, the being has to be worthy and the goal has to hold merit.  No heaven?  No point.  Selfish petty god? Why would I work towards a crappy boss when I can have oblivion?  I am already a decent person, I doubt there would be much to actually change (depending on the god proven.)  Only a stubborn fool would not, once proof is established.<br>
<br>
Candy – as stated, you are a fundamentalist, not a fundie.<br>
<br>
Paige – Re; Peace…How is that peace different from the one your kids have being told you’ll never die?  I think it is maturer of us to face facts regarding our mortality.  If we do, our decisions are with open eyes and our values can be rightly balanced.  (I’d rather spend my time with my son loving him and cherishing our time than excoriating him about being gay and his eternal damnation.  Rightly balanced.)  If your life is lived facing an afterlife, there is no way it can be balanced in the present.<br>

<br>
As for peace--I can only say that I feel a much deeper sense of peace and freedom since shedding the mental chains of religion and superstition, much in the same way moving into one's own apartment is full of greater responsibility and personal accountability, being an autonomous, independent adult rather than continuing to live in some fantasy celestial household, is liberating. The air is fresher, each day more beautiful and precious, the time with my family richer, my professional and intellectual endeavors more rewarding and personally satisfying. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Not to mention I don't have to worry about being constantly monitored every moment of my life by fairies, angels, gods or dead relatives....makes having sex way more intimate and private, not to mention using the bathroom.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

No---for me finding out there really is a god/goddess would take all that away again, returning me to the life of servitude inherent in religious dogma and robbing me of the peace, satisfaction and freedom in which I now bask every day. <br>
