Bed Fishing?</span><hr size=1> Me too, I'm a new member and just saw this topic, so here is my take.  Lets all have a reality check, I'm willing to bet that 90 percent of the armatures out there have never seen a bed, the odds that weekend fisherman catching the timing just right, guessing the correct bait or lurer, and catching bed fish are not, in my opinion, any real threat to there population.  On any given lake during spawn, I would guess there are thousands of beds. If there are a half dozen guys/gals that are knowledgeable enough to find and catch these bed fish, exactly how many fish do we think these folks are catching.  Lets get real shall we, if I catch a half dozen fish on an outing, spawn or no spawn, bedding or not, I have got enough bragging material to last all week.  I hate to admit, but I'll be honest, I had more outing without catching any fish then I have had catching fish. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Luke17</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFF00>(7/1/03 11:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffishtalkandfishingreportsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   We've mentioned bass, what about bluegill</span><hr size=1> This is a great subject on bed fishing for bass, but what about the bluegill.  At least with the bass they are released to be caught another day.  You can't believe how many fisherman I've seen lately just cruising the shorelines and setting up on the bluegill beds.  Do you think they've got much of a chance since they aren't released.  Just seems like they are very vulnerable.

So my lakes are bombarded every spring with 3 states anglers, and the  tournaments they bring with them.  I personally feel that if your state that you reside in doesn't allow spring fishing, then you should not be able to cross state lines and fish their waters.  I'm just sick and tired of seeing all these bass boats on my home waters.  By the time their bass season rolls around my water is hammered and tough fishing from the tremendous pressure they have put on the local bass.  Instead they go back across state lines to there home bodies of water and have fresh fishing for the next couple month's.  Something doesn't seem fair, or right about that.  Why should a local resident have to fight for parking to fish in there own state owned waters?  <br>
<br>
Thinking about it, I'm sure it boils down to the fact that money talks.  My state is making a killing on out of state licenses.  My solution would be this.  At public launch sites.  Limit the number of spaces to out of state vehicles.  Have a reserved amount for local vehicles.<br>

I'm guilty as charged.  I'm one of those guys that goes across state lines all the time to fish.  The fishing is just plain better then where I live.  Imagine they do make a lot of money for out of state licenses.   I'm not sure how much though.  I fish Indiana waters early in the year, and from what I see of their launch sites.  They are not rolling in the money.  This past year they have fixed a lot of them.  However, if you go across the border to Michigan they have some of the finest access sites you will find at every public launch ramp.  They do have a bass season, more active DFG, and a excellent fishery.  So what's the solution?  I'm not sure, but as long as the rules dictate the outcome.  I'm afraid you will probably continue to face the same number of anglers on your home waters every year.  <br>
<br>
My advice is don't get a negative attitude to-wards the fishing, but rather deal with it.  Those fish are still there, and they will bite.  I fish Indiana water year round, and I don't let the opening of bass seasons elsewhere dictate where I fish.  The fishing is still excellent in Indiana, so I doubt it has too much of a effect (if any at all) on the over all quality of fishing.  Some good examples of this would be Florida.  I'm sure Skip H. and a few others can attest to the huge numbers of anglers that fish there when it's not possible in there own state.   Doesn't seem to affect the overall fishing possibilities.  Still hear great things about bass fishing there.  It would be nice if we all lived by the same rules, but our states don't think that way (just ask Marty).  Marty, I don't know how you make it through the off season.  I'll share my water with you friend.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">

Bed Fishing?</span><hr size=1> With all of the rules, regulations, keeper sizes, bag limits, opened and closed seasons....look at it this way.   You don't really have to mind them if you catch and release.  In all seriousness, how many of you would rather have a nice big steak rather than a 16 inch bass fillet?  I know I may be stepping on a few toes here, and I 'm sorry for that, but those of us who keep a bag limit each trip on the water or keep a 10  lber on the next trip...you are the reason that we need these rules and regulations and case studies on this and that.  If people didn't get carried away with keeping fish, questions about bed fishing would never come up.<br>
<br>
I have also heard people say, &quot;we need to harvest fish because if we didn't, there wouldn't be enough food and there would be no big fish.&quot;  From what I have learned in grade school, life went on for millions of years without our help.  I don't think we really need to do &quot;our fair share&quot; in regards to keeping fish in order to maintain a proper food-fish ratio.  Keeping fish every so often is fine.  Im not necessarily talking to anyone who has ever kept fish before.  I even do it from time to time (only saltwater).  This is more targeting those who leave with a bag limit each time, small and large fish.  Being respectable fishermen, I doubt anyone from this site really falls into this category. <br>
<br>
Again I am sorry if I offended anyone or stepped on any toes, but I have seen too many of my fishing spots get fished out by people over harvesting.<br>

Bed Fishing?</span><hr size=1> Hmmm, I guess I'll weigh in. I don't fish in neighboring states. Why? First, the fishing is better here. Second, I don't have to fish the best water and probably would not travel far even if the fishing was better fifty miles away. Some fantastic lakes are as close as thirty miles (like Lake Seminole) that I have never fished. Do I see plenty of trucks at the local landings with Georgia plates? Every time I go. Until I read this thread I never thought of them as stepping over the line and moving in on &quot;my turf&quot;. I still don't. How many people from all over the country come to Florida every year to fish? Yes, tourism is about money, and thank you very much to those who spend it. I don't have to pay a state income tax or half the stupid taxes that my in-laws tell me they pay in Ohio because of out of state visitors. Come on to Florida everyone, and bring a friend with ya! <br>

(I also had a couple of paragraphs about fishing for bedding bream and bass but for the sake of keeping peace I decided it would be better to edit them for the time being.)<br>

In fact, I agree on all counts..... except one.....<br>
<br>
When author Marcantonio says, &quot;Personally, fishing for bedding bass is not much of a challenge anymore, as once you figure out how to catch them, it can be ridiculously easy&quot;....... <br>
HA ! He obviously hasn't bedfished for giant Florida strains in my neck of the woods ! Just sighting a big one on a bed, that will stick around for more than .2 seconds after she has sighted you, can be a huge challenge in itself ! <br>
So after three 10 hour fishing days, you finally find one that is relatively glued. You make your cast.... in runs the male.... you stick him, and she spooks off :-( Urgggg..... but after 15 minutes of sitting as still as a statue, she reluctantly comes back. You make a cast, and she acts interested, but here comes the male again..... he picks up your lure, but you don't set on him. (or you can try sticking him again and putting him in your livewell) and so she spooks again. Twenty minutes later, here she comes again...... but so does a breeze ! Urggg.... Now your fishing for nothing more than a &quot;blur&quot;.... After fishing for her for 3 more hours straight, she finally cruises off, but she did so during that last wind gust, leaving you wondering how long you have been fishing an empty bed ! <br>
<br>
Oh sure, on rare occasion I have stuck a double digit bass in 15 minutes or less, but typically, I spend an average of 2 hours on a fish before either landing it, or losing it during the fight. Of course there are many trips (probably 60% of the time) when I don't even have that much of a chance at a good one, in the first place. I have spent as much as 8 hours on a single fish, during a trip..... AND NEVER GOT HER TO GO ! (those are the rough ones) and I have spent nearly 8 hours on a single fish before I finally caught it..... which of course made it all worth it :-)<br>
<br>
One particular fish comes to mind..... A big one which was &quot;very loosely&quot; relating to a spawning area &quot;after the spawn&quot; (nobody had been able to entice her, even during the height of the spawn, although I think most of the trophy bass anglers knew where she was hanging out, and had been hammering on her daily). Personally, I spent 6 sessions with her, on 3 different trips, which lasted from 1 to 5 hours at a time (maybe about 15 hours total) before I finally stuck her on a wad of crawlers. Totally spawned out, she still went 14.1 lbs, which in my opinion, made all of those hours totally worth it, and then some :-) But to say she was easy ????? Yea' right ! <br>
<br>
BTW, my favorite sight fishing lake gets a ton of pressure put on it every Spring, yet by April there are massive clouds of bass fry swirling everywhere ! Obviously no problems with recruitment.<br>
<br>
Peace,<br>
Fish Chris<br>
