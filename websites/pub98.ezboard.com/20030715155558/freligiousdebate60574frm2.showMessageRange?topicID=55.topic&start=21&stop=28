I'll try again, though.  And I haven't said how I feel one way or the other about the possibility of faith healing, so I won't even address how you imagine I would respond to your postulations b/c that would clog things up as far as the point I was making.<br>
<br>
Basically, I was saying your analogy comparing faith healing to the placebo effect was not apt in at least one way.<br>
<br>
When people experience the placebo effect, they think they are getting something that they are not (for instance they think they are given a magic stone that gives them the power to do addition, when in fact, it is just a regular stone from the garden).  But their faith in the idea that the stone is magic allows them the confidence to ace their math exam.<br>
<br>
But I was merely arguing that those who believe in faith healing may believe that by praying *for others who are not even aware that prayers were being said for them* may think that a miracle can still occur *unbeknownst* to the recipient.<br>
<br>
Basically, the placebo effect's recipient is tricked into thinking that they are given something that they aren't.  You could say the same thing for a person who actively sought out a faith healer, or asked people to pray for healing with the desired result  <br>
<br>
The hole is, when folks are the unaware recipients of prayer, they are not being tricked.  They may later learn that prayers were said and link that to explain an unexplained recovery, but that is not the same thing as a placebo effect.<br>

beth, I agree with your criticism of the analogy she gave, but the real hole is in making the claim that someone benefited from 2 years of prayer without giving credit to anything else. If instead of praying, the woman and her church had gotten together every Thursday night to drink beer and play Bunko, then lo and behold 2 years later their friend got pregnant, would they credit drinking beer and playing Bunko on Thursdays to her &quot;miracle&quot;? How silly would that be to connect two totally disconnected things that have NO effect on each other and to give that much power to something like drinking beer.....or praying. KWIM?<br>

Oh sure, the 2 years of praying thing could have its holes as well.  No disagreement there.  Linking cause and effect is usually open to many interpretations, and I agree it would be very difficult to prove in the case you gave.<br>

On the other hand, drinking beer and playing Bunko cannot be said to have prevented insemination and so one could say praying (which is just a polite way of saying begging) is neither effective nor harmful and so if not a placebo, to the unknown target a rather irrelevant occurrence. To the prayers though--a monumental wast of time, but then each of us has the right to spend our days how we choose. I prefer beer and Bunko--can touch it, feel it, taste it, get results.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I also read that entire LONG post (thanks!). Just an observation before I begin... just as those who don't believe in prayer find it hard to connect prayer a great distance away with healing, I find it hard to connect the fact that this woman felt social and political pressures to follow these faith healers and allow all this to go on with a belief in God, or religion being harmful. It was the pressures that these people put on one another that is the problem, not God. That said, I also feel like a HUGE problem (like that all caps stuff??? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) that our society has is that of not taking accountability for one's actions. You see it everywhere. It is the source of the current psych mumbo jumbo of &quot;It isn't my fault because my parents did _______&quot; and insert any number of things. Regardless of what we have been through, we all make decisions about our behavior. I am the first to admit that events in people's past can definitely affect their decisions but it has become a crutch that our society leans on in order to excuse any behavior that they choose to have (anyone heard of &quot;The Twinkie Defense&quot;?) Darg made her decision. Yes, she was pressured but she still decided. <br>
<br>
Now, I can't resist also sharing a story... My uncle used to play fast pitch softball. He was a very good player. He was at a tournament in Florida when his injury occurred. He was his second time up to bat. The first time up, he hit the pitch with a two base hit. No one else had yet hit this pitchers throws. Well, he had hit again but it went foul. So, on the second throw, the pitcher deliberately hit my uncle in the face with the ball. He hadn't even entered the batter's box yet and was looking the other direction when he started to turn and there was the pitch. 106 mph. He went down in a pool of his own blood. He bled so badly that they were not sure if he was dead or alive upon looking at him. He was rushed to the hospital and then flown via helicopter back to Utah. In the hospital they found that his eye socket, cheekbone and jaw had been turned to powder. He was told that he would never be able to see out of his left eye again. The nerves had been damaged beyond repair. They were going to go in and place a plastic reconstructed eye socket, cheek bone, and jaw where the old ones were and hope they could save some of his vision in his other eye. He had before had 20/15 in one eye and 20/20 in the other. Well, before the surgery, he was given a priesthood blessing (in the LDS church, we believe that men holding the priesthood authority can lay their hands on the head of the person who is sick or injured and offer a prayer in their behalf). He was promised that he would have his vision restored and that he would be fine. The next morning, before the surgery, he had vision in both eyes. The doctors were completely astonished. His vision was estimated at 20/40 in the better eye and 20/70 in the eye that was never to have been able to see. Just 2 weeks after the surgery, both eyes had returned to 20/20 vision and he does not have any visible scars from the surgery except one in the crease under his left eye. Coincidence? Maybe but I don't believe it to be. <br>
<br>
One other story. My friend's wife was pg with their second child. Upon going to their 20 wk u/s, they were told that the baby had no brainstem. They were devastated. They decided to carry the baby anyway, knowing that it would possibly die before birth or during birth. If not, it would only live a few minutes after birth. They prayed the entire pregnancy. They had monthly u/s and no brainstem. When she went in for her 39 wk appt., they did another u/s right before the exam. Still, no brain stem. During the exam, her water broke. They took her in to deliver the baby. She was also given a priesthood blessing and told that if she had faith, God could make this baby whole.  The delivered that baby and had an entire team of physicians in the delivery room waiting to wisk that baby away. When she was born, she scored a 7, then a 9 on the Apgar. She was fine. They have had drs. from all over the country come to look at the records, to look over the u/s records and to examine this little girl. She is now almost 2. I don't know how else to explain something like that. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, I realize that when you attribute such wonderful things to the help of God, you also have to attribute bad things to God. I agree with that. I have to say first, that I do not blame God for things that happen because of someone's choice. I strongly believe that God will not take away the agency of any of us, even if we chose to do bad things. Part of His plan was to send us to earth, give us a body so that we could experience all the things that a body allows us to experience (sensations, smells, sounds, touch, taste, etc), and to make choices, both good and bad, and to try to prepare to return to him. Life can't be all easy or we would never improve or grow. When it comes to miscarriages, death from natural type causes (heart attack, stroke, etc) I can see that God may have a hand in that. As far as miscarriages or SIDS, death of small children, we (LDS) believe that we all existed before this life. We came here to be tested and challenged and to prove ourselves, along with the other I already mentioned. We believe that some of us had less to learn than others of us. Those who had less to learn, were more righteous before coming here, needed only to receive a body in order to fulfill the plan, to be able to be ressurected and have Eternal Life. Some of us have to be here longer to mature and grow and learn. We also believe that children who are born with mental disabilities, who are less able to make choices of right and wrong, were more righteous. They receive their body and experience life in a different way than we do. Often times, I believe (and this is only me) that they are given to families to teach their families things like patience, love, mercy, acceptance, etc. Those babies who are never born didn't have to go beyond receiving that body in order to return to live with God. They proved themselves before they ever left His presence. And we believe they go right back to Him. <br>
<br>
The last two years of my life have been pretty hard financially and yet I look back on it and see why things happened. There have been so many things that we saw as bad which turned out to be necessary in order to make something better. Sure, it could all be a big long string of coincidences but I don't think so. <br>
<br>
I guess I can see why the assertion that religion can be harmful. No one can dispute that there have been horrific things done in the name of God but I would assert that God was used as a rationale for their own agenda. I don't see that the terrorists flew into WTC because of God but rather in spite of Him. But I don't believe God to be a mean and ruthless God. I believe He loved those terrorists in spite of what they were about to do just as much as he loved all those they were about to kill. I also believe it caused Him great sadness to see His children do these kinds of things to one another. <br>
<br>
Back to the original post ( I warned ya!)...<br>
I believe that the knowledge that we have has been revealed by God. I believe He has inspired scientists, doctors, and so on. I believe that any faith based healing should be coupled with responsible medical care. The &quot;healer&quot; who wanted money, favors, etc... I believe was a fraud. God does not work that way, at least not the God I believe in. We believe in the Priesthood, the authority to act in Christ's name. Christ, at least based on our beliefs, did not heal the sick, the blind, the deaf for a price. He never said &quot;Get the Pharisees off my back and I will heal you.&quot;  Also, as far as prayer goes, I believe that my prayers are every bit as powerful and heard as are those of anyone else on the planet. In the LDS church, anyone with the priesthood authority can perform a blessing. The power to do that is the same for the prophet as it is for my husband or brother. The priesthood is the same, only the position held in the church is different. We believe that the prophet holds other authority but as far as the power to give blessings, it woul be the same. As far as regular prayer goes, we are all equally important.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm sure I have gone off on about 20 tangents here but I gave it my best shot for tonight... I may try again tomorrow.<br>

I do have a questin though because your pre-existence and lessons learned thing struck me as very Richard Bach (Jonathon Livingstone Seagull) and is very much what my pagan friends believe. Indeed this is at the heart of reincarnation beliefs and can be found in many eastern religions (yet another reason I think LDS diverges on major things from xianity, but then I don't see this as necessarily bad<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). Anyway, you say<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We also believe that children who are born with mental disabilities, who are less able to make choices of right and wrong, were more righteous.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
I have heard two different sides on how to explain this in light of folks like Hitler and Jeffrey Dahmer. If a person has &quot;mental disabilities&quot; including paranoid delusions or episodes of violent psychosis what are they here to learn? Are they not accountable for their actions (sort of the way we say in the legal sense you must know the difference between right and wrong)? There are clearly mentally ill folks that do horrible things that do not see it is wrong--this goes beyond murder too to child molesting and even rape. My pagan friends disagree with each other on this so I'm curious what the Mormon take is and how it relates to where a violently mentally ill person would go post mordem.<br>
