I didn't think I'd like it when it was assigned, but I ended up finishing it in a day.  I think besides having a clever story, the book tried to enforce morals.  It showed was was good, and teaches what you should really look at when seeing a person.  I thought the book was really touching, especially the end.  Has anyone else read it and liked it?   <p><font color=yellow ><font face="Bradley Hand ITC"><font size=+3>* Jessie *</font></font>

I'm a friend of Ambers from elsewhere in EZ boards.<br>
<br>
About your question on a re-make of TKAM( which I read in grade 9, then saw the movie):<br>
<br>
How about Edward Norton as Boo Radley?<br>
<br>
Or Sam Shepard as Atticus Finch?<br>
<br>
And who, today can portray "evil" enough to play the role of Mr. Ewell(which isn't far from "evil" in it's spelling!)?<br>
