<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
2. Bans are for one week or one month.<br>
3. One month bans will be issued for the following offenses:<br>
<br>
a) Gross spamming (Gross spamming is defined at posting the exact same text/image (or the same type of text/image) several times in one thread, several threads or forums and having no discernable relationship to the topic of the thread(s). <br>
b) Posting of pornography.<br>
c) Posting a booby-trap.<br>
d) Hacking<br>
<br>
4. One-week bans will be issued under the following circumstances:<br>
<br>
a) If a banned member attempts to post under a dual within the term of the original ban. One week will be added for each attempt to post using a dual or another member's account. A member in good standing may not post for a banned member.<br>
b) Repeated attempts to post in a thread where the members posts have been removed to the Abyss for flaming, trolling or baiting. The removal of a post to the Abyss is a hint the member should take seriously. Repeated attempts to go back to the original thread and disrupt it will garner a one-week ban. It gets a stiff ban because there is a forum ready made to continue on a tirade. Take it to the Abyss or take a one week vacation from posting.<br>
<br>
5. Bans apply to ALL the user names (duals) of a member.<br>
<br>
6. If a banned member disagrees with the reasons for his/her ban then they are encouraged to contact the Administrators or the moderator that issued the warning.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's not so much what the rules say, but that you have written rules. I'm tired of written rules, bans and warnings. I'm going to start avoiding boards with written policy. What Ex Isle is doing is supposed to be only guidelines. Members who do something that would have gotten them a warning at SS would instead just get a conversation with a mod or Admin, the same way you and I did once long ago, when the stream first opened, and some jerkoff was accuseing you of bringing up something from another board. But frankly, after Hawks post in that thread, I can see where that's going, and I think I'll stay away from there as well, if I can. I admit I'm weak when it comes to UBB's and making friends and then leaveing. I usually end up going back.<br>
<br>
No offence meant to you guys here at the Underground. I was trying to make the point that I didn't want to be involved with a board that had written rules. Looks like no one understood what I was trying to say.<br>
<br>
<br>
 The best board I know of has been running since about 1995, without ever having written rules. The membership is small, staying below three hundred or so for all of that time, and we have had our fights, but the owner doesn't get to hot till there is clear spamming or trolling, then that person gets banned if they continue after he tells them to stop, once. That was much the way the stream went till Che came along, and C&amp;L decided that it was policy or nothing. That's when I resigned.<br>
<br>
I check this tomorrow to see if you respond. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=consubstantial>consubstantial</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/examples/fhpp036.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 257<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/6/03 10:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   From the peanut gallery</span><hr size=1> I'd like to respond too, if I may.

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kosh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, I mean no offense but could you at least put a link to the discussion occuring on ExIsle so we can all follow this.  Other wise it just looks like you are coming over here to create conflict.  AND I don't think that is your intent at all.<br>
<br>
As to the rules, you quote... As <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Connie</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> mentioned they were up for discussion for quite a while and you could have joined in.  Bringing your complaints after the fact seems pointless and quite frankly add to a suspicion that you would complain regardless of what policy we set in place.  (Forgive me if I am wrong)  Your input was needed at the time we were in discussion and would have been welcomed.  We tried to listen to everyone and form policy that we could all live with and still function as a community.  <br>
<br>
We have no warnings per se and the Moderators are there for exactly the purpose you describe, to bring order by suggestion.  However we do have bans, although no permabans, but they are for breaking policy that we HAVE to abide by in order to use ezboard at all and to protect the members and the board.  I really can't see how this is objectionable to you--or to anyone for that matter.  But if you say it is, then it certainly is to you.<br>
<br>
We've decided to take a look at how well the rules/policy serve the community in about 6 months.  Your comments now will certainly be taken into consideration.  We'd hate to think that a few rules kept anyone from particpating in the community.  And your particpation is of course welcome should you decide you can post here and not be in conflict with your principles.<br>

Kosh, we don't have warnings.<br>
<br>
We do have non-permanent bans only.<br>
<br>
The rest of the rules are for moderators only.<br>
<br>
So where's your problem here?<br>
<br>
The board you speak so highly of has permabans for the offenses that we listed as being only a month ban if I'm not mistaken right?<br>
<br>
What's the difference between a permanent ban and a temporary one?  Well, people have a chance to reform.<br>
<br>
These policies are to protect the membership from those that might do the community harm and that includes the Moderators and Admins!!!<br>
<br>
There are not alot of rules here and nothing that a member of the Slipstream that I have ever seen would get banned for.<br>
<br>
So please tell us exactly what banning people for posting porn has to do with imposing rules on the membership. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

Once they ban you, you are gone. They don't ban members for getting angry, I've started enough shit there to be banned for life, but I had been there for a couple of years by that time, and I was never banned for a moment. The system works, you have more freedom of speach, once you've been there a while.<br>

The more of us there are, the merrier the discussion. <br>
Ex Ilse members have asked also for written rules. I don't understand the need, for what is mostly adults, to tell them how to behave. Those who cause enough trouble to bring on the ire of enough people should be booted. Thiose who don't have little to worry about.<br>

I was not around when it all ended at the stream, and wasn't around much for any of the boards being built. When Ex Isle was opened, I had no intention of going to yet another board. I was planning on staying at RHW, and talking to whoever came there. Rov started a thread to get your account fixed, so you could poost at EI, but I didn't make the request. I got an e-mail from him a few days later, that it had been done, so I went. I'm tired of moving.<br>

I only came in to answer HF, as he had asked what I was talking about at EI. As for suspision, I said it in my first post. It's not what your rules say, it's that you have them at all. I wasn't wround when you wrote them, I'm not even a member here, I'm using a global account I've had for ages. You don't need policy to function as a community, you just need manners.<br>

<br>
Our policy is to keep the Admin and moderators from EVER being the sort of tyrants that would make a restrictive policy and force it on the people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tell me the difference in having a written policy that says if you spam porn you will be booted and not having a policy, but you still boot the porn spammer...<br>
<br>
I'll tell you...  At least if it's written down you have a little warning before it happens.<br>
<br>
That's it.<br>
<br>
Our policy says you can't do 4 things or you will be banned.<br>
<br>
The rest is about keeping the mods and admin from becoming draconian slave masters now or in the future when the current admins and mods are no longer in charge.<br>
<br>
I don't see a problem with that kind of policy. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
This is a horse of a different color.  I see what you are talking about, but have to agree with HF here, most of the policy is aimed at gjuidlines for Mods and Admins.  Actually very little is directly aimed at posters.  <br>
<br>
While I understand your point now, I'm of a mind to let policy stand for now and we'll review it in a couple of months to look at how well it functions.<br>
<br>
We're not looking, nor did we look, at policy as a way to constain members. We looked at policy as a way to constrain Mods and Admins and give them guidelines in order to do their jobs.<br>

<br>
You all undoubtedly did a better job, there were only few threads and it was all business.  It was how it should be.<br>
<br>
Even then you DID have rules however.<br>
<br>
Even if there was no written policy, there were consequences for posting porn and other nasty activities.<br>
<br>
I hate the warning system and that's why we don't have warnings here.  <br>
<br>
A frugal ban system IS necessary in order to protect this community from being hit with porn, not only to protect the members but to keep us from being kicked off EZboard while we're here.<br>
<br>
The first part of the policy are things we MUST do in order to remain here on EZboard.  The rest is about tying the hands of the Mods and Admin so that certain things never happen again.<br>
<br>
Whether there is a written policy or not, every board has its rules and some actions have consequences.  This is true even at Troll kingdom, one of the places with no policy except to keep it legal.<br>
<br>
At least if it is written down we can attempt to be consistent, We can be held accountable and we can be sure that everyone is on the same page. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

FirstKosh, we wanted a policy to protect the rights and freedoms of the people who visit here.  I think our policy does that.  I'm not much on lots of boards myself; I haven't even visited ExIsle yet.  The thrust of our policy is about what moderators and administrators can't do and what they can do.  Anyone who visits here should know what kind of treatment to expect from the admins and moderators.  I far prefer stated rules to unstated ones; however, I can understand if you prefer unstated rules.<br>

I think it's necessary to have some rules partly so that people know exactly what behaviour will or will not get banned but also so that people can't just be tossed out on their ear because someone has it in for them.

That is extreamly rare. I've only seen it happen a couple of times, and it is the draw back to not having written rules, you can lose people through the cracks, but over all, I'll stick to no rules.<br>
