Chapter 3<br>
Peace, Lost and Found<br>
 <br>
<br>
So Dad is dating? Wow! Why didn’t he tell me about her? It was late and I was tired. In the morning I went downstairs to the kitchen.<br>
“Morning, baby girl how are you?” he asked pulling a chair for me to sit down.<br>
I sat down and looked at him chew his food slowly.<br>
“What?” he asked cracking a smile, “Why are you staring at me?”<br>
“Im just watching you eat that’s all.” I said. I was really thinking on how at ask him a question.<br>
“Michael, don’t forget you have to go talk with Tommy about Invincible.” Nancy said before leaving the kitchen.<br>
“Dad? Who is Victoria?” I asked, “I heard you talking about her to Nancy.” <br>
Dad swallowed the food that was in his mouth and turned to face me. He sighed and thought of what to say.<br>
“Victoria is my girlfriend.” He said looking at me in my eyes, “My girlfriend..”<br>
“When did you meet her?” I asked taking a piece of his toast with jam.<br>
“6 months ago. I should have told you about her.” He said smacking my hand for not asking first.<br>
“Oww. Yes you should have.” I said rubbing my throbbing hand, “I don’t know this woman. And I don’t want you with her.”<br>
“Rachel, I have to move on. Your mother, my wife is gone and she would have wanted me to be happy. I am happy, with Victoria.” He said.<br>
“You don’t love her..” I said in anger, “You didn’t tell her on the phone”<br>
I quickly covered my mouth. He looked at me with such anger. Privacy is a big issue with my Dad.<br>
“You listened?!” he said with ever growing intensity in his voice.<br>
“I picked up the phone when it rang.” I said getting angry that he was yelling at me.<br>
“You have no right to eavesdrop on my conversations!” he yelled<br>
“You don’t have the right to snoop through my room!” I yelled back.<br>
“Don’t raise your voice at me  young lady!!” he screamed at me.<br>
“Don’t you yell at me!” I screamed back.<br>
“That’s it! Go to your room.” He said, “Go!”<br>
I ran to my room, crying. That is the first time he yelled at me. Daniel was in his room when he heard my door slam. He gently knocked on the door.<br>
“Sissy?” he asked, “You okay?”<br>
“Go away, Danny.” I said crying.<br>
He came in and sat next to me. Downstairs Dad was trying to calm down.<br>
“Michael you were yelling.” Nancy said giving him some water. <br>
“I know. I shouldn’t have yelled at her.” He said drinking, he took a breath.<br>
“She shouldn’t have yelled at you.” Nancy said, “She’ll apologize when she calms down.”<br>
He sighed and went into the living room. I packed a runaway bag just in case. I don’t know where I’m going go, but I know that if he yells again I’m leaving. I didn’t want to meet Victoria or get to know her or anything. It’s Wednesday and that woman is coming tomorrow. I am plotting some booby traps for her. A whoopee cushion, or glue? Glue! Hot or Tacky? Hot! I’m going to get her good. I borrowed Uncle Randy’s hot glue gun and plugged it in my room. I don’t want that woman in our house. Danny was going to help me too. I got balloons, filled them with water and whipped cream. I’m going to get her good. I went downstairs to Dad’s office. I knocked on the door.<br>
“Come in.” he said facing the window.<br>
“Dad?” I asked sitting in a chair in front of his desk. He faced me. He had a tired expression on his face.<br>
“Yes, Rachel?” he asked me holding his head up.<br>
“I’m sorry. I was angry.” I said, “I didn’t mean to yell.”<br>
He patted his lap for me to come over and sit with him. I did. I started crying because I don’t like being angry. He hugged me and kissed my forehead, and told me it was alright.<br>
“I’m sorry, honey I didn’t mean to yell. I was angry too.” He said looking into my tear filled eyes. He rocked with me and we just sat there. Daniel found some home videos of me, Dad and, Mom. Daniel put it in the VCR in the living room and started to watch it. I came out of Dad’s office, I heard our mother’s voice and I ran to the living room. I saw her, I saw me in her arms as a baby. She had short brown hair. She looked into the camera.<br>
“Michael! Stop! I can’t show this to Katie.” She said. She was breastfeeding me.<br>
“Oh come on!” Michael said, “Mother did it.”<br>
“That’s different. You are taping me” she said trying to hide her face. I watched in agony, I miss her so much and Daddy is dating someone? She is going to replace our mother? I’m not having it.<br>
“Rachel! Danny!” Dad called, “Time for bed.”<br>
“Dad, it’s only 9:00!” Danny said, “I’m not sleepy!”<br>
“Yes you are.” He said tickling him.<br>
The tape was still playing…..<br>
“Michael? Will you look at her for a minute and not me.” She said laughing.<br>
“She’s beautiful just like her mother. 9 months.” Dad said zooming in on me.<br>
Dad quickly turned off the tape and shooed us to bed. Victoria is coming tomorrow and my plan goes into action. I can’t wait. Ha Ha Ha..So long Victoria<br>
