  <em>The Great War</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Many millennia after the events of Dragon Ball Gt. The universe experienced a
  prolonged 500-year period of peace. During this time, technology and
  civilization as we know it advanced substantially. Computers became obsolete,
  and many new inventions were created in their place. Many of the inventions of
  old simply became items in antique and memorial stores. During this time, all
  the races of the universe were in a state of perpetual peace. The planets were
  all pretty much happy with their lives and everything ran smoothly, or so it
  looked.<br>
  <br>
  Far off in the remote reaches of space lied the planet of Quazar. On this
  planet lived two extremely powerful, and vastly advanced races: the angel-like
  Gemanites, and the Super-inhuman Mystics. These two races had been coexisting
  together peacefully for centuries, that is until one of them began to get too
  powerful. You see the Gemanite King, Enock, was a great warrior. He had led
  his armies into many extreme battles in the past, all being won without fail.
  His power grew so vast that he one day reached the level of an Ascended
  Gemanite; a form that had not been seen since the ancient times. This level of
  power made him nearly unstoppable. With this new found power he became greedy
  and corrupt. He began to plot against his long time allies the Mystics. What
  he did not plan on was the Mystic King, Jazen. Jazen was also a skilled
  warrior, and had many centuries of experience in battle. When Enock began his
  campaign to take over the Mystic lands from Jazen, he sent in his armies to
  intercept Enock.<br>
  <br>
  Enock merely wiped away the armies almost single-handedly. Jazen was then
  forced to fight Enock face to face. He hated the fact that he had to fight his
  one time companion, and tried to reason with him, but for nothing would the
  Gemanite listen. He unleashed his fury onto Jazen, but was ultimately
  overpowered, at first. After this occurred, the king went back to his forces
  and he began to plot against the Mystics. In the end, he planned to rule the
  entire planet of Quazar, and eventually the universe. With his power, it was
  not far from his reach. He decided that he needed allies if he wished to carry
  out war on the Mystics; for the Mystics were the only race ever to give the
  Gemanites trouble when it came to power.<br>
  <br>
  The king first decided he would need a leader for his elite army. This warrior
  had to be loyal, trusting, and above all else, sworn to the king. He found the
  perfect warrior with unchallenged power and skill. His first born son,
  Lazarus. Lazarus controlled his armies with an iron fist and was a great
  fighter on the battlefield. He sent Lazarus as an ambassador for the Gemanite
  race, to the planet of New Vegeta. He planned to ally with the powerful race
  he heard of many times before, the Saiya-jin. He promised that when the war
  was won, that they could have part of the bounty, and even control of certain
  land on Quazar. They agreed to fight alongside the Gemanites, but did not know
  of the kings true intention to enslave them the moment he knew that the
  Mystics were no longer a threat.<br>
  <br>
  Word of this act got back to Jazen. After learning this, he sent a fleet of
  his best men to the home planet of the Pikkonian people to negotiate an
  alliance with the people of that planet. They agreed to help in the war, in
  exchange for lands on Quazar; and freedom to do as they pleased with their
  lands. Jazen agreed, and so it began. The fleets of the four races gathered,
  and on a tragic day in history, the battle known only as the Great War began.
  This war was the most bloody, disgusting, and vile battle that had ever been
  fought in the history of war. It lasted for years, spanning the length of the
  entire universe. Many different battles were fought on all the different
  planets. Though most of them took place on Quazar, there was always another
  immense battle taking place on the other planets. Warriors in this war reached
  power levels so high that it boggles the mind to even try and fathom the
  weakest of them. As it progressed, armies grew stronger, but numbers dwindled.
  New alliances were formed, and in only 3 short years, almost every major race
  in the universe was part of the Great War.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  After many years of intense battles the Mystic queen, Aphelia, decided to tell
  her husband it was time to end this. While planning a way to approach the king
  and tell him to make a truce and pact with the other races, the royal castle
  was destroyed by Enocks extermination squads. Although his wife had now
  been killed, Jazens son, Xain, managed to escape shortly before thanks to
  his mother sending him out to hide in the country in case they came. Jazen
  received word of this wifes death and became uncontrollable. He found Enock,
  and with tears of sorrow in his eyes, challenged him to one final battle.
  Enock agreed, knowing that this would be his chance to kill the Mystic threat
  once and for all, and secure the planet of Quazar for himself.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  As they began to unleash the primary forces of their immense powers, the force
  of it could be felt all through the galaxy by every being. As the two
  legendary warriors began to power up for this last battle, every planet shook
  with incredible force from their power. All fighting stopped, for the armies
  realized what was about to take place. The entire war would be settled by this
  one, cataclysmic, battle. These two warriors were the best in what they did.
  The best their races had to offer. King Jazen was of the same bloodline as the
  legendary Alpha Mystic, Shikujya. King Enock had the blood of the first
  Celestial Gemanite coursing through his veins. These two warriors shook the
  entire universe by merely charging to portions of their maximum power. As the
  fighting on the different planets came to a cease, the immense battle grew
  ever closer.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, in a sudden sonic explosion that shook the galaxy, it began. With every
  blow the planets shook. Their power had reached such levels that stray blasts
  destroyed uninhabited planets just by passing by. Their many stray attacks
  left all the planets in ruins. With every devastating attack the people became
  aware of the two great powers that were going to determine their fates. They
  fought for days, which then turned to weeks and those to months. They fought
  for a total of 9 months on end, never stopping for anything. They pushed
  themselves to such great heights that both reached the final and most powerful
  levels achievable by their races. King Jazen attained the level of Gamma
  Mystic. And King Enock reached the level of power destined to him by his
  bloodline, Celestial. At this point their power was almost god-like. They
  could move at speeds even greater than that of light. When they fought
  darkness would surround them. They exhibited uncanny skills. Tearing into each
  other, neither ever getting the upper hand. Their telepathic and telekinetic
  powers were so great that they would hit each other with meteors and comets,
  just by using their telekinesis. These two warriors would hit and cause sonic
  booms and tremors to echo out through out the galaxy. Then, after the long and
  intense months of fighting, the two great warriors ended it.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  They both realized just how powerful the other was and came up with the idea
  that would destroy the other. Enock unleashed a gigantic and almost
  catastrophic wave of pure psychic energy that killed Jazen, but at the same
  time, Jazen unleashed from within himself of massive wave of pure energy that
  destroyed everything for miles in space: stars, comets, and meteors. As the
  two explosions erupted, they were heard all over the universe. The blast shook
  every house and planet that it seemed like the end of creation.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, long after the two warriors finished their battle by committing the
  ultimate desperation, the entire universe was left in shambles. Races and
  populations had taken a major decline in numbers, and many died caught in the
  crossfire of the insane final battle. About 5 years after the war ended the
  races began to go back to they way things were before. Everyone began
  rebuilding. The universe has now returned mostly to normal, and the War is a
  thing of the past, although some places are still recovering. The two races
  that were the cause of the war have now begun an uneasy alliance, and have
  gone on with their lives.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The Great War was a devastating episode in the history of the Pre-Shintei
  period. That was 200 years ago on Quazar when the war ended, and now there are
  still those with incredible power, but nothing even remotely close to what the
  warriors of that battle had.The year is now 5286, and though now things are
  looking peaceful, there are still those who would dare to harm the innocent.
  These people still wish that some kind of leader would rise up and take them
  back to this time, but there are also those who still fight for justice.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  This is Dragon Ball Shintei, a new beginning, with new people and a new story.
  Let the saga of their many journeys begin. Welcome to the world of Dragon
  Ball: Shintei!

  <em>The Master Olympian </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->
  </p>
  <p>After being summoned to the New Lookout of Earth, the Shintei warriors were
  told of a great evil that was approaching. After learning that the long
  forgotten Dragon Balls still existed and that with them they could revive the
  fallen warrior Lazarath, they were insisted by the Earth's guardian, Nhala, to
  search for them and find them before the forces of evil were able to find
  them. After retrieving the first ball, they returned to the Lookout with a new
  companion; a woman known as Denise. After meeting everyone, Denise revealed
  her true nature. She stole the dragonballs and when confronted by the other
  warriors she transformed, revealing her true form, Harpy!<br>
  <br>
  After defeating the warriors and escaping with the Dragonballs, Harpy returned
  to parts unknown. After their defeat by Harpy the Shintei warriors were
  advised by Nhala to search for the other Dragonballs, for if they could
  retrieve the remaining Dragonballs then the forces of evil could not use them
  for thier own demonic purposes. The warriors split into two teams, Akaris
  leading one, and Lyjian leading the other. Lyjian's team retrieved their
  Dragonball but were then confronted by Harpy and a new threat, Chimera. At the
  same time Akaris and his team had been confronted by the deadly fiend known as
  Titan.<br>
  <br>
  The two teams now had to face the Olympians. Although each team consisted of
  members with unique abilities and skills, they proved no match for the
  extraordinary powers of the Olympians. Facing the ultimate defeat, Akaris and
  his team returned to the Lookout with nothing. Only the news of their defeat.
  Lyjian later returned with the same depressing news. They had also been
  defeated. Akaris departed, along with the beautiful Blade to train and
  increase his powers for the inevitable battle to come. Lyjian also returned to
  his ship and over the course of three days: he, Akaris, and Blade cominced
  training sessions that they thought would never have to be reverted to.<br>
  <br>
  After completing their training, Akaris and Blade tracked down the Olympians
  and spied on them learning the true goal behind their plot to retrieve the
  Dragonballs. They planned to revive their long sleeping Master, the Master
  Olympian known as Thor, the Minator. After summoning the dragon and making
  their first wish they were interrupted by Akaris and Blade, who were soon
  joined by the newly, much more powerful Lyjian.<br>
  <br>
  A fierce battle ensued between the Olympians and the Shintei warriors. The
  Olympians began to grow weaker with every blow. Soon the Master Olympian arose
  and began a thread of destruction, destroying multiple cities. After the
  Shintei warriors disposed of the lesser Olympians, they turned their focus to
  the new menace ravaging the planet. Akaris, Lyjian, Blade, and Citan
  confronted the Master Olympian in the ruins of the destroyed city, but proved
  no match for him. All the Shintei warriors confronted Thor, but were nothing
  to him but mere bothersome flies. Even the newly acquired techniques of Akaris
  and Lyjian proved nothing against the fierce might of Thor.<br>
  <br>
  During the fight with Thor, Scepterz and Matthew succeeded in wishing back the
  now immensely more powerful warrior known as Lazarath. Upon his arrival onto
  the battle field, he witnessed the death of his only friend, Akaris. This was
  exactly what he need to unlock the new power he had acquired. Lazarath reached
  the level of Elemental and even the full power of Thor proved nothing for the
  might of an Elemental Gemanite fighting for revenge. After the defeat of Thor,
  the remaining Shintei warriors returned to the Lookout to tell Nhala of their
  bitter triumph.</p>

  <br>
  After the events of the Olympian Saga, life continued on in the Shintei
  universe, for good and worse.<br>
  <br>
  Quickly after the destruction of Thor, the Master Olympian, Lazarus entered
  into his ship and blasted off into space into parts unknown for a reason that
  still remains a mystery. Ever since that battle where he ascended into the
  Elemental Form, no trace of him has been seen throughout the galaxy.<br>
  <br>
  Blade, Lyjian, and Kamajin left in Lyjians personal ship and have been
  undergoing intense training in the atmosphere of Quazar directly after the
  events of the Olympian Saga. Only recently have they landed. Not soon after
  that, Lyjian seemed to disappear into thin air without giving any such word to
  Blade or Kamajin. His whereabouts are still unknown while Blade and Kamajin
  continue to train.<br>
  <br>
  In the realm of the afterlife, the trainings of Akaris and Matt intensify
  under the master teachings of King Kai.<br>
  <br>
  During all of these new events, their has been many strange happenings upon
  the surface of Quazar. Soon after the Olympian Saga, a war between the
  Gemanite nation and a guild known only as The Black 7 took place. The Gemanite
  nation was quickly loosing. Their only hope was to turn to the Mystics.
  Unfortunately, the happenings in the Great War were still fresh in the minds
  of the Mystics. To the great dismay of the Gemanites, the Mystics simply
  reinterated that their alliance was just a cease fire between the two
  nations. Without the help of the Mystics, the capital city of the Gemanites,
  Zione, was quickly captured by the ruthless Black 7 who possessed power
  beyond any of the Gemanites capabilities.<br>
  <br>
  The Black 7 quickly established Zione as their own capital and enslaved
  every remaining Gemanite. The Mystics watched in horror but were unsure what
  to do. After The Black 7 established their empire, they soon informed the
  Mystic capital that they wished to keep the cease fire treaty and ensured them
  that there were absolutely no intentions of the Black 7 even attempting to
  capture the Mystic nation. Thinking that possibly The Black 7 would be a bit
  more trustworthy than the original Gemanite nation, they agreed to the treaty.<br>
  <br>
  NowThe great story continues. As life goes on, forces beyond comprehension
  are hard at work shaping something that is out of any sort of fathoming.
  Children grow older and warriors grow stronger. The time is now. The Divine
  Balance shall soon be revealed!<br>
