I'm writing a sermon on Pride, and I'd like some view points.  (My test to myself to see if I can turn out a sermon every week before I apply to seminary)  FYI- I'm Unitarian Universalist and pretty much a combo of Atheist/agnostic/humanist; but identify as UU.<br>
<br>
Here are my questions.<br>
<br>
Do you feel Pride in itself is a bad or negative thing?<br>
<br>
Do you feel there are two kinds of pride? (as called in the Bible selfish pride and I think humble pride- pride in someone else doing God's work)<br>
<br>
Do you see pride as equal to arrogance, and conceit or do you see a separation?<br>
<br>
Is there ever a time Pride is a positive?  (pride in your children, proud of your parents, your country, your heritage?)<br>
<br>
How did your parents deal with pride? (I had an aquantance tell me every time someone tells her daughter she should be a model, she has to bring her [the daughter] back down.)<br>
<br>
Anything else would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!!<br>

<br>
&quot;Do you feel Pride in itself is a bad or negative thing?&quot;<br>
<br>
My straight answer is no.  My more complex answer is that it depends on the context.  Sometimes people can let pride get in the way of reason.  In that case pride is a negative thing.  Pride can be a positive thing when you are talking about people trying to compose themselves and act properly in a group setting.  Pride can sometimes mean the difference between the employee who throws their temper tantrums in private as opposed to the middle of the board room.  In other words, it can sometimes be the opposite of shame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you feel there are two kinds of pride? (as called in the Bible selfish pride and I think humble pride- pride in someone else doing God's work)&quot;<br>
<br>
I think pride can come in different shapes and sizes.  You can have pride in your country, or you can have too much pride to admit when you are wrong.  Those are two different definitions of pride.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you see pride as equal to arrogance, and conceit or do you see a separation?&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess it depends on what kind of pride you are talking about(see above).  Pride can sometimes equal arrogance, like in the example that I provided about having too much pride to admit when you are wrong.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Is there ever a time Pride is a positive? (pride in your children, proud of your parents, your country, your heritage?)&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes.  Taking pride in your children, country or heritage can be a wonderful thing if it is done in a responsible manner.  I say &quot;responsible manner&quot; meaning that it is okay to be proud of your children and say good things about them, but not to the point where you put others down or inflate your own children's ego beyond control  Pride in country is good as long as it doesn't equate to extreme nationalistic sentiments.  Pride in heritage is good as long as that doesn't involve trying to say your heritage is the best, and as long as it doesn't seperate you too much from others.  I take pride in my heritage, but not because I think it is better than anyone else's, and I see myself as equal to all others first and foremost.  <br>
<br>
&quot;How did your parents deal with pride? (I had an aquantance tell me every time someone tells her daughter she should be a model, she has to bring her [the daughter] back down.)&quot;<br>
<br>
My parents had a pretty healthy attitude about it.  I don't want to sound like I'm bragging, so don't take this the wrong way.  I just want to cite examples, but that doesn't mean I'm full of myself, lol.  People used to compliment my parents a lot on my looks, intelligence and behavior.  This made my parents proud, and they never felt the need to try and put me down to offset any of this.  At the same time, they never let it go to their head either.  When people would tell them I should be a model, then they took it as a nice compliment, but they didn't go overboard with trying to pretend they had the best looking daughter in the world.  Since I always thought I was ugly anyway, they never felt the need to have to bring me down off a highhorse either.  I know that if any compliments would have gone to my head, then my parents would have definitely been first in line to tell me to chill out on the ego trip, but as long as they weren't going to my head, then my parents didn't mind sharing these compliments with me to help me feel good or to show they were proud.  <br>

<br>
This was written by Janeen Brady:<br>
<br>
Thinking you are better than others wanting to always be in charge lying to look good to another, bragging as your fortunes enlarge.<br>
<br>
Laughing at someone who is hurting, Claiming you know all that there is.  Scoffing at the laws your perverting, vowing you will never forgive. - Pride, assuming because youre older you are smarter as well, Pride, regarding someone who is weaker as yours to compel.<br>
<br>
Coveting the most stylish fashions, living off anothers good name, failing to control your base passions, lusting after power and fame. Pride Unwilling that you should take counsel from anyone else Pride - Expecting rewards from labos not done by yourself.<br>
<br>
Failing to give thanks for your talents, thinking that everyone should applaud, blaming when your life looses balance, Wanting to be higher than God,  Pride - Refusing to yield your will to God's.<br>
<br>
Pride - Refusing to say sorry if you should offend <br>
Pride Rejecting the love of another who would be your friend.<br>
Arrogance rebellious conceited, gossing delighting in sin, Folowing the path of the evil, hopng to defy God and win, expecting to defy God and win<br>
<br>
(did I mention it a religious based play)<br>
<br>
**********************************<br>
<br>
I think there are two kinds of pride.  I think there is the self esteem and joy in the accomplishments of yourself and those around you.  And then there is the Pride that only focuses on making You look and feel good at the expense of others or at the expense of your integrity.<br>
<br>
I think if you have to put others down to have pride, then it the &quot;bad&quot;kind.   - Hope that helps - Shirene<br>
<br>
(For some other good quotes go to www.LDS.org and do a search in the church literature section.  Use the Key words Pride and President Benson.  He gave a rousing talk on pride back while I was on my mission in 1989 ish. ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mightyk>MightyK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 218<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/11/03 12:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=184.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pride</span><hr size=1> I'll answer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you feel Pride in itself is a bad or negative thing?&quot;<br>
<br>
No I don't feel pride is bad or negative. I also don't think it is good or positive in and of itself. Pride out of context is neutral to me. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you feel there are two kinds of pride? (as called in the Bible selfish pride and I think humble pride- pride in someone else doing God's work)&quot;<br>
<br>
I think there are several types of pride. There is the self-centered pride which to me would be more arrogance. There is also pride in ones self for over coming hurdles or doing something you weren't sure you could (I'll tell ya, I lose the 100 pounds I'm working on, I'm going to feel damn proud of myself and rightly so). Pride in concerning another person can also be good or bad.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you see pride as equal to arrogance, and conceit or do you see a separation?&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess I kinda answered this above. I think they can be the same thing, but it isn't necessarily the case all the time. Arrogance and conceit might usually come with a ton of pride, but the reverse isn't always true.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is there ever a time Pride is a positive? (pride in your children, proud of your parents, your country, your heritage?)&quot;<br>
<br>
I think pride can be a positive. If you are working hard at something, yeah you should be darn proud of yourself for finishing it. I am proud of my DD who isn't even three when she uses her manners, shares toys beautifully, shows empathy for another child who she might have accidently hurt or was hurt by someone/something else, things like that. I am proud of my parents too, my parents were teenagers when they got married. My Mom wasn't even 18 year. And they are still married 33 years later and happily so. They had a hard life at times, yet managed to work through it all and for the most part kept all the troubles from us children (I never ever saw them fight). They are a great role model. I am going to ditto what Stacey had to say for the most part on the rest because I agree. <br>
<br>
&quot;How did your parents deal with pride? (I had an aquantance tell me every time someone tells her daughter she should be a model, she has to bring her [the daughter] back down.)&quot;<br>
<br>
My parents never felt the need to bring us down after a compliment. I hate hearing people do that. But we were taught that things we were born with -brains, looks (not really my family lol), special talents - mean little if you don't use them. They were happy my brother and I got good grades, but weren't proud of us for the most part because we didn't even try to get them. When we worked and tried to accomplish something, then yeah, they were proud of us and let us know that we should have pride in that achievement because we worked at it. Mainly they taught us that no one can control what they are born with, its how they go on to use their talents that matter. My twin brother hasn't worked in 2 years. And yet he is one of the smartest people I know. But pride isn't something he should feel because he hasn't accomplished anything. I am a lousy home-maker, by nature I'm a slob who lives in clutter (from the time I was a baby), yet I'm working really hard to keep a house neat and tidy, cook meals my whole family will eat, trying to fill my toddlers need for learning (she is a sponge and can't get enough), and so on and so forth, and yeah, this is so new and hard for me (before I just did the minimum around the house) and now that I've found the system that works and I'm keeping it up, ohh yeah You better believe I'm proud of myself for it.<br>

For cleaning (still working on organization, you should see my desk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) I put up a chore board for all members of the family, except Edison who at 7 months is too young, with a list of chores that has to be done each day. And I stick to it. I have found that it gives me focus on knowing which rooms are suppose to be picked up on a given day and I'm not overwhelmed by it all.<br>
<br>
Today because today is a workout day (and I share child watching with a friend) I am going to clean the living room and my DD's bedroom. DD's chore is to help me with it. DH's chore (which I've a 50% chance he will actually do) is to take out the trash. I need to label (haven't yet) the boxes that things are suppose to go into (toy wise) so when its DH's turn to pick up he knows where things are suppose to go. I have an area for DD's living room toys and they all during the pickup are suppose to go in that area. DS's toys are put in another area and I keep a box out that toys that belong in DD's room go into when I pick up the living room. On days I clean DD's room I take the box and put those toys back in her room. I sweep and vacuum on those days in those rooms. Haven't gotten to the point where I'm organized to also dust (what needs dusting is still a collecting station of items of DH I have no clue what to do with). But I don't do rooms if they aren't on the board and I haven't done my board rooms yet. No matter how bad the rooms are (and watching other children can make the rooms bad) board rooms come first. <br>
<br>
I mark off the chores I did with a slash through and chores I (or DH etc) didn't do with an X through it. The board I use is a dry erase board with the days of the week on it (suppose to be for a month but I do it weekly with each week a person's chore for each day). At the bottom I put what we are having for dinner each night and the items I need to buy for that dinner. This way I only have to go to the store once a week (unless I forget to buy something - it happens more then I like lol). I also schedual in days off from all chores or I wouldn't take days off and I start feeling really bitchy. I put in fun things for us to do (swimming etc) as a goal to earn on days off from chores. On one of DH's days off he is to take DD out and play while I do a massive clean up if I've gotten behind for the week. If I'm on top for the week, I get to use that time for myself. Work on some of my own projects. <br>
<br>
Its not perfect yet, but its keeping my house clean enough that I love having company again. And it is really helping my emotional state. The house being untidy was making my depression so much worse. And having it clean and tidy is really perking me up. I would like DH to do his chores, but he is slowly learning to do them. Making sure he has to write in 2 or 3 dinners a week also makes sure he at least looks at the board which has helped him remember to do some chores.<br>
<br>
I felt silly at first, needing a chore board. Made me feel like a child. But I needed the focus to know where to start. And I don't move from the room I start on to a different room, until the first is done. Because we live in a small apt (with way too much stuff), I do the rooms fairly often, so even if I do miss one chore, it won't get too bad (though the kitchen might need the floors scrubbed if I miss that one due to having a baby learning to self-feed) until the next day its schedualed to be cleaned or until I finish and feel up to it on another chore day.<br>
<br>
Does that make sense?<br>

<br>
&quot;Do you feel Pride in itself is a bad or negative thing?&quot;<br>
<br>
No. The straight definition (excluding a family of lions) is-<br>
<br>
1 : the quality or state of being proud: as a : inordinate self-esteem : CONCEIT b : a reasonable or justifiable self-respect c : delight or elation arising from some act, possession, or relationship &lt;parental pride&gt;<br>
2 : proud or disdainful behavior or treatment : DISDAIN<br>
3 a : ostentatious display b : highest pitch : PRIME<br>
4 : a source of pride : the best in a group or class<br>
<br>
but I think of pride as taking pleasure or joy in accomplishments-your own or others. I think what gets confused is this sense of what the Greeks called hubris. I don't see this so much as simple pride, rather pride in combination with other things like superiority, rudeness, irrationality. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you feel there are two kinds of pride? (as called in the Bible selfish pride and I think humble pride- pride in someone else doing God's work)&quot;<br>
<br>
The Greeks addressed this before xians, but I'd have to still say, that I don't think there are different kinds of pride, just feelings that when combined with pride have nasty consequences. (sort of like passion...)<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you see pride as equal to arrogance, and conceit or do you see a separation?&quot;<br>
<br>
Separation. Arrogance is defined as &quot;a feeling or an impression of superiority manifested in an overbearing manner or presumptuous claims&quot; and may be mistakenly identified as pride by some, but it's very different. <br>
One can be proud of being a xian without feeling they are better, more intellignet, enlightened or special than others and without intruding on their personal family time at home without an appt. based on the presumtion that others are too ignorant or stubborn to possibly not be like them. You know on a higher mission from god type arrogance, very different than simple pride.<br>
<br>
Is there ever a time Pride is a positive? (pride in your children, proud of your parents, your country, your heritage?)<br>
<br>
I'm always confused about pride in America since it's not an accomplishment. Being American is an accident of my birth that makes me feel lucky, but not proud. Being proud of children, parents embracing culture and honoring history...sure that's all pride and nothing wrong with it. We should take pride in a job well done, choosing to do right, respecting others, and in our families and loved ones when they do these things.<br>
<br>
&quot;How did your parents deal with pride?&quot;<br>
<br>
My mom was great about telling us she was proud, but humility was pushed bigtime through religion and since they were all farmers/blue collar. Not putting on airs (sp?) so to speak or acting too fancy, but nothing freaky. <br>
<br>
I think people who have a reason to be proud or have self confidence should and without apology. If you do or feel anything involving pleasure at the expense of others it's wrong, not because of pride but sadism. <br>
