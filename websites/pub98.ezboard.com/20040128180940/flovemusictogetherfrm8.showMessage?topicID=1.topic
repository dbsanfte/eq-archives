While the author isn't more familiar with other Mraz shows (which, to be sure, were a hell of a lot better!), he expresses a lot of interesting insight into the current state of music, and what I believe is the current state of our generation, where the country is going, etc.  Read it, and believe even more in the vision of LMT!<br>
<br>
From: Lefsetz<br>
Subject: Jason Mraz At The Wiltern<br>
<br>
<br>
One of the great hangs in rock and roll is Rena's office. At the Wiltern. <br>
@#%$ the show, I go for the HANG!<br>
<br>
So I was ELATED that Eric invited me to the show. He said come for dinner! <br>
We'll catch a few numbers. Then HANG OUT!<br>
<br>
Only one problem, I fell asleep. I didn't only not make it for dinner, I <br>
didn't make it for kickoff either. The show was supposed to start at 9:15, I got <br>
there at 9:30. Parked in my privileged space underneath the building. Went <br>
for a pee. Looked through the door to see that the act was ON (he was) and <br>
then went straight for Rena's office, a modern day salon.<br>
<br>
I found myself talking to Kathrine. She was filling me in on business. How <br>
all the shows were doing.<br>
<br>
And you know it's not 1973 anymore. You can get a ticket to ANYTHING!<br>
<br>
But not Jason Mraz. Jason Mraz was SOLD OUT!<br>
<br>
I thought I heard her wrong. But then she said she was saved by the twenty <br>
tickets turned back in by the label. TWENTY TICKETS MAKING A DIFFERENCE?<br>
<br>
And while we're standing there, Eric comes in.<br>
<br>
Uh-oh. I'm gonna get busted.<br>
<br>
I admit that I haven't caught any of the show. I learned LONG ago that <br>
honesty is the best policy. But Eric was just looking at me with this shocked <br>
look. A kind of smile. Like he'd just had sex and I was about to find out.<br>
<br>
He told me I had to SEE THIS!<br>
<br>
And as we're walking through the lobby to the showroom, he starts talking <br>
about the babes. The way Jason Mraz CONNECTS!<br>
<br>
Sometimes I think the people at record labels know NOTHING! They're under <br>
some ILLUSION that MUSIC is cyclical and the audience will purchase WHATEVER <br>
they're selling.<br>
<br>
This is patently UNTRUE! The AUDIENCE is cyclical.<br>
<br>
And we haven't seen an audience like this since...the sixties.<br>
<br>
In the sixties we had the baby boomers. A HUGE cache of teenagers who <br>
thought they RULED, who didn't give a @#%$ what their parents thought.<br>
<br>
The exact same situation exists today. With the KIDS of the baby boomers.<br>
<br>
And in the early sixties, the music business sold the baby boomers girl and <br>
boy groups, that sang essentially MEANINGLESS music, but were QUITE GOOD! You <br>
don't want to argue with the Four Seasons canon.<br>
<br>
And you don't want to argue with a lot of the Backstreet Boys' hits. &quot;Quit <br>
Playing Games (With My Heart)&quot; is one of the BEST records of the nineties. If <br>
you don't think so, do me a favor. QUIT! Start selling real estate. Open up <br>
a restaurant. You're cocking up the works. You're so out of touch you're <br>
getting in the WAY!<br>
<br>
The Backstreet Boys were NOT New Kids On The Block. New Kids On The Block <br>
SUCKED! It was all a hype. And, there WAS a lot of hype involved in the boy <br>
bands of the nineties, but there was ALSO a great deal of good material.<br>
<br>
So think about it. You're hooked on the Backstreet Boys. What do you want <br>
NEXT? MARILYN MANSON??<br>
<br>
God, makes me want to go through these labels run by these baby boomers with <br>
their coiffed hair firing an UZI!<br>
<br>
What we had with the Backstreet Boys was...cute boys who could sing who <br>
performed melodic material.<br>
<br>
That's not what's going on in rock today. God, everything's a REACTION to <br>
what's come before. If you're a teenager, how can you UNDERSTAND IT if you <br>
didn't LIVE THROUGH THE HISTORY!<br>
<br>
It's SO simple. Kids NOW want MORE meaningful material sung by people who <br>
can sing!<br>
<br>
And if you doubt me, go see Jason Mraz. It'll blow your @#%$ mind.<br>
<br>
I DIDN'T GET THE MEMO! I thought Jason was just another Elektra priority. <br>
No different from a million hypes.<br>
<br>
But I've got to tell you, tonight was like the Beatles on &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot;. The <br>
hall was PACKED with screaming girls who knew every word.<br>
<br>
It was positively jaw-dropping. The audience was PUTTY in Jason's hands. <br>
They were IN LOVE with this cute guy in street clothes who could PLAY!<br>
<br>
Look at all that description. Cute! The BEATLES were cute. STREET CLOTHES! <br>
That's the acts of the late sixties and seventies, no artifice, all honesty, <br>
all reality, all the time! They were reflecting REAL LIFE!<br>
<br>
And Jason could play. Didn't hit a bum note. And when the band came in, <br>
there was a mellifluous whole. Sans tapes, sans Pro Tools.<br>
<br>
While the majors are using the MOTTOLA formula of old farts cowriting hits <br>
for DANCERS who CAN'T EVEN SING, the audience has made a left turn.<br>
<br>
If you think it's about Britney...<br>
<br>
You see the audience USED to be into Britney. Actually, their first concert <br>
was the Spice Girls. They saw Britney's extravaganza in the arena.<br>
<br>
But they're done with that. They need more SUBSTANCE!<br>
<br>
There were NO parents in attendance. This was PROBABLY HALF of the <br>
audience's FIRST SHOW ALONE! They'd GROWN UP! This music, Jason Mraz's music, was an <br>
EVOLUTION from what they'd cut their teeth on.<br>
<br>
God, it was some weird 'FEAR FACTOR&quot;!<br>
<br>
It was like &quot;Surf City&quot; on STEROIDS! Two girls for every boy? TWENTY GIRLS <br>
FOR EVERY BOY!!!<br>
<br>
They were there...showing their bellies, and their fully-developed tits. It <br>
was a STATUTORY RAPE TEST! Could you look at all this young, nubile flesh and <br>
NOT TOUCH!<br>
<br>
Their minds might say girl, but their bodies say WOMAN!<br>
<br>
And when I walk into the pit, Jason's singing some quiet song with just his <br>
bassist and percussionist. Lilting. But, THEN, he slows it down, almost <br>
stops, and tells everybody to sing along. And, from just under the RAFTERS, the <br>
assembled THOUSANDS sing &quot;Our House&quot; full force.<br>
<br>
Yup, the CSNY song. Jason melds it into one of his own numbers. A number <br>
ONLY on a live CD, sold via the Net.<br>
<br>
You should have seen it. These girls knew EVERY WORD! Grooved their lithe <br>
bodies in motion with the music. It was like a secret society I was not a <br>
part of. They knew ALL these songs I'd NEVER heard. They were holding up their <br>
CELL PHONES, to play the music for friends, they were shooting digital PHOTOS!<br>
<br>
And Jason wasn't playing down to them. No, he was being his mid-twenty self. <br>
He was so cute and cool, even I wanted to @#%$ him.<br>
<br>
And I figured he'd do a cover as an encore. The closest he came was when his <br>
guitarist played the line from Frampton's &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do&quot;. He had <br>
enough material to play almost TWO HOURS!<br>
<br>
It was revelatory, it was SHOCKING! HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN??<br>
<br>
After the show I spoke with sixteen year old Elizabeth. She said it was the <br>
NET!<br>
<br>
Then Bill Silva confirmed this. How else to explain that gig in Cincinnati <br>
almost a year ago where they'd had no airplay and had moved only 80 CDs but all <br>
500 tickets were sold and 150 people were turned away!<br>
<br>
Now I'm not gonna tell you that Jason Mraz's material is of the quality of <br>
James Taylor's or Jackson Browne's. But, go back to your collection, was every <br>
record that good?? And, normally, I get bored stiff. But I stood there for <br>
the remaining hour and twenty minutes of the show. I COULDN'T leave. It was a <br>
RELIGIOUS meeting. They were revealing the secret of life, I didn't want to <br>
MISS OUT! These kids had DISCOVERED SOMETHING, all by their LONESOME! It <br>
wasn't jammed down their throats, it was relatively organic. Oh, there was a <br>
video, and some airplay, but not commensurate with THIS!<br>
<br>
Go to jasonmraz.com. Find the closest gig and go. It will blow your @#%$ <br>
mind.<br>
<br>
EVERYTHING the fat cats and the RIAA are telling us is phony baloney <br>
bullshit. Music isn't on the verge of dying. It's REINVENTING ITSELF! It's <br>
spontaneous generation, from the performers and the audience. The fat cats want to <br>
HARNESS it, but they're CLUELESS! Jason Mraz signed with a major, but I've got <br>
to tell you, he didn't NEED TO, and the next Jason WON'T!<br>
<br>
And the next Jason won't be a Fred Durst kiss-ass. Won't be a <br>
plastic-surgeried Britney. Won't be a can't sing J. Lo. Won't be a dancing fool. No, he's <br>
gonna be the kid sitting next to you in high school. Who plays music because <br>
he MUST! He's just got to EXPRESS HIMSELF!<br>
<br>
And he won't need a band to get his act across. Just he and his acoustic <br>
will be enough.<br>
<br>
Oh, the band explorations, the Genesis-type acts, will come later.<br>
<br>
But not right now.<br>
<br>
Just like the people in Jefferson Airplane could sing. Just like David <br>
Clayton Thomas could sing. Everybody coming down the pike is gonna be TALENTED, <br>
able to sing AND write. My advice? LET THEM BE, LET THEM DO THEIR OWN THING! T HEY know their audience, YOU don't. Don't be a meddler, be a FACILITATOR!<br>
<br>
Tonight I saw the future of the music business. And it was THRILLING!<br>
