Before I get started there is a wonderful feature on the official website, download the monthly calendar to use as your background:<br>

<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://andromedatv.com/galleries/wallpaper_cal.html">andromedatv.com/galleries...r_cal.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Opening quote: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Any fool can be honest, for it is only what he knows. A wise man is aware of when to share the truth.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
At last an opening quote that is appropriate, for it is a message to this reviewer. Do I cover up my reaction to this episode, and be wise? Or do I give my honest reaction, and thus be a fool? A fool for your lovin', as Harper and Beka can attest to this week. I give this episode the rating of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Stinkosaurus,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a breed of reptile that went extinct through sheer incompetence. Next Generation fans will recognize elements of this episode from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Outrageous Okuna</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Hunted,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with all the fun surgically removed. There are some positives such as Harper getting some romance, but they're far and few between the belly laughs. On to the review.<br>
<br>
Stop the tape! I have something to complain about before we even see our first cast member. A close shot of the Andromeda (top down) is shown, with some sort of indistinct gray background behind it. Is it a nebula? Is it a galaxy? Is it a planet? We don't know, because it's a lousy shot. Later in this episode, we twice see beautiful shots of the planet they are orbiting. So why show us this crap at the start, if the planet looks this good? It doesn't help that later in the episode they show a stock shot of Florida with blue ocean beside it, the color doesn't match the planet shots. It's like that scene in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kentucky Fried Movie</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> where they show the Statue of Liberty with the caption &quot;Hong Kong&quot;. (Only they were joking.)<br>
<br>
Harper and Trance share some chatter about the nature of love, and we switch to Beka who is testifying as a character witness for a &quot;ABLE LADRONE&quot;. I'm sure it looked good on paper, but throughout the episode you've got people referring to &quot;something DRONE&quot;, which is confusing. One expects to see an Andromeda drone wander onto the screen. (Don't worry about that, the drones have been destroyed, apparently.)<br>
<br>
It's a cute scene where Beka's attempts to &quot;vouch&quot; for this guy keep setting off their lie detector. Finally she loses patience and cripples several guards, demanding the release of her friend. Thank goodness he wasn't being kept 9000 miles away on another continent, right? (chuckle) Beka retrieves this guy and runs down the corridor, where Tyr is laying around. Tyr wakes up and beats up some guards, and they bail.<br>
<br>
We return from commercial break to find the Andromeda crew being threatened by the planetary representative to turn over Ladrone, or face the consequences. The consequences being a fairly interesting new threat called &quot;Technocorp&quot;, a giant military/industrial complex of the type that President Eisenhower warned about. At this point Beka introduces us to Ladrone. I nearly slipped into unconscious upon his first lines, and it didn't improve with his later scenes. Best known for his starring role on KUNG FU THE LEGEND CONTINUES, I'm sure Chris Potter is a great actor. But I believe he was terribly miscast for this role, has zero chemistry with Lisa Ryder, and was rather unbelievable as a con man. Like the senator from last week (or Naz from a few more back), he's just plain annoying. <br>
<br>
Beka and Trance go down several dozen corridors discussing this guy, and for those keeping track, the human crew has once again COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED from the ship! Corridor after corridor of deserted ship, snaking through one passage after another, and there's nobody else to be seen. Not one other person, the whole episode. It's pretty funny. Look at us, all alone on the warship!<br>
<br>
At this point I'm hoping Harper will jack into the planetary computer and shut the whole place down, but no dice. Harper discusses his lack of a love life with Rommie. We switch to a scene I suppose was intended to build a loving bond between Beka and LaTrine. I tried slumping into the sofa to get away, but it didn't help. <br>
<br>
Able LaTrine: You have my permission... I implore you to shoot me!<br>
<br>
Please, shoot the audience first, to get out of this scene. Latrine moves to kiss Beka, but Beka is called to the bridge. At this point, LaTrine hasn't had to explain squat to Beka or anybody else, the only information we've gotten so far is from the honest planetary representative. LaTrine has stolen some fancy DNA, presented as technobabble normally employed on Voyager. We'll see more technobabble (at the expense of real plot) later. But now, Technocorp is on the way to apprehend the figitive. <br>
<br>
You may ask where Dylan is in all this. There's some plot explanation, but best I can figure is that Dylan locked himself in his quarters for the whole episode until this was all over. He had Harper fake the shots of him flying away elsewhere. (As if it's believable Dylan could get very far with one of these fighters.)<br>
<br>
Okay, so new plan: Beka and LaTrine take the Eureka Maru out so they can be helpless to warrior assault teams, while the Andromeda flies a couple people out to rescue. During this, Andromeda herself just sits and spins. Just like last week. Why not just make Andromeda a space station? Call it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Deep Space A.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It's never used for its stated purpose, they always have to use the gimmick of getting people out on the Maru where they are then in more danger. Stooopid.<br>
<br>
LaTrine confides to Beka about the DNA technology he is carrying. It should be obvious just from Beka's opening character statement on the guy that he's lying to her in the here and now. But Beka doesn't catch on until the end. She's blinded by love! (Or a bad plot.)<br>
<br>
The planetary representative shows up on Andromeda, and he's brought a babe. If anything, this should have brought Dylan out of his quarters, he can smell a babe a lightyear away. Harper takes an interest in her, and she reciprocates, at least for the time being. A nice change for Harper.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Rommie and Tyr have decided to fly a slipfighter out to rescue Beka and her boy toy. After seeing Rommie fight in the last few episodes, I guess Tyr realizes he needs a real fighter on board if he's going to rescue anyone. (grin) We then join Beka and LaTrine in progress, as they are down to their underwear and making out. This is reminiscent of Dylan making out with that First Officer last week while they were all facing imminent death from Nietzchean fighters. Yeah, you're wanted by an entire planet and the giant Technocorp, no reason to be worried. The sad thing is, I imagine Beka would have worked in a quickie and then concentrated on saving their lives. Pretty silly scene, but I guess it's risque for syndicated tv.<br>
<br>
Their fun is broken up by an alert, a slipfighter rather unrealistically lands on the hull. Given the context, this is clearly Tyr and Rommie, who were just shown flying their slipfighter towards them. But that's not the case, these are crazed Technocorp mercenaries. And they provide the first big belly laugh of the episode. As Beka and LaTrine ready themselves for battle, the boarders rappel down from the ceiling on ropes. Every one of them has little sparkler jets attached to their boots! It's the funniest thing. Was this supposed to be like Iron Man's boot jets?<br>
<br>
These goons all wear cheap helmets, with the word &quot;TECHNO&quot; written across them on masking tape. Now I can imagine how this assault went down. The boss prepares the men for this mission, and tells them their body armor incorporates the most advanced electronics ever devised to help them complete the mission. Nothing but the best for his men. As soon as they leave, an assistant asks if that's true, and the boss says no. That would have been too expensive. The only thing they did for them was write TECHNO on their helmets.<br>
<br>
Previously in the episode, the Andromeda crew swears up and down that Beka and her buddy haven't harmed anyone. Here we see Beka cheerfully space one of the invaders to vacuum. So much for that. As they run down a corridor, LaTrine watches as Beka engages in hand to hand with an invader. She shoots him in the chest, at LaTrine's shocked expression. So, it's okay if she casts one of them into space, to aphyxiate and freeze his eyeballs, but if she shoots him personally, it's shocking! (chuckle)<br>
<br>
I'm not an expert on deep space mercenary assaults, but wouldn't it be best to bring an air supply if you're breaching another ship's hull? I don't know why they didn't just shoot out the Maru's front windows, wait for the passengers to die, and then pick up the bodies. Plenty of flash-frozen DNA to retrieve, right?<br>
<br>
There's only two invaders left, and Beka and boy toy appear helpless. There are tremendous sparks when these guys get shot, that's what you get for strapping all those sparklers to your feet. Tyr and Rommie appear out of nowhere and charge down the corridor, wasting the remaining bad guys. Maybe they and the Techno invaders carpooled in the same Slipfighter?<br>
<br>
Harper gets some quality time with the blonde, who is written to have the depth of a Double Mint twin.<br>
<br>
Lyra: And you want to know if I have any implants?<br>
<br>
Titillating. The Maru has docked, is that Slipfighter still stuck on it? Beka and Rommie discuss Able LaTrine, Rommie tells her his DNA isn't an exact match.<br>
<br>
Harper is trying his best with the young lady, but she's finding ways to be dishonest with him without lying outright. Lyra takes off one side of her outfit. <br>
<br>
Lyra: So, do you wield all your tools with such confidence?<br>
<br>
Oh come on! What an eye roller. This episode was written by a woman, former Xena writer Emily Skopov. Now imagine you're this young actress, KRISTI ANGUS. This is your big break on television. You've got your family watching, your mom and dad, grandma, and the aunts and uncle. And this is what they see? Glad I'm not in acting, this is a terrible way to break into the field.<br>
<br>
Beka breaks up the fun, shoving Harper around for daring to take a DNA sample from LaTrine. Well so what? It's more than Beka did, and she has experience with ex-boyfriends not being what she remembered (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Be All My Sins Remembered.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->). <br>
<br>
Note: We can see Lyra walking in the corridor behind Beka, she has apparently put on her shoulder garment again. Later on the bridge, this garment has once again disappeared, and while on the bridge reappears again!<br>
<br>
We go to commercial, there's an ad for next week's ep, Rev Bem's return. But from the looks of things, he will be tidily eliminated by the end of the episode, figuratively or literally. Not a very happy return, but I'm only going by the commercial.<br>
<br>
There is a massive slipfighter fleet zooming in on our heroes. (Why is it they are heroes, again?) This fleet is from Technocorp, and they apparently don't care much for the people on Andromeda or the ones from the planet. Beka suggests using &quot;Plasma Phantoms&quot; to fool this fleet. This is known as relying on technobabble to resolve situations rather than actual plot or the strength of the characters. This phenomena first became widely discussed with the Voyager television series, it was a trademark that they would resolve episodes this way. Borg fleet approaching? Not to worry, just realign the focault demistators, and the entire Borg fleet blows up! Problem solved, no writing required. Contrast this to where Picard or Kirk would win through the strength of their command decisions. Sad to see such a bad writing crutch being embraced on this show.<br>
<br>
Beka confronts LaTrine about being dishonest with her. Um, like how her brother was dishonest with her? And Bobby Jensen was dishonest with her? And Uncle Sid was dishonest with her? This episode was supposedly a kick-butt Beka Valentine episode. But instead it portrays her as a lovestruck fool. Why weren't you having this scene 8 minutes into the episode, Beka? You did risk your life to save him, and you weren't demanding answers for what sort of trouble he was in? (No, let's see how fast we can get in our underwear!)<br>
<br>
We return from commercial to see the giant fleet surrounding the Andromeda, as Beka and Tyr walk slowly and unconcernedly down a corridor. Dylan shows up, and Beka fills him in on the situation. LaTrine shows up, he draws a gun on them. Harper and the rest show up at the other end of the corridor. Harper moves to &quot;protect&quot; Lyra, but it's funny. He only reaches his hands around her for a cheap feel. She still presents a larger target than he does. <br>
<br>
We reach another hilarious scene, where LaTrine has his eyes locked with Dylan Hunt's. We switch to Beka for a quick reaction shot, and then back to LaTrine.<br>
<br>
LaTrine (still looking precisely in Dylan's direction): I love you.<br>
<br>
(chuckle) LaTrine gets blown away, and there are two weird guys with sunglasses who sidle up behind Dylan and Beka. Apparently these are the representatives of Technocorp. (&quot;We are Nester.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Wrapping things up, Dylan and the planetary representative have a chat. And here we get an apparent blooper, the actor couldn't remember his lines, and the director decided to leave it in. The director must have said, what the heck, the rest of this crap doesn't make any sense, who will notice?<br>
<br>
Dylan: Let me walk you back to your ship. <br>
Marshall Orac: By the way, we interviewed Miss Valentine. We're sure she knew very little of Ladrone's work. Rumors were circulating the Commonwealth and we were looking at the possibilities... widespread chaos and panic.<br>
<br>
If anyone can tell me what the good Marshall's first two sentences have to do with his third sentence, let me know. <br>
<br>
Harper parts with Lyra, and doesn't even get a kiss goodbye. As she walks past Dylan, Dylan gives a look back at Harper, and escorts her out. Maybe that means the captain will do her on the shuttle ride down to the planet.<br>
<br>
There's some additional wrapup involving Dylan and LaTrine faking his death, but I kind of stopped caring after the Marshall's inane dialogue. Seeing this guy come back to life made me want to bleed from my ears. It's like one of my friends said after we went to see Judge Dredd. One of the closing scenes was of the sidekick being taken out on a stretcher: &quot;What really sucked is that Rob Schneider got shot and didn't stay dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harper gets &quot;consoled&quot;, if that's the word for it, by Dylan and Trance on being blown off by that girl. And that's the end, Harper is left being called a loser. Here's what Harper's closing dialogue should have been:<br>
<br>
Harper: I'd remind both of you that on several occasions if not for Seamus Zelazny Harper, you'd be frozen chunks of fleshy debris. @#$% you and your sympathy. Next time you need the Slipstream drive up and running, I'll remember your support. No, let's call it condescension. How's that for honesty?!<br>

I really felt bad for Harper at the end. But it seemed his shipmates didn't feel too bad for him. <br>
The Right Horse was a little better for me cause I'm such a big fan of Chris Potter. (how dare you call him LaTrine..<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) I wish he'd have been someone other than an old friend/new love of Beka's. <br>
Loved that we had less of Dylan...even if we had to pay the price of having him 'save the day' at the end. Most everyone had good lines, but some of them seemed in poor taste, inappropriate and even a little mean spirited instead of funny and lighthearted. Do these people trust and/or even like each other anymore. Sometimes it's hard to tell. Did we lose whatever family or close-knit feeling there was when Rev left....or maybe that was part of the blackhole left when Robert was let go.<br>
Beka pulling a gun on her 'friends' was also a sore spot. <br>
Stil another was Beka grabbing Harper by the collar and hauling him away just as he was about to kiss Lira. Now would that happen to Dylan, Tyr or Beka. Nope....we're supposed to think that Harper  constantly being on the short end (sorry, no pun intended there) of the romance department is funny. Oh, look....duped by the girl AGAIN. Ha ha ha....NOT!! All I see is a big double standard and GMW being allowed only to be comic-relief man and NOT playing a fully fleshed-out character. I'm still waiting for a truly 'Harper-centric' episode this season where we learn something about him. A little character growth and maybe some backstory is all I'm asking for, But somehow I feel I'm only going to be disappointed.  <p>It's the end of the world as we know it...and I feel fine.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=consubstantial>consubstantial</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/examples/fhpp036.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=purple, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='user title'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table><a

There was a female walking in the corridor behind Beka, in the scene where Beka confronts Harper about taking a sample of LaDrone's DNA. That was Lyra, the girl Harper was with. I recognized the uniform. <br>

I found it appalling, like they were cartoon characters. Harper hasn't gotten any for the entire run of the show.<br>

It was hard to top LaDrone, that was pretty weird. I thought the actor would chuckle and make funny faces at the oddest times, like near the end where LaDrone remarked on Dylan's arrival. He didn't seem to keep in character.<br>

Having him show up and insult Harper's nerdiness with his PDAs really rubbed me the wrong way.<br>

<br>
It's impossible to know whether this was from Emily Skopov's script, or changes by upper management. But regardless, this is the look and feel of the show they are happy with. And one does indeed wonder why anyone on this crew likes each other, or continues travelling together. What is the point anymore?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Stil another was Beka grabbing Harper by the collar and hauling him away just as he was about to kiss Lira. Now would that happen to Dylan, Tyr or Beka. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

It's insulting writing. Harper's short, so everyone can shove him around, right?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Oh, look....duped by the girl AGAIN. Ha ha ha....NOT!! </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, that closing scene flew like an lead brick.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>!! All I see is a big double standard and GMW being allowed only to be comic-relief man and NOT playing a fully fleshed-out character.

<br>
Well said, and precisely my reaction upon seeing The Shards of Rimni. I've got everyone telling me what a great action hero that episode showed Harper to be. Meanwhile I watch it, and all I see is Harper being insulted and demeaned by Dylan in scene after scene. A dog would have gotten better treatment.<br>
<br>
When you trivialize the rest of the cast to somehow make the hero look good, it backfires. Just like when you dumb down the villains to make the hero look good, it backfires. It looks like the Andromeda team is on a roll. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the excellent points, it's a shame the Andromeda team doesn't care for input.<br>

Good line, maybe Rommie will take him up on it. No one else seems to find either of them attractive. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Hi Kylie. I didn't notice your absence, but I appreciate the conversation. We don't have many people to talk about Andromeda with, it's pretty much just a few of us.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Please. I knew it was a planet before they showed it on the Andromeda screen. I mean, come on! I thought it was pretty obvious.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Watched the opening scene twice, I'm fairly certain what I saw. It was an extreme closeup (top down) of the Andromeda, meaning the ship filled the whole screen. In the space and gaps around the ship, there was an indistinct gray background, no land or blue ocean discernable. I'll stick with my story, it was a lousy shot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Heh...   Yeah... well, I figured it out later on...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You're not alone, a lot of people mistook his name. The only reason I knew different was that I had seen the name beforehand on the internet. It didn't help that many of the actors emphasized the DRONE part of the name every time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The ship is big. Real big. They can't always be around the same area all the time. Besides, it's not like there're thousands of 'em on board.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I mentioned this because the scene where Trance and Beka walked through the corridors went on for a VERY long time. They turned about 6 corridors during their dialogue, a desolate ghost ship through the entire scene. That's pretty sad. And for the record, this isn't the only episode like this. <br>
<br>
In For Whom The Bell Tolls, for example, the command staff had to go through the entire ship setting traps for those space maggots. In scene after scene, we see the stars walking through deserted corridors setting these traps. Why not just write dialogue ordering the human crew to do this? This is stupid and avoidable. If they don't have the budget to show a crew, at least write dialogue that indicates they are there. <br>
<br>
Not a single word of dialogue in The Right Horse even indicates there is a human crew aboard. And they're not shown. What is the viewer supposed to think?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I know! It's like they didn't think we were smart enough to figure out who they were ourselves! Then again, I thought Tyr n' Rommie were supposed to board...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I think Technocorp should invest in better helmets. Imagine how hard it is to use those helmets as a pickup line. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&gt;that's what you get for strapping all those sparklers to your feet.<br>
LOL! What were those things for anyways??</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I don't know, but whenever they got shot, all of their sparklers would go off. Very dangerous to strap those things to your feet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hehehe...Silly, he wasn't looking at Dylan when he said that, you could see his eyes shifted and looked lower (ta Beka). Check again, you'll see. Oh! But no, you DIDN'T tape it now DID you!? </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
My brother tried to correct me on that also, but he's not writing the review, is he? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And here we get an apparent blooper, the actor couldn't remember his lines,<br>
Really?! Where?? I wanna see!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Go back and look at the dialogue I quote between Dylan and Marshall Orac. Marshall Orac's third line (especially if you watch him say it) is just mumbling incoherence. It doesn't make any sense, it is meaningless gibberish. But since the rest of the episode is pretty close to that, the director decided to leave it in!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lol at what Harper should of said! But ya know, Beka did say something after pushing him down the corridor... But that's pretty much it . </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I'd rather see Harper as captain at this point. Then Beka would be the &quot;captain's woman&quot;.<br>
