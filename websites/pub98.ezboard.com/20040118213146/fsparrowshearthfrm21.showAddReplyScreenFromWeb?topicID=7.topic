post first.. so here goes.<br>
<br>
I think the Bible shows that once we are a member of God's family, we are ALWAYS a member of God's family. There is only one kind of life Jesus gives us, ETERNAL LIFE. Nothing, no one, can remove us from God's hands. David over and over talked about how God is our Rock, our Salvation, how He is our Refuge, and how He will NOT forsake us..ever.  Even when God allowed Israel to be taken off into bondage, He went with them, He didn't abandon them. And the reason He allowed it was to get their attention so they would return to Him.<br>

The Bible shows us that salvation is an ongoing event and that while Salvation is a FREE gift from God that even after accepting this gift people return it.  God will never forsake us but salvation history shows that we forsake God.

But those that have accepted Jesus as Savior.<br>
<br>
(Also, ALL emphasis is mine in any of the verses I use.)<br>
<br>
&quot;But the Lord abides forever;<br>
He has established His throne for judgement,<br>
And He will judge the world in righteousness;<br>
[snip]<br>
And those who know Thy name will put their trust in Thee;<br>
For Thou, O Lord, has not forsaken those who seek Thee.&quot;<br>
~Psalm 9: 7-10<br>
<br>
&quot;How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,<br>
Whose sin is covered!<br>
How blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity&quot;<br>
~Psalm 32: 1<br>
<br>
&quot;As far as the east if from the west,<br>
So far has He removed our transgressions from us.&quot;<br>
~Psalm 103: 12 <br>
<br>
I could go on and on how David realized and wrote about how strong God's love is for us. He alone is our Salvation. He promises to never forsake us.<br>
<br>
John wrote:<br>
<br>
&quot;And the witness is this, that God has given us ETERNAL LIFE, and this life is in His Son.<br>
These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God in order that you may KNOW that you have ETERNAL LIFE.<br>
And this is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us&quot;<br>
~1 John 5: 11-14<br>
<br>
That we may KNOW.. that's key. We don't have to wonder, we don't have to worry, no guessing, we KNOW. Jesus give us ETERNAL LIFE. <br>
<br>
John also said:<br>
<br>
&quot;My sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow Me;<br>
And I give ETERNAL LIFE to them; and they shall never perish, and NO ONE shall snatch them out of My hand.<br>
My Father, who has given them to Me is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand&quot;<br>
~John 10: 27-29<br>
<br>
Which if a wondeful follow up to <br>
<br>
&quot;Behold I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands.&quot;<br>
~Isaiah 49: 16<br>
<br>
NO one, NOTHING can take us from God once we are His. Romans makes this quite clear<br>
<br>
&quot;For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principialities nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,<br>
nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus&quot;<br>

Since you used David in your examples, we’ll table the exact phrase of “those that have accepted Jesus as Savior” for the moment.  I also agree that David attested to God’s strong love for us and that God would never forsake us (as I also stated in my Opening Statement) and that He alone is our Salvation.  But God not forsaking us is DIFFERENT than us not forsaking God (as is evident that we have done throughout salvation history)!<br>
<br>
I agree with 1 John 5:11-14 and your stated assessment of it that we may know that Jesus gives us eternal life.  This passage speaks to our moral assurance of salvation but not our personal absolute assurance.  Just to note that while John 10:27-29 does use the words “no one” it does NOT use the word “NOTHING” as you stated.  Nor does it or its context suggest that one does not “lose their salvation” if they grievously sin or fall away.  The beginning of the verse states “they follow Me”.  So while Satan may not snatch a believer away, what happens when those individuals following Him choose to not follow him by committing adultery, murdering, etc?  <br>
<br>
I don’t believe that the verses quoted from Romans speak AT ALL about personal eternal security.  Nowhere does it talk about being safe from your own sin.  All the things listed in those 2 verses and the previous verses are EXTERNAL forces (things over which one has no control) and not INTERNAL forces.  In other words God is a faithful and loving God and He won’t let any external forces disrupt the salvation process, but whether an individual who claims to follow God will continue to be faithful to God is open to question.  In summary both John and Romans are speaking about general security (a moral assurance of salvation) and not individual CERTAINTY.<br>

<br>
Tommy, the &quot;nothing&quot; was my comment, not stated as scripture. But, it seems reasonable that &quot;nothing&quot; can be taken from &quot;NO ONE&quot;. Also, wouldn't &quot;NO ONE&quot; mean US? We're part of &quot;NO ONE&quot;.<br>
<br>
[what happens when those individuals following Him choose to not follow him by committing adultery, murdering, etc?]<br>
<br>
You mean like David? What did happen to him? He recieved God's judgement, the consequences for his sin, then God's forgiveness.  God doesn't forsake us, He promises to NOT forsake us. <br>
<br>
[I don’t believe that the verses quoted from Romans speak AT ALL about personal eternal security.]<br>
<br>
Why not? It speaks about being separated from God. That would mean our salvation.  <br>
<br>
[In other words God is a faithful and loving God and He won’t let any external forces disrupt the salvation process, but whether an individual who claims to follow God will continue to be faithful to God is open to question.]<br>
<br>
So, man IS stronger than all other beings in the universe? I can't agree. <br>
<br>
Also, God promises to give us strength to over come.<br>
<br>
&quot;No temptation has overtaken you but such as in common to man; and GOD IS FAITHFUL, who will NOT ALLOW you to be tempted BEYOND what you are able' but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, that you may be able to endure it.&quot;<br>
~1 Cor 10: 13<br>
<br>
God's promise is clear. I go back to:<br>
<br>
&quot;Behold I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands.&quot;<br>
~Isaiah 49: 16<br>
<br>
We are FOREVER tatooed on His palms.

The first are the angels that were in a state of grace and righteous union with God but then a third of them fell out of that state of grace.  The second is Adam and Eve who also were in a state of grace but fell from God’s grace.  Paul warns us Christians in 2 Corinthians 11:2-3 that we can fall in the same way that Eve did – “I am jealous for you, just as God is; you are like a pure virgin whom I have promised in marriage to one man only, Christ himself.  I am afraid that your minds will be corrupted and that YOU WILL ABANDON your full and pure devotion to Christ – in the same way that Eve was deceived by the snake’s clever lies.”  {Note: all emphasis throughout is mine}  The third is babies who most Christians would agree that if they were to die would be given an automatic assurance of heaven.  But once they reach the age of accountability they must fall from this grace if there is a chance any of them can be lost when they die as adults.<br>
<br>
There are many statements in the Bible that we need to persevere to the end but first we’ll look at just the Gospels.  Matthew 10:22 (dittoed in Mark 13:13) tells us “Everyone will hate you because of me.  But whoever HOLDS OUT TO THE END will be saved.”  Again in Matthew 24:13 “But whoever HOLDS OUT TO THE END will be saved.”  In Luke 8:13, Jesus tells us that there are some who receive the word with joy but because they have no root they BELIEVE for a little while and in time of temptation “THEY FALL AWAY”. They did believe (Jesus says so) but then they fell away.  In Luke 15:11-32, Jesus tells the parable of the prodigal son, in which one of the sons of the Father leaves home, is twice described by his father as being &quot;dead&quot; and then returns home and is spoken of by the Father as being &quot;alive again.&quot; So you can be a genuine son of the Father, then leave and become dead, and then return and become alive again.<br>
<br>
Looking at the other New Testament writings we find more of the same.  In 1 Corinthians 9:23-27, Paul tells us that not every runner who runs in the race will receive a prize and that he pommels his body to subdue it, lest after preaching salvation to others “I myself should be a castaway”. So Paul did not even consider his own salvation certain, but recognized that he too could fall away if he did not discipline himself in holiness.  In Galatians 5:1-4, Paul says that anyone who is circumcised becomes severed from Christ and has “fallen away from grace”. He means exactly what he says: You can be in Christ, then be severed from him and fall from grace.  In Col. 1:21-23, Paul tells us that we were once hostile to God but HAVE NOW been reconciled and WILL BE presented holy and blameless PROVIDED we continue in our faith and not shifting from the hope of the gospel. So you can already be reconciled, yet NOT be presented holy and blameless on the last day if you do not continue in your faith and shift from your hope in the gospel.<br>

<br>
I don't think this is a valid analogy. Angels are entirely different beings from humans. How God deals with them is different. We're talking about how He deals with Mankind.<br>
<br>
[The third is babies]<br>
<br>
The Bible is silent on what happens to babies. Other than David and Bathsheba's son, whom David said &quot;I will go to him&quot;, we don't know how God handles these little ones. But, I will note, that little ones are completely self absorbed. They are selfish, and have no concept of &quot;other&quot;. <br>
<br>
Which leaves<br>
[The second is Adam and Eve who also were in a state of grace but fell from God’s grace]<br>
<br>
When Adam and Eve were evicted from Eden, God made the first sacrifice on their behalf.<br>
<br>
&quot;And the Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them&quot; <br>
~Genesis 3: 20<br>
<br>
And Adam and Eve frequently referred to God and were still under His protection. They had consequences for their sin, but God made a way for them to repent. <br>
<br>
In 2 Cor 11: 3 it's talking about being &quot;led astray from the simplicity and  purity of devotion to Christ&quot;. It's not talking about one losing their eternal life. Many men have gone astray from God for a season. Look at David! He took another man's wife, and then had that man murdered. And yet, God said: <br>
<br>
&quot;I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will do all My will&quot; ~ Acts 13: 22 <br>
&quot;...The Lord has sought out for Himself a man after His own heart, and the Lord has appointed him as ruler over His people..&quot; <br>
~1 Samuel 13: 14. <br>
<br>
All over the OT it's said, over and over, &quot;David, a man of God&quot;. While David did wrong things, he was still in God's care. God didn't forsake him. David recieved consequences for his sin, but God didn't cast him out.<br>
<br>
If you are using 1 Cor 9 to show we can lose the race, then you also must  say only one will win it. (vs 24 &quot;Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win&quot;) I don't think that's what this means. I think it's saying we need to do our best in all we do. <br>
<br>
A good companion verse is 1 Tim 6: 12:<br>
<br>
&quot;Fight the good fight of faith, take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses&quot;<br>
<br>
Paul did have confidence he would not lose his salvation. <br>
<br>
&quot;For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.<br>
But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which to choose.<br>
But I am hard pressed from both directions HAVING THE DESIRE TO DEPART AND BE WITH CHRIST, for that is very much better&quot;<br>
~ Phillippians 1: 21-23<br>
<br>
If you'd gone to the next few versed in Galatians 5 you would have found the point being made. When the discussion about circumcision came up, some were saying that converts MUST be, and others saying not, because it put them back under the law. But vs 5-6 make it clear what the point is:<br>
<br>
&quot;For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness.<br>
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love&quot;<br>
<br>
Jesus give only ONE kind of life, &quot;ETERNAL&quot;.. <br>
<br>
&quot;In Him you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you WERE SEALED IN HIM with the Holy Spirit of promise&quot;<br>
~ Ephesians 1 13.<br>
<br>
And God promises He will always be with us through our temptations.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO BE TEMPTED BEYOND WHAT YOU ARE ABLE; but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, that you may be able to endure it&quot;<br>
~1 Cor 10: 13.<br>
<br>
Also we will have discernment to keep following God.<br>
<br>
&quot;For false Christs and fasle prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to mislead, IF POSSIBLE, even the elect&quot;<br>
~ Matt 24: 24<br>
<br>
God promises He will not abandon us. <br>
<br>
&quot;He who overcomes shall thus be clothed in white garments; and I WILL NOT ERASE HIS NAME FROM THE BOOK OF LIFE, and I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.&quot;<br>
~Revelation 3: 5<br>
<br>
He promises to hold onto us by faith. It's always the &quot;faith&quot; that is what counts with God. In the OT the sins are explicitly shown for the men, but in the Hebrews account, it's all &quot;BY FAITH&quot;.. That's what God sees, our faith. That's what gives us the strength to &quot;fight the good fight&quot;. Our faith in God. And, since God gives us the faith (Romans 11: 3 &quot;for through the grace given to me I say to every man among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as t have sound judgement as God has allotted to each a measure of faith&quot;) He will not take it away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=esdras>esdras</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:maroon;><b>Administrator<br>Sir Esdras,<br>Master, Knights of the Realm,<br>Peacekeeper Extraordinaire,<br>Canadian, eh.</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#B87333>(11/20/03 9:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/gsmorgan/images/ADPY005.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Point of Order</span><hr size=1> Ok, I have deleted the little conversation that occurred here (and I received the PM, thanks!) since I now realize that my Point of Order was Out of Order.

<br>
To reiterate in regards to David, while God may not forsake us, we may forsake God, which is what David did.<br>
<br>
I agree that Paul’s reference to one winner encourages us to do the best we can but then he goes on to talk about his self being disqualified from the prize and what greater prize is there than salvation, the crown that will last forever?<br>
<br>
If we look at the preceding verse in Phillippians that you quote we see Paul say “I eagerly EXPECT and HOPE that I WILL in no way be ashamed, but WILL have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exacted in my body, whether by life or by death.”  What is there to hope or expect for something that in the future will be if it’s 100% absolutely personally assured?<br>
<br>
You’re right Galatians does speak about the debate about circumcision but it mentions those who “FALL AWAY FROM GRACE” and further in verse 7 we see the race analogy again - “You were running a good race.  Who cut in on you and KEPT YOU from obeying the truth?” – and see that some have been ‘disqualified’ as Paul was afraid he might be too and warned them against.<br>
<br>
I want to reiterate that I am not arguing that God forsakes us but that we may forsake God.  We could build an argument that God wouldn’t allow us to forsake him but Paul and the gospel writers say that we must hold out to the end, that we must finish the race and not be disqualified and that some have fallen away.  That does not sound like a Once Saved Always Saved theology to me.<br>

Ok.. now to my next affirmative.<br>
<br>
&quot;Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even how many antichrists have arisen, from this we know it it is the last hour.<br>
They went out from us, BUT THEY WERE NOT REALLY OF US; FOR IF THEY HAD BEEN OF US, THEY WOULD HAVE REMAINED WITH US; but they went out, in order that it might be shown that they are not of us.<br>
But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.<br>
[snip]<br>
And this is the promise which He Himself made to us; ETERNAL LIFE.&quot;<br>
~1 John 2: 18 ff<br>
<br>
Those that &quot;leave&quot; were never part of the family of God. Jesus makes this clear again in John 10.<br>
<br>
&quot;But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.<br>
To him the doorkeeper opens; and the sheep HEAR his voice; and he calls his own sheep BY NAME, and leads them out.<br>
When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him BECAUSE THEY KNOW HIS VOICE.<br>
And a stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him because they do not know the voice of the stranger.&quot;<br>
~vs 2-5.<br>
<br>
If you go on in the chapter He points out that HE is the door and He is the good shepherd.<br>
<br>
Those that are HIS, are always HIS. He goes on in verse 27:<br>
<br>
&quot;My sheep hear My voice and I know them and they follow Me;<br>
and I give ETERNAL LIFE to them; and they shall NEVER PERISH, and NO ONE shall snatch them out of My hand.<br>
My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all; and NO ONE is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand&quot;<br>
<br>
That means the believers themselves. NO ONE is stronger than Jesus and the Father. <br>
<br>
Ephesians talks about this too.<br>
<br>
&quot;In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed you WERE SEALED IN HIM with the Holy Spirit of promise&quot;<br>
~1: 13<br>
<br>
We are creatures that cannot NOT sin.. but we do become &quot;new&quot; with our faith in Jesus. As such a creature we can certainly &quot;greive&quot; the Holy Spirit, but we do not lose that &quot;seal&quot;. (I don't want to quote the whole book of Ephesians, but it's all through the first 4 chapters). We are indwelled by Him, and He promises to NOT leave us.. ever. <br>
<br>
Going back to 1 John 4: 4<br>
<br>
&quot;You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because GREATER IS HE WHO IS IN YOU than he who is in the world&quot;<br>
<br>
And chapter 5: 4 ff<br>
<br>
&quot;For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world--our faith.<br>
And who is the one who overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?<br>
[snip]<br>
The one who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself;<br>
[snip]<br>
And the witness is this, that God has given us ETERNAL LIFE, and this life is in His son.<br>
[snip]<br>
These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God in order THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE&quot;<br>
<br>
How can it be any clearer? It is God that gives us our faith, and our faith in Jesus guarantees ETERNAL LIFE because we are sealed by the Spirit of God. He knows us by name and we follow him. As humans we can grieve Him, but he promises to never leave us.. and NO ONE can take us from Him, that includes ourselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=t0mmyt>T0mmyT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src=http://smilies.narno.com/smilies/yaplukon/dead.gif></span><br>  Posts: 505<br> <font color=#B87333>(12/3/03 4:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 2nd Affirmative Statement Rebuttal</span><hr size=1> DEFINITION:  By “state of grace” I mean the condition that a person is in – whether they possess ‘sanctifying’ (saving) grace or not.  If a person is in a “state of grace” and they die, then they are saved.  If a person finds oneself NOT in a “state of grace” at their death, they are NOT saved.<br>
<br>
Your conclusion regarding 1 John makes my point about personal moral assurance EXACTLY.   How then can one TRULY know one is ‘of us’?  One can become ‘born again’ at the age of 10, live a completely moral, faithful, faith-filled and holy life, and then one day at 80 decided to rob a bank, rape, kill, commit suicide and die unrepentant.  One’s self and an outsider would conclude up until that last day that one was ‘saved’ but then after that last day decide that one wasn’t “really of us”.  That doesn’t sound like personal moral assurance if the conclusion for 70 years could be wrong after all!  The people who leave in 1 John are not saved yet David (who you mentioned in the first round) leaves but yet you claim isn’t forsaken and thus still saved.  How can one possible know the difference?  Wouldn’t it be AFTER one “leaves” and find that one is forsaken that they weren’t saved even though they thought they were?  That isn’t personal moral assurance then.<br>
<br>
We already talked about John 10 but I believe you’re hinging your argument on “NO ONE” meaning not even ourselves (as you stated in your first counterpoint rebuttal) can choose to leave.  But in the first four chapters of Ephesians that you point to, there are conditional statements.  Verse 4 states “that we SHOULD walk holy and without blame before Him” – SHOULD, not will or would.  The stage then is already set for verses 11-14 where it starts with those who are “In Him” and “SHOULD (not would) be to the praise of His glory”.  The sealing refers to IF we have the Holy Spirit and if we choose not to have Him (Paul warns us not to quench the Holy Spirit in 1 Thes. 5:19) then we don’t.  With the Holy Spirit, the sanctified Christian is sealed and has the guarantee, but if one starts to walk unholy and full of blame, that person has driven out or quenched the Holy Spirit with the practice of sin.<br>
<br>
We find earlier in 1 John 3:10 that whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God.  Reminds me again of David.  Agreed that God didn’t forsake David, but David chose not to practice righteousness and thus was not of God until he repented again.  Then in 5:2 (right before your quote) we find that we must “keep his commandments”!  But if we can’t leave God why must we love and obey and keep commandments?  I whole-heartedly agree with your conclusion EXCEPT the last part that just does not follow from the context of the Scripture you quoted.<br>

<br>
Ok.. onward...<br>
<br>
[They went out from us, BUT THEY WERE NOT REALLY OF US; FOR IF THEY HAD BEEN OF US, THEY WOULD HAVE REMAINED WITH US;<br>
~1 John 2: 18]<br>
<br>
The operative point being &quot;They would have remained&quot;. Once one is actually, factually part of God's family, they remain.<br>
<br>
If we go back to the OT examples, many, I'd even venture MOST , even ALL, of the Kings of Judah were men of God.. but they screwed up, especially near the end of their lives. EVERY last one! David, Solomon, Asa, Jesoshaphat.. all were called &quot;men of God&quot; and yet they didn't keep their lives singularly focused on God. And yet, they are remembered for not only the screw ups, but that their hearts were towards God. God sent prophets to smack them upside the head and get their mind back on track.. Some did, some didn't. But in the records, they were STILL referred to as &quot;men of God&quot;. It was sad that they let things slip in their old age, and some left a mess for their sons to deal with, or left sons that made it worse. But God continued to have His hand on them. He never forsaked them, even when they strayed. <br>
<br>
Tommy, I'm sorry, but I don't understand the stress on &quot;should&quot; as a negative. It's a reminder that that's what we strive for. But it doesn't say it's conditional of keeping our Eternal life. <br>
<br>
After it talks about being &quot;sealed to the Holy Spirit&quot; in Ephesians 1: 13, vs 14 goes further on the permanance of it:<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory&quot;<br>
<br>
We're PLEDGED and are God's OWN POSSESSION! How much more can we be assured that we will never be separated from Him.<br>
<br>
If we go forward to Ephesians 2: 4-9:<br>
<br>
&quot;But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,<br>
even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),<br>
[snip]<br>
For by grace you HAVE BEEN saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God<br>
not as a result of works, that no one should boast.&quot;<br>
<br>
If our salvation is something we cannot achieve, how can we &quot;unachieve&quot; it? Our works have nothing to do whatsoever with our salvation. It's presented here as completed.. &quot;have been saved&quot;. It's done, completed. Also, Titus points this out:<br>
&quot;He saved us Not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy by the washing of  regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit&quot; Chapter 3: 4<br>
<br>
Also, the faith we have is a gift from God, it's not something tangible that we can take up and lay down. Our very being is changed, we go from dead in our sins to alive in Jesus. We are forever changed. The Holy Spirit comes and lives within us. And He helps us. He prays for us when we don't know how to (that's in Romans 8: 26.) <br>
<br>
Actually, all through Romans it shows that while we were slaves to sin, we become freed, and slaves to God. But, at the same time, &quot;nothing good dwells in me&quot; but &quot;there is therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&quot;. Chapter 7: 18 and 8: 1.<br>
<br>
Romans 4 and James 2 talk about works. They point out that works demonstrate our faith before men, but not God. He looks at our heart, he KNOWS our heart. Our works have no bearing on our salvation, but are an outward showing to others of our inward transformation.<br>
<br>
[But if we can’t leave God why must we love and obey and keep commandments?]<br>
<br>
Because we are filled with the Holy Spirit and WANT to? Because we keep our hearts toward God and rejoice in His love and mercy? Because we know it pleases Him? Because it brings us closer to Him? Because it makes our lives better? Because it demonstrates Him to others? <br>
<br>
I could go on and on.. but I think you get the drift. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=t0mmyt>T0mmyT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src=http://smilies.narno.com/smilies/yaplukon/dead.gif></span><br>  Posts: 537<br> <font color=#B87333>(12/15/03 3:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tommy's 2nd Affirmative Statement</span><hr size=1> In my opening statement I stated that the Bible shows us that salvation was an ongoing event.  Paul speaks of salvation as a past event several times.  We hear in Ephesians 2:5 that “it is by grace you HAVE BEEN saved” {again, all emphasis is mine throughout) and in verse 8 “For it is by grace you HAVE BEEN saved”.  But this past aspect is only one dimension of our salvation.  There is an ongoing aspect as well.  1 Peter 1:9 states “for you are RECEIVING the goal of your faith, the SALVATION of your souls”.  Paul tells us in Philippians 2:12 that we need to “work out your own salvation”.  Along with the past and ongoing aspect of salvation there is a future aspect as well.  We find in Roman 13:11 this sense in which we have not yet received salvation “For SALVATION IS NEARER TO US NOW than when we first believed” and in 1 Corinthians 3:15 “though he himself WILL BE SAVED” and in 5:5 “that his spirit may BE SAVED in the day of the Lord Jesus”.   Salvation has past, present and future aspects.<br>
<br>
Another aspect I’d like to develop from my opening statement and from my 2nd rebuttal is the possibility of self-delusion and delusion of others.  What of the example of the “born-again” person who lives an upstanding life until the last day?  Was this person never saved, even though he and others around him would have sworn to it?  Or can one commit all kinds of foul deeds like murder, adultery, and rape and since they’re already saved, not lose it or even have to worry about it?  Or those in Matthew 7:22-23 who cry out “’Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’  Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you.  Away from me, you evildoers!’”   Sounds like a group of people who THOUGHT they were saved.  If they thought it but weren’t, that doesn’t sound like true personal moral assurance.<br>
<br>
Finally I’d like to mention more Scripture that warns us because if we’re truly personally assured, why do we need a warning for something we can’t lose?   We find in Romans 11:22 “Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provide that you CONTINUE in His kindness.  Otherwise, you also will be CUT OFF”.  And in 1 Corinthians 10:11-12 “These things happened to them as examples and were written down as WARNINGS for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come.  So, if you THINK you are standing firm, be CAREFUL that you DO NOT FALL!”   2 Timothy 2:12 tells us that “IF we ENDURE, we will also reign with Him.  IF we DISOWN Him, He will also DISOWN US;” even though in v.13 “He will remain faithful”.  EVEN though GOD is faithful, we CAN disown Him and then He will disown us!  Hebrews 6:4-6 describes sharers in the Holy Spirit who then fall away and in 10:26-27 that judgment remains for those who continue to sin after receiving the truth.<br>

<br>
(as you pointed out in Ephesians 2, “it is by grace you HAVE BEEN saved”<br>
“For it is by grace you HAVE BEEN saved”) <br>
<br>
then what is the other &quot;salvation&quot; mentioned refering to?<br>
<br>
You used Phillippians 2, but you only pulled out verse 12:<br>
<br>
&quot;So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;&quot;<br>
<br>
but you didn't go on to the next verse which give it it's context:<br>
<br>
&quot;For IT IS GOD WHO IS AT WORK IN YOU, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only a true child of God is going to have Him working in them! The &quot;salvation&quot; I think this is referencing is our daily walk.. NOT our eternal life. THAT is a gift from God.<br>
<br>
Of course there is an element of &quot;past&quot; &quot;present&quot; and &quot;future&quot; aspect of our salvation. We experience different parts as our life goes. We cannot recieve our glorified body until we die on this earth. But, our eternal life is already ours.<br>
<br>
I don't understand the &quot;delusion&quot; thing. Are you saying someone could actually &quot;think&quot; they were a believer and not be? How does that work with:<br>
<br>
&quot;These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God in order that you may KNOW that you have ETERNAL LIFE.<br>
~1 John 5: 13<br>
<br>
If we cannot have confidence in God's word what CAN we have confidence in? I do think there may be people &quot;playing at&quot; it.. but we determined at the beginning of the discussion that we were talking ONLY about TRUE believers. There is a separate discussion of who is/n't a &quot;true believer&quot; and we can take it up after if you want.<br>
<br>
&quot;No temptation has overtaken you but such as in common to man; and GOD IS FAITHFUL, who will NOT ALLOW you to be tempted BEYOND what you are able' but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, that you may be able to endure it.&quot;<br>
~1 Cor 10: 13<br>
<br>
TRUE believers will NOT turn from Him, nor can they be decieved.<br>
<br>
&quot;For false Christs and fasle prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to mislead, IF POSSIBLE, even the elect&quot;<br>
~ Matt 24: 24<br>
<br>
The verses in Romans 11 talking about being &quot;cut off&quot; was in reference to how the Gentiles were ever allowed into the family of God. If you read the whole chapter you see the context. The Jews turned away and salvation came to the Gentiles as a result. We were grafted in. <br>
<br>
vs 19 talks about how branches were broken off so that the Gentiles could be grafted in.. but it is by FAITH that we stand. There is a whole bit about how IF Israel turns to Him they will be grafted in again.. and vs 29 says:<br>
<br>
&quot;For the gifts and the calling of God are IRREVOCABLE.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then goes on to talk about His mercy.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 6 is relative to the parable of the seeds. These are obviously the ones that fell on shallow soil that grew up but were choked by weeds or withered with the harsh sun. The seeds NEVER TOOK ROOT. These are not true believers. <br>
<br>
Paul talks about what happens to those that knowing truth and being part of the body, that go far astray when he says in 1 Corinthians 5: 5<br>
<br>
&quot;I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.&quot;<br>
<br>
They may lose their physical life, but not their spiritual one.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=t0mmyt>T0mmyT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src=http://www.geocities.com/bat3193/smilies16/insanes.gif></span><br>  Posts: 643<br> <font color=#B87333>(1/13/04 6:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tommy's Second Affirmative Counterpoint</span><hr size=1> The past/present/future aspects that you are agreeing to don’t seem to explain the Scripture I quoted when you state that the present aspect means just our daily walk apart from an already obtained un-loseable salvation or the future aspect as just us obtaining a glorified body (they use phrases like ‘receiving’/’working out’ and ‘will be saved’/’may be saved’ instead of something like ‘you have salvation, just be good until you receive your glorified body in the future’).<br>
<br>
Correct - we are NOT talking about those playing at it, but surely those crying out in Matthew 7:22-23 thought they were saved and thus had apparently deluded themselves and surely anyone who experiences some growth will think they are ‘saved’ even if later they are choked by weeds or wither and die in the sun due to not taking root.  You can make that judgment that they weren’t a true believer but I’ll bet they surely felt that way, along with the those in Matthew 7 and the person who lived the exemplary life only to spend his last day committing all kinds of sins.  <br>
<br>
I agree with your context of Romans 11 but the words you choose further my point.  You talk about how the “Jews turned away” and “IF Israel turns to Him they will be grafted in again”!  Further as I already stated we are given a stern warning that WE TOO may be “CUT OFF” “[f]or if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either” v21.<br>
<br>
Finally as we both quoted 1 Corinthians 5:5 – I don’t agree that it says that they “may lose their physical life, but not their spiritual one” since the text says that they “MAY BE saved” and not ‘WILL BE’.<br>
