No, the ACLU sued because the easement is maintained by the city, which means it receives <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>public funds</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  If you receive public funds, it does not matter whether or not the land is privately owned, just as privately-owned companies that receive public funds are subject to the same Title VII laws as public companies and government entites.<br>
<br>
I could use your own argument against you, here.  Sure, it's rude to ruin someone's wedding day.  I agree that it is inappropriate.  But, as American citizens, they have the right to free speech.  They have to right to organized protest.  And, since they have that constitutionally protected right, that supercedes any moral obligation to consider the feelings of others, right?  <br>
<br>
Isn't that your argument about Bush's statements?  You abandoned it rather quickly when, suddenly, you were the one who felt maligned.<br>

CAD gave you some wonderful quotes, and I highly urge you, before you trot out the highly overused and incorrect &quot;but the Founding Fathers were Christian and wanted things this way&quot; argument, that you read up on the men who were the architects of the country.<br>
<br>
You'll find that many, many of the men were far from Christian, and did not have any conception of a Creator in the same sense that you as a Mormon do....just because the word might be applicable to your religious beliefs doesn't make the intent the same thing.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I think the Founding Fathers, if they saw the state of the union today, would be spinning when they saw what lines Bush and co. were erasing....<br>
<br>
That would be much more in keeping with their intent, even from the Christian ones who wisely saw, as they werw pretty fresh from religious persecution, the merit in a secular government.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>From what I have read, it seems that there is an opinion that it should be ok for Bush to express his religious beliefs while acting in his role as president. Well, my question to you (Christians here, they seem to be defending this stance) what if he was a Satanist or an athiest? Instead of saying things like he said, he said something like, &quot;I greive with the families in this, but always keep in mind that because there is no afterlife they will never have to suffer again...&quot; Or something along those lines? I am not being to articulate right now, but you get my drift. <br>

or do Jehovah's Witnesses not count as xians anymore?

You want a religious nation founded on religion where political leaders ALWAYS express their views and you don't want to hear any complaining about it, then you have the choice of moving to places like Trish suggested, I hear Iraq and Saudi Arabia are nice this time of year or hey---there's always that hotbed of cessesion, firearms and religious dogma--Idaho..course Montana has some good ranches too where noone will &quot;express their religion&quot; at your brides and grooms in parks.<br>

If the difference is prayer in school, the reason not to have prayer in school would be that teachers hold some power over the students and it would be more &quot;compelling&quot; to participate than an adult who happens to be listening to a presidential speech.  The president isnt compelling anyone to belief participate or even accept his views or faith.  He was merely trying to use what he knew/believed to be comforting to &quot;help&quot; comfort the families.  What is fundamentally wrong with that?

I know that not everyone appreciates to be preached at all of the time especially in times of stress or grief.

Bush should have respect for all of the diversity in this country, THAT is what it was founded on.  Maybe he should have made comments based on all of the religions involved, that would have shown more respect than ignoring the astronauts diversity.<br>

Where did you find the Jefferson quotes? Jefferson was not a Christian (he was Unitarian/Deist), and did not believe in a G-d who could have any kind of actions over the lives of men. He even wrote an alternative Bible, that left out the unsubstantiated stuff, and the supernatural stuff. Quite a different book, when he got done with it. He believed that if there was a G-d of some sort, he walked away from the affairs of man long ago.<br>
<br>
Here's a good page for Jefferson:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.nobeliefs.com/jefferson.htm">www.nobeliefs.com/jefferson.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
If I read that quote, knowing what I know of Jefferson, I think he is talking about fearing how the citizens will react if they don't, in state manners, have an allegiance to a G-d who dishes out justice and wrath. I don't think of it as a flattering statement, but rather a kind of snarky one aimed at believers. I think that's what he was fearful of, not an actual G-d of some sort.<br>
<br>
I also don't think of Andrew Johnson as a Founding Father, seeing as her was president nearly one hundred years after the Revolutionary War, but hey, I guess that's just me.<br>
<br>
And the quotes by Washington illuminating his lack of interest in religion far outnumber any religious quotes.<br>
<br>
Again, I'd like to know where the Jefferson quotes came from. Thanks! I would presume they are in a text of a much more detailed letter that would put the context a little differently.<br>

To spew hate about anothers faith is the excericise of free speech and as long as it is just talk, there is no problem.  When it crosses the line to denying another person their civil liberties by actions based on that hate there is a problem.<br>
<br>
As a LDS of course I would have been personally offended if my governor choose to spew hate messages about my faith, but that is a different issue altogether.  I do not have the right to &quot;never be offended&quot;  Those hate messages had nothing to do with him exercising his own religion.  The two are not related.<br>

The quotes were taken from a website that I found when I inserted faith of founding fathers into the keyword.  I did not bookmark it, sorry.<br>

Do not consider my lack of response to anymore posts on here personal or as a sign of my defeat.  I find that I am spending way too much time and energy arguing.  It is finding its way into my dreams at night and into my demeanor.  I decided this morning, before I even looked at the rest of this thread that I do not want to continue being onry and argumentative.  So I will be deleting this from my favorites and moving on to more positive and uplifting uses of my time.<br>

It is such a hotly mined field that even the suggestion of a date in the workplace and not being told no is grounds for summary career execution.<br>
<br>
Torquemada was exercising his religion when he impaled, burned, quartered, drowned, and beheadded all the victims of his inquisition.  His god (ironicly the same one you worship) demanded the death of the infidels.<br>
<br>
The founding fathers were of a diverse background.  You may find several held close ideals about god, but again, they were fleeing various persecutions when they left europe (at the hands of xians mind you) and didn't want it repeated here.  Most of them were deists, not xian; some were atheist, not xian; of the few xians, some xians did not recognize the other xians as xian.  Furthermore, they wrote extensively and spoke frequently.  Were I to address a religous group, I would speak in religous terms and descriptions.  It is simple sense in communicating a message to use what is most easily communicated.  <br>
<br>
However, just like DAG and his Einstien theism fantasy, you have to take the entire body of their record and look at it as a whole.  Out of context many things can be colored to hold a religous halo, no matter where they began.  Surely you recognize this in the use of biblical quotes to back spurrious claims.  You go read the whole verse, not just the line to see what the message really is.  None of your quotes (Aside from the obvious last one) distinguish the god cited as the xian one.  Few of the quotes even mention god (providence is infact fate, fortune or good luck) so it is a tenuous rationalization at best.<br>
<br>
Irrespective of the messages you choose to take, their other writings are very clear about the matter.  No gov't sponsering of religion.  Period.  He is living in  a house I am paying for, he is drawing a check out of my wallet, he should damn well have the respect for his fellow americans to be curteous.  If he wants to preach, go get ordained an become a minister.  Standing at a podium holding your religeon above all others in the world is not the highest form of religous freedom, it is the losest form of disrespect and abuse of power.<br>
