<br>
Crowley sat quietly at his office desk. There were stacks of reports to be reviewed, orders to sign, messages to send... in other words, his so-called &quot;day job&quot;. <br>
<br>
None of which interested him at the moment. <br>
<br>
&quot;Just a few moments...&quot; he whispered.<br>
<br>
A few moments. A few moments would have been all he needed to convince Thomas Ryder, or Jack, or whatever his name was, to stay. To convince him that his existence truly was of continued value. That he had a third option besides rejoining the monsters of the Sabbat or seeking his own self-destruction. <br>
<br>
Crowley had barely met Ryder before the death of Nikke Black. Even after that, Crowley had his own business to attend to. Shortly before he had left, Blackmore had warned him that Ryder was suspected of being a Sabbat. Then after he returned and heard that Ryder was being counted among those butchered at the hands of Jason Black, Crowley couldn't help but feel some connection to this vampire, as he did with all those who had fought that terrible night.  <br>
<br>
Crowley was almost certain he could've convinced Ryder to go back with him, if the Princess and Blackmore were so desperately insistent that he not leave the city.<br>
<br>
And if it had been absolutely necessary, Crowley would've called upon his Disciplines. Still an inelegant response, but it would've worked. It would've avoided violence in the street, a Masquerade breach, and Ryder would've returned to Elysium peacefully. <br>
<br>
But no. Instead others had gotten in his away. Instead of reasoning with Ryder, they had threatened him. The Tzimisce had already been enraged enough after his shouting match with the Archbishop. Did they honestly expect him to come with them, approaching him with hostility? Did they not expect him to defend himself? <br>
<br>
And so he had shown his true, fiendish form. Several Cainites had fled in horror back to Elysium with their tails between their legs at the very sight of it! Crowley had held his ground, but so had some others and they insisted on continuing to terrorize the beast. On the open street! Crowley might've used his powers to stop the fight, but before he could intervene, a passing Kine witnessed the exchange from across the street, and ran in fear. Crowley had chased after the man, caught up with him, and erased any recollection of the incident. Before it was all over, two more humans had to be likewise dealt with, all in the name of protecting the Masquerade. <br>
<br>
By the time Crowley was able to turn his attention back to Ryder himself, the chase had already taken to cars, and Crowley's own black Mercedes was parked two blocks away in a parking garage. <br>
<br>
Now Ryder was gone. Gone to face the sun, apparently. By now, the man was almost certainly dead, forever this time. <br>
<br>
Another kindred spirit turned to ash.<br>
<br>
Kindred. What vampires had chosen to call themselves. <br>
<br>
What a ridiculously ironic term. <br>
<br>
Vicious, evil, backstabbing monsters, all of us. Kindred, indeed!<br>
<br>
Oh, we try to hold ourselves above the level of the Sabbat, but Crowley had no doubt whatsoever that virtually of the Cainites present agreed with the words of the Archbishop, whether they acknowledged it or not. <br>
<br>
The lot of them had stood by and watched as the Fiend had taken the remains of the creature the Tremere had been sheltering folded it up like a pair of old sweatpants and packed it away. <br>
<br>
Crowley had watched, as well, of course. He'd never known the creature, only seen he once before. And now this Archbishop claimed her as a member of the Sabbat. He didn't seem devastated that she had been slain, apparently by Tremere Gargoyles. He had implied she was far more important than some simple deserter. <br>
<br>
Crowley couldn't help but feel he should have acted. Never mind that she was dead and accused of being a Sabbat. Never mind that the Archbishop had a knife to their necks. But what should he have done? Risked destruction for them all to keep a corpse out of the Sabbat's hands?<br>
<br>
When Ryder had confronted the bastard, confronted him with the sheer uselessness of it all, the Sabbat lord, without batting an eye, had simply stated that he was a Vampire. He woke up in the evening and fed. That was purpose enough for him. But it was not purpose enough for Thomas, who refused to go back with him, instead choosing to end it on his own terms. <br>
<br>
Damn the Sabbat Archbishop for bringing yet more treachery and violence into the city.<br>
<br>
Damn the Brujah, the Gangrel and even the blasted Herald for getting in his way. <br>
<br>
Damn Blackmore for not trusting him, and instead sending in a bunch of thugs who didn't know the meaning of the word subtle. Or, apparently, the words Masquerade breach.<br>
 <br>
And after all that, the Princess still couldn't seem to find the time to see him, despite Blackmore's assurances that she had desired to do so. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me, Crowley, what ails you more; the fact that she had her Scourge ambush you and implant a bomb in your skull on the word of an anarch? Or the fact that no matter how many times you've covered up Masquerade breaches, she can't seem to spare you even a minute of her time? That your so unimportant she can't be bothered either to praise you or degrade you? Which stings deeper, her focused hostility or her complete dismissal?&quot;<br>
<br>
For a brief moment Crowley tensed up -- but only for a brief moment. He eased up and then smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Touché, Mr. Roche.&quot;<br>
<br>
How natural it all seemed to him now. He almost took it for granted that Kaergon Roche would eventually enter into his thoughts. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now is not the time, anyway. Covering up Masquerade breaches has won you a reprieve, wait until you've put yourself in her good graces <br>
&quot;Fine. It doesn't matter when or if I see her. But couldn't she at least acknowledge what I've done?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Look at the newspaper on your desk, Crowley. What does it say?&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley picked up the Saturday edition of the Santa Carla Tribune. <br>
<br>
&quot;The usual Kine nonsense.&quot; Crowley answered. &quot;This business with Iraq. The state of the economy. Local weather...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know what you do not see, Crowley?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You do not see anything about an eight-foot tall demon fighting super-humanly fast, super-humanly strong vampires in the middle of a city street. That is largely because of your actions last night.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That almost sounded like praise.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Almost, yes. It was a statement of fact that portrayed you in a somewhat positive light. So yes, it was almost praise. The point is, you did your duty, and protected the Masquerade.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And that should be enough?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If your loyalty is truly with the Camarilla, if that above all else is what you serve, then yes, that should be enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley put the paper down. <br>
<br>
&quot;It should certainly count for Marie than Marie's approval.&quot; Roche added.<br>
<br>
&quot;Humph.&quot; Crowley grunted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not that I can blame you. She has a wonderful combination of beauty, charm, intelligence, perplexity....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop.&quot; Crowley was suddenly quite serious.<br>
<br>
&quot;Could tear you apart piece-by-piece and have you begging for more...&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Enough!&quot; Crowley rised from his chair, knocking it over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well.&quot; Roche answered, in what for him, would pass as an innocent voice. &quot;Now we can move on to the bigger problem at hand.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; Crowley said sternly. <br>
<br>
&quot;And that would be...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What about humanity? What about the instinctive caring for others, that we should reach out to our fellows with something other than a need to control or destroy?&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a pause.<br>
<br>
&quot;Crowley, let's try something.... Close your eyes for a moment. I'm going to show you something of this 'humanity' of yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley closed his eyes. <br>
<br>
Visions appeared before him. People being rounded up, stuck in trains, sent to camps. The soldiers - those were Nazi uniforms. Jews -- the Holocaust. The ovens. The gas. Beatings, shootings, torture. Human beings destroying other human beings because of their overwhelming hatred. He saw families torn apart -- children and the elderly sent straight to the ovens. Innocent people dying by the thousands -- by the millions. He saw death and destruction turned into an industry. Instead of producing cars or planes, it destroyed all evidence that a person had ever existed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was part of this, Crowley. I helped do these things. And I stood by and watched. But do you know what the most incredible part is? Flesh-and-blood mortals did all of this. That is your humanity which you seem so concerned about.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough, please, stop!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Open your eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley did so and was himself again.<br>
<br>
&quot;The lesson, Crowley, is this: Kindred, Kine, it doesn't matter. It is our ACTIONS that define us. It is what we do, in the time we are given in this world, regardless of whether or not its a few years or if its millennia. There are some Kine who accomplish far more in only a short period than many Kindred achieve in 10 of their lifetimes. Most Kindred believe as the Archbishop did. We wake every night, and we prey on Kine. Oh, certainly, we are not without ambition. All the clans have an inherent nature to get a leg up on the others, as well as their own Kin. But ambition for what? More power and control? Oh, very fine and good, but to what end?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The end is the point, Crowley. Ambition in both the Kindred and Kine world is fine, but it is HOW WE USE IT that truly counts for something.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley, finally recovered from the intense visions, nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will remember what you've said -- what you've shown me -- this night.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope you do.&quot; Roche replied. &quot;Because, Crowley, you will be tested.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then Roche was gone, and Crowley, once again, was alone.  <br>
<br>
