Everyone likes flame wars right?  Here are some topics of discussion you may be interested in flaming me for but if you come at me, be warned that I have good reasons to believe the way I do:<br>
<br>
1) I'm atheist, I hate religious people, especially christians.  I can get along with some, but its gonna be a stretch.  I think all religious people are inherently stupid.  Dont come in here and say &quot;but what about so and so, he's smart!&quot;.  He may be smart in other areas but religiously speaking, he's weak and pathetic and an idiot who wont listen to reason<br>
<br>
2) On the board where Archangel found me, we had been discussing the war on Iraq for many months.  Politically, I'm liberal, but mainly I am that way because I hate conservatives.  They're warmongers and hypocrites, moreso than liberals.  I dont care about Iraq, I dont care about Saddam, I dont care about the suffering of the Iraqis.  Bush is a moron that someone should kill and people need to seriously lay off the French.  Jokes are fun, but they've got more balls to stand up to US unilaterilism than most countries<br>
<br>
3) Speaking of the Iraqis, I hate people as a rule.  I dont care if someone's having their arms and legs cut off in Zimbabwe, that doesnt affect me, I wouldnt send them a penny if I could help it.  I would help a richer nation though, because they can reward us.  Thats one of the reasons why I didnt care about Iraq.  So they're being murdered by Saddam, big fucking deal.  Like the Republicans are actually genuine in their fake humanitarian preachy bullshit.  Its about money and oil and you know it<br>
<br>
4) I have no morals.  I'm completely amoral.  If I can get away with it, I'll probabaly do it if it benefits me.  I'm a relative moralist, meaning that I dont believe anything's absolute.  Murder can be ok in certain situations, rape can be as well, so can a lot of other things.  I think the normal Judeo-Christian way of thinking is some guy's idea of a bad joke ran amok<br>
<br>
5) Speaking of christian morals, abortions for everyone.  A fetus is technically a parasite.  Read the definition of a parasite, then read what a fetus does.  Its the same damn thing.  Just because there are gruesome pictures of something doesnt mean it should be illegal, people rely on their emotions too much<br>
<br>
6) On the subject of emotions, the world needs to make their laws with less of them and more of their brains.  I cant stand people who think something's icky or disgusting or horrible and make laws based on feelings and not their brains.  Rationality is your friend<br>
<br>
7) Also, a lot of people think gay people are icky.  I say: Get over it.  How would you like the government telling you what you can and cant do in your own bedroom?  They deserve the same rights just like everyone else, let them marry and adopt, get over your fucking selves.  And by the way, them having gay parades and shows and lobbying for holidays is not special treatment and does not mean they want more rights.  They want those things because they already have less rights<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Red and green are bad together.  Christmas may be fun, but its colorblind<br>
<br>
9) You're paranoid if you think people are gonna kill you if you dont have a gun.  The very act of making guns so widespread is contributing to the amount of crime that you feel you need to protect yourself from by owning more guns than most small countries have in their arsenals.  Guns should be banned, criminals should be dealt with, and you can have your shits and giggles renting a gun from a shooting range and going nuts on a target.  Police are there to protect you, sometimes they cant make it.  Show me a man who's 100% effective in his job for life and never makes any mistakes.  Besides, you're much more likely to shoot a family member anyways<br>
<br>
10) Everyone likes to argue this because unlike the rest, this view is generally hated by everyone in our society.  But I believe anti-pedophilia laws should be changed.  Get rid of statutory rape, let adults have sex with children if they can both be judged to be competent.  You want to cry about slippery slope?  Slipperly slope is when a bunch of morons decide that one adult having sex with someone 17 years and 11 months old means that the whole system is going to crash down on their heads.  Dont make a blanket law that affects everyone, look at each case individually<br>
<br>
There, 10 things that I'm sure at least some of you feel strongly about and opposite of me.  Lets have a debate or just yell at me continuously, give me your best shot <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkickbanned.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archangel@kickbanned>Archangel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>High Power</span><br>  Posts: 368<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/29/03 8:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkickbannedfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=263.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sane.org.uk/images/christmas%20cards/Angel-Annunciate1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Since this board is really really really really slow...</span><hr size=1> Way to whip up the board!<br>

But be prepared, you won't be able to handle my arguments, as you are too far gone. I'll make comment one by one.<br>
<br>
1) I'm atheist, I hate religious people, especially christians. I can get along with some, but its gonna be a stretch. I think all religious people are inherently stupid. Dont come in here and say &quot;but what about so and so, he's smart!&quot;. He may be smart in other areas but religiously speaking, he's weak and pathetic and an idiot who wont listen to reason.<br>
<br>
__________________________________________<br>
Why do you hate anyone at all? If you don't like religious people, simply ignore them. I'm an agnostic myself, and I don't hate people simply because the find comfort in religion. I don't hate anybody. And why do you zero in on Christians? I can think of MANY religions which have rituals which are hurtful and dangerous. Christians are lightweights. You hate christians because that is all your limited experience has shown you. If you actually researched various religions, you wouldn't have that attitude. So some christian groups can be overbearing and stubborn. That's nothing compared to a religion where you have to castrate yourself or kill innocent people.<br>

Since I live here in the US, that means I'm subjected to lots of idiotic christian-influenced laws that I am forced to follow.  Most of its fine, I have no problems with obeying laws that I personally dont agree with, but keeps the majority in line.  The problem is all the hypocrisy and moronic retarded contradictions in the laws that are based solely on the emotions of other people.  Those dont make sense and even when they can be shown that they dont make sense, they still dont change it.  Disagreeable laws are one thing, but laws that contradicted other laws and make no sense are another<br>
<br>
I dont know you so I dont know if you're going to resort to the &quot;if you dont like it, get out&quot; line of argument.  Anyone with a brain will notice the utter stupidity of that line so I hope you're not that type of person<br>
<br>
I hate people because we've been conditioned to think that life means something when it doesnt.  Its just a subjective, arbitrary inherent quality that people like to attribute to life.  But because its so pervasive and nobody would listen to reason, I've grown annoyed and eventually angered at it<br>
<br>
I focus on christians because they are the dominant sect in this country.  If Hindu laws were pissing me off, I'd be attacking Hindus instead.  So yes, its partly based on my experiences but I dont claim that out of all religions, christianity is the worse, far from it.  I am only mostly angry at them because they are the one that affect me most.  And its not just the fact that they are religious that I wish they'd disappear forever.  Some religions are mostly harmless and though I wish their followers would try and give some proof of why they believe what they believe, something like Buddhism doesnt bug me that much <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkickbanned.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theitalianstalin@kickbanned>The Italian Stalin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel</span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/30/03 9:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkickbannedfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=263.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://the.feds.are.lookingat.us/nnava.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Since this board is really really really really slow...</span><hr size=1> You say that you want religious people to give proof of what they believe.

2) On the board where Archangel found me, we had been discussing the war on Iraq for many months. Politically, I'm liberal, but mainly I am that way because I hate conservatives. They're warmongers and hypocrites, moreso than liberals. I dont care about Iraq, I dont care about Saddam, I dont care about the suffering of the Iraqis. Bush is a moron that someone should kill and people need to seriously lay off the French. Jokes are fun, but they've got more balls to stand up to US unilaterilism than most countries<br>

3) Speaking of the Iraqis, I hate people as a rule. I dont care if someone's having their arms and legs cut off in Zimbabwe, that doesnt affect me, I wouldnt send them a penny if I could help it. I would help a richer nation though, because they can reward us. Thats one of the reasons why I didnt care about Iraq. So they're being murdered by Saddam, big fucking deal. Like the Republicans are actually genuine in their fake humanitarian preachy bullshit. Its about money and oil and you know it<br>
_____________________________________________<br>
It's about OIL?????????? REALLY?????<br>
Well, we have the oil, and gas prices are higher than they've ever been. It's easy to repeat slogans like that, but the facts simply don't support it. You talk about fake humanitarian BS? You just displayed one of the most callous attitudes toward your fellow man that I have ever had the opportunity to read.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4) I have no morals. I'm completely amoral. If I can get away with it, I'll probabaly do it if it benefits me. I'm a relative moralist, meaning that I dont believe anything's absolute. Murder can be ok in certain situations, rape can be as well, so can a lot of other things. I think the normal Judeo-Christian way of thinking is some guy's idea of a bad joke ran amok<br>
________________________________________________<br>
<br>
It's very clear that you have no morals. So logically, you must understand that you are in no position to judge those who do.<br>
Surely you must agree.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5) Speaking of christian morals, abortions for everyone. A fetus is technically a parasite. Read the definition of a parasite, then read what a fetus does. Its the same damn thing. Just because there are gruesome pictures of something doesnt mean it should be illegal, people rely on their emotions too much<br>
____________________________________________<br>
I know something about science. A foetus is not technically a parasite. A foetus is vital to the propagation of the species. If anything, it would be a symbiotic organism. But since it shares our DNA, I think it is rightfully classified as offspring.<br>
Sorry, I can't let you twist science. A foetus is offspring.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6) On the subject of emotions, the world needs to make their laws with less of them and more of their brains. I cant stand people who think something's icky or disgusting or horrible and make laws based on feelings and not their brains. Rationality is your friend<br>
________________________________________________<br>
I agree with you on this. As an agnostic, I am devoted to logic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7) Also, a lot of people think gay people are icky. I say: Get over it. How would you like the government telling you what you can and cant do in your own bedroom? They deserve the same rights just like everyone else, let them marry and adopt, get over your fucking selves. And by the way, them having gay parades and shows and lobbying for holidays is not special treatment and does not mean they want more rights. They want those things because they already have less rights<br>
<br>
 Red and green are bad together. Christmas may be fun, but its colorblind<br>
________________________________________________<br>
If you want to talk science, you did earlier, homosexuality is a disease and a disorder. Homosexual behavior cannot produce offspring. Homosexuals claim that they are born with the condition. Any condition which disables the ability to reproduce, by definition, is a serious reproductive disorder. Assuming that homosexuals are born that way, and that it is a genetic disorder, whe should be looking for a cure.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
9) You're paranoid if you think people are gonna kill you if you dont have a gun. The very act of making guns so widespread is contributing to the amount of crime that you feel you need to protect yourself from by owning more guns than most small countries have in their arsenals. Guns should be banned, criminals should be dealt with, and you can have your shits and giggles renting a gun from a shooting range and going nuts on a target. Police are there to protect you, sometimes they cant make it. Show me a man who's 100% effective in his job for life and never makes any mistakes. Besides, you're much more likely to shoot a family member anyways<br>
_____________________________________________<br>
Let's say guns were completely outlawed, world wide.<br>
The criminals would be forced to use knives and swords.<br>
Do you plan to stop there? Or are you going to eventually outlaw those things too? Where does it end? Bad people will always pervert the use of tools.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
10) Everyone likes to argue this because unlike the rest, this view is generally hated by everyone in our society. But I believe anti-pedophilia laws should be changed. Get rid of statutory rape, let adults have sex with children if they can both be judged to be competent. You want to cry about slippery slope? Slipperly slope is when a bunch of morons decide that one adult having sex with someone 17 years and 11 months old means that the whole system is going to crash down on their heads. Dont make a blanket law that affects everyone, look at each case individually.<br>
___________________________________________<br>
I just heard about a case where a 19 year old man was charged with the statutory rape of a 16 year old girl. The judge decided that since they had been together for 5 years, and since their ages were only 3 years apart, that he let the guy go. So I think the system is already working the way it should. I think it's the 45 year old guy boning a 12 year old girl that people find so offensive. Pedophilia is like pornography vs. art. We know the difference when we see it. I think the system works as well as it can. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkickbanned.showUserPublicProfile?gid=skullboy@kickbanned>Skull Boy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thread Zombie</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/2/03 10:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkickbannedfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=263.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.3dimagery.com/skullc.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Since this board is really really really really slow...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2) On the board where Archangel found me, we had been discussing the war on Iraq for many months.

Guns have one use.  Knives and blades have more than one.  Besides, you are missing the point.

But if you would, then we are only debating about the line in the sand. And that is subjective reasoning, my friend.<br>

I happen to disagree that this board is really, really. etc. slow.  Well, it's definitely not now after reading all of the comments !  Prior to people expressing their opinions on the above-referenced topics, I strongly believe that it was (and still is !) a great board.  It seems to me that you seem to feel that unless there is controversy present, then you appear disinterested.  <br>
<br>
Kickbanned provides for us a tool for which each of us is permitted to freely express our creativity, ideas, opinions, thoughts, etc.  If the board appears to be really, really, etc. &quot;slow,&quot; then we have no one to criticize besides ourselves for our not posting!<br>
<br>
Thank you and that is all !  Oh, one final thought . . .  KICKBANNED ROCKS ! ! ! Thanks a million, ARCHANGEL ! ! <br>
<br>
THE END<br>

At one point we were pulling in 50 posts a day,<br>
then lately, it's been maybe 5 or so.<br>
I stopped trying to figure it out. My goal is to<br>
simply have a board where people can talk about<br>
whatever the hell they want, without fear of being banned<br>
or silenced. I hope I'm doing this.<br>
<br>
BTW: No I don't have a job. I'm a bum. And I have a lot of time on my hands. I just hope you enjoy the board.<br>

When anyone edit's a post, the system leaves a comment at the bottom indicating such. The system does this on it's own and neither I nor the mods have any control over it. I will edit this post to show you what I mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have added this sentance to the above post as an edit, so look at the very bottom and you will see the comment that the system adds to this post.<br>

The system also puts a copy of the previous message right below, so you can cut and paste text into the quote-box, and produce the effect you see above. <p>Archangel<br>
