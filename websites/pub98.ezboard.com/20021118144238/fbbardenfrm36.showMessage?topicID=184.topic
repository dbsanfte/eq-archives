Most odd, when I came back to my pc and moved my mouse to start monitor again I found an error message for something called MMTask. It was odd looking error message cos the error window was far bigger than normal, and it said normal stuff about illegal error will be shut down etc. but nothing shut down at all.<br>
<br>
Whats MMTask?<br>
<br>
I'm wondering if it's one of those nasty advertising programmes that sites put on your disk without you even knowing?<br>
<br>
Btw can sites that use lots of flash animation crash your browser? Cos mine froze earlier when on a very heavily animated, graphics heavy site.<br>

<br>
  Are you using some kind of screensaver? is it a windows screensaver or something you donwloaded? Somehow (I'll spare you the details), it can explain why the error message was so big.<br>
<br>
  Im not sure; MMTask can be something out of WinGate that is often corrupted into a trojan (bad stuff).. Or maybe its related to active desktop (and therefore be buggy), but I think it must be the first thing. Eitherway, make a search for it and delete it. And try not to use active desktop (view desktop as web page); set your walpaper normally, or with a photo editing software like paintshop, ACDsee, ect...<br>
<br>
  Win98 is really crappy.. its mostly patchwork. So a format isnt always necessary, you need to clean your registry. If you want more info just ask...<br>

<br>
Right, as for the large error message box. It sounds as though your screensaver or the switch to low power mode by the monitor had change the resolution on the monitor (sometimes it can be as low as 320x240). Obviously, because it had crashed before the monitor had come out of low power mode and the screensaver had terminated, it hadn't been able to reset the original resolution (this is why you sometimes get a clicking sound by the monitor as it changes resolution).<br>
<br>
The fact that it didn't shutdown sounds to me as though an invalid page fault or general protection fault had occured and as such the memory was to scrambled and the system too confused to continue functioning normally.<br>
<br>
As for mmtask...<br>
<br>
I hope you didn't delete it yet. I'm pretty sure it isn't a trojan. Just to make sure, you should first do a search for the file and make sure the file is in the windows\system folder and check it's properties under the Version tab to make sure it is a microsoft file and you could also check that the file is the same size and has the same dates as the original in the cabs on your Win98 CD. Also using a good virus killer like AVG ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.grisoft.com">www.grisoft.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) and a good firewall like ZoneAlarm Pro ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.zonelabs.com">www.zonelabs.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) will make sure you don't get any virii of any description (fingers crossed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
<br>
mmtask (mmtask.tsk) is an application referred to as the multimedia background task support module. It runs as a system service and as such is in the background performing various &quot;duties&quot; some of the time. It is mainly for multimedia functions and IPC (inter program communication) between various multimedia components.<br>
<br>
As a conclusion, I believe this to be caused by the system just getting overloaded (being on for too long and the memory becoming &quot;bloated&quot;) and probably a bug in the MS software somewhere. However, I have also heard of a problem with power management which can cause mmtask to hang, so I would recommend either turning of the monitor power management function in the display section of control panel or turning off ACPI (advanced configuration and power interface) or APM (advanced power management) alltogether <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
You could possibly lower the limit on the screensaver to one minute and the monitor power down to two minutes and just check to see if that is what is causing the system to crash. If not then it is most likely just too much uptime (even NT4 was recommended by Microsoft to be rebooted every few days).<br>
<br>
As for flash, well it depends. If they use a lot of custom scripting and there are some bugs in those scripts then it could cause the system to crash. If it was a rather large file though it could have just caused the memory just to die if the system had been up for a while and the memory had become overloaded (bugs in software are a pain and usually from the most commercial companies who have stricter deadlines).<br>
<br>
I think your idea about a re-install sounds just about right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I would usually recommend having a WinMe and Win2000 dual boot. WinMe for gaming/multimedia and Win2000 for everything else. However if you only have Win98 (I hope it's second edition) then you'll have to stick with that, but try and avoid installing stuff you don't really need or the registry will just get bogged down again and will cause the system to act erratically.<br>

   Formatting is nice, but its long, and you can loose your programs. Unless you change OS, I don't like the idea. Clean up your program files (uninstall everything you don't need), then clean your registry.. <br>
<br>
   I rescently had to test a program called... emm (searching documents, not finding anything)... ahh got it..(!!!) wheres the second page?? This place is a mess! umm.. but my hard drive is extremely well organised.. why didnt I think of it before.. here it is.  I rate this product very good, and its free. It cleans your registry. Its not as good as a format.. but also far less painful.<br>

Happy Birthday m8 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bounce --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/bounce.gif ALT=":bounce"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
To be perfectly honest m8, I am not keen on a lot of the registry tools out there. <br>
<br>
I can imagine you have taken the time to traverse your way through the infinite hierarchical structure that is the windows system registry, and therefore understand how complex it would be to create a tool to do so. It is the centre of everything Windows.<br>
<br>
Editing it manually would take hours. Doing it automatically takes quite a while too, probably 15 - 20 minute’s minimum to get through the entire tree. I only edit the registry as and when I have to. I back up first and then proceed to edit it manually. I have never trusted registry tools. <br>
<br>
I must admit the link you provide looks rather interesting and it sounds like a pretty cool tool. If it isn’t up to scratch though you could end up in a worse off situation than you started in. Imagine if your system crashes during a registry sweep? Your registry user file becomes corrupted and you can’t boot into windows (that’s half the reason these people create disclaimers and eula’s (end user license agreements), to cover their own arses.<br>
<br>
For people like you and I that could recover from errors such as these with minimal stress and difficulty, this may be an option I would consider. For a “beginner” or less knowledge computer user, simply getting out the system restore disk, or if they have the knowledge a good old format every now and again does no harm, is far less stressful and in my opinion less time consuming in the long run. If you make backups first and make sure you have all of the application set-up disks then you can’t go wrong (most restore disks install all the oringal apps anyways).<br>

If I do decide to do that, I have two hard drives, can I just format the C drive and use the other one to store all my stuff on?<br>

And last time I formatted and reinstalled, I lost all my IE5 favourites, I tried to back them up, but they just would not reinstall at all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/puppydogeyes.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have tons of faves, and I only just got them all organised, I really dont wanna loose them all, is there any way to save them and reinstall them?<br>

<br>
If you want to save all your emails and other user data then you need to copy the &quot;C:\ WINDOWS\Application Data&quot; folder to you other drive as well as all your personal files. If you have multiple users then the App Data directory will be in &quot;C:\ Windows\Profiles&quot;. Your favourites are stored in &quot;C:\ Windows\Favourites&quot; so just copy that directory over too.<br>
<br>
Once you have reinstalled if you just copy the favourites folder back to &quot;C:\ Windows&quot; again. Restoring your emails however is a little more complicated so I will leave this for another post.<br>
<br>
If you just give me a shout when and if you need me to explain through this post then I will be pleased to help ;) <br>
