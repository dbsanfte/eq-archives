Lisa Marie Presley Comes In. 4/8/03. 7:45am<br>
Lisa Marie Presley came in this morning to promote her new CD ''To Whom It May Concern'' which was released today. Howard said the album got very good reviews. He was playing one of her songs as he talked about it. Stuttering John said she's a pretty hot chick. He also said that she's very nervous and when they asked her if she's nervous about Howard she said ''No, I'm worried about Robin.''<br>
Howard had the guys bring Lisa Marie in after talking to John for a few seconds. She was wearing an overcoat so he asked her to remove it. He said he could tell she was very nervous when she came in. She was wearing a mini-skirt that looked pretty good. She immediately asked Robin what she meant about the ''gummy smile'' comment she'd made earlier in the morning. She wasn't showing any gummy smile when she came in. Howard told her it wasn't a gummy smile, it was a yummy smile to him.<br>
<br>
Howard said that being married to her would be great not just because she's hot, but because she's got all of that money. Howard asked her if she's ever used a vacuum in her life. She said of course she has but she doesn't anymore. She told Howard she went to boarding school when she was younger and had to do a lot of work there. She said her mother got more than she bargained for with her.<br>
<br>
Howard told Lisa Marie that if he was with her he'd make her mother work for them for sending her to boarding school. Howard said if he was lucky enough to be with her he'd just do fun stuff with her all the time. Howard said if the sex is good, he's there. Lisa Marie said she spent enough time doing nothing in her life, now she keeps busy.<br>
<br>
Howard brought up some of the people Lisa Marie has been with like Nicolas Cage and Michael Jackson. He said they'd get to more of that later though. He went on to talk to her about how her father, Elvis, left her all of his money. He didn't leave it to her mother. Lisa Marie is Chairman of the Board for Elvis Inc. Howard said he'd sit there at the meetings with her if he was with her. He said he'd run it with an iron fist. He asked her if she owns her own jet. She said they rent one instead of owning one. Howard said he'd make her buy one if he was with her. He said it would be called ''The Howard Stern Jet.'' Howard and Robin brought up Priscilla and how she draws a salary from Elvis Inc. Lisa is in charge of all of that. She said her mother does pretty well with that.<br>
<br>
Lisa Marie sounded a little hostile as she was talking about how she had to get out of the house when she was sent away to boarding school. She said she wasn't hostile though. Howard went on to ask her about when she started having boyfriends and when she lost her virginity. She said she was 15 and the guy was 24 who took her virginity. Howard and Robin said that's illegal. She said she met the guy on the set of a movie her mother was working on. His uncle was a director. She said the guy had a friend taking pictures of them having sex and sold her out because he needed money for drugs. She said they went out for like a year until her mother found her diaphragm. She said she was very sexual at the age of 4. She said she used to use a dolls foot to masturbate when she was that young. Lisa Marie said she was actually sexually active at 13 years old. She said she was giving oral to a kid her age at that point.<br>
<br>
Howard told Lisa Marie that people were complaining about not being able to hear he so he asked her to get closer to the microphone. He then asked her about her belief in Scientology. Howard told her he doesn't understand any religion so it's not just Scientology he doesn't get. He joked that he channeled her father the other day and he said he wants her out of the Scientology thing. Howard asked her about the guy she married when she was 19 years old who got her into Scientology. Howard also asked her why she always gets married so quick. She said she's not going to do that anymore. Howard said he's never going to get married again either. He said he's just not good at it. Robin pointed out that Lisa Marie left her first husband to go with Michael Jackson. Howard wondered if she had to shell out a lot of money to that guy when they divorced. She said it was under a million and they hadn't even signed a pre-nuptial agreement. She said he actually gave the money back and even the house she set him up with.<br>
<br>
Howard asked Lisa about her relationship and marriage to Michael Jackson. She said she went with him because it would have been more of an equal relationship. Howard told Lisa about his meeting with Jackson and how nutty he is. He told Lisa to let him meet her next prospective husband, he'll let her know if she should do it.<br>
<br>
Gary came in and told Howard to plug Lisa Marie's new album ''To Whom It May Concern'' which goes on sale today. The record company people were complaining that he wasn't promoting it.<br>
<br>
Howard got back to Michael Jackson after that. She said that relationship was before the whole lawsuit came about from the kid who claimed he was sexually assaulted by Jackson. Howard wondered if he was doing it to cover up that case. She said she didn't think that was the case. Robin threw in a question about sex with Jackson and Lisa said she wasn't going to talk about that stuff. Howard told Robin she was moving too fast and he'd get to that later. Howard asked her about Jackson's melting nose and all of the makeup he has to wear. She said she never looked at him that way though and it didn't bother her. She said she let him wait until he was ready to have sex with her. She said she wasn't the aggressor in that relationship. Howard asked her if Jackson or Nicolas Cage spanked her. She said ''no'' to Jackson but said she didn't want to talk about what Cage did. Robin asked Lisa if she was sexually satisfied by Jackson. She didn't really have an answer but said she did marry the guy. Howard said most couples bang like 4 times a day when they first meet and he figures she wasn't banging him more than once a week. Howard said it made him angry when she was with him. She'd read Howard's book (Miss America) so she knew his feelings about it.<br>
<br>
Howard asked Lisa about her kids who are 10 and 13. She said they're at home and their dad is watching them. She said he's a musician so he does work. She said that she takes care of them when she's home. Howard asked her what she likes to do for fun. She said she likes to hang out with her friends and drink at home or at one of their homes.<br>
<br>
Howard asked Lisa Marie what a typical day is like for her. She told Howard that she might stay up all night drinking. Howard also asked her about what her house is like. She said they have a pool that she likes to hang out at once in a while. He asked her if she likes to walk around naked. She said she doesn't but Howard ended up asking her if she shaves completely. She said she does shave completely. He also asked her if she's up for anal sex. She quickly said ''Sure'' to him when he asked.<br>
<br>
Howard wondered if Michael Jackson used her as a publicity stunt. She said it's possible but she's not sure about that. Howard also asked her about Nicolas Cage and if he had a temper. She said everyone does sometimes. Howard said he heard that Cage lived in separate houses when he was married to his last wife.<br>
<br>
Lisa Marie said that Jackson would give her all kinds of gifts and stuff when she was with him. She said she knew things weren't right when he did an interview with Diane Sawyer. She said he wasn't protecting their relationship at the time. She said she never saw kids sleeping over during their marriage. She said she wasn't drinking then either, that came after the marriage.<br>
<br>
Howard told Lisa that he could give it to her very hard for about 13 seconds. He asked her who she spoke to when she wanted to get away from Jackson. She said she talked to her mother and her mother just listened to what she had to say. Lisa said she and Jackson divorced but they had signed a pre-nuptial agreement so it wasn't a major thing.<br>
<br>
Howard asked Lisa Marie about ever having a lesbian relationship. She said she did have a fling when she was 17 or so. She wouldn't say who she was or where she met her though. Howard wanted to hear all of the details so he asked her a bunch of questions about it. She wanted Howard to plug the album though.<br>
<br>
Howard got off the lesbian stuff and asked her some other stuff about Michael Jackson and her other relationships. Howard wondered what it was about Michael Jackson's penis that distinguishes it from other penises. She refused to answer anything about that though.<br>
<br>
Howard took some phone calls from people who were surprised at how cool Lisa Marie was being today. One guy asked if she's ever going to pose for Playboy. She said she won't be doing that but she did do a Q&amp;A for the magazine. Howard also asked her what she's using for birth control these days. She said she's not using anything. Howard figured out that her man uses a condom. Howard also asked her if Michael Jackson's face without makeup ever freaked her out. She mumbled something like ''no'' but Howard didn't believe her.<br>
<br>
Another woman called in and asked Lisa if she'd come out and sign some autographs. Lisa said ''sure.'' Double A called in a short time later and told Lisa that Howard is the one and only real ''King'' out there.<br>
<br>
Howard asked Lisa if she smokes pot or does any other kinds of drugs. She said she doesn't do that now but she did use coke when she was younger. He went on to play a song that was supposed to be a demo song by her but it was some other wacky woman singing horribly. He then played the first single from her new album. Howard wondered what took her so long to put it out. She said she just wasn't prepared as an artist until now. Howard told her she sounds good on the album. She said she'll be going on tour starting in May. Howard said he'd go see her. Howard went through some of the tracks on the album and asked her which one's she wanted him to play. She told him to play ''Sinking In'' so he did that. Howard listened to that for a few seconds and asked her what it was about. She said it was about a failed relationship but it wasn't the one with Michael Jackson.<br>
<br>
Howard took some more phone calls. One caller asked Lisa if she supports the war in Iraq. She said she is supporting her country. Howard asked her if she loves that we're bombing the crap out of them over there. She just giggled when he asked her about that. Howard asked Lisa about a story about her getting into a fight with Paris Hilton. Lisa said a friend of hers actually threw a drink on Paris and she just happened to be there when it went on.<br>
<br>
A few more callers asked Lisa Marie some questions. Howard also asked her about her personal life and if she does the shopping for herself. She knew about how much milk, eggs and gasoline costs her when she goes shopping. Howard asked her how much a stamp costs. She said $.13. Gary came in with a whole list of stuff to ask her about. She knew approximately how much the stuff was. Lisa Marie said she doesn't live like Howard thinks she does. She said she owns an older model Mercedes Benz and only has one house.<br>
<br>
Howard asked Lisa who she hangs out with these days. She told Howard she hangs with Rob Zombie and some other friends. She said she parties pretty much every other night. She said she tries not to do it every night though because that would be too much. She said she rarely blacks out when she drinks.<br>
<br>
Howard was about to wrap up the interview but Artie asked if Gary was going to come in and offer her money to get topless. Howard asked her if that could happen. She said she'd do that later. Howard wrapped up the interview a short time later. <br>
