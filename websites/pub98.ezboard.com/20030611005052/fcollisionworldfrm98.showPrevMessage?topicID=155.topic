<br>
*Alias: Goblinslayer<br>
<br>
*Age: 21<br>
<br>
*Height: 6'0&quot;<br>
<br>
*Weight: 210 pounds<br>
<br>
*Eye Color: Green<br>
<br>
*Hair Color: Blonde<br>
<br>
Blood Type: O<br>
<br>
Relatives: Sister, Ember Strife<br>
<br>
Affiliation(s): Royal Fire Mages of Dratilia, Goblinslayer of Flowerwood<br>
<br>
Personality:  Light, cheerful and optimistic.  Courteous and generous.  He believes almost anything can be resolved without fighting, but he is not afraid to fight for those he cares for.  Friendly and charming, and he likes to make people feel good about themselves.  A bleeding heart.  But he can also become very hostile and protective when it comes to the welfare of his family and friends.<br>
<br>
*Style (so people can have an imagery vision of your character): A broad shouldered man in red mage robes, but wearing a swordbelt as well. Dark golden locks of naturally messy but charming hair grows down just inches above his broad shoulders; dazzling, charming emeralds of eyes set handsomely upon his face, full of cheer and healthy color.  Around him he wears a deep red cloak to protect him from the cold, underneath a red shirt and dark brown pants and boots.  <br>
<br>
*Likes:  Sunny days, the sound of laughter and people being happy, children, helping people, and pretty much anything cheerful. <br>
<br>
*Dislikes: Cold, dreary weather, people suffering, people who hurt others for no reason, and sadness.<br>
<br>
*Skills and Powers:  He was born with the skills of a great fire mage, but his powers rest mostly in his sword.  He can heal to a certain extent, but not very well, though his magical power is very strong.  He has an innate skill of bringing brightness to his surroundings, and making people smile.  <br>

Stamina:7<br>
Intelligent:8<br>
Fighting Skills:8<br>
Energy Powers (If the have any):6    <br>
<br>
*Weaknesses (everyone must have one):  The powers of glacial magic that quench the powers of fire. Plus, the normal physical injuries can hurt him, of course.  And poison effects him with greater potency than it would other people for some reason.<br>
<br>
*Bio:  It was never very clear where exactly Menion was born, but all that is known is that he was taken in by an orphanage in Flowerwood, a small village in Dratilia, by a kind elven matron by the name of Kristinia Strife when he was three years old.  She was a wild person in nature, but a loving mother, and took Menion under her own name.  Menion then not only had a mother, but a sister as well, Kristinia's half elven daughter named Ember.  Krisitnia's human husband had been killed in a recent battle(there was a small war/skirmish going on at the time...nothing too unusual for the rival nations) between Dratilia and Osiria.<br>
When he was eleven years old, a stray troop of Osirians came from the south and attacked Flowerwood.  Krisitnia took up her late husband's sword and tried to fight them off, to protect the children.  She was killed.  The troops set fire to the orphanage and the entire town, and luckily the children scattered and were not hurt.  Menion took his younger sister and ran off into the woods until everything died down.  Rebuilding the town wasn't easy, and many had been lost, and a few of the children that had escaped the orphanage had not returned.  But they did it, and Menion grew to become its defender against the rising goblin population in the forests surrounding the tiny town, gaining the title Goblinslayer by the age of fifteen, using his mother's sword.<br>
When he was nineteen, it came to the attention of everyone that his sister Ember had magic powers, a rare trait but very powerful.  Driven by ambition, Ember wanted to go to Dratilia to become a Royal Mage, which stirred Menion's desire to become a Dragon Knight.  Why just protect his hometown when he could defend his entire nation?  <br>
On the way, he met a taciturn and dark-souled black mage named Naomi Eboncloud.  She was on a quest for power to best her rival Jai Koto, and she was traveling to the Tower of Trial to test her power.  He accompanied her, as any good knight should, to the Tower, where she did very well, but her final test proved almost fatal.  Menion saved her life from near destruction, and he is the only one besides Naomi that ever knew about it.<br>
Menion Strife trained at Dratilia Castle in the Corridors for two years, and finally gained the title of not Dragon Knight, but surprisingly, Royal Mage.  The royal Seer saw greater magic power in him than physical strength, and so gave him magehood.<br>
Living in the Corridors, is where he met the ice mage Kyonae Falcona.  The minute he laid eyes on her he was instantly entranced by her cold nature and beauty, and it filled him with wonder as to how one person could hold such sadness in her eyes.  He has made it his goal to somehow make her let loose her feelings, because it is his nature to help people, even people who don't want help.<br>
<br>
Other Facts/Things:  He has a bit of a crush on Kyonae.  He doesn't know he was adopted because he was much too young to remember. He is very protective of his little sister, Ember.<br>

Sample Rpg<br>
<br>
Menion watched the sun rise from the outer wall, sighing happily.  The sky was alight with glorious reds and oranges and pinks, slowing calming into blue.  He smiled.  It was promising to be a lovely day.<br>
He was glad that it would be a nice his first day as a Royal Mage.  He was wearing his robes, deep, fiery red and lined with gold trimming and sash.  Actually, he felt a bit gaudy, but oh well.<br>
&quot;You...you look nice.&quot;<br>
The chilling whisper came from behind him, as soft as the wind.  He turned around to see Kyonae, standing there and gazing at him thoughtfully.  She was dressed in her Mage robes as well, white and trimmed with blue and silver.  The garment swayed in the wind as she approached him.<br>
&quot;Thank you, Kyonae,&quot; he returned politely.  &quot;You look...beautiful.&quot;<br>
Instantly Kyonae's eyes lowered to the ground, a faint blush staining her pale cheeks.  &quot;I...thank you.&quot;<br>
He chuckled. &quot;Don't mention it.  Come here, the sun shouldn't rise alone,&quot; he invited, gesturing her to stand beside him.  Reluctantly she complied, watching as the sun sent glittering rays sparkling over the hills, shining with last night's snowfall. Both were silent for a moment, until Menion looked over and saw the sorrow in Kyonae's eyes.<br>
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asked in concern.<br>
She looked up from her thoughts.  &quot;What? Oh...just thinking.&quot;<br>
&quot;About what?&quot;<br>
&quot;About this...&quot; she gestured toward everything around them.  &quot;The seas.  The mountains.  The plains.  Everything.  It's all so beautiful.&quot;<br>
He nodded, looking at the scenery.  &quot;It is very beautiful,&quot; he agreed, though not sure what she was getting at.<br>
&quot;It took hundreds and hundreds of years to make everything we see the way it is.  It took so long to make everything so beautiful, and so full of life.&quot;  Her voice was soft and sad.  &quot;And it will all be destroyed.  Time will consume it all in the blink of an eye.&quot;<br>
Menion looked at his companion, feeling disturbed by her words.  He frowned slightly.  &quot;What makes you say such horrible things, Kyonae?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Where do you learn these things?&quot;<br>
She leaned against the wall, holding her head in her hands.  &quot;My dreams...my visions, that I have...they are not surreal.&quot;  she sighed.  &quot;I do not know.  All I do know, is...that all that is created and born...all that live...our only purpose of living is to die.  Seas will dry up, mountains will crumble to dust, and all will be dead.&quot;<br>
Menion was held silent by her words, too shocked to say anything.  But then he cleared his throat.  &quot;Well, Kyonae,&quot; he said.  &quot;You may be right.  But...I think that maybe we all live to die...in order to live again.  That is how the world has survived, ever since the First Dawn.  Like a phoenix from its ashes.  It dies only to give birth to new life.  Nothing is ever really truly dead or lost.  Just misplaced.&quot;<br>
She looked at him, her eyes glittering strangely in the morning light, and he could tell she wanted more than anything to believe him.  &quot;Maybe,&quot; she nodded softly.  &quot;Maybe.&quot;<br>
He chuckled.  &quot;Maybe.&quot;<br>
