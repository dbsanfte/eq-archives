<br>
STREAMDANCE GLX AND METOLIUS –<br>
NEW CONCEPT IN TROUT FLY RODS FROM G.LOOMIS<br>
<br>
Woodland, Wash. 9/03 — With the goal of addressing the company’s mission - “To make every day you spend on the water memorable” – G.Loomis announces a new concept in trout fly fishing with its now available StreamDance fly rods.<br>
        Offered in 26 GLX and Metolius models, with Presentation, High Line Speed and Max Line Speed actions – and a 13-foot-4-inch ‘trout spey’ rod, the G.Loomis product development staff “spent hundreds of hours and traveled thousands of miles talking and listening to serious fly anglers, guides and fly shop owners about what makes a great trout rod,” said Gary Schaefer with G.Loomis. “It was very evident from our discussions with these anglers that they had an extreme passion for fly-fishing – the StreamDance rods reflect this passion and without their input and without us listening, these rods would have never come about.”<br>
From everything the G.Loomis staff learned, it was then in the hands of rod designer Steve Rajeff and his team to develop the most definitive trout fly rods G.Loomis has ever made. <br>
Rajeff and staff took into consideration all the various trout fishing available to fly anglers. “Whether you fish out East, in the Midwest, the Rockies, small streams, large spring creeks, fast water – no matter your preference – Steve and his team have created StreamDance rod actions to meet the demands of fishing conditions found coast to coast,” Schaefer said. “Plus with two performance levels, either with our exclusive GLX blanks or the Metolius rods with our proprietary graphite blend blanks, there’s a StreamDance that can make the day on the water memorable for any fly angler.”<br>
        Throughout the StreamDance series, anglers will notice the performance and technology that is expected in all rods that bear the G.Loomis name, notes Rajeff. But with StreamDance, “our emphasis was on the tapers, the design concept and looks and components of each finished rod,” Rajeff said. “From all our research into these rods, a recurring thought among anglers is they are most interested in how a rod casts, how it looks, how it feels – they already know they can count on G.Loomis for the high-tech materials and formulas we use. That’s what you see in the StreamDance rods.”<br>
        According to Rajeff, a majority of trout fly fishing conditions can be described under the headings of: Small Spring Creeks and Brooks; Medium Spring Creeks and Small Streams; Large Spring Creeks and Slow Water; Small Streams – Fast Water; Medium Streams – Fast Water/Large Spring Creeks; Large Rivers and Lakes; and Strong Wind and Distance Casting. “We designed specialized tapers to suit these conditions and satisfy the anglers style of casting by offering three actions,” said Rajeff. “They include Presentation, best for softer and delicate casts; High Line Speed, an action which offers control over a wide range of casting styles and water/wind conditions; and Max Line Speed, best suited for rapid fire casting from drift boats and when long distance and powerful casting is the norm.”<br>
<br>
         Presentation actions have a softer flex and load easily. When using a slower, smoother power casting stroke for accurate casts with super light tippets and tiny flies, “these will be the rods for consistent success,” Rajeff notes.  G.Loomis offers seven 3- and 4-piece GLX presentation rods in two, three, four and five weights. They range in lengths from 7-feet-9-inches to 9-feet. Metolius presentation rods include 3-piece, three weight 7- and 8-footers.<br>
        High line speed action StreamDance GLX and Metolius rods are moderately stiff with moderate-fast tapers. “These rods are all about versatility – powerful enough for extended distance, good control in windy conditions, yet light enough in the tip to cast tight loops when making short, accurate casts. You really feel the rod load at all distances,” explains Rajeff. The ten GLX versions are offered in a 3-piece three-weight, and 4-piece four through six-weights. Lengths range from 8-foot-3-inches to 10-feet. There are five, four-piece Metolius versions. Four-weight and five-weight rods are available in 8-foot-6-inch and 9-foot lengths, plus there’s a six-weight 9-footer.<br>
        While the assortment of presentation and high line speed StreamDance rods handle most needs and situations, the GLX Max Line Speed rod and Metolius Trout Spey rod are designed for specific type of anglers, specific conditions, and very technical fly rod challenges, Rajeff notes.<br>
        “Aggressive casters demanding fast casting cycle time, such as casting streamers out of a drift boat, and those wanting the extra power to punch out large indicators and split shot, and still have the power to set hooks during extended line drifts and have power to hook set will look to the StreamDance GLX Max Line Speed rod,” said Rajeff. “It’s a 4-piece, 9-foot five weight for maximum distance and maximum lines speed.”<br>
Rajeff adds the growing interest for using spey rods in the trout venue is also addressed in the StreamDance series. “At 13-feet-4-inches and best used as a two-hand rod, the Metolius ‘trout spey’ it is light enough to be cast one handed, and safe with 4X tippets,” Rajeff said. “A 14-inch trout puts a major bend in the rod, and it’s just a hoot to use.” While salmon and steelhead anglers have learned the advantages of two-handed rods, trout anglers can now have both casting efficiency and line-mending control. A 3-piecer for five and six weight lines, this StreamDance rod is for big-water trout fishing where conditions won’t allow a long back-cast. <br>
        The StreamDance GLX rods feature GLX graphite blanks – the first graphite developed specifically for the use in fishing rods, and REC Recoil striper and snake guides that will snap back to their original shape. Also featured is G.Loomis’ unique reel seat with an offset-oval sculptured barrel and a stabilized ‘California Buckeye Burl’ wood insert. <br>
        The StreamDance Metolius rods feature blanks with a blend of G.Loomis’ proprietary graphite, Hopkins &amp; Holloway stripper and hard chrome single-foot snake guides, and an offset-oval reel seat. On the traditional Presentation action rods, the reel seat insert has an engraving of a trout on it, while on the High Speed Line rods, the insert features G.Loomis’ ‘Fear No Fish’ logo. <br>
All StreamDance fly rods have premium-grade Portuguese cork grips, and ‘Roman numeral-style’ bands on the butt section to easily identify the line weight of each rod.<br>
With the StreamDance rods, “it’s more than just high performance materials, high-tech components and premium cork,” said Bruce Holt, executive director for G.Loomis. “It’s a new emphasis and a new expression of our understanding into the passion of fly-fishing for trout. And from this emphasis and understanding, and the all efforts put in by the entire G.Loomis team, we truly think that the StreamDance rods will make every day you spend on the water memorable.”<br>

<br>
Fishing Situations:<br>
<br>
—        Small Spring Creek &amp; Brooks: Fishing small spring creeks and brooks is always a joy, enhanced when using rods that load short, in the 15- to 35-foot ranges. Line speed should be slower for delicate and accurate presentations of the very tinniest of dry flies and nymphs. Models to try:<br>
GLX Presentation: 8’ #2 - 3pc; 7’9” #3 - 3pc and 7’9” #4 - 3pc<br>
Metolius Presentation: 7’ #3 - 3pc and 8’ #3 - 3pc <br>
<br>
<br>
—        Medium Spring Creeks &amp; Small Streams: Fishing small streams and medium size<br>
spring creeks often challenge the angler to extend casts approaching 45 feet. Slightly longer rod lengths help make casting tasks and line control mends easier. Light lines in three and four weights are the norm when the utmost in accuracy and presentation is needed, using flies from #14 down to #24, with 5X to 8X tippets.  Models to try:<br>
GLX – Presentation: 8’8” #3 - 3pc; 7’9” #4 - 3pc; 8’6” #4 - 4pc <br>
<br>
<br>
—        Large Spring Creeks &amp; Slow Water: When fishing large spring creeks or slow moving<br>
bodies of water, standing in relative openness exposes the angler to spooking fish. Longer range, soft presentation casts become a must under these conditions. Delicacy and accuracy are still at a premium, but enough power is needed to turn over longer leaders with a wide range of fly sizes. These are also great rods for early morning fishing on ponds with trout-sipping emergers.  Models to try:<br>
GLX Presentation: 9’ #4 - 4pc; 9 #5 - 4pc<br>
<br>
<br>
—        Small Streams &amp; Fast Water: Early season high water causes small creeks to flow much faster than later in the year. Often at these times, weighted nymphs are the ticket to success, and it is helpful to have a small rod with enough backbone to punch out these small weighted flies. Also, for casting dries on windy days, a faster tempo casting cycle will keep the fly on the water more minutes of the day. Models to try:<br>
GLX High Line Speed: 8’3” #3 - 3pc<br>
<br>
<br>
—        Medium Streams &amp; Fast Water/Large Spring Creeks &amp; Windy Conditions: Four weight rods in 8- and 9-foot lengths are becoming increasingly the most dominant player in the trout angler’s arsenal. The slightly more powerful designs within the High Line Speed range help create tight loops, controlled and accurate casts. When the wind picks up, take command on larger spring creeks with these positive casting rods.  Models to try:<br>
GLX High Line Speed: 8’6” #4 - 4pc; 9’ #4 - 4pc; 8’6” #5 - 4pc<br>
Metolius High Line Speed: 8’6” #4 - 4pc; 9’ #4 - 4pc; 8’6” #5 - 4pc<br>
<br>
— Large Rivers, Lakes &amp; All Weather: Big dries, strike indicators, streamers, weighted <br>
flies, long leaders, sinking tips, split shot, multi flies, long casts from float tubes, and even without much wind, are all buggers to cast. That’s why you need the extra horsepower of the High Line Speed rods. Should all the stars and mayflies align and the conditions get calm, the fine diameter tips can still protect light tippet, granted, not as well as the Presentation actions, but for trout fishing versatility, nothing beats these rods. Models to try:<br>
GLX High Line Speed: 9’ #5 - 4pc; 9’ #6 - 4pc; 9’6” #5 - 4pc; 9’6” #6 – 4pc; 10’ #5 – 4pc; 10’ #6 – 4 pc<br>
Metolius High Line Speed: 9’ #5 - 4pc; 9’ #6 - 4pc<br>
<br>
—        Strong Wind &amp; Technical Pocket Water: When big winds find you on the water, you need a cast that slices through it like a hot knife through butter. The oftentimes, fast and frantic situation of casting streamers to the bank out of a drift boat is made easier with a rod that allows you to react quickly. The faster you can false cast to re-position the fly inches from shore keeps the fly in the zone more consistently. Also, when chucking weighted nymphs long ways with what amounts to a cotton ball for a strike indicator, you need power to spare. Models to try:<br>
GLX Max Line Speed: 9’ #5 - 4pc<br>
<br>
—        Difficult Back Drops &amp; Technical Current Approaches: The bushes are just behind<br>
you. The fish are 60 feet out. What do you do? Roll out a single or double spey cast and you cover the spot, then mend, extending your drift to the confluence of the next river system. Steelhead and salmon anglers have been capitalizing on the use of the long rod to make casts with limited back cast space, and to keep the fly in the water more, not in the air. The 13’4” #5/6 Trout Spey is so light that it will still be fun catching a 12-inch redside rainbow on the Deschutes River. An 18-incher will feel like a summer run steelhead on a big rod. It is an ultra light two-hand rod, but a strong caster can cast it one handed. A 13’4” one hand rod? It’s is awesome at managing long leaders and nymph patterns in deep water spots, and can also push out large dries like stoneflies and hoppers patterns. Isaac Walton would be jealous. The model to try:<br>
Metolius Trout Spey: 13’4” #5/6 - 3 pc</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfishar>FlyFishAR</A> at: 8/30/03 1:38 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=148.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showNextMessage?topicID=148.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.emailToFriend?topicID=148.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.threadControl?topicID=148.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=148.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=148.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14">General Discussions<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13">Casting Corner<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm8">White River<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm9">Taneycomo<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm10">Little Red<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm11">Norfork<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm12">Places of Interest<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm5">Help Files<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm17">The Environment</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri>Fly Fishing Arkansas and Missouri</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14>General Discussions</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><a href="http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com">Fly Fishing Arkansas</a><font color=#000000> - </font><br><br> <a href="http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com">BACK TO FLY FISHING ARKANSAS HOME PAGE</a>
