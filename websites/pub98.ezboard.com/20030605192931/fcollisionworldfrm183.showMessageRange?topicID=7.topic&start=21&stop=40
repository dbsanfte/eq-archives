Mae blinked. Sometimes she wondered how Aeli knew it when people were lying and when they weren't. But the scream was pretty hearable. <br>
<br>
&quot;I won't come in if you don't want me to...but tell me if she's alright.&quot;<br>

Kain had somehow managed to find his way to thier room, with a little help from some servants. He opened the door and immediately his jaw dropped. <br>
<br>
There was a large bed off the the side, covered in lush and rich velvet burgundy and gold colors. Armor and weapons hung on the walls as well as many maps and other neat things. <br>
Like the girl's room, a large balcony was at the other end, through an open doorway and a large curtain hung over that doorway. A large sofa was at another corner, and he ran and plopped down onto it, a huge grin on his face.  <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

I'm not sure if it is a good idea for you to come in, but then, I can't stop you, can I?&quot; she bit, a little tense.<br>

He couldn't just walked away from her calling him.<br>
<br>
He looked down and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.<br>
&quot;Azalea.&quot; He turned back around. &quot;I guess I will see her.&quot; He walked pass Azalea and into the room to see Laurena wrapped in covers with a horror stricken face.<br>
&quot;Laurena?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mae looked at Azalea. &quot;Are you sure she'll be alright? I have healing powers...&quot; Her lavender eyes were sincere and worrying. &quot;I have soothing powers also.&quot; She added a little hopful. &quot;But if none of that will help then i'll leave.&quot;<br>

Kain breathed out. This was awesome. A real life castle... wow. And to think that he actualy finally go to come here, instead of staying behind. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot; He shouted in victory, getting up to look at one of the maps on the wall.<br>

There was death in her eyes, but she was not dying. Physically, anyway.  Azalea broke her free of the bind spell and she clung onto Aeli as if life depended on it, her words shaky and making no sense.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...I tried to take it off...&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I'll never...no..not again, I swear...it was so horrible, Aeli...please...I won't take it off...I can't...&quot;<br>
<br>
Azalea stood aside, wondering what on earth she would do now.  Laurena had already found the secret of the ankh..or at least, stumbled upon it.  She did not understand.  And Azalea could not tell her.<br>
<br>
Laurena's eyes blinked rapidly, but the look of death remained.  &quot;I saw..I...Aeli...&quot; she ended, whimpering into his shoulder, clutching him tighter.<br>
<br>
Azalea sighed.  &quot;There is nothing you can do for her, I'm afraid...it is something beyond physical ailment.&quot;  She walked out.  &quot;When you are finished, I would like to have a word with you, Aeli.&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 566<br> <font color=#8B0000>(5/3/03 4:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm183.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heehee...yeah. *cough* and awesome in combat...waha!</span><hr size=1> Aeli nodded at Azalea's words, stoking Laurena's hair and then wrapping his arms around her. She must've had a bad dream... but who wouldn't after all of what she went through.<br>
&quot;It's alright Laurena.&quot; <br>

Mae looked down at her booted feet, her eyes filled with heartbreak. <br>

He sat on the bed a moment, staring out the window. What was he going to do? <br>
Finally, he got up and followed Azalea's &quot;tracks&quot; and closed the door behind himself.<br>

Mae quickly found the library. She had, afterall, been here for almost a month now. Finding a book, she sat down and read it... burying herself in it. Maybe she would go for a walk later on... <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

<br>
Suddenly the floor seemed to shoot out of under Aeli's feet, but he didn't fall.  Neither did Azalea.  They zoomed down the hall and through several corridors, as fast as light itself, past unseeing maids and butlers and nobles.  Finally, they stopped, in a darkened, untended room.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is private enough.&quot;  She walked over to the window, whose black curtain was draped halfway against the sun and letting a little light in.  Instead of opening it more, she closed it.  &quot;If this were to be heard by any other without my discretion, it would surely mean Laurena's death.&quot;  She turned to him then, her staff casting the only light in the room, and it was not much.  <br>
<br>
&quot;She had no nightmare, Sir Aeli.  It was far worse than a nightmare.  I blame myself for it, I should have been awake and watching her.&quot;  Her eyes looked about and saw nothing of danger, it seemed, because she continued.  &quot;Such is my duty.  But enough.  I will tell you as much as I can, as promised in the wood.<br>
<br>
&quot;That Ankh she wears, it is no trifle thing.  It was given to her under the order of the gods, but I cannot tell you why.  Even for you to know, it would mean great danger for Laurena.  For even she herself does not know of her peril.  But she is clever.&quot;  Her eyes glimmered strangely in the artificial night.  &quot;It is the Ankh of Life.  It has the power to resurrect, to heal, to transfer energy through one shell to another.  Its powers are beyond my knowing, and I am the Head of my Order.  And only Laurena can wield it.  Unless...of course...she dies.<br>
<br>
&quot;That Ankh is a gift, of course, a gift of the gods, but alas it is also a curse.  It is her lifeline, and she has worn it far too long to become detached of it.  If she were to be able to take it off, or any other who was able, she would immediately die.  Such is the curse of the Ankhs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tryphaena holds the same curse over her head.  But hers, the Ankh of Death, gives death.  It is the predominant of the two, given by the dark god Athena.  If she gains control of the Ankh of Life, she will neither be living or dead...making her and all who favor her unstoppable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Azalea paused.  &quot;That is the reason why Tryphaena hunts her,&quot; she explained.  &quot;And torments her dreams as she does.  She will stop at nothing to destroy Laurena and all who stand in her path.&quot;  She became close to Alei's face, only mere inches, her half moon pupils glowing in their greyblue pools.  The smell of spice and spell components hung around her, giving off an intoxicating essence. &quot;It is easy to keep Tryphaena away. For the moment.  But our real danger is Laurena's curiosity.  We must keep her from taking it off.  We must keep her from knowing.  The Ankh weighs down on her everyday, though she does not feel it.  I trust you, Sir Aeli, not to tell her any of this.

Suddenly, it was light.  they were back in the hallway, and people were bustling about their business.<br>
<br>
She smiled faintly.  &quot;She will be fine, for the moment,&quot; she said.  &quot;I have put a charm on her so I will know if she is in danger. I think I'll go to the library.  I've heard that the Joy of Finia hold great spellbooks within its keep.  Good day.&quot; and she walked down the hallway, and out of sight.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 569<br> <font color=#8B0000>(5/4/03 9:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm183.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heehee...yeah. *cough* and awesome in combat...waha!</span><hr size=1> Aeli just stood there, taking it all in. He was always the one trusted with secrets... sometimes ones he wish he didn't know. Slowly, he took a deep breath. Maybe he'd tell Laurena tonight. Of course not about the ankh, but of his past. She had the right to know.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir Aeli! There you are!&quot; The cheerful yet busy person of Jerred came into view. &quot;The king is ready to see you! His majesty is waiting. He would like to meet young Kain also.&quot;<br>

Aeli nodded and the two went and found Kain laying on the lush couch, in thier room.<br>

Azalea came into the room, and a faint smile was set upon her face.  &quot;Ah. Miss Laurena. Are you well?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am...but I don't remember...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You fainted,&quot; Azalea explained, sitting down by her side.  &quot;Your fatigue got the better of you, I'm afraid. do not worry.  You should be alright by now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; Laurena said, smiling.  &quot;Alright.  I do feel better.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is good.&quot; she uncovered the siren.  &quot;I have been in the library in the meantime.  The castle is quite interesting. What say you and I go and have a look about? You shouldn't be confined in this room.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright!  Um..where is Aeli?&quot; Laurena asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;With the king,&quot; she said after some thought.  &quot;They are speaking with the king. We'll meet with them later.  but come.  The garden is very splendid this time of year.&quot;<br>

Laurena smiled happily.   &quot;Alright!&quot; she got up.  &quot;Let's go, then!&quot; and walked out with Azalea, who sighed quietly in guilt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 570<br> <font color=#8B0000>(5/4/03 11:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm183.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> agh!

The walls were covered in beautiful paintings, armor, weapons, maps, and many other things. A large table sat in the middle, and a rather tall man sat at the other end.<br>
<br>
He had peircing blue eyes and mohagany brown hair. He wore maroon velvet and gold. His face was very handsome and kingly... and had a mustache that just added to his kingly appearance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come in Sir Aeli! Master Kain! What a pleasure it is to see you again old friend.&quot; He got up and walked proudly over to Aeli and shook his head with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;So this is master Kain? Wow, what a fine young lad. Bet he's trained very well...by the best.&quot; The man gave a wink.<br>
<br>
Aeli gave a slight bow in honor.<br>
<br>
&quot;NIce to see you to your majesty.&quot; He said, coming back up and looking the king in the eyes.<br>
<br>
The king laughed and shook his head. &quot;Aeli, call me Kinoc. You know i've given you and your friends special permission. &quot;<br>
<br>
Aeli shook his head and gave a smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;So what brings you here? Oh, sit down! Make yourself comfortable.&quot; He said, sitting back down and motioning towards some chair.<br>
<br>
Kain and Aeli sat down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Kaed and some sirens.&quot; Aeli said,looking down at the table.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, and our home was attacked by a whole army of monsters! Kaed's boss must've sent them.&quot;Kain pointed out, loving telling the story.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, i see. Well you're welcome here as long as you like! I heard you brought to lovely ladies with you? A young woman and a mage? Is that correct?&quot; King kinoc raised his eyebrow.<br>

&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br>

<br>
She knelt down beside a bush of beautiful blue flowers with silverish centers. she smiled...she was instantly reminded of Aeli, his eyes and hair.  Looking about, and deciding no one would mind, she picked one and held it carefully, looking at him admiringly as she sang softly:<br>

Her ears pricked to the sound of boots. She turned around and saw Aeli himself approaching.  Smiling happily, she got up and ran to him, blushing.<br>
