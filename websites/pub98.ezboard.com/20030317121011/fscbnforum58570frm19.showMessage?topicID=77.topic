~ Confucius<br>
<br>
Stephen Crowley ran down the streets of Santa Carla, the Sabbat Pack hot on his trail. <br>
<br>
How had they found him? How had he been caught out in the open? <br>
<br>
Damnation! There must be a dozen of them!<br>
<br>
They howled and laughed like beasts as they chased him down abandoned streets. Where was everyone? Where were the Kine, out enjoying the evening? Where were the Sheriff and Scourge out on patrol? Where were any of the other Kindred of this domain? This was a clear Masquerade breach in progress!<br>
<br>
But Crowley was all alone against them, so he ran. <br>
Finally, desperately, he tried losing them in a back-alley, but suddenly there were more of them at the other end, too. The ones he had been running from cornered off the first exit.<br>
<br>
He was trapped. <br>
<br>
Crowley edged his way to the center. On both sides, the Sabbat started to close in. <br>
<br>
Well, dammit, if he was going down, he'd take as many of them with him as he could. <br>
<br>
Crowley drew both of his guns and started firing...<br>
... and was rewarded by empty *clicks*.<br>
<br>
His guns weren't loaded.<br>
<br>
How could that be? He ALWAYS kept his guns loaded. <br>
In frustration Crowley threw the weapons down. <br>
Must, at least, stop one of them....<br>
<br>
Crowley looked at the largest one, a massive Gangrel, in the eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;I command you to stop!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Sabbat paused for a moment, and then began to laugh. The others joined in. They could smell the desperation Crowley felt. They moved closer and were now right on top of him. He tried fighting them off by hand but was quickly overwhelmed and restrained. They started tearing into him...<br>
<br>
.... and suddenly they weren't Sabbat anymore.<br>
<br>
The Prince. Blackmore. Prophet. Trevor. Yoji Tetsuo. Keith. Cybel. Estelle. The Herald. The Populace he had sworn to serve and protect. All of them were there. They were his pursuers, tormentors, murderers. <br>
<br>
Crowley turned to the Gangrel he had tried to dominate, and was thrust into even further despair. <br>
Jason Black laughed.   <br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Crowley whispered. Not like this! Any way but this!<br>
While the others continued to taunt and tear into him, Jason Black morphed into a massive Panther. The beast growled, and then lept at Crowley's throat....<br>
<br>
&quot;NO!&quot; <br>
<br>
Crowley sat up in bed. He was in his haven. Checking his alarm clock, Crowley saw that the hour of his rising had only just arrived.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bad dream, eh, Crowley?&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley grumbled and started to rise from his bed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Roche,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a commonly held etiquette not to enter someone else's haven without invitation.&quot;<br>
<br>
The voice of Kaergon Roche, former Prince of Santa Carla, seemed amused by this. <br>
<br>
&quot;Commonly held etiquette among the living, Crowley.&quot; He corrected. &quot;You'll find its one of the advantages of being dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley stood up and looked at his hands, as if for the first time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Their going to destroy me me aren't they?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Crowley, let me pose you a question: As Ventrue, who do we trust? I mean truly, genuinely trust?&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley considered that for a moment, drawing from his Sire's teachings. The other Camarilla clans were children who needed the constant guidance of the Ventrue. The Sabbat were sworn enemies who would do almost anything to destroy the Camarilla. The Independent clans were, at best untrustworthy neighbors. The Anarchs could not be trusted to follow the Masquerade. Lupines and other supernatural creatures had never been friends of the Cainites. Mortals had proven long ago that they could be dangerous if given knowledge. Ghouls could be competent, loyal servants, but in the end they were only that; servants. <br>
<br>
Other Ventrue? They all played the same game, driving ambitiously to the top of the mountain. Each of them would stab the others in the back if possible.<br>
<br>
Finally, Crowley reached his answer. &quot;No one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly.&quot; said Roche. &quot;We cannot trust anyone, not even ourselves. It can be a very lonely existence, but that's the price we pay.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One of many.&quot; Crowley muttered. <br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed, and don't sound so dissapointed. You know there have been rewards. This nice haven of yours, for example.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley sighed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Roche, may I confide in you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Crowley, honestly, who am I going to tell?&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley nodded. &quot;There are times, sir, when I fear my Embrace was a mistake.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley admission was rewarded by laughter. &quot;If it makes you feel any better Crowley, there are times I fear your Embrace was a mistake, as well!&quot;<br>
<br>
The words stung, but Crowley avoided flinching. &quot;Nice. I meant as a Ventrue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I suppose you would've been happier if you'd been Embraced as a Gangrel? Or a Lasombra? Or a Toreador?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, anything but a Toreador.&quot; Crowley deadpanned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, good, your sense of humor is returning. But to answer your problem, yes, you have made some very foolish moves unbecoming of a member of our Clan.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So why have you stuck with me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because, frankly, your the only link I have left at this point.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It wasn't a compliment. It was an admission of the desperate nature of my situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what about the desperate nature of my situation?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;CROWLEY.&quot; Roche's voice now seemed more like a sneer. &quot;I may be dead, and you may be alive, but never forget that regardless of these facts, we are VENTRUE. We are the chosen ones. We need to be strong and resilient, and we need to survive. I will do everything I can to guide you along a path that will allow you to redeem yourself, and make you a power not only in this city but in the world. But don't ever come to me again seeking comfort or sympathy or pity, because quite frankly, I find it absolutely despicable in a fellow Ventrue.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley's back straightened. Roche was right. Regardless of what might or should have happened, he was a Ventrue in the here and now, and that was all that mattered.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're right, Mr. Roche. I will not falter like that again.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. Now, close your eyes again. How much closer are you to the light?&quot; <br>
<br>
Crowley closed his eyes, and looked down the dark tunnel.<br>
<br>
This time, the light was much closer. <br>
<br>
&quot;What's at the end of the tunnel, sir?&quot; Crowley asked. &quot;I mean, I know you told me that's where I was headed... and I do sorely want to get there, but I have no idea what it is I'm reaching out for.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't get into it without sounding metaphysical, and that's so unlike me.&quot; Roche responded. &quot;Suffice to say that its the step that will determine if you press on with a purpose or simply fade away into obscurity. Your making good progress Crowley, and your time will come if you allow it. Your walking the path, both in your mind and in the city.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;In the meantime, Crowley, you have a defense to prepare. You'll never reach that stage in your evolution if you don't survive the coming nights.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley sighed. &quot;I have been back in this city for more than a month. In that time, I've interrogated countless lost ghouls, covered up breaches of the Masquerade, wiped the memories clean of individuals who could threaten us, revealed the machinations of both the Baali and some new Hunter no one's heard from yet. I have collected no boons or status from these acts, despite the fact I was not a city officer and therefore under no obligation to act. For all these acts, I am to be put on trial, made a disgrace of once again, and quite possibly destroyed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley slammed his fist angrily against the wall. &quot;All because of some damn Tremere Anarch!&quot;<br>
<br>
Calmly but firmly Roche responded. &quot;Crowley, remember what I said: Ventrue. Now control yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley clenched his fist and summoned his willpower. After a moment, the anger was gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. Now then, you're wrong on two points, Crowley. First, just for the record, you WERE obligated to act as you did, to serve this city, its Prince and the Camarilla.&quot; <br>
Crowley focused for a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ventrue.&quot; He said finally.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Replied Roche. &quot;Now, then, as to the cause of your current dillemia, well... I won't give you anything, Crowley. But remember what I told you; never trust anyone, not even the words of another Ventrue. Remember your dream, and consider that your subconcous is trying to tell you something. Then decide how you want to proceed with your business.&quot;<br>
<br>
The gears in Crowley's mind started to whirl, and after a few moments, pieces began falling into place. Crowley was quite surprised and satisfied that his blood didn't start to boil again. He finally nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll remember what you've said, Mr. Roche.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. Remember, Crowley, one of the main reasons our clan has thrived is because we see the &quot;big picture&quot;, as the Kine call it. We play the long game, and because of that, we are usually better prepared to deal with new developments. I prefer to relate it to a chessboard. You need to be aware of all the pieces and all the squares. If you focus too much on just one area, you'll be crushed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley nodded again. &quot;Any advice on my defense?&quot;<br>
Crowley was met with silence.<br>
<br>
He grinned. &quot;Of course,&quot; he said. &quot;Ventrue.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Crowley got dressed, walked to his desk, and began composing a defense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stephencrowley>Stephen Crowley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/11/03 7:44:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=77.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crowley's Journey - Vol. V - Icons</span><hr size=1> OOC: As Mike/Crowley's mind continues to deteriorate...<br>

<br>
Your literaries do a very good job of leaving me hanging... i always have more questions after i'm done.  Like:<br>
<br>
&quot;Is Mr. Roche going to completely take over?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Does this ever happen when he's not alone?&quot;<br>
<br>
and of course<br>
&quot;Wow, what the hell is going to happen at next weeks LARP?&quot;<br>
<br>
I just want to see these two in some different context (the car ride was nice)...<br>
<br>
It does all depend on how much you want to reveal, and how soon, and any number of other factors... so please, take your time and give me more.  hehe.<br>

Thanks for the feedback. Always happy to please a fan. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Crowley actually had a &quot;conversation&quot; with Kaegon at game TONIGHT. Unfortunately for those others present, it happened only in his head, and this was when he was sort of sulking in the corner, away from everyone else. He knows fully well that it would really be unhelpful for these experiences to come to light at this point IC. <br>
<br>
That is not to say that it will never happen. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'll post that little encounter either Saturday or Sunday. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll continue to drop hints about where Crowley's going. He's not dead yet; he's headed down the tunnel. What, exactly, will he become when he reaches the other end? And what will the other Kindred of the city think of him when they learn what he has become?<br>
<br>
Hmmmmm... <br>
<br>
I may need to start writing two of these a week. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
