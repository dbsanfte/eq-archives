<br>
It is with regret that I must inform you, the populace, of a dramatic change in the political structure of our fair city.  Our esteemed Prinzessin, Marie Mercer-Renald and her Seneschal, Grifon Blackmore, have been called to duty by those in power in the Camarilla.  This call has forced them to effectively abandon their posts here in Santa Carla.  This is a heavy blow to this city.  The Camarilla Kollegium seems to have plans for our now former Prinzessin and Seneschal which we are not privy to.  Frau Mercer-Renald, Herr Blackmore and I have met on this situation, and Her Highness has invested myself as Vertrauensmann der Arbeiter or Steward of Santa Carla until such time as a suitable candidate for Prince presents themselves.<br>
In the interim, I, along with the Primogen Kollegium will act in the missing Prince’s stead.  As Steward, I will act as Seneschal and a voice on the Primogen Kollegium.  As such, I will abdicate my position as Nosferatu Primogen and nominate my clansman Zarthas as Primogen in my stead.<br>
In light of recent events, I must ask members of the following clans to nominate someone in your clan to represent you in the Primogen Kollegium; Gangrel, Ventrue and Clan Toreador, unless Frauline Estelle returns by this Friday evening.  <br>
If there is one among you who wishes to claim Praxis and take the throne, you must have the approval of the Primogen.  We will not allow just any Cainite to assume control of this city without say.  If you presume to take the throne by force, I would recommend you reconsider your plan of action.  I will personally take exception to a violent uprising and take appropriate actions with the aid of those of the other Primogen if need be.<br>
If you have questions, please do not hesitate to voice them to me.  I will return all inquiries with as much haste as I can.<br>

I'm afraid I don't understand. Both members of this esteemed populace have become Alastors? Or have they been apointed to the position of Archon beneath their respective Justicars? I enquire only to spread word of their eminence to the vampires who compose this sect and to be doubly prepared when next we meet.<br>

<br>
In domains filled with neonates, it is not uncommon for a position such as primogen to switch hands quickly and often; it is a sign of how unstable these domains are. In domains with even the youngest claiming status, and Santa Carla is certainly one of these, it is unheard of for a Prince or Seneschal to &quot;skip out&quot;. As a member of the Camarilla, it is my duty and choice to sing the praises and to whisper of the hubris of my fellow Kindred. When both the Prince and the Seneschal disappear, enquiring minds want to know why.<br>
<br>
I have known two alastors as they earned their position, if Ms. Mercer-Renault and Mr. Blackmore have attained a position of such eminence, I will be glad to speak well of them and hold their names as shining examples of the Camarilla if I again meet them; if this is not the case, I'm sure the harpies will make more note than myself.<br>

Both Frau Mercer-Renald and Herr Blackmore have been asked rather insitently to take the mantle of Prinzessin and Seneschal in another Camarilla city.  Their location and the Camarilla Kollegium's resons for this are unknown to me at this time.  If an answer is forthcoming, I will, of course, inform the populace.  Until such time, we will all have to merely speculate.  The rumors and speculation, I fear, have already begun.  As Frauline Hart has pointed out, Alastors and Archons are not lightly made and I have not seen any evidence to support that as the case.  With all respect to Frau Mercer-Renald, can you see her hunting down and slaying Elder Kindred?  In this time of change, please, let us not place unnessecary and incorrect speculation where it is not useful.<br>

Kindred of Santa Carla,<br>
<br>
I assure those of you who have posted to this thread that I still retain the ability to read and have been watching its progress. While I can understand the suspicion and doubt that may fill some Kindred's minds concerning Ms. Mercer-Renald and I's departure from Santa Carla, I wish to assure the populace that there is little mystery behind its motivations. Santa Carla as a domain has grown in the last five months beneath Ms. Mercer-Renald's reign. I daresay the city has earned a good deal of respect in the eyes of the Camarilla as well. Unfortunately, these efforts have not gone unrecognized and like many Kindred are called to serve as Alastors and Archons, the Camarilla has called upon both Her Majesty and myself to serve another role.<br>
<br>
I assure you that Ms. Mercer-Renald and I thought long and hard upon the decision to accept this assignment. Were not such a capable Kindred as Count Orlock able to take over as Steward till a suitable ruler could be found in the city I daresay we would not have been able to accept these duties. There are places in the Camarilla that are much like Santa Carla's old unstable governments, and not all have had the benefit of months of stable rulership. These places require attention as well. The Elders know this and they do what they feel is best for the Camarilla. Ms. Mercer-Renald and I are both in Clans that do not often enjoy the luxury of having personal freedoms to move where we wish to move. <b>We do what we are told by our Elders.</b> This is a lesson that many Kindred in Santa Carla can still benefit from.<br>
<br>
It is my belief that there are those among the Camarilla who wish to test Santa Carla's resolve. To test if the city is capable of retaining its Camarilla Tradition, its Primogen Council, and its stable order, despite having the two officers who uphold those most directly, removed. There are many of you who see "being Camarilla" as a function of which leaders are in power. You could not be more wrong. "Being Camarilla" means retaining those same values and order, despite who rules your city. The Traditions and the desire to retain Camarilla power must pervade among the whole of the populace. If all Kindred in Santa Carla are true to that purpose, then a new Prince will be chosen and the city will continue what has been started. Then, I believe, it will be truly ready to be acknowledged as a rightful member of this society.<br>
<br>
Lastly. I have heard assertations that Her Majesty and I are "skipping out". I find such assertations to be completely and utterly insulting. Count Orlock. I ask you to find out the names of those individuals who would say that I have shirked my responsibilities to the Camarilla in any way. I assure you when I return to Santa Carla, and its very likely I someday will, I make each Kindred who I find out about saying such things a promise that I will show them exactly how little they do understand about my will and my sense of duty to the Camarilla. So, if you wish to take your jabs and your shots in our absence, then do so. But I promise you that whatever short-term gains you will reap will not be worth what you are sowing.<br>
<br>
I will be posting more details concerning Ms. Mercer-Renald and I's duties when I am able.<br>
