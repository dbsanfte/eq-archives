Spoilers: No specific eppies that I can think of, but up to Rosetta in the second season to be safe.<br>
Summary: Chloe and Lex are exposed to a chemical spill near kryptonite and develop the ability to hear each other’s thoughts and see some images inside each other’s heads.<br>
Disclaimer: Not mine, no infringement intended, please don’t sue.<br>
Feedback: YES!! REVIEW!!  Geez, that sounded incredibly needy.<br>
Archival: Sure – just let me know where.<br>
Author’s Note: Oh man.  You guys are going to kill me, but I needed to write a fluff fic.  I’m sorry.  I love writing my drama, romance, and angst stories, but I needed something that was just for fun.  It’s not going to be a long story (probably only a few chapters) and it’s just for me, but if you guys like it too, then all the better.  BTW, I don’t know Gabe’s secretary’s name or if he even has one, so just pretend that I know what I’m talking about.  In case you’re not familiar with my writing –  “represent spoken words” and ‘represent thoughts’.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe walked into her father’s office and gave the secretary one of her beaming smiles.  The older woman smiled back at her.<br>
<br>
“Hi Kathy,” Chloe greeted cheerfully as she swung her key ring around on her finger.  “Is he ready yet?”  Kathy shook her head.<br>
<br>
“Sorry sweetie, he’s not here,” she answered.  Chloe’s smile fell.<br>
<br>
“His car is in the shop and I was supposed to pick him up.  He could have at least called me and let me know that I didn’t need to drive all the way out here,” Chloe rambled.  Kathy chuckled.<br>
<br>
“I meant he’s not in his office,” she clarified.  Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“I knew that,” she said.  <br>
<br>
“He was called down to lab seven, something about one of the vats leaking,” Kathy said.  “But you’re welcome to wait here if you want.”  Chloe seemed to think about it and then shook her head.<br>
<br>
“No thanks.  I’m a little hungry.  Can you tell me where the vending machines are?”  She asked.  Kathy went back to her typing.<br>
<br>
“Down the hall and take a left,” she said without raising her head from the computer screen.  Chloe turned around to head out the door and paused when Kathy spoke again.  “Chloe?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah?”<br>
<br>
“Don’t let your father catch you snooping around down there,” Kathy said, knowing full well that Chloe couldn’t pass up the urge to find out about the vat leak.  Chloe bit her lip as she smiled.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she replied in a faux innocent voice.  Kathy grinned and kept typing as Chloe walked away.  ‘Hmm, maybe I should have gotten directions,’ Chloe mused as she tried to make her way through the labyrinth of hallways.  She smiled when she saw a sign next to a door indicating that it was the entrance to lab seven, but the smile quickly fell when she saw that it had a keycard and pad entry lock.  “Damn,” she mumbled.  As if by divine intervention, at least in Chloe’s mind, the door opened and one of the employees came walking through.  She stuck out her hand to keep the door from closing.  The older man smiled at her briefly and she smiled back.  <br>
<br>
He turned and walked down the hallway, paying her virtually no regard.  Chloe tried to keep herself from laughing.  Security controls were a good thing if the employees actually enforced them and an even better thing for her when they didn’t.  She stepped into the lab and took a quick look around.  She guessed that the small group of people huddled around a vat was probably where the spill was, especially since she could see Gabe and Lex standing with them.  Lex looked out of place wearing his expensive suit and no lab jacket, but she figured that he rarely spent time in that section of the plant.  She began to walk over there, disregarding the warning signs that said safety gloves and hats must be worn at all times in that area.  Gabe spotted her and gave her a small wave.<br>
<br>
“Hey sweetheart,” he said as she walked up to him.  Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“Hi Dad,” she replied.  “Mr. Luthor,” she said with a nod of her head.<br>
<br>
“Miss Sullivan,” Lex greeted.  “What brings you to lab seven?”  He didn’t look pleased that she was there.  The last thing he needed was for her to do an article on the vat leak and end up having the EPA shut them down for a while.  She shrugged as if it was no big deal.<br>
<br>
“Kathy said that Dad was down here, and I’m picking him up from work today,” Chloe answered.  Lex looked at her with suspicion, but accepted the excuse.  Chloe turned to Gabe.  “So are you ready yet?”  Her dad frowned and looked at the floor, where a new puddle of the liquid from the vat was starting to form.<br>
<br>
“I’m afraid not,” he said with a shake of his head.  “Go ahead and go home.  I’ll just catch a ride with someone from the plant.”  Chloe crossed her arms.<br>
<br>
“And you couldn’t have told me this *before* I drove all the way out here?”  She asked with mock anger.  Gabe grinned.<br>
<br>
“Sorry sweetheart,” he said.  Chloe shrugged.  <br>
<br>
“No problem,” she said.  “See you when you get home.”  Chloe hadn’t noticed that the puddle extended to where she was and when she turned to walk away, she slipped and fell.  “Yuck!”  The liquid was filmy and now covering her posterior and her hands.  “What is this stuff?”  <br>
<br>
“I’d tell you, but I’m pretty sure you don’t want to know,” Gabe answered.  Chloe made a disgusted face.  She noticed that a couple of the small meteor rocks she had in her bag had fallen out and were now covered in film as well.  <br>
<br>
“As long as it comes off,” she said.  On instinct, Lex reached out his hand to help her up, not paying attention to the fact that neither one of them was wearing gloves.  Chloe picked up the rocks and then took Lex’s hand with her free hand.  They yanked their hands away from each other after she was standing.  “It’s burning!”  Lex frowned at his now goop covered hand.<br>
<br>
“You’re right,” he said with displeasure.  “We’d better get to clean up.”  Chloe nodded in agreement and dropped the rocks back into her bag.  Gabe gave them a sympathetic grin.<br>
<br>
“At least we know that it’s not toxic,” he called at them as they were walking toward the clean up area.  “You should be fine.”  Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“That’s really comforting,” she said sarcastically.  Lex chuckled and then noticed that she was looking down at her hands.  <br>
<br>
“Still hurts?”  He asked.  Chloe frowned.<br>
<br>
“A little, but it seems to be going away,” she said.  “You?”<br>
<br>
“The same,” Lex said.  He got a small smirk on his face as they finally reached the sinks.  “So your Dad calls you sweetheart?”  He teased.  She shot him a glare out of the corner of her eye as they both pumped some liquid sanitizer onto her hands and ran them under the water.<br>
<br>
“Your Dad doesn’t call you sweetheart?”  She bit back.  Lex laughed loudly.<br>
<br>
“No,” he answered.  “But my Mom used to call me ‘dumpling’.”  Chloe laughed and smiled at him.<br>
<br>
“I’ll have to remember that,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Please don’t,” Lex said seriously.  Chloe looked at her hands after drying them off.  They were a little red, as if the top layer of skin had been burned off.  She frowned and held them up for Lex to see.<br>
<br>
“Is your hand red?”  She asked.  He looked down at his own hand.<br>
<br>
“A little, but I’m sure it’ll be fine.  At least it’s only one of my hands,” he said with a small smirk.  Chloe gave him a forced grin and turned to leave.<br>
<br>
“Whatever you say *dumpling*,” she threw over her shoulder.  Lex cringed.  He knew he shouldn’t have told her that.<br>
<br>
Chloe waved goodbye to her dad and left to go home.  The drive home was long and boring as usual, and Chloe started to daydream as she drove down the back roads.  She told herself a million times that she was over Clark and that she had to stop thinking of him like that, but a few little fantasies weren’t going to hurt anyone, right?  An image flitted through her mind of she and Clark making love and she smiled to herself as she pulled up in her driveway.  Lex Luthor had a very different reaction.  He was talking to Gabe and suddenly Chloe’s daydream appeared in his mind.  He smiled inwardly at the image of Chloe being naked, but then saw Clark and he shook his head to try and clear the picture from his mind.<br>
<br>
‘What the hell was that?!’  He thought to himself.  Chloe furrowed her brow and looked around the room.  She could have sworn she heard a man’s voice.<br>
<br>
‘What the hell was what?’  She thought to herself as she kept looking for the man who she knew had to be there.  Lex paled when he recognized Chloe’s voice in his head.<br>
<br>
‘Chloe?’  He thought.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I’m right here,” Chloe said aloud.  “Where are you?  And more importantly, *who* are you, and what are you doing in my house?”  Lex cringed, but did his best to compose himself.<br>
<br>
“Gabe, I’m not feeling too well,” he said.  “I’m going home.  Can you handle this?”  Gabe grinned and nodded.<br>
<br>
“No problem.”<br>
<br>
‘Gabe?’ Chloe thought.  “My Dad’s at work,” she said to the air, hoping that the man would come out of hiding.<br>
<br>
‘I’m at work too Chloe,’ Lex thought.  ‘I think something happened to us.’  Chloe’s eyes grew wide when she finally recognized Lex’s voice, and realized that it was coming from within her own head.<br>
<br>
‘Well fix it!’  She mentally yelled.  <br>
<br>
‘I’m on my way home now,’ Lex said.  ‘I have the files on the chemical back at the house.’<br>
<br>
‘Speed!  I can’t have your voice inside my head Lex!’  She said.  Lex pursed his lips, knowing that he would regret his next sentence.<br>
<br>
‘It’s not just our voices,’ Lex thought.  <br>
<br>
‘What do you mean?’  Chloe made her way to the refrigerator and took out a small container of hot fudge topping.  Her mind drifted to less than chaste thoughts of what she could be doing with Clark and the chocolate and Lex yelled at her.<br>
<br>
“Stop it!”  He practically screamed.  Chloe furrowed her brow.<br>
<br>
‘Stop what?  I was just fixing myself some ice cream,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘Stop fantasizing about you and Clark!’  Lex ordered.  ‘Don’t get me wrong, the images of you are terrific, but I have no desire to see you having sex with another man.’  Chloe choked on the ice cream she just tried to swallow.  A furious blush rose to her cheeks.<br>
<br>
‘You – you ---’<br>
<br>
‘Saw it.  Yes.  I told you, it’s not just our voices,’ Lex thought.  <br>
<br>
“Oh God,” Chloe groaned in embarrassment.<br>
<br>
‘Just try and control yourself, don’t let it happen again,’ Lex told her.  Chloe’s mouth opened a little.  How dare he tell her what to think or not to think?<br>
<br>
‘What’s the matter?’  She asked.  ‘Jealous that it wasn’t you?’  Lex squared his jaw.<br>
<br>
‘Don’t be ridiculous, I ---’ Lex’s thoughts drifted to a vivid image of he and Chloe making love on his bed.  They were sweaty and writhing against each other with full passion.  Chloe screamed her release and Lex tried to clear his thoughts.<br>
<br>
“What the hell was that?!”  Chloe yelled.  Lex ran his hand around the back of his neck.<br>
<br>
“Don’t get mad at me, you’re the one who suggested it,” Lex said.  He frowned when he realized that he was arguing with her aloud even though she wasn’t there.<br>
<br>
‘I – argh!  Just find a way to fix it!  And no more thinking about – you know – for either of us.  Deal?’<br>
<br>
‘Deal,’ Lex thought.  He immediately regretted thinking it.  He was certain now that he had an imprint of the two of them in that position in his mind that he would want to think about it frequently.  He imagined himself kissing her passionately, their tongues maneuvering against each other in an erotic dance; him moving his hands under her shirt and ---<br>
<br>
“Knock it off!”  Chloe yelled.  Lex snapped out of his thoughts.<br>
<br>
‘Sorry,’ he thought.  A small smirk crossed his lips.  <br>
<br>
“Knock what off?”  Lana asked in confusion as she walked into the house.  Chloe turned around to face her and offered her a nervous smile.<br>
<br>
“Nothing, nothing’s wrong,” Chloe lied.<br>
<br>
‘Who are you talking to?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘Lana just got home,’ Chloe explained.  She thought she heard Lex snicker and shook her head.  “How was work?”<br>
<br>
“Fine,” Lana said.  “Kind of busy.  But you’ll never guess what happened!”  Lana seemed excited and Chloe sat down next to her.  <br>
<br>
“What happened?”  Chloe asked.<br>
<br>
‘What happened?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘Shut up,’ Chloe thought.  ‘I’m talking to Lana.’<br>
<br>
“Okay, you know Damian Thomas?”  Lana asked excitedly.  Chloe nodded.  “I think he likes you.  He was asking all these questions about you, like if you were seeing anybody and stuff.”<br>
<br>
“Really?”  Chloe asked.  Lana nodded happily.<br>
<br>
“So what do you think?  You want me to try and hook you two up?”  She asked.<br>
<br>
‘Would you please tell me what’s going on?’  Lex asked.  ‘And who the guy is?’  Chloe ignored him.<br>
<br>
“I – uh – maybe,” Chloe said.  Lana rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Okay, well think about it and let me know,” she said.  Chloe nodded and buried her head in her hands after Lana left the room.<br>
<br>
‘Thinking about it is the last thing I should do,’ Chloe thought to herself.<br>
<br>
‘Thinking about what?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘God!  You’re nosier than I am,’ she thought.  Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
‘It’s a little hard not to be when we share each other’s thoughts,’ he replied.<br>
<br>
‘I guess that’s a valid point,’ Chloe conceded.<br>
<br>
‘So are you going to tell me what’s going on?’  He asked.<br>
<br>
‘Lana thinks some guy – the guy in the mental picture – likes me and wants to try and set us up on a date,’ Chloe said.  Lex was silent for a minute and Chloe got her hopes up that maybe their connection had worn off.<br>
<br>
‘I don’t think it would be a good idea for either of us to date until we have this sorted out,’ Lex said.  Chloe frowned.<br>
<br>
‘I’m not going to give up the little social life I have just so you won’t feel uncomfortable,’ Chloe thought.  Lex pictured them making love again.  The image was strong and Chloe could feel herself becoming aroused at the very thought of it.  ‘Okay, stop it!  You made your point.’<br>
<br>
‘Thank you.’<br>
<br>
‘Whatever,’ Chloe thought shortly.  ‘Just look over your files and see if there’s anything we can do to reverse this.’<br>
<br>
‘Of course *sweetheart*,’ Lex replied.  <br>
<br>
‘Bastard.’<br>
<br>
‘You can call me anything you’d like, as long as it keeps images of you with teenage boys out of my head,’ Lex quipped.<br>
<br>
‘Fine.  *Dumpling*.’<br>

Chloe’s patience was wearing thin and Lex’s was now non-existent.  Chloe finished up her harried meal with her dad and Lana and pushed herself away from the table.<br>
<br>
“I’m going to get an early start on my homework,” Chloe said.  Gabe arched an eyebrow at her.<br>
<br>
“On a Friday night?”  He asked with surprise.  Chloe managed to fake a smile.<br>
<br>
“Well, if I get it done now then I have the rest of the weekend free,” she explained.  <br>
<br>
“Ah,” Gabe said with a smile.  Lana smiled at her also.<br>
<br>
“So does that mean you’ve come to a decision about D-” she glanced at Gabe and then back at Chloe, “you know?”  Chloe opened her mouth to speak, but closed it before saying anything.  She smiled at Lana.<br>
<br>
“I’ll have to get back to you on that,” Chloe said.<br>
<br>
‘No,’ Lex reminded her.  ‘I just got a mental image of that guy again, so I can infer that you were talking about going out with him, and the answer is no.’<br>
<br>
‘You’re not my social director Lex,’ she thought as she made her way up the stairs.  <br>
<br>
‘As long as our minds are connected I am,’ he countered.<br>
<br>
‘I was thinking ---’<br>
<br>
‘No you weren’t, I would have heard you.  Remember?’  Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Would you shut up for just a second?  God you’re annoying!’  Chloe was ready to drive over to his house and strangle him.<br>
<br>
‘It’s the truth,’ he said.<br>
<br>
‘I know it’s the truth that you’re annoying,’ she said with a smile.  ‘I’m surprised to hear you admit it.’<br>
<br>
‘Not that,’ Lex thought with aggravation.  ‘The part about me hearing you.’<br>
<br>
‘Maybe you don’t hear all my thoughts,’ Chloe mused.<br>
<br>
‘If that’s the case, I’d be forever grateful if you’d filter out those ghastly images of you and Clark together,’ Lex said.<br>
<br>
‘Ghastly?  There’s nothing ghastly about ---’<br>
<br>
‘Please,’ he said sarcastically.  ‘Even in your fantasies you don’t look right for each other.’<br>
<br>
‘Hey!’<br>
<br>
‘I’m just pointing out the obvious,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
‘Ugh!  Ignoring you now,’ she thought.  Lex scoffed.<br>
<br>
‘Best of luck with that,’ he said.  <br>
<br>
‘I need some music to calm me,’ Chloe thought.  ‘Maybe I can drown you out.’  Lex chuckled aloud and it came through his thoughts as well.  Chloe glanced through her cds and picked one.  She placed it in her cd player and selected the track she wanted.  ‘Prepare to be drowned out,’ she thought.  The music started playing and because Chloe was thinking about it, it came through loud and clear in Lex’s head.<br>
<br>
<br>
You belong to my heart<br>
Now and forever<br>
Though our love had it's start<br>
Not long ago<br>
<br>
Well we were gathering stars<br>
And a million guitars<br>
Played our love song<br>
<br>
When I said I love you<br>
Every beat of my heart<br>
Said it too<br>
<br>
Was a moment like this<br>
When I first found you<br>
And your eyes threw a kiss<br>
When they met mine<br>
<br>
Now we own all the stars<br>
And a million guitars<br>
Are still playing<br>
<br>
Now you are a song<br>
And you'll always belong <br>
To my heart<br>
<br>
Now you are a song<br>
And you'll always belong <br>
To my heart<br>
<br>
<br>
‘Chloe?’  Lex thought.  Chloe lay down on her bed, closed her eyes, and groaned softly.<br>
<br>
‘I hope you’re happy.  I was almost able to convince myself that you weren’t inside my head,’ she said.<br>
<br>
‘Sorry to disappoint you,’ Lex thought with a grin.<br>
<br>
‘Whatever.  Did you want something?’  Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘We should at least *try* to be civil toward each other.’<br>
<br>
‘That would kind of negate my homicide defense,’ Chloe thought.  Lex smiled broadly.<br>
<br>
‘The voices in your head made you do it?’  <br>
<br>
‘Well, it’s just the one if you want to be specific your honor,’ she thought.  Lex chuckled.<br>
<br>
‘So what were you thinking earlier?’  He asked.<br>
<br>
‘You know what I was thinking earlier, you were sort of there,’ she said.<br>
<br>
‘No, I mean the part you said that ---’<br>
<br>
‘Oh,’ Chloe thought.  ‘I was wondering if proximity might have anything to do with it.’<br>
<br>
‘You think it might get better if we were further away from each other?’  He asked.<br>
<br>
‘It’s worth a shot,’ she said.  ‘Tomorrow’s Saturday.  Maybe you could have a date with one of your model slash bimbos in Metropolis or something.’<br>
<br>
‘Nice to know you think so highly of my taste in women,’ Lex said sarcastically.<br>
<br>
‘Have you seen the women you go out with?’  She countered.<br>
<br>
‘You just want me to go to Metropolis so you can go out with that guy that Lana wants to set you up with,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Damian,’ Chloe filled in for him.  Lex rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
‘Damian,’ he repeated.  ‘As in *The Omen*?  I should think that would be a major hint that you shouldn’t go out with him right there.’  Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
‘I’ll mention it to him,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘Before or after he tries to make you his demon bride?’  Lex quipped.<br>
<br>
‘Funny,’ she said sarcastically.  ‘So do you want to try the proximity idea or not?’<br>
<br>
‘Can’t hurt,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Great!  Now get out of my head so I can do my homework.’<br>
<br>
‘Chloe, if I could get out of your head at will then I would have by now.’<br>
<br>
‘You want to help me then?’  She asked.<br>
<br>
‘Depends.’<br>
<br>
‘On?’<br>
<br>
‘What class are you doing homework for first?’  He asked.<br>
<br>
‘Why does it matter?  You’re going to be there through all of them,’ she retorted.<br>
<br>
‘Not necessarily true,’ he said.  He held up a glass of scotch in front of him and grinned.  ‘I’m working on my second glass of scotch as we speak, so I could very well pass out and not think anything.’<br>
<br>
‘Why didn’t I think of that?’  Chloe thought.  <br>
<br>
‘Because you’re underage?  Or perhaps because your father and Lana are home and they wouldn’t look favorably upon you getting sloshed and passing out?’<br>
<br>
‘The latter,’ Chloe said.  ‘Of course if it works for you tonight, I may have to reconsider how much I value my image in the eyes of my dad.’  Lex laughed.<br>
<br>
‘So which class is first?’<br>
<br>
‘I’m not sure I want you to help me if you’re already well on your way to getting drunk,’ she answered.<br>
<br>
‘I’m only on my second glass Chloe.’<br>
<br>
‘Right.  I forgot that you probably have a liver the size of Texas by now,’ she said with a smile.<br>
<br>
‘What happened to being civil toward each other?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘I never agreed to it,’ she responded.<br>
<br>
‘Oh.’<br>
<br>
‘Right.  So – how are you at Health?’<br>
<br>
‘What subject in Health?’  Lex asked in a suggestive voice.  Chloe could practically see the smirk on his face.<br>
<br>
‘We’re already passed human sexuality Lex,’ she said.  <br>
<br>
‘Damn.  That was always my best subject,’ he replied.<br>
<br>
‘Certainly the only one you probably paid attention to,’ Chloe thought.  Lex pursed his lips and then took a drink of his alcohol.<br>
<br>
‘Touché.’<br>
<br>
‘We’re working on our CPR section now,’ Chloe said.  Lex grinned.  ‘And don’t even bother with the mouth to mouth remarks because I had to hear them all this morning from Pete and Clark.’<br>
<br>
‘I’m sure you didn’t mind the latter,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
‘Actually I did,’ she admitted.  ‘He’s gorgeous, but sometimes he can be so ---’<br>
<br>
‘Immature?’<br>
<br>
‘So?’<br>
<br>
‘What makes you think this Damian kid, or any teenage boy will be any better?’  Lex asked.  He took another drink from his glass.  He was almost done and would be ready to start on his third soon.<br>
<br>
‘Well technically Damian has an edge, seeing as how the demon inside of him has probably lived for centuries,’ Chloe joked.  Lex choked on some of his scotch as he started laughing.  His laughing subsided and he headed toward the decanter set to pour himself a third scotch.  <br>
<br>
‘Chloe, may I ask you a question?’<br>
<br>
‘Like I have a choice?’  She responded.  ‘Speaking of which, I guess I could get all the information I need for any sort of inside article on you or your company now huh?’  Lex groaned.  <br>
<br>
‘I guess I’ll be calling in sick for a while,’ he said.  Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
‘You do realize I was just joking right?’  She asked.  Lex arched an eyebrow and sat down with his drink.<br>
<br>
‘You were?’<br>
<br>
‘Of course,’ she said.  ‘How would I ever explain how I got my information?’  Lex looked thoughtful.<br>
<br>
‘Good point.’<br>
<br>
‘You had a question?’  She asked.  She started to fill out the answers on her homework, which proved to be incredibly easy.<br>
<br>
‘Do you even like Damian?  Or are you just using him as a substitute for Clark?’  Lex asked.  Chloe frowned.<br>
<br>
‘Clark is my friend.  I’ve accepted that ---’<br>
<br>
‘Ah yes, I can tell that from the numerous pornographic images that I’ve had played in my head,’ Lex said sarcastically.  Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
‘Well, look on the bright side.  If I end up liking Damian, then I could fantasize about him instead.’<br>
<br>
‘How is that a bright side exactly?’  He asked and then took a rather large drink from his glass.  He was finally starting to feel the effects of the alcohol and his mind drifted to an image of him cupping Chloe’s face with his hands and kissing her.  They slid their tongues against each other and only finally parted when they needed air.  Chloe tried mentally screaming at him, but the images didn’t stop.  Lex closed his eyes and thought about undressing her and slowly leaning her back against his bed.  About them running their hands over each other and him taking one of her nipples into his mouth.  Chloe’s skin felt heated.  The imagery Lex was projecting was erotic and she couldn’t get him to stop it.  <br>
<br>
‘Lex!’  She tried again.  Lex corresponded her yell to his fantasy.  Her screaming his name as he entered her and began to thrust.  Her wrapping her legs around him for better contact.  Their breathing becoming shorter and faster as he pumped into her.  Chloe felt the arousal spread through her body.  She was so close to climax and they hadn’t really done anything.  ‘This can’t be good,’ she thought.  Lex didn’t hear her, or chose not to.  Chloe’s real breathing became closer to that of the image as she seemed to feel everything that was going on.  ‘Oh God!’  She felt her orgasm sweep over her and clung to the comforter on her bed.  Lex had a similar reaction.  He ran a hand over his face when he looked at the liquid and broken glass on the floor and the wetness in his slacks.<br>
<br>
“Damn,” he muttered under his breath.  Chloe’s eyes opened.<br>
<br>
‘Okay, explain that, and explain it now,’ she thought.  Lex’s eyebrows rose.<br>
<br>
‘Did you  ---?’  He asked, trailing off at the end of the question.  Chloe blushed.  She couldn’t lie to him because he would know.<br>
<br>
‘Yeah,’ she thought.  ‘You?’<br>
<br>
‘Yeah.’  There was a small pause while they both absorbed the surrealism of the situation.<br>
<br>
‘So this proximity thing isn’t such a bad idea right?’  Chloe asked.<br>
<br>
‘I – sure.  We can try it,’ Lex thought.  <br>
<br>
‘Okay,’ Chloe agreed.  ‘But Lex?’<br>
<br>
‘Yeah?’<br>
<br>
‘Just don’t do that – you know – during my date okay?’  Chloe asked.  Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
‘I’ll do my best.’<br>
<br>
<br>

Chloe resisted rolling her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, and meeting at The Talon – how original,” she said sarcastically.  Lana giggled.<br>
<br>
‘I can’t believe you’re meeting him somewhere at all.  Shouldn’t he have picked you up at your house?’  Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘You do realize that you sound like my Dad,’ Chloe retorted.<br>
<br>
‘Gabe’s a smart man,’ Lex countered.  <br>
<br>
“You’ll go somewhere else afterward.  He probably just wants a comfortable place to start out at,” Lana said.  Chloe shrugged. <br>
<br>
“I guess,” Chloe said.<br>
<br>
‘You guess what?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘Nothing,’ Chloe lied.  ‘Aren’t you supposed to be on your way to Metropolis?’<br>
<br>
‘I am,’ Lex said.  ‘I should be there in another hour and a half.’<br>
<br>
‘Damn,’ Chloe thought.  ‘Are you sure?’<br>
<br>
‘I’ve made this drive several times,’ Lex thought.  ‘Yes, I’m sure.’<br>
<br>
‘Really, really sure?’  Chloe asked.  Lex sighed.<br>
<br>
‘Well, I could span it out to another two and a quarter hours if you’re desperately concerned about my safety at driving this speed,’ he teased.  ‘But your proximity theory was obviously flawed,’ Lex thought.  Chloe frowned.<br>
<br>
‘Maybe you’re just not far enough away,’ she thought hopefully.  ‘You could go to Europe or something right?’  Lex chuckled.<br>
<br>
‘So you can have a social life with *Damian*?  I think not.’<br>
<br>
‘Spoilsport,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘Well look at it this way Chloe; if your date turns out to be as brain dead as most of the Smallville community, then at least you’ll have good company in your head.’<br>
<br>
‘I’m not sure I’d consider you good company,’ Chloe thought.  She smiled at Lana when she came back from her waitressing rounds.  Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
‘Even after last night?’ he asked with a sultry undertone.<br>
<br>
‘Especially after last night.  You’re going to corrupt me, Luthor,’ she thought.  Lex smiled broadly and then started laughing.<br>
<br>
‘If that’s the way you feel about it, then maybe I should just swing the car around and ---’  <br>
<br>
‘Don’t you dare!’  Chloe thought.  Luckily her own yelling at him drowned out the fact that he had done just that and was already on his way back to Smallville.<br>
<br>
‘Come on Chloe.  You don’t even like this guy,’ Lex said.  <br>
<br>
‘I don’t even know him.  I just know *of* him.  He could be nice.  You don’t know,’ Chloe argued.  <br>
<br>
‘Yeah, but can he make you scream?’  Lex asked.  Chloe buried her head in her hands to hide the color that was rising to her cheeks.<br>
<br>
‘That was mortifying,’ Chloe thought.  Lex furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
‘No it wasn’t,’ he thought.  ‘It was fantastic.’  Chloe sighed.<br>
<br>
‘Not that,’ she thought.  ‘The after part where I actually screamed and my Dad and Lana both came rushing to my room because they thought I was being attacked or something.’  Lex started laughing again.  ‘It’s not funny!  I had to tell them that I had a nightmare and I don’t even think they believed me.’<br>
<br>
‘Of course they didn’t – it wasn’t that kind of a scream,’ Lex said luridly.  Damian walked in and tapped Chloe on the shoulder.  She turned around and smiled at him.  ‘Ugh,’ Lex thought with disgust.  ‘Why do I have a picture of that damn kid in my head again, Chloe?’<br>
<br>
‘Because he just showed up,’ Chloe thought.  “Hey,” she greeted.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” Damian said.  He motioned toward the tables with his head.  “You wanna get a seat?”<br>
<br>
“Sure.”<br>
<br>
‘Hey and sure,’ Lex thought.  ‘He’s obviously a master of conversation to get such vivid responses from you.’<br>
<br>
‘Will you shut up and let me enjoy my date?!’<br>
<br>
‘Be nice or I’ll start fantasizing about you again,’ Lex thought.  Chloe groaned and Damian shot her a concerned look.<br>
<br>
“Is something wrong?”  Damian asked.<br>
<br>
“No, sorry.  I just remembered that I forgot to do something I was supposed to do today,” Chloe lied.  Damian smiled and nodded.  ‘Ugh.  He’s giving me the Clark look.’<br>
<br>
‘Clark look?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘You know?  *I don’t know what you’re talking about, so I’m just going to nod and smile a goofy looking smile at you*?’  Chloe answered.  Lex smiled.<br>
<br>
‘Ahh, that look,’ Lex said.  ‘So I gather that brain surgeon is not on young Damian’s list of career options?’<br>
<br>
‘Not unless the demon inside him is calling the shots career wise,’ Chloe quipped.  Lex smiled again, but it quickly fell.<br>
<br>
‘I can’t hear anything you’re saying to him.’<br>
<br>
‘Because I’m not saying anything,’ Chloe thought.  Lex chuckled at her irritated tone.  ‘Shut up.  I have to put up with your side of the conversation with whatever gold digger you decided to take out tonight.’<br>
<br>
‘Actually you don’t,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Why?  Have you figured out a way to block your thoughts from me?  And if so, could you do it now?’<br>
<br>
‘Funny,’ Lex responded sarcastically.  ‘Actually, I didn’t have a date for tonight.  I only agreed to go to Metropolis because it seemed like you really wanted me to.’<br>
<br>
‘Oh.  Well, thanks then I guess.’<br>
<br>
‘Anything for you *sweetheart*,’ Lex thought.  Chloe started laughing and Damian looked at her like she had grown a third eye.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, I was just thinking how awkward this is,” she lied.  Damian took a breath and then released.<br>
<br>
“Totally,” he agreed.  “I was going to ask you out on my own, you know, after I found out a little more about you to see if we had anything in common.  And then Lana totally jumps on the idea after I asked her two questions.”  Chloe chuckled.<br>
<br>
“She gets carried away sometimes,” Chloe said.<br>
<br>
“So do you wanna see a movie or something?”  He asked.  <br>
<br>
‘Do I wanna see a movie or something?’  Chloe thought to herself, mimicking Damian’s tone.  Lex rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
‘I told you not to go out with him,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
‘Maybe I should go see a movie,’ Chloe thought, ignoring Lex’s comment.  ‘It might help muffle the sound of your voice in my head.’<br>
<br>
‘What did I tell you about being nice?’  He warned in a half joking manner.  Chloe scoffed.<br>
<br>
‘Please,’ she said sarcastically.  ‘If I have sex with you in my brain then it’s the only action I’m getting tonight.’  One corner of Lex’s mouth curled upward.<br>
<br>
‘So poor Damian doesn’t have a chance?’  He asked a little too hopefully.  Chloe faked a smile at Damian.<br>
<br>
“A movie sounds good.  What did you have in mind?”  She asked.<br>
<br>
“They have a new war movie out,” Damian said with a little too much enthusiasm.  Chloe frowned and Damian furrowed his brow.  “You don’t like war movies?”<br>
<br>
‘Who the hell likes war movies?’ she thought.  Lex shook his head.  Damian really didn’t have a chance with Chloe, even if Lex wasn’t sharing thoughts with her.  “I’m sorry, it’s just with Whitney and ---”<br>
<br>
‘Good cover,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Thanks.  It’s the truth.’<br>
<br>
“Oh yeah, I forgot that you were friends with him, huh?”  Damian asked.<br>
<br>
“Not really,” Chloe said honestly.  “More like friends of friends.”  Damian nodded.  ‘Kind of like you and me, huh Lex?’<br>
<br>
‘I give you an orgasm so powerful that your dad and Lana rushed in the room to see if you were alright when you screamed and you don’t consider me a friend on my own merits?  I think I’m hurt, Chloe.’<br>
<br>
‘Not to mention the fact that we’re in each other’s heads,’ Chloe thought.  ‘That’s what you were going to say next right?’<br>
<br>
‘You make it sound like it’s a bad thing,’ Lex said.  <br>
<br>
“Okay, well how about Army of Doom?”  Damian asked.  “It’s supposed to have some great special effects.”<br>
<br>
‘Army of Doom,’ Chloe thought.  ‘I guess that’s technically not a war movie.’<br>
<br>
‘Nor a movie that any male with a brain cell would take a first date to,’ Lex thought.  ‘Is he on drugs?  Check his pupils.’  Chloe coughed to cover her laughter.<br>
<br>
‘It might not be that bad,’ Chloe thought.  ‘It just seems kind of weird that he would suggest a war movie and then a horror movie.  I wonder if he has some sort of death wish or something.’<br>
<br>
‘I could accommodate it,’ Lex said.  Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
‘And how would you do that?’ she asked.  Lex pictured Damian getting shot and the blood spraying over the wall behind him.  ‘Charming.’  Her sarcasm was heavy.  <br>
<br>
‘You asked,’ Lex argued.<br>
<br>
‘And how would you get away with this obviously well thought out plan of yours?’  Chloe asked.<br>
<br>
‘I had no choice, your honor; the voice in my head made me do it,’ Lex said with a bright smile.  Chloe inwardly laughed and Lex continued.  ‘What exactly did the voice tell you to do son?  Oh, she said that she was having a very bad date and I needed to get rid of him before I could take her back to my house and ravage her.’  <br>
<br>
Chloe snorted.  ‘You wish.’<br>
<br>
‘Several times,’ Lex replied with a smirk.  Chloe reached across the table and placed her hand on top of Damian’s, oblivious to the fact that Lex sped even faster to get home and had just pulled up outside the building.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry Damian, I just don’t think this is going to work,” she said.  <br>
<br>
“How do you know?  We could have *something* in common,” Damian pointed out.  Lex walked into The Talon and spotted the table Chloe and Damian were sitting at.  “We haven’t even really gotten to know each other yet.”  Lex arrived at the table and grinned at Chloe.<br>
<br>
“And you never will,” Lex responded to Damian.  The boy looked at him in confusion.<br>
<br>
“Who are you?”  Damian asked.  Lex briefly let his eyes glance at him.<br>
<br>
“Jealous boyfriend,” Lex said dryly.  “Take a hike.”  Chloe arched an eyebrow and Lex grinned at her.  ‘Play along,’ he thought.  “Did you think I wouldn’t find out about him?”  Lex asked.  “Lana should have known better than to try and push you away from me.”  His tone was menacing and Chloe was surprised that he was able to pull it off.  He held out his hand to help her out of her chair.  ‘You want out of this date from hell or not?’  Lex thought.  “No one takes you away from me.  You’re mine.”  <br>
<br>
Chloe took his hand and stood up.  She gave Damian a somewhat forced apologetic look.<br>
<br>
“Sorry Damian, but he has violent tendencies.”  Her mind replayed Lex’s image of shooting Damian.  “And I wouldn’t want you to get hurt.”  Damian frowned.  Lana never mentioned that Chloe had a boyfriend, let alone one who looked like he was ready to kill him just for sitting with her.  <br>
<br>
Someone caught the corner of Chloe’s eye and she smiled.  “But hey!  I know Stacey really likes war movies, and she’s getting off shift in a little bit.  Maybe this will all work out for the best.”  Damian looked over at Stacey and smiled.<br>
<br>
“Maybe,” he agreed.  “I guess you just never know how fate’s going to work out, huh?”  He gave her another Clark look and Lex grinned tightly.  Lex wrapped his arm around Chloe’s back possessively.<br>
<br>
“You just never know,” Chloe said through a clearly faked smile.  She looked up at Lex.  “Come on *dumpling*, we should get out of here before you start trying to kill people.”  <br>
<br>
Lex smirked at her and then ushered them to the front doors.  He held the door open for her and placed his hand on the small of her back as she was walking through.  <br>
<br>
Chloe sighed when they reached his car.  “You do realize that I’m never going to get a date again don’t you?”  <br>
<br>
Lex arched an eyebrow and motioned to The Talon with his head.<br>
<br>
“And that’s a bad thing?” he asked.  Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
‘Of course not.  It’s not like I have any need for any sort of social life or anything,’ she thought sarcastically.  Lex stepped closer to her and began to lean down.<br>
<br>
‘You just never know how fate’s going to work out,’ he thought.  She creased her brow ever so slightly and Lex brushed his lips against hers.  Chloe’s eyes widened.  <br>
<br>
‘Lex!’<br>
<br>
‘Problem?’  He asked and continued to be persistent with the kiss.  His tongue wove its way into her mouth and Chloe let out a small moan.  His hands rested on her hips and Chloe ran her hands up his chest.  Their tongues slid against each other.<br>
<br>
‘You know we can’t do this,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘Why?’ he asked.<br>
<br>
‘Because sex in our heads is one thing,’ she thought.  ‘Sex in reality is something else entirely.’  <br>
<br>
‘I agree,’ he thought as they kissed.  He slid one hand up the back of her shirt and Chloe gasped.  ‘Sex in reality can only be better.’<br>

He shook his head and walked away.  How could Lana *not* know that Chloe had a boyfriend?<br>
<br>
Chloe pulled away from Lex and Lex furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“We can’t do this,” she repeated aloud.  Her breathing was heavy and Lex smirked, taking a step closer to her to fill in the gap she left when she ended their kiss.<br>
<br>
‘Chloe,’ he thought.  Lex watched as she looked behind him and her eyes grew wide.  He turned around.  ‘Damn.  Perfect timing as always Clark,’ he thought sarcastically.  Chloe smiled and inwardly laughed.  Lex smiled at her.  <br>
<br>
“Hey guys,” Clark greeted.  He observed how close his friends were standing to each other and narrowed his eyes at them suspiciously.  “What’s going on?”<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” Chloe said with a forced smile.  Clark frowned and stepped a little closer to Chloe.<br>
<br>
“Are you okay Chloe?  You looked kind of flushed,” Clark said.  Chloe tried desperately to keep the blush from rising to her cheeks and Lex grinned evilly.<br>
<br>
“You do,” Lex agreed.  “Maybe I should take you home.”<br>
<br>
‘My dad’s at home moron,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘I didn’t say *your* home,’ Lex countered.  Clark watched as Chloe and Lex eyed each other.  It was like they were having their own conversation without words, and Clark couldn’t say why, but it set him on edge for some reason.<br>
<br>
“Oh, that’s okay Lex, I can take her home,” Clark offered.  Lex glared at him and Clark raised his eyebrows in surprise.  Lex quickly changed his expression.<br>
<br>
“Don’t you need to meet Lana?”  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘Way to change the subject,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘The sooner we get rid of him, the sooner we can ---’<br>
<br>
‘Shut up.’<br>
<br>
‘Why?’<br>
<br>
‘I already told you we can’t, that’s why,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘But you never gave me a reason why we can’t,’ Lex countered.<br>
<br>
“Guys?  Guys!”  Clark waved his hand in front of them to try and get their attention again.  They were staring at each other and Clark’s discomfort with the situation was growing.  Something was definitely going on.  Chloe looked over at him.<br>
<br>
‘What?’  She thought.  Lex chuckled.<br>
<br>
‘He can’t hear you *sweetheart*.  You have to use your voice,’ Lex thought.  Chloe looked at Lex again.<br>
<br>
‘You want a reason we can’t?  Because we hate each other.  Is that enough of a reason for you?’  She asked.  <br>
<br>
“I don’t hate you,” Lex said to her.  Clark furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“What?”  Clark asked.  He sighed and ran a hand through his hair.  “Something is going on with you two and you’re going to tell me right now.”  His voice was authoritative and Chloe bit her lip to keep from laughing.  She was laughing on the inside though and Lex smiled.<br>
<br>
‘Clark Kent – drill sergeant,’ Chloe thought.  <br>
<br>
‘He’s been spending too much time with his dad,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘He did sound remarkably like him,’ Chloe agreed.  Clark cleared his throat and they both looked over at him again.<br>
<br>
“Sorry Clark,” Chloe said.  “You see, there was an accident and ---”<br>
<br>
“And I’m sure that Clark doesn’t want to be bothered with all of the details,” Lex interrupted, shooting a warning look at Chloe.<br>
<br>
‘He has a right to know Lex,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘Does he have a right to know what you’ve been *thinking* about him as well?’  Lex thought.  Chloe blushed and immediately her mind flitted to an image of her and Clark undressing each other.  Lex shook his head to try and clear the picture.  “Stop it!”  He yelled.<br>
<br>
“You brought it up!”  Chloe retorted.  Clark opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out.<br>
<br>
“Stop what?”  Clark asked in confusion.  He looked back and forth between his friends who were now glaring at each other.  “You guys ---”<br>
<br>
“This doesn’t involve you Clark,” Lex said without looking at him.  ‘Well, it sort of does,’ he thought.  Chloe sighed.<br>
<br>
‘It doesn’t,’ she argued.  ‘It’s not my fault that you brought up the whole fantasizing about him thing.  You should be more careful when you tease me.’  Lex grinned when she said ‘fantasized’ and pictured himself and Chloe together again.  Chloe’s eyes grew wide.<br>
<br>
“No, no, no!”  She shouted.  “You are not doing this here!”  Lex’s image was persistent and grew more and more vivid.  Chloe could feel a warm tingle of arousal start to spread through her body.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe?”  Clark asked with concern.  Chloe pushed the image away and glared at Lex, who in return frowned at her.<br>
<br>
“Just for that, I’m telling him,” Chloe said.<br>
<br>
“Telling me what?!”  Clark asked in frustration.  Lex sighed and looked at him.<br>
<br>
“Chemical spill,” Lex started.<br>
<br>
“We can hear each other’s thoughts,” Chloe continued.<br>
<br>
“And see some images inside each other’s heads,” Lex added.<br>
<br>
“And, um,” Chloe paused and looked unsurely at Lex.  He tilted his head at her.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think he needs to know that much Chloe,” Lex said.<br>
<br>
“You’re right,” she agreed.<br>
<br>
“You admitted that I’m right?”  Lex asked in astonishment.<br>
<br>
“What are you doing?”  Clark asked as he watched Lex look up in the sky.<br>
<br>
“Looking for the four horsemen of the apocalypse,” Lex answered tongue in cheek.  Chloe hit his arm playfully.<br>
<br>
“Jackass,” she said with a smile.  Lex smiled back at her.  Clark looked at the two wide eyed.  <br>
<br>
“So you can read each other’s minds?”  Clark asked in disbelief.  He wasn’t sure whether to believe it or not, but it would certainly explain how they were acting – well, except for the kind of flirty undertones they were taking on, but Clark surmised that part could just be in his head.  Chloe smiled at Clark.<br>
<br>
“You sound like you don’t believe us,” she observed.  Clark opened his mouth to speak, but Lex interrupted.<br>
<br>
“If it helps, I could tell you what Chloe’s really been thinking about you,” Lex said with a teasing glance at Chloe.  Chloe reached up and clamped her palm over Lex’s mouth.<br>
<br>
“Don’t even think it,” she warned him.  Lex’s eyes gleamed with pure mischief and Chloe couldn’t help but smile.  Clark watched the entire scene with some amusement, until his earlier trepidation about them flirting kicked in.<br>
<br>
“Um, guys, I might be totally off here, but ---” he started.  Chloe jerked her hand away from Lex’s mouth and stared at it.<br>
<br>
“You licked me!”  She exclaimed in surprise.  <br>
<br>
‘I could be doing a lot more than that,’ Lex thought suggestively.  Chloe laughed and Clark arched an eyebrow at her.<br>
<br>
“You guys are doing it again, aren’t you?”  Clark asked.  Both Lex and Chloe whipped their heads around to look at him and Clark noticed Chloe blushing.  He looked at her suspiciously before turning his attention to Lex.  “Could you just not do that whole ‘mind reading’ thing when you’re around me?  It’s kind of creepy.”  Lex smiled but Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“If we could turn it off, don’t you think we would have by now?”  She asked.  Clark gave her an apologetic smile.<br>
<br>
“You’re right,” Clark said.  “I guess I wasn’t thinking.”<br>
<br>
‘Understatement of the decade,’ Chloe thought.  Lex coughed to hide his laughter.<br>
<br>
‘Be nice,’ Lex thought.  ‘This *is* the boy you’ve been dreaming about.’<br>
<br>
‘Shut up,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘Of course, you haven’t done that for a whole ten minutes now,’ Lex teased.  Chloe blushed and Clark looked back and forth between his friends again.  Lex noticed him out of the corner of his eye and smirked at Chloe.  ‘Are you sure you don’t want him to know?  I think it would be really enlightening for him.’  Chloe narrowed her eyes at him.<br>
<br>
“Okay, you asked for it,” she said aloud.  She pictured herself grabbing Clark’s face with her hands and kissing him senseless.  Lex frowned.<br>
<br>
“That’s enough,” Lex said.  Chloe continued her forced fantasy.  She began to unbutton Clark’s shirt and lightly kiss his chest.  Lex squared his jaw.  “That’s enough Chloe,” he repeated.  Clark furrowed his brow at them.  Obviously Chloe was thinking something that Lex didn’t want to see or hear, but what could it be?  Chloe unknowingly took a few steps toward Clark and Lex got an evil smirk on his face.  He could play just as dirty as she could.  Lex altered the image in her mind so when she looked up to kiss Clark it was him instead.  Chloe glared at him, but Lex shrugged it off and let the picture continue.  <br>
<br>
“Lex!  No!”  Chloe yelled.  Her mind flitted to the image he was projecting and she couldn’t push it out of her head.  He was nibbling at her neck as he slowly backed her onto his bed.  Chloe clenched her hands into fists, trying not to give in, but she felt the familiar warmth begin between her legs and groaned.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe?”  Clark asked.  “Are you okay?”  He closed the small distance between them and wrapped his arm around her for support.  Chloe closed her eyes as she leaned her head against his chest.  Clark looked up to glare at Lex, but Lex’s eyes were closed.  Clark creased his brow in confusion again.<br>
<br>
“Oh God,” Chloe murmured in pleasure.  Clark’s eyes grew wide at the sound.  He glanced down to find Chloe breathing harder against his chest and starting to rub herself against him.  Clark blushed and quickly looked around to see if anybody else was witnessing it, but thankfully the streets seemed to be bare.  Chloe whimpered as her body and mind started to give into the image that Lex was projecting.  Lex pictured her moving on top of him, her face contorted in ecstasy.  Lex and Chloe’s breathing both became ragged and Chloe found herself gripping onto Clark’s arms for support.  Clark wrapped both his arms around her and felt her body start to shake.  Chloe felt her orgasm rolling through her body and let out a deep moan of delight.   She clung onto Clark’s arms and crashed against him just as Lex moaned out his own release.  Clark tightened his arms around Chloe.  He was completely aroused by her rubbing herself against him as she moaned.  <br>
<br>
Chloe allowed Clark to lift her chin with his hand, but her eyes were still closed and she was still picturing herself in the daydream.  Clark started to lean down to kiss her when Lex cleared his throat loudly.  Chloe opened her eyes and they grew large with the realization that she was in Clark’s arms.  She jumped away from him.<br>
<br>
“Oh Clark, I’m so sorry,” she said while shaking her head and holding her hands out in front of her.  Clark tried to step closer to her, but she kept backing away.<br>
<br>
“Chloe ---” <br>
<br>
“I don’t suppose we could just forget the fact that I just mortifyingly embarrassed myself in front of you?”  Chloe asked hopefully.  Clark looked surprised.<br>
<br>
“You didn’t – I mean,” Clark stammered.  Lex observed the two interact and an unsettling feeling came to rest in his gut.  He recognized it, although he hadn’t felt it very many times in his life – at least not in this capacity.  Jealousy.  Lex frowned. <br>
<br>
‘Why would I be jealous of Clark?’  He thought.  Chloe turned to look at him.<br>
<br>
‘You’re jealous of Clark?’  She thought.<br>
<br>
‘I – no,’ Lex lied.  ‘Time to change the subject.’<br>
<br>
‘I can hear you,’ Chloe reminded him.  Lex walked over to them.<br>
<br>
“I think Chloe and I should get going now,” Lex told Clark.  Clark looked at Chloe.<br>
<br>
“But ---”<br>
<br>
“We need to meet with the people at my lab to see if they can find an antidote,” Lex said smoothly.<br>
<br>
“Oh, that makes sense,” Clark said in a disappointed voice.<br>
<br>
‘No it doesn’t,’ Chloe thought.  ‘Since when do your scientists work on Saturday nights?’<br>
<br>
‘Since I pay them very well to do so,’ Lex thought.  Chloe let out a small sigh and looked at Clark.<br>
<br>
“So we’re going to forget this whole thing ever happened, right?”  Chloe asked Clark hopefully.  Clark shoved his hands in his pockets and looked up from the ground with puppy dog eyes.<br>
<br>
‘Oh great,’ Lex thought sarcastically.<br>
<br>
“I ---” <br>
<br>
“Of course he’ll forget about it Chloe,” Lex interrupted.  “He’s your friend.  Right Clark?”  He gave Clark a pointed look and Clark smiled and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, no problem,” Clark said.  Chloe smiled in relief and stepped closer to him.  She gave him a friendly hug, causing Clark to grin and Lex to frown.  She pulled back and walked over to Lex.<br>
<br>
“I’ll call you later, okay Clark?”  She asked.  He nodded.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, tell me how you like being a guinea pig,” he joked.  Chloe rolled her eyes and Lex opened his car door for her.  Clark watched them drive away with a smile on his face.  His brief experience with Chloe had been enlightening.<br>

<br>
“What?”  Lex asked.  A small smirk played at the corners of his mouth.  “You climaxing against Clark because of our fantasy or jumping away from him when he tried to kiss you?”<br>
<br>
“Both,” Chloe replied.  “And what’s this ‘our’ business?  I wasn’t thinking about that.”<br>
<br>
‘You started it.’<br>
<br>
“With an image of me and Clark,” Chloe countered.<br>
<br>
“Which, I might point out, did absolutely nothing for you,” Lex said.  Chloe narrowed her eyes at him.<br>
<br>
“Well maybe it would have if you hadn’t interrupted.”<br>
<br>
‘Doubtful,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
“Why?”  Chloe asked.  “Do you have any idea how long I’ve liked him?  And you don’t think I could have ---?”<br>
<br>
“No.”<br>
<br>
‘Okay, I can’t wait to hear the reasoning behind this,’ Chloe thought.  Lex looked at her through the corner of his eye with a grin and then turned his attention back to the road.<br>
<br>
“How many times have you fantasized about Clark since our – accident?”  Lex asked.  Chloe furrowed her brow in thought.<br>
<br>
“Hmm…” she said.  ‘Three or four?’  She guessed.  Lex turned his head to shoot a look of disbelief at her.<br>
<br>
“At least seven,” he growled through gritted teeth.<br>
<br>
“No way,” she argued.  <br>
<br>
“Would you like me to list them for you?”  Lex asked.  Chloe felt the color rising to her cheeks and looked away from him.<br>
<br>
“No – I’ll take your word for it,” she replied.  Lex nodded once.<br>
<br>
“And how many times did you ---?”<br>
<br>
“God.  I can’t believe we’re even having this conversation,” Chloe interrupted.  She didn’t see Lex’s mouth curl into a smug and satisfied smile.<br>
<br>
“So, zero then?”  He asked.  Chloe sighed and looked at him.<br>
<br>
“Fine.  I get it,” she said.  “We obviously have some sort of enhanced chemistry between us because of what happened, but that doesn’t mean that we should act on it.  In fact, we should probably avoid it at all costs.”<br>
<br>
‘Or we could take advantage of it,’ Lex mused.<br>
<br>
‘Not funny,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘It wasn’t supposed to be.’<br>
<br>
“Lex,” Chloe said and tilted her head at him.  She stopped talking as she looked down at her feet and her eyes widened in panic.  ‘Oh crap,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
“What?”  Lex asked.  <br>
<br>
“I think I left my bag back at The Talon,” she said.  “We have to go back.”<br>
<br>
“Why?”<br>
<br>
“Because I’m hungry,” Chloe said with exasperation.  “Money buys food, and my money is in my bag.  Could you stop arguing with me about this and just turn the car around?”  Lex kept driving straight ahead and glanced over at her so she could see his smirk.<br>
<br>
“I’m fairly certain I have enough money to buy you dinner Chloe,” he said.  “And I thought I saw you with your bag after we left?”  Chloe motioned to the area by her feet.<br>
<br>
“Well, you obviously didn’t,” she pointed out.  “And I don’t want you to buy me dinner.”<br>
<br>
“You said you were hungry,” he observed.  <br>
<br>
“Well, yeah, but ---”<br>
<br>
“So I’ll buy you dinner.  We can have something delivered to the house after we get our blood drawn at the lab.”<br>
<br>
“You’re missing the point,” Chloe said.<br>
<br>
“The point being?”<br>
<br>
“The point being that you need to turn the car around so we can go back and get my bag.”<br>
<br>
“We’re almost to the lab,” Lex observed.  Chloe furrowed her brow.  ‘And the only reason you want to go back there is to try and prove me wrong about the whole Clark situation,’ he thought.  <br>
<br>
‘True,’ Chloe thought.  Lex turned and arched an eyebrow at her.  Chloe smiled and crossed her arms.  “Well, that and the fact that my cell phone is also in my bag and I’d rather not try to explain to my dad why I didn’t answer it.”<br>
<br>
“What makes you think that Gabe will even try to call?”  Lex asked.  Chloe bit her lip and a small blush rose to her cheeks.  <br>
<br>
“I sort of told him to,” Chloe admitted.  Lex looked at her questioningly.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t hear you say anything,” he said.<br>
<br>
“I wrote it on a note for him,” she said with a shrug.<br>
<br>
“Why?”  He asked.  <br>
<br>
“He had to go into the plant to check on some stuff today, so he wasn’t home when I left and ---”<br>
<br>
“Why did you ask him to call you?”  Lex interrupted.  Chloe let out a tiny, almost inaudible sigh and stared out her window again.<br>
<br>
‘Why do you think?’  She thought.<br>
<br>
‘I have no idea,’ he responded.  Chloe’s eyebrows rose in surprise and she looked over at him.<br>
<br>
“Really?”  Chloe asked.  “You’ve never had a woman get a phone call in the middle of a date and then say that something urgent came up?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t see how the two relate to ---,” Lex trailed off and pulled the car over to the side of the road.  “Why did you ask your dad to call you?”  Chloe grinned nervously and started wringing her hands together.<br>
<br>
“Well, you know, in case the date was going badly or something, so I would have an ‘out’ so to speak,” Chloe stammered.  Lex stared at her in disbelief.  <br>
<br>
“Is this a common practice?”  <br>
<br>
“Pretty much,” she answered.  Lex seemed thoughtful.<br>
<br>
“What time is he supposed to call you?”  He asked.  Chloe glanced at her watch and frowned.<br>
<br>
“In about a half hour,” she said.  Lex pulled into the road again and did a u-turn to head back toward town.<br>
<br>
“You could have mentioned this before,” he grumbled.<br>
<br>
“You could have turned the car around when I first told you to,” she said pointedly.<br>
<br>
‘And now I have to see you fawning all over Kent again,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Avert your eyes,’ Chloe said with a teasing smile.<br>
<br>
‘I can look at something else, but I’ll still get the image of you two in my head,’ he thought acidly.  Chloe creased her brow as she regarded him.  His posture had stiffened and his knuckles were turning white from gripping the steering wheel a little too tight.  <br>
<br>
“Lex?”<br>
<br>
“What?”  His tone was harsh, but instead of being intimidated, Chloe tilted her head at him.<br>
<br>
“What did you mean when you made the ‘jealous of Clark’ comment?”  Chloe asked.  Lex squared his jaw.<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” he lied.  <br>
<br>
“Lex ---”<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” he repeated a little more insistently.  Chloe decided to drop it and leaned back in her seat, allowing her eyes to close as she did so.  She didn’t know why the image that floated into her head did so, especially since Lex wasn’t the one to put it there, but she pictured herself kissing Lex in the room that he had imagined before.  Lex was startled and turned to face her, but her eyes were still closed and she didn’t notice him.  “Chloe?”  He questioned.  Chloe corresponded his voice to the fantasy that started playing in her head.  He murmured her name against the crook of her neck and then took the soft skin and gently ran his teeth across it.  Chloe shivered in anticipation and Lex felt himself becoming aroused.  “Chloe, we shouldn’t do this while I’m driving,” he told her and then shifted uncomfortably in his seat.  His mind flitted to Chloe’s daydream, where she had toppled on the floor, and she was kissing his now shirtless chest.  “Chloe – aaah,” he moaned as the image had her running her tongue in circles around his nipple.  Lex barely heard the sound of another car honking in time to pull back into their lane.  He shook his head.  “Chloe!  Stop!  We can’t do this while I’m driving!”<br>
<br>
‘So stop driving,’ Chloe thought as she was too involved in her fantasy to let it stop now.   She allowed her dream-self to start kissing down his chest to his stomach.  Lex’s eyes grew wide and pulled the car off onto a side road only used for farming access.  The tall stalks of produce would shield the car nicely from any onlookers from the main road.  He drove down it far enough until he couldn’t stand the ache in his groin anymore.  Lex stopped the car and quickly unfastened his safety belt.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe?”  He noticed that her eyes were still closed and he could still picture everything they were doing in her head.  He unbuckled her safety belt as well and touched her thigh with his hand.  Chloe’s eyes fluttered open and she stared at Lex with a mixture of lust and partial confusion.  ‘God, you’re going to kill me for this,’ he thought.  He quickly captured her mouth with his own and ran his tongue inside it.  Chloe tongue dueled with his own and she started unbuttoning his shirt.  She let out a small moan and Lex pulled her closer.  He frowned.  His car had many fine features, but enough room to do what he wanted wasn’t one of them.  Lex pulled away from her, leaving Chloe staring at him in a half-stunned state.  “Hold that thought,” he said.  He got out of the car and circled around to her side, where he promptly pulled her out of the vehicle.  He pressed her up against it, trapping her with his hands on either side of her, and then leaned down to kiss her.  He moved his lips to her neck and copied what she had imagined him doing earlier, pushing his knee between her legs to alleviate some of her discomfort.  Chloe absently started to rub herself against him and Lex opened his mouth to hers again.  Chloe’s breathing went ragged and she whimpered with delight and Lex snaked one of his hands up under her shirt and started to tease a nipple.  Lex stopped and slid into the passenger side of the car, pulling her on top of him.  Chloe nodded and moved her mouth to his ear.<br>
<br>
‘We really shouldn’t be doing this,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘Yes we should,’ he argued.  She moved to straddle him and Lex reached around her to the glove compartment.  She furrowed her brow in confusion until he held up a wrapped condom between his fingers.  They kissed again and Lex started to unzip his slacks.  He freed himself and ripped the condom wrapper open.  Chloe lifted her hips and started to take off her panties as she moved her lips from his mouth to his bare skull.  Lex moaned and helped her moved them off of her legs.  He threw them into the small area behind the seats and then rolled the condom onto his waiting and throbbing cock.  He placed his hands on her hips and guided her until he could feel the warmth radiating from her entrance.  He looked her in the eye before making another move, desperately fighting with his urge to just take her, he wanted to make sure it was what she wanted.  She nodded in a silent understanding and he thrust himself into her.  Chloe gasped and clung to his shoulders.  She began to move on top of him, developing a slow and steady rhythm while Lex kept his hands firmly placed on her hips to urge her to continue.  She stopped, as if frozen in place, when a phone started ringing from the area behind the seats.  She and Lex exchanged a look and Chloe hesitantly looked over his shoulder and saw her bag slumped behind the passenger side seat.<br>
<br>
‘Oh, God,’ she thought.  Lex nipped at her collarbone.  <br>
<br>
“He’ll call back,” he said.<br>
<br>
‘What if he’s already talked to Lana?’  Chloe thought.  ‘He’ll know that I skipped out on my date with Damian.’  Lex pulled her down again and Chloe closed her eyes at the sensation.<br>
<br>
“He’ll call back.”<br>

The experience had been so painful and so pleasurable that she felt like she was going to feel the ache between her legs for weeks.  She felt a hand reach into her hair and try to bring her head down and to the side.  <br>
<br>
‘Lex ---’ she thought.<br>
<br>
“Chloe,” he murmured before capturing her mouth once again.  Their tongues darted out and met each other with a furious passion.  <br>
<br>
‘God, I hope I’m not bleeding,’ Chloe thought.  Lex furrowed his brow as they kissed.<br>
<br>
‘Why would you be bleeding?’  He asked.  <br>
<br>
‘Doesn’t matter,’ she thought.  The phone in her bag started ringing again and she pulled away from him.  Lex inwardly groaned.<br>
<br>
‘Your father has the worst timing,’ he thought.  Chloe smiled as she leaned over him to retrieve her phone.<br>
<br>
“Just for that, I should make you answer it,” she teased.  Lex smirked and snatched the phone away from her.  Chloe’s eyes grew wide and she tried to get the phone away from him.  “Lex!  I was just joking!  Give me my phone back!”<br>
<br>
‘No,’ he thought as the smirk grew larger on his lips.  He punched the button to answer the phone and held it up to his ear.  “Hello?” he greeted.  Gabe furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“Lex?”  He asked.<br>
<br>
“Gabe?”<br>
<br>
“I – uh – I’m sorry Lex.  I was trying to reach Chloe.  I obviously dialed the wrong number,” Gabe stammered.  Lex looked at Chloe with another smirk and she narrowed her eyes at him.<br>
<br>
“You didn’t,” Lex said.  “She’s right here.  Hold on.”  He brought the phone away from his ear and held it out for Chloe, who quickly tore it away from his hand.<br>
<br>
‘Asshole,’ she thought.  Lex bit back a laugh by faking a cough and Chloe held the phone up to her ear.  “Hi Daddy.”<br>
<br>
“Don’t *daddy* me Chloe,” Gabe said.  “You have some explaining to do.”<br>
<br>
“Such as?”  Chloe asked in the best innocent voice she could fake.<br>
<br>
“You were supposed to be out on a date with some kid from your school, but when you didn’t answer your phone the first time, I called Lana and she said you ditched him at the Talon, and --- why didn’t you answer your phone the first time?  And why did Lex answer it this time?”  Gabe rambled.<br>
<br>
“You know, I’m not really sure you’d believe me if I told you,” Chloe said.<br>
<br>
‘You’re going to tell him about us?’  Lex thought in surprise.  <br>
<br>
‘There is no *us*,’ Chloe thought.  She glared at him and tried to squirm off his lap, but he held her hips down tightly with his hands.<br>
<br>
‘I meant the psychic connection,’ Lex thought with a small smirk.<br>
<br>
‘Oh.  Well ---,’<br>
<br>
“Chloe?”  Gabe’s voice came through the receiver.  “Are you still there?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, sorry about that,” Chloe apologized.  <br>
<br>
“So are you going to tell me?”  Gabe asked.  <br>
<br>
“I ---”<br>
<br>
“Hold on a second honey, I have another call coming in.”  <br>
<br>
“Okay.”  Chloe heard the phone click over to the other line and then she shook her head at Lex.  “I can’t believe you did that,” she said.  “I’m going to be in so much trouble.”<br>
<br>
“Chloe?”<br>
<br>
“Dad!”  She said a little too loudly.  She hadn’t heard the phone click back over and she wondered how much of her previous statement to Lex he had heard.<br>
<br>
‘How much did he hear?’  Lex thought, <br>
<br>
‘Looks like I’m about to find out.’  <br>
<br>
“Why would you be in trouble?”  Gabe asked.<br>
<br>
‘Shit,’ Chloe thought.  Lex looked at her questioningly, but she chose not to elaborate.  “No reason,” Chloe lied.  “So who was on the other line?”<br>
<br>
‘Nice change in topic,’ Lex complimented.  <br>
<br>
‘Thanks.  Hopefully it will work.’<br>
<br>
“Clark,” Gabe said.  “He wanted to know if you and Lex were back from the lab yet.”  He paused and Chloe grimaced.<br>
<br>
‘Clark was on the other line,’ she thought.  ‘What if he told my dad about ---?’<br>
<br>
‘I’m sure he didn’t,’ Lex said.  <br>
<br>
‘How can you be sure?’<br>
<br>
‘Clark doesn’t seem like the kind of guy who would be comfortable telling a girl’s father that she climaxed against him,’ Lex thought snidely.  Chloe’s face flushed in embarrassment and she ran a hand over it.<br>
<br>
“Chloe?”  Her dad asked again.<br>
<br>
“Sorry, I’ve just been zoning today,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh,” Gabe said as if he didn’t believe her.  “*Now* would you like to explain what’s going on?”  Chloe let out a defeated sigh.<br>
<br>
“We actually never got the tests done,” she admitted.<br>
<br>
“What tests?”  Gabe asked.<br>
<br>
“Like I said, it’s a long story Dad.”<br>
<br>
“Then I guess you’d better get started,” he said dryly.<br>
<br>
“I’m on my way home now; we’ll talk when I get there.  Okay?”  She asked.  Gabe rubbed his temple with his free hand.<br>
<br>
‘You are?’  Lex asked.  She looked at him expectantly and he frowned.  ‘Couldn’t you just tell him that we’re waiting for a doctor to come in and it could be a while?’<br>
<br>
‘No,’ Chloe thought.  ‘He’s already suspicious because of Clark calling.’<br>
<br>
‘I’m going to have to have a talk with Clark about keeping secrets,’ Lex thought.  Chloe scoffed.<br>
<br>
‘Clark Kent has the market cornered on keeping secrets,’ she retorted.<br>
<br>
‘I meant other people’s secrets,’ Lex clarified.<br>
<br>
“Fine,” Gabe agreed.  <br>
<br>
“What?”  Chloe asked.<br>
<br>
“I said *fine*,” Gabe said.  “How long until you get here?”  Chloe looked at Lex.<br>
<br>
“I’m not sure,” Chloe said hesitantly.  ‘How long until we get home?’<br>
<br>
‘Who’s home?’  He asked with a small smirk.  Chloe tilted her head at him and looked at him with pure exasperation.  Lex shrugged.  ‘I have no idea,’ he thought as he looked around at the field surrounding them.<br>
<br>
‘Great,’ Chloe thought sarcastically.  ‘Are we lost?’  Lex sloughed off the comment and took the phone from her.<br>
<br>
“Gabe?”  <br>
<br>
“Yes?”<br>
<br>
“We didn’t make it to the lab because I was having some car trouble.  It seems to be okay now though, so we’re on our way,” Lex smoothly lied.  ‘That should do it,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
“Why was my daughter in your car in the first place?”  Gabe asked.  <br>
<br>
“We’ll be there shortly,” Lex said, sloughing off Gabe’s question.  Gabe listened to the dial tone come on and he frowned in confusion.<br>
<br>
“*We*?” <br>

They were on her street now and she could feel the blood leaking from her.  She only hoped that they got home in time before it stained her skirt.<br>
<br>
“Calm down,” Lex said.  “Why are you in such a rush to get home anyway?”<br>
<br>
“I need to change,” she mumbled.  Lex glanced over at her.<br>
<br>
“Why?”<br>
<br>
“I just do, okay?”<br>
<br>
“Chloe, I sincerely doubt the outfit you’re wearing will make much of a difference when we tell your dad,” Lex said.<br>
<br>
‘It will if he sees the back of it,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
“I don’t see why that would ---?”  Lex trailed off as he pulled into the Sullivans’ driveway.  He tilted his head at her as the thought struck him.  “Something you’re not telling me?”<br>
<br>
“Let’s just get this over with,” she said and reached for her door handle.  Lex caught her arm before she could open the door.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, you weren’t – I mean, you weren’t a ---?”<br>
<br>
“Yes,” Chloe said through gritted teeth.  Lex leaned his head back against his seat and closed his eyes.<br>
<br>
‘God, I’m an ass,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
“No argument here,” Chloe said.  “Now can we hurry up and get inside so I can change before my dad sees my skirt?  Which you’re replacing by the way.”  She opened the door and Lex saw the back of her skirt as she started to climb out of the car.  His eyes grew wide and he quickly yanked her back inside the vehicle.<br>
<br>
“We can’t go in there,” he said.<br>
<br>
“That bad?”  She asked as she made a worried face.  He nodded.  Chloe sighed and stared at her house.  “We have to do this.  Maybe you could walk behind me or something.”<br>
<br>
“All the way to your room?  I think that might look a little suspicious.”<br>
<br>
“Well, we don’t have a lot of options do we?”  She asked in a slightly aggravated voice.  Lex took a deep breath.<br>
<br>
“You’re sure you want to do this?”  Lex asked.  “I could always call him again and say we got stranded again.”  Chloe spotted someone peeking out the blinds and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“It’s too late now, he’s seen us,” she said.  Lex followed her gaze to the blinds.<br>
<br>
“How can you be sure it was him?”<br>
<br>
‘I guess I can’t,’ Chloe admitted.  ‘I suppose it could be Lana.’<br>
<br>
“Great,” Lex mumbled sarcastically.<br>
<br>
“You don’t like Lana?”<br>
<br>
“Think about it Chloe.  Where Lana is, Clark inevitably follows,” Lex explained.  Chloe gave him a blank look and he squared his jaw.  ‘I really don’t feel like explaining why we didn’t go to the lab to him, do you?’  Chloe paled and shook her head.  “Good.  So, we’re leaving then?”  Chloe stopped his hand before he turned the keys.<br>
<br>
“We can’t leave.”<br>
<br>
“Chloe ---”<br>
<br>
“Fine!  I’ll stay and you can leave,” she said.  ‘Just like always,’ she thought.  Lex turned to face her.<br>
<br>
“I beg your pardon?  When have I ever left you?”<br>
<br>
“I wasn’t talking about you in particular,” she said and opened the car door again, managing to get out before Lex could stop her.  <br>
<br>
‘Damn it.’<br>
<br>
‘Just leave,’ she thought as she started walking up to her front door.  Lex swiftly jumped out of his car and draped his overcoat on Chloe’s shoulders.  She looked at him quizzically.<br>
<br>
“It’s longer than yours,” he explained.  They walked up to the door and Chloe opened it hesitantly.  Lana came in from the living room and smiled at Chloe.<br>
<br>
“It took you long enough, you were out in the car for-,” she trailed off when she saw that Lex had followed Chloe into the house, and that Chloe was wearing Lex’s overcoat over her own jacket.  Her eyes darted questioningly at Chloe who shot her a nervous smile and grabbed her arm.<br>
<br>
“Think you can keep my dad distracted long enough for me to change?”  Chloe asked hopefully.  Lana furrowed her brow in confusion.  “I *started* early and Lex was kind enough to lend me his jacket to cover up,” Chloe lied.  Lana’s eyes grew wide and her mouth dropped open a little.<br>
<br>
“Oh!  Oh, of course,” Lana said, practically pushing Chloe toward the stairs.  Chloe ran up the stairs and Lana turned around to face Lex with an uncomfortable look on her face.  Lana’s tension eased when she saw that Lex wasn’t even paying attention to her, but only following Chloe with his eyes.  “I’m sure she’ll pay for dry cleaning.”  Lex turned his head to look at her and shot her a confused expression.  “Your coat, you know, if blood gets on it,” she explained while wringing her hands.  Lex gave her a curt nod.<br>
<br>
“I’m not worried about the coat Lana,” he said with a small grin.  “Where is Gabe?”  <br>
<br>
“On the phone with Clark,” Lana said with a partial eye roll.  Lex arched an eyebrow, but Lana didn’t elaborate.  Her face had marred into a distinct look of agitation and Lex tilted his head at her.<br>
<br>
“You seem upset,” he observed.<br>
<br>
“It’s nothing,” she lied.<br>
<br>
‘Lana’s upset?’  Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘Apparently.’<br>
<br>
‘Why?’<br>
<br>
‘I’m trying to find out.  She mentioned Clark being on the phone with your dad and then her mood changed.’<br>
<br>
‘Huh.  I thought they were getting better at the whole *let’s just be friends* thing.’<br>
<br>
‘I’m sure the fact that you ---’<br>
<br>
‘Don’t even think it Luthor.  I have nothing to do with their ongoing soap opera problems.’<br>
<br>
‘Of course not *sweetheart*,’ Lex thought sarcastically.  “Lana, this wouldn’t have anything to do with Clark would it?”  Lana looked down at the floor and then back up to him.<br>
<br>
“I,” she started, but then paused as if she couldn’t find the right words to say.  “Do you think Clark still likes Chloe?”  Lex pumped his hands into fists and then released them.<br>
<br>
‘She just asked me if I thought if Clark still liked you,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘So tell her the truth.  Clark never liked me,’ Chloe thought bitterly.<br>
<br>
‘That’s not the truth.’<br>
<br>
‘Yes it is.’<br>
<br>
‘No it’s not.’<br>
<br>
“Lex?”  Lana asked, snapping him out of his mental argument with Chloe.<br>
<br>
“I think you and I might be in the same situation,” he responded without apologizing for spacing out.  Lana crinkled her brow.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
<br>
‘Yes, what *do* you mean Lex?’  Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
“You like Clark,” Lex said.<br>
<br>
“He’s my friend.”<br>
<br>
“But you like him more than a friend,” Lex said.  Lana blushed and ducked her head.  “It’s okay.”<br>
<br>
“It’s not okay,” Lana argued.  “We decided to just be friends so no one’s feelings would get hurt, and now ---,”<br>
<br>
“Your feelings are getting hurt because you like him but you think he likes Chloe,” Lex filled in for her.  Lana nodded.<br>
<br>
‘What a load of bu-”<br>
<br>
“What makes you think he likes Chloe?”  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘Good question,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘Are you going to let me get through this conversation or not?’<br>
<br>
‘Not.  I’m almost done.’<br>
<br>
‘What’s been taking so long?’<br>
<br>
‘I had to clean the blood off me, not that it’s any of your business.’<br>
<br>
‘Oh.’<br>
<br>
“Tonight at the Talon, he was – I don’t know – zoning,” Lana said and motioned wildly with her arms.  “And he called Gabe to find out if Chloe was back yet, and he’s called several times since I got home, and ---”  <br>
<br>
“Okay,” Lex interrupted.  “I think I’ve got the picture.”  Lana narrowed her eyes at him slightly as a thought occurred to her.<br>
<br>
“What did you mean when you said we’re in the same situation?”  She asked.  Lex opened his mouth to speak, but Chloe came down the stairs and smiled at him.  She held out the overcoat that was now draped over her arm.<br>
<br>
“Thanks again,” she chirped.  Lex smirked at her and she instantly deciphered the double meaning behind what she had said.<br>
<br>
“Anytime,” he replied.  Gabe cleared his throat and all three of them turned their heads to look at him.  He rubbed his temples and sighed, and then gave Chloe a small smile.<br>
<br>
“I think Clark must have been in an accident,” he said.  Chloe and Lana’s eyes both widened.<br>
<br>
“What?  When did this happen?”  Lana asked.<br>
<br>
“Is he okay?”  Chloe asked.  <br>
<br>
“No, no.  I just meant ---” Gabe trailed off and sighed again.  “The reason he gave for you two to need to go to the lab was a little out there.”  Lana looked at Chloe.<br>
<br>
“You had to go to a lab?  Why?”  She asked, suddenly feeling guilty that she had automatically jumped to the conclusion that Clark was interested in her friend.<br>
<br>
“We didn’t even make it there,” Chloe said.<br>
<br>
“Car trouble,” Lex said.  Gabe arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh,” he said.  “So, why don’t you tell me why you were really going there?”  He asked Lex.  “Did Chloe con you into getting information for a story or something?”  Chloe fought hard to keep the color from rising to her cheeks.<br>
<br>
‘Or something,’ Lex thought suggestively.<br>
<br>
‘Don’t start,’ Chloe warned.  Gabe saw the way Chloe and Lex were looking at each other but not speaking and he frowned.<br>
<br>
“Something I should know?”  He asked.  Chloe turned to him.<br>
<br>
“What did Clark tell you?”  She asked hesitantly.  Gabe let out a light chuckle.  ‘That’s a good sign.  He probably didn’t tell my dad about what happened.’<br>
<br>
‘Agreed,’ Lex thought.  <br>
<br>
“He said that because of the chemical spill at the plant that you two can read each other’s minds now,” Gabe said, still chuckling, as if the very idea was completely absurd.  Lana smiled brightly.<br>
<br>
“That’s ridiculous,” she said.  “Why would Clark say something like that?”  Chloe and Lex looked at each other again and then back to Gabe.  Gabe’s face dropped the second they looked back at him.  <br>
<br>
“Oh, no,” he said under his breath.  <br>
<br>
“You’re kidding?”  Lana asked in astonishment.  Chloe and Lex both shook their heads.  Gabe looked up from the floor at them and shook his head at Lex.  <br>
<br>
“God, I’m so sorry, Lex.”  <br>
<br>
‘Why do I have a feeling that he wouldn’t be apologizing to you if he knew the whole story?’  Chloe thought.  Lex inwardly laughed.<br>
<br>
‘Not only can we read each other’s minds, but I also took advantage of the fact to take your daughter’s virginity,’ he thought dryly.  ‘Yeah, I’m pretty sure that wouldn’t go over very well.’  Chloe giggled and Gabe and Lana gave her a strange look.  <br>
<br>
“Sorry,” she mumbled.  <br>
<br>
“So how do we fix it?”  Gabe asked.  Lex was still looking at Chloe when he answered Gabe’s question.<br>
<br>
“Fix what?”  He asked absently.  Lex felt Gabe’s eyes boring a hole into the side of his head and he turned around.  “Oh, the situation,” he said.  “I have no idea.  Like I said, we never made it to the lab.”<br>
<br>
“But you can go there tomorrow, right?”  Gabe asked.<br>
<br>
“The lab is closed on Sundays, but Chloe and I can go first thing Monday morning,” Lex answered.  Gabe’s eyebrows rose in surprise.<br>
<br>
“You think you can handle it that long?”<br>
<br>
“Dad!”<br>
<br>
“Sorry honey,” Gabe said.  “But Lex is a young man, and I’m sure he doesn’t want to have a teenage girl’s thoughts in his head for longer than he has to.”  Chloe folded her arms across her chest.<br>
<br>
“And what about me?”  She asked somewhat angrily.  “Did you ever think that I might not want to have *his* thoughts inside *my* head?”  Gabe frowned as he appeared pensive.<br>
<br>
“You’re right, I’m sorry,” he apologized.<br>
<br>
‘You don’t want my thoughts inside your head?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘No.  In fact, I’m going to look for my dad’s scotch as soon as you leave.’<br>
<br>
‘I feel the need to point out that getting drunk didn’t actually help the situation,’ Lex thought.  ‘Of course, we did end up ---,’<br>
<br>
‘Shut up,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘Chloe.’<br>
<br>
‘No,’ she thought.  ‘I’ll stand my ground so I don’t embarrass myself in front of my dad and Lana.’  Unfortunately, her body had other ideas.  An image flitted into her mind of when they were in the car together and her mind started to expand on the memory.  Lex’s eyes grew wide as he felt the arousal start to warm his body.  Chloe was able to snap out of it just long enough to fake a smile at Gabe and Lana.  “I’m not feeling too good, so I’m going to go upstairs and lie down.  Bye Lex.”  She practically ran up the stairs and Gabe furrowed his brow at his daughter’s retreating form.  Lana grimaced and leaned toward Gabe.<br>
<br>
“She, um, started her time of the month early,” she whispered.  Gabe’s mouth dropped open and he nodded in understanding.<br>
<br>
“Right,” he said and turned to Lex, who now looked flushed as well.  He frowned.  “You’re not looking well either Lex.”<br>
<br>
“I should go,” Lex said.  “I’ll talk to you later.”  He hurried out the door and Lana turned to Gabe.<br>
<br>
“Maybe it’s another side effect of the chemical spill,” she suggested.<br>
<br>
“Great,” Gabe said sarcastically.  “So not only can my daughter and my boss read each other’s minds, but they’re both sick too.”<br>

Chloe looked up at him from her bed.  She was just sitting there, her back against the headboard and the music playing at a normal level.  “I thought you were going to bed,” he said with a small smirk.  Chloe frowned.<br>
<br>
“I couldn’t sleep,” she lied.  He shot her a sympathetic look and held up the cordless phone in his hand.<br>
<br>
‘There’s a reason for that,’ Lex thought smugly.<br>
<br>
‘Shut up,’ Chloe thought.  <br>
<br>
“Clark’s on the phone.  You must have had your phone off,” Gabe said.  “Do you feel up to talking to him?”  Chloe groaned and rubbed her eyes with her hand.<br>
<br>
‘What’s wrong?’<br>
<br>
‘Clark’s on the phone,’ Chloe explained.  ‘How am I supposed to explain this to him?’<br>
<br>
‘You’re not.’<br>
<br>
“Uh – sure,” Chloe agreed after a slight pause.  She picked up the phone in her room and her dad clicked off the one in his hand.  “Thanks Dad.”  He nodded and then shut the bedroom door behind him as he exited the room.  “Hey Clark,” she said weakly.<br>
<br>
“Hey Chlo,” he said.  “You don’t sound too good.”<br>
<br>
‘Clark Kent, master of the obvious,’ she thought.  Lex snickered and Chloe shook her head.<br>
<br>
“Your dad said that you never made it to the lab,” Clark continued.  “Something about *car trouble*.”  He said the last part in a tone that indicated that he knew it was just a cover story.<br>
<br>
“Well,” Chloe started.  ‘Shit.  He knows.’<br>
<br>
‘He knows what?’<br>
<br>
‘He knows that you didn’t have car trouble,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘No offense, but I was a little surprised that your dad and Lana bought the excuse so easily,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Me too.  Why is that?’<br>
<br>
‘People believe what they want to believe.  It makes them feel safe.’<br>
<br>
‘I guess.’<br>
<br>
“Chloe?  Are you still there?”  Clark asked.  Even thought Clark couldn’t see her, Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, sorry,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Talking to Lex?”<br>
<br>
“I’m not sure you can call it *talking* exactly.”<br>
<br>
“Uh, yeah,” Clark started, “about that ---”  <br>
<br>
“No, no!  That’s not what I meant,” Chloe quickly protested.  “I just meant, it’s more thinking than talking.”<br>
<br>
“Oh,” Clark said.  “But still, I wanted to talk to you about ---”<br>
<br>
“I thought we were going to forget all about that.  Remember?”<br>
<br>
“Chloe, you,” Clark stopped and hesitated before continuing.  He took a deep breath and glanced around to make sure his parents weren’t anywhere within earshot.  “You and Lex, *you know*.”<br>
<br>
‘He’s upset because of what happened earlier,’ Chloe filled in for Lex.<br>
<br>
‘I’m in shock,’ Lex thought sarcastically.<br>
<br>
“Clark ---”<br>
<br>
“Chloe, he’s my friend; but the more I think about it, the more I think he’s taking advantage of the situation,” Clark interrupted.  Chloe’s eyes grew wide, stunned by the fact that Clark would say something like that to her.<br>
<br>
“How do you think he’s taking advantage exactly?”  Chloe asked and then bit her hip as she waited for an answer.  <br>
<br>
“Come on Chloe,” Clark said.  “You would never do something like that, even if it *was* just in your mind.”  Chloe gritted her teeth as she suddenly felt completely affronted.<br>
<br>
“You *do* realize that I’m a woman, don’t you Clark?”  She asked angrily, trying to keep her voice down so her dad and Lana wouldn’t hear her.<br>
<br>
‘Uh-oh,’ Lex thought.  ‘What did he say?’<br>
<br>
‘Stay out of this,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, that’s not what I meant,” Clark said.  “I just meant, you know ---”<br>
<br>
“No, I don’t know Clark.  Why don’t you tell me?”  She asked.  Clark ran his hand over the back of his neck.  <br>
<br>
“Don’t get mad,” he said.  “I just ---”<br>
<br>
“You just don’t see me as a female of the species,” Chloe interrupted.  “Well, just because *you* don’t, doesn’t mean that ---”<br>
<br>
‘Remind him that he tried to kiss you,’ Lex thought helpfully.  He frowned and furrowed his brow immediately after offering the advice.  ‘Why did I do that?’<br>
<br>
“Lex said to remind you that you tried to kiss me,” Chloe said, ignoring Lex’s thought about his motivations for saying it.  Clark sighed.<br>
<br>
“If you’d let me finish a sentence, then I could finish telling you what I called to say,” Clark said.  This time Chloe sighed.  She ran a hand through her hair and then closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry Clark; it’s just been a really rough couple of days.”<br>
<br>
“I understand,” Clark said sympathetically.  “Having someone else’s thoughts in your head can’t be very easy to deal with.”<br>
<br>
“You have no idea,” Chloe said.  ‘You’re quiet,’ she thought to Lex.  Lex took a sip of the alcohol he had just poured for himself.<br>
<br>
‘I would rather not have images of you and Clark together in my head tonight, so I’m doing my best not to think anything that might make you angry,’ Lex admitted.<br>
<br>
‘That’s considerate of you,’ Chloe thought.  ‘Wait.  So you would be thinking something that might make me angry?’<br>
<br>
“So, I was wondering if you might want to get together to study for history tomorrow?  You know, since it’s Sunday and Mr. Charles usually throws pop quizzes on Mondays?”  Clark asked.<br>
<br>
‘Damn!  I completely forgot about that,’ Chloe thought.  <br>
<br>
‘About what?’  Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Clark wants to get together and study for history tomorrow.’<br>
<br>
‘I thought you finished your homework last night?’<br>
<br>
‘I did, but our teacher has a habit of throwing pop quizzes on Mondays,’ Chloe replied.  <br>
<br>
‘I’m not sure it’s such a good idea for you to be alone with him,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘With Mr. Charles?  I agree, he’s a pig,’ Chloe thought with a small smirk.<br>
<br>
‘With Clark,’ Lex clarified.<br>
<br>
‘You’re joking, right?  Clark is the safest person in the world to be with.’<br>
<br>
‘He might try something,’ Lex protested.<br>
<br>
‘Define *something*,’ Chloe thought.  ‘Because, you and I did a lot more than just *something* less than two hours ago.’<br>
<br>
‘I’m aware of that.’<br>
<br>
‘And Clark would never try anything – at least not with me.’<br>
<br>
‘He tried to kiss you,’ Lex reminded her.<br>
<br>
‘I’m not having this conversation with you again.’<br>
<br>
‘Yes you are.’<br>
<br>
‘No, I’m *not*.’<br>
<br>
“Chloe?  So what do you think?”  Clark asked.<br>
<br>
‘What do I think?  I think I need to get your best friend’s voice out of my head before I go crazy,’ she thought.  <br>
<br>
‘Tell him that you won’t be alone with him,’ Lex suggested.<br>
<br>
‘I *want* to be alone with him.’<br>
<br>
‘Chloe, please.  For my own sanity,’ Lex pleaded.  Chloe rolled her eyes.  ‘I saw that.’<br>
<br>
‘You saw what?’<br>
<br>
‘You rolled your eyes.’<br>
<br>
‘How did you know *that*?’<br>
<br>
‘You pictured yourself doing it,’ Lex thought.  Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
‘Did I really?  Oops,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
“Chloe?”  Clark asked.<br>
<br>
“Oh, yeah, sorry Clark.”<br>
<br>
“Lex is keeping you pretty busy, huh?”  He asked.  Chloe felt her skin color and was thankful that Clark and Lex couldn’t see her.<br>
<br>
“You could definitely say that,” Chloe said.  “So, needless to say, I’m not sure how much use I would be in a study session.”  Clark chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Actually, Lex is pretty good at all that world history stuff.  He could probably help,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Okay, but we should invite Lana and Pete,” Chloe said.  Clark’s smile fell.<br>
<br>
“Why?”<br>
<br>
“Because they have the same class we do?”  Chloe answered, as if it were the simplest thing in the world to understand.  Lex coughed on some of his drink when he heard her tone.<br>
<br>
‘That’s no way to speak to the man you love Chloe,’ he teased.  <br>
<br>
‘When did I say I loved him?’  Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘You don’t?’  Lex asked in surprise.<br>
<br>
‘As a friend,’ she thought.  ‘But if I loved him more than that, then I wouldn’t have ---’<br>
<br>
‘Slept with me,’ Lex filled in.<br>
<br>
‘I’m not sure it could be considered *sleep*,’ she thought.  <br>
<br>
‘So, tell him,’ Lex thought in frustration.  It had only been an hour since he had last seen her, and he was already on his third drink in a desperate attempt to forget about how much he enjoyed the taste of her.  Unfortunately, it was working in the opposite way.  Every sip he took only seemed to accentuate how much he missed being inside of her and hearing her scream his name.  <br>
<br>
‘Tell him what?’  Chloe thought.  Lex closed his eyes and let his mind wander to an image of the two of them together.  Chloe’s eyes grew wide.  ‘You can’t be serious!’  In his daydream, Lex pictured himself nipping at her collarbone and running his hands under her shirt to cup her breasts.  ‘Lex!’<br>
<br>
‘Tell him that you only love him as a friend,’ Lex thought.  In the image, he was murmuring the words into her ear and Chloe could feel herself starting to become aroused again.  She would need to end her conversation with Clark quickly.<br>
<br>
“Clark?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah?”<br>
<br>
“What time?”<br>

And there’s a weird kind of scene switching that happens about half way through, because my muse insisted on adding a little bit of a plot to this story.  <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe walked up to the Kents’ front door and hesitated before ringing the bell.<br>
<br>
‘Ugh,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘What’s wrong?’<br>
<br>
‘I just got to Clark’s house,’ she explained.  ‘And I should be happy, but instead I’m kind of nervous.’  Chloe turned to look at her car.<br>
<br>
‘Feeling the overwhelming urge to run away?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
“No!”  Chloe yelled aloud.  She sighed when she realized what she had done.  ‘Okay, sort of.  How did you know that?  Are you feeling my emotions now too?  Because that would be really bad.’  She thought the last part for herself, but of course Lex heard it.<br>
<br>
‘No, thank God,’ he answered.  ‘It’s hard enough for me to handle you thinking about Clark without feeling the emotions behind it.’<br>
<br>
Chloe laughed loudly, and because she was still staring longingly at her car, she didn’t notice that Clark had opened the door and was leaning against the door frame with a lopsided boyish grin on his face.<br>
<br>
“Should I ask?”  Clark asked in amusement.  Chloe’s head whipped around and her face colored quickly.  She smiled with embarrassment at him.<br>
<br>
“It’s nothing,” she lied and shook her head.  She glanced back at the driveway area.  “Lana and Pete aren’t here yet?”<br>
<br>
‘Oh, great,’ Lex thought sarcastically.<br>
<br>
‘I’m sure they’re just late.’<br>
<br>
‘I’m sure they’re not coming,’ Lex countered.  ‘Why would he give up spending time alone with you when he doesn’t have to?’<br>
<br>
‘For the millionth time, Clark Kent doesn’t see me like that.  Will you just stop it?  Geez!  If I didn’t know it was because you found my daydreams disturbing, then I’d say you sound like a jealous boyfriend,’ Chloe thought.  Clark cleared his throat and crossed his arms, but kept the grin on his face.<br>
<br>
“Trying to talk him into helping us study for history?”  Clark asked.  <br>
<br>
“Something like that,” Chloe said.  Clark’s grin turned into a smile that almost made her melt.  He stood to the side of the door and motioned for her to come inside.<br>
<br>
“Lana called.  One of her waitresses called in sick, so she had to go into work after all,” Clark said.<br>
<br>
“I thought they were closed on Sundays?”<br>
<br>
“They have been, but profits haven’t been as good as Lana was hoping for the last couple of months, so she’s trying out being open for shorter hours on Sundays.”<br>
<br>
“Oh,” Chloe said.  ‘Why didn’t you tell me that?’<br>
<br>
‘Why didn’t I tell you *what*?’<br>
<br>
‘Lana’s trying out having the Talon open for limited hours on Sundays,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘I don’t know anything about it,’ Lex admitted.  ‘But, that’s good.  Even with the different things she’s been trying, nothing beats an after-church crowd.’  Chloe didn’t know what to think.  She understood his reasoning since he owned half of the Talon, but she was a little surprised that he didn’t mind Lana not being at Clark’s to keep an eye on them.  ‘Is Pete still coming?’  And there it was.  Lex thought Pete wouldn’t let anything happen between her and Clark.<br>
<br>
“When is Pete supposed to get here?”  Chloe asked, walking passed Clark into the living room.  She placed her books on the coffee table and sat down on the couch.  Clark stood over her and shoved his hands in his pockets nervously.  He looked up from the floor with puppy dog eyes that made Lex inwardly groan when Chloe flashed him the mental picture.<br>
<br>
“He’s not,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Why?”<br>
<br>
“I – um,” Clark started.  He shuffled a foot back and forth on the floor and Chloe looked at him questioningly.  “I didn’t actually invite him.”  Chloe’s mouth dropped open and shut before she could respond.<br>
<br>
‘He didn’t invite him?  How could he not invite him?’  She thought.<br>
<br>
‘Do you need me to come over?’<br>
<br>
‘Why?  To protect me from Clark?’  Chloe scoffed at the thought.  <br>
<br>
‘No, to help you study for history,’ Lex thought sarcastically.  Chloe held back on rolling her eyes and looked at Clark somewhat suspiciously.<br>
<br>
“Do you mind if I ask why?”  She asked.  Clark took a few steps and then sat down next to her on the couch.  It was a little closer than he normally sat, but Chloe didn’t think anything about it.<br>
<br>
“I wanted to have some time alone with you,” Clark admitted.  Chloe’s eyes grew wide.<br>
<br>
“W-what?”<br>
<br>
“To talk about what’s going on,” Clark said.  “And I haven’t told Pete, because ---”  Chloe let go of the breath that she didn’t even realize she had been holding in.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, he would pretty much freak out,” she agreed.  Clark nodded.<br>
<br>
“So, how are you feeling?”<br>
<br>
“I’m fine Clark.”<br>
<br>
“No, I mean, are there any other side effects?”<br>
<br>
‘Damn you Lex.  You got all my hopes up that Clark *might* actually like me and all he wanted to do was ask me more about the effects of the stupid chemical spill.’<br>
<br>
‘Really?’  Lex was surprised.  When Clark had tried to kiss Chloe, it didn’t look like a ‘just friends’ thing to him.<br>
<br>
‘Yes,’ Chloe answered, somewhat bitterly.<br>
<br>
‘Poor baby,’ Lex teased, and then his tone became more suggestive.  ‘Do you want me to make it up to you?’<br>
<br>
‘Don’t you dare,’ she warned him.  Chloe could hear his chuckle echoing through her mind and she shook her head to try and clear it.<br>
<br>
“Sorry, I had to ask,” Clark said, misinterpreting her gesture.  “With what happened ---” Clark trailed off as a blush spread across his cheeks.  He ducked his face and waited for it to clear.<br>
<br>
“Clark, it’s not like that,” she said.<br>
<br>
‘It’s not like what?’<br>
<br>
‘He’s talking about what happened in front of the Talon yesterday.’<br>
<br>
‘And, it’s not like *what*?’  Lex repeated.  Chloe chose to ignore him as Clark began to speak again.<br>
<br>
“I guess.  I just don’t want to see you get hurt,” he said.  Chloe smiled and nodded.  <br>
<br>
“It’s okay.  It must be kind of strange to see one of your friends turn into ‘wall of weird’ material, huh?” She asked.  Clark gave her a strange look and then coughed into his hand.<br>
<br>
“Yeah.  So, where do you want to start?”  He motioned to the history books in front of him and Chloe groaned.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know.  I ---” she stopped talking when she heard Lex’s voice inside her head, but he wasn’t talking to her.<br>
<br>
Lex watched his father walk into his office, but he didn’t rise to greet him.<br>
<br>
“Dad,” he acknowledged.<br>
<br>
‘Your dad is there?!’<br>
<br>
‘Unfortunately.’<br>
<br>
“Lex,” Lionel said with a sneer and strolled over toward the desk.  <br>
<br>
“What brings you to Smallville?”<br>
<br>
‘Good question,’ Chloe thought.  ‘Can you ask him one for me?’  A smile lifted her lips and her eyes gleamed with the possibility of interrogating – er, interviewing Lionel Luthor without him knowing about it.  Clark tilted his head questioningly at her, but she motioned for him not to talk as she grabbed her pen and notebook.<br>
<br>
‘No,’ Lex answered.<br>
<br>
‘Come on!  It’ll be fun.’<br>
<br>
‘For you.’<br>
<br>
‘Exactly.’<br>
<br>
“I heard there was a small incident at the plant,” Lionel started.  “Something about a vat leak.”  Lex narrowed his eyes a little.<br>
<br>
“I won’t bother asking how you heard about that, but rest assured, it’s been taken care of,” he said as calmly as possible.  One corner of Lionel’s mouth curled upward.<br>
<br>
“Of course it has.  I wasn’t doubting your competence, *son*,” Lionel responded.  <br>
<br>
‘Yeah, right,’ Lex thought and then pursed his lips.  “Then the question still remains to be answered.”  ‘You might get your chance to ask that question of yours if he keeps stalling like this.’<br>
<br>
‘Really?’<br>
<br>
‘Sure.  Why not?  It’s not like I can make him dislike me anymore than he already does,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘I’m sorry,’ she thought sympathetically.<br>
<br>
‘Don’t worry about it.’  Lex stared straight at his father, his eye contact never wavering as he spoke to Chloe inside his head.  “It’s not like you to be at a loss for words, Dad.”  <br>
<br>
“Just paying a friendly visit to see my son, Lex.  Isn’t that allowed?”  Lionel said with a smirk.  Lex pursed his lips.  His patience with Lionel and his cryptic lies had completely run out.  It was time to do something about it.<br>
<br>
‘What’s your question Chloe?’  Lex thought.  <br>
<br>
“Woo-hoo!”  She yelled, earning her a puzzled expression from Clark.  She smiled at him, but concentrated on Lex.  ‘Ask him if his visit to Smallville has anything to do with Ted Dobson and Axis Chemicals.’  Lex arched an eyebrow and leaned back in his chair with confidence.<br>
<br>
“It might be if I thought for a minute that you were actually here to see me, but I have a feeling it has more to do with Axis Chemicals and Ted Dobson,” Lex said.<br>
<br>
‘That wasn’t a question,’ Chloe protested.<br>
<br>
‘He wouldn’t have answered a question straight out Chloe.’<br>
<br>
‘Whatever.  So what’d he say?’<br>
<br>
‘He’s seems too surprised to answer the question,’ Lex thought in a pleased tone.  A tiny smirk crawled across his mouth.  “I’ll take your stunned silence as an affirmative answer.”  Lionel squared his jaw and glared at his son.<br>
<br>
“You’re treading on dangerous ground Lex,” he said in what almost sounded like a growl.  “Watch your step.”  He turned on his heel and left the room, leaving Lex with a broad smile on his face.  <br>
<br>
‘I owe you for that one Chloe.’<br>
<br>
‘Why?  What happened?’<br>
<br>
‘He threatened me and then hurried out of the room,’ Lex thought with a chuckle.  Chloe furrowed her brow.<br>
<br>
‘How is that a good thing?’<br>
<br>
‘You don’t know my father.  Trust me.  Having the upper hand is always good,’ Lex thought.  ‘So, why don’t we meet and you can tell me everything you know about Dobson and Axis Chemicals?’<br>
<br>
“Because I’m with Clark,” Chloe answered aloud.  Clark seemed surprised to hear her break her silence, but he was pleased with what she had said.  “We’re studying, remember?”  That part made Clark look away for a minute.  He knew she would figure out the real reason he asked her over if she saw the guilt in his eyes.<br>
<br>
‘Right.  The history test.’<br>
<br>
‘Quiz,’ Chloe corrected.<br>
<br>
‘When is this quiz supposed to take place?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘Tomorrow.’<br>
<br>
‘Ah.  And therein lies the reason that you’re studying today.’<br>
<br>
‘Very clever,’ she thought teasingly.<br>
<br>
‘You do realize that you’re not even going to be at school tomorrow, don’t you?’<br>
<br>
‘What?’<br>
<br>
‘Or have you forgotten about our appointment at the lab first thing in the morning?’  Lex thought.  Chloe’s eyes widened.<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe I forgot about that!”<br>
<br>
“Forgot about what?”  Clark asked.  Chloe stood up, gathering her books as she did so.  She shot Clark an apologetic smile.<br>
<br>
“Sorry Clark, but I completely forgot that I’m going to be at the lab tomorrow; for – you know,” she sort of explained.  Clark’s eyebrows rose.<br>
<br>
“Oh.”  He stood up as well.  “So, I guess that means you don’t really need to study, huh?”<br>
<br>
“Nope,” she said cheerfully.  Clark walked with her toward the door.<br>
<br>
“You could still stay,” he said hopefully.  Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
“No offense, but as fun as studying for history *isn’t*, I think I’ll – mmph.”  Clark quickly pressed his mouth against hers, taking her completely by surprise.  <br>
<br>
‘Mmph?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘He’s kissing me.  He’s actually kissing me.’<br>
<br>
“What?!”<br>

The kiss had been very different than she had imagined it would be.  There was no spark, just flesh against flesh.<br>
<br>
‘But judging from the goofy looking grin on Clark’s face, he doesn’t feel the same way,’ she thought.  Lex stopped dead in his tracks.  He had been on the way to his car when Chloe’s voice came into his head.<br>
<br>
‘What does that mean?’  He asked.  Chloe inwardly sighed.<br>
<br>
‘He – um – didn’t exactly live up to my fantasy version of him,’ she admitted.  A grin curled at the corners of Lex’s mouth.<br>
<br>
‘And here I was on my way to ---’ <br>
<br>
‘To *what*?’  Chloe asked suspiciously.  <br>
<br>
‘Nothing.’<br>
<br>
‘Liar.’<br>
<br>
‘So, what are you going to tell him?’<br>
<br>
‘I don’t know.  You think I should try again?’  She asked.<br>
<br>
‘No.’<br>
<br>
Chloe fidgeted with her hands while she looked up at Clark.  <br>
<br>
“You’re quiet,” he observed.  “You didn’t like it?”<br>
<br>
“I was just taken by surprise,” she said.  “Maybe if we ---”<br>
<br>
‘No,’ Lex repeated as he was pulling out of his driveway.<br>
<br>
‘Shut up Lex.  Clark is the guy that I’ve been in love with for the last – well, forever.  Don’t you think that deserves another shot?’<br>
<br>
‘Chloe ---’<br>
<br>
“Okay, now you really *are* sounding like a jealous boyfriend.  What gives?”  Chloe saw the surprised expression on Clark’s face and realized that she had said it aloud.  She slapped her hand over her mouth.  ‘Crap.’<br>
<br>
‘You’re right.  I’m sorry,’ Lex told her, but he kept driving his course toward the Kent farm.  ‘Go ahead and try again,’ he thought, trying to hide the bitterness and jealousy from his statement.<br>
<br>
‘Yeah, well, I’m thinking he’s not going to want to do that now,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘Why?’<br>
<br>
‘Because I accidentally said the part about you sounding like a jealous boyfriend out loud,’ she thought.  Lex smiled and then started to chuckle.<br>
<br>
‘Whoops.’<br>
<br>
‘Shut up Luthor.’  Chloe took a deep breath and looked straight into Clark’s eyes.  To his credit, he seemed more confused than upset.  “Clark, I’m sorry.  Ever since the accident -” she paused and looked down as she shook her head.  “Ever since the accident, things have been happening.  Things that we don’t seem to have a lot of control over.”<br>
<br>
‘You’re telling him?’  Lex asked with surprise.  <br>
<br>
“Like what?”  Clark asked suspiciously.  Chloe cringed.<br>
<br>
“Like what happened in front of the Talon the other day,” she said slowly.  Clark’s eyebrows rose and Chloe got a horrible feeling in the pit of her stomach.<br>
<br>
“You – you’ve done that more than once?”<br>
<br>
“Sort of,” she said quietly.  <br>
<br>
‘Sort of what?’<br>
<br>
‘He asked if we had done the mind-sex thing more than once,’ Chloe explained.<br>
<br>
‘We could demonstrate it again for him right now if you’d like.’<br>
<br>
‘Ha ha,’ Chloe thought dryly.  ‘But considering the way you reacted the last time I fell into Clark’s arms, I’m thinking that wouldn’t be a good idea.’<br>
<br>
‘Good point,’ Lex agreed.<br>
<br>
Clark’s mouth dropped open at Chloe’s statement and he found it difficult to form coherent words.<br>
<br>
“I ---” he shook his head.  He looked at the ground and then looked up at Chloe with a completely different expression on his face.  He sighed and ran a hand through his hair.  “I’m so sorry Chloe.”  Chloe furrowed her brow.  “I should have called your cell phone and warned you earlier.  I didn’t know that he would take it so far.  I suspected, but ---” he shook his head again.  “I just didn’t want to believe it, you know?”  He reached out and touched her arm.  “I’m so sorry.”<br>
<br>
‘Oh my God, he thinks it’s his fault.’<br>
<br>
‘Just tell him that chemistry can’t be controlled and it’s not his fault that you and he don’t have it,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘No,’ Chloe thought as her tears started to well up with tears from the strong emotions tearing at her.  ‘He thinks it’s his fault that you and I have been ---’<br>
<br>
‘Oh,’ Lex thought, and then, after a couple of silent seconds, ‘why?’<br>
<br>
‘He thinks you’re taking advantage of me or something,’ Chloe started to let a few tears run down from her eyes and Clark swept his thumb across her cheek to wipe them off.  He pulled her into his arms and took in a deep breath.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry Chloe,” he repeated.  “Please forgive me.”  Chloe began to pull away, but Clark kept her in his embrace.  She looked up at him and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“Clark, it’s not your fault.  None of this is your fault,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, you would never have done ---” he shifted around uncomfortably, “you know – if ---”<br>
<br>
“Clark,” Chloe took a deep breath and then continued.  “We sort of already did the night before.  You didn’t have anything to do with it.  Dreams can’t be controlled.”<br>
<br>
‘Liar,’ Lex teased.<br>
<br>
‘What do you want me to tell him?  That we’ve turned into a couple of mind-sex nymphos?  Although I guess the ‘turned into’ part doesn’t really apply to you, does it?’  Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘Ouch.  And I should point out that you’re the one who was daydreaming about things you could do with naked Clark,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
‘You’re right.  I should take the opportunity while it’s presenting itself,’ she retorted.  Lex’s hands gripped the steering wheel tighter.<br>
<br>
“Those were just dreams though, they weren’t real,” Clark said.  <br>
<br>
“They *felt* real,” Chloe said.  Clark lightly stroked her hair with his hand and Chloe closed her eyes, sinking into the comforting sensation.<br>
<br>
‘Are you saying that the opportunity is presenting itself?  I thought you said that he wasn’t interested anymore?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘Well, he’s stroking my hair and not letting me out of his arms, so I’m going to take that as a good sign,’ she answered.  <br>
<br>
‘I’ll kill him.’<br>
<br>
‘You will not.  He’s your best friend.’<br>
<br>
‘Chloe --- God!  I can’t believe he accused *me* of taking advantage of the situation.  Hypocrite.  Just don’t do anything with him, okay?’  Lex pulled up in the Kents’ driveway and made his way to the front door.  <br>
<br>
‘It’s not like you can stop me,’ she argued.  The doorbell rang, jolting Clark and Chloe away from their embrace by the door.  Clark shot Chloe an apologetic look before answering.  <br>
<br>
“Lex,” he said in surprise.  Lex opened the screen door and walked passed them into the house.  He turned around to face Chloe.<br>
<br>
“You and I need to have a talk.”<br>
<br>
“I agree,” she said.  She bent down to pick up her books that dropped long ago and placed them on an end table by the door.  Clark looked back and forth between them with a confused expression.<br>
<br>
“I thought that’s what you were doing the whole time you were so quiet?”  Clark said to Chloe.  Both Lex and Chloe ignored him, their intense gazes focused only on each other.  Unknowingly, they started stepping closer toward each other.<br>
<br>
“I can put up with a lot of things, but having my girlfriend contemplate cheating on me isn’t one of them,” Lex said angrily.<br>
<br>
“News flash!  Not your girlfriend!”  Chloe spat.  Lex quickly closed the gap between them and slammed his lips almost punishingly against hers.  One of his hands wove into her hair and circled around to the back of her head to keep her from ending the contact, and the other hand rested on her arm.  Chloe’s eyes closed and the kiss softened as she began to reciprocate.  ‘Mmm.  Oh, God – yes,’ Chloe thought as their tongues started to explore each other’s mouths. <br>
<br>
Clark watched on with wide eyes as they seemed to devour each other.  Maybe he had just caught Chloe by surprise, but Lex caught her by surprise too, and she was kissing him passionately.  <br>
<br>
‘Maybe it’s another side effect of the chemical they were exposed to,’ he thought.  Clark shook his head.  ‘At least they’re getting everything fixed tomorrow.’<br>
<br>
‘Mmm.’  Lex moved the hand on her back to the hem of her shirt and their lips pulled away for a split second so Lex could talk.  “Mine.”<br>
<br>

‘God, I’m a horrible person,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘I wish you’d stop saying that.’<br>
<br>
‘I’m not saying it, I’m thinking it,’ Chloe corrected.<br>
<br>
‘Either way, it’s not true,’ Lex thought as he glanced in his rearview mirror to make sure she was still following him in her car.<br>
<br>
‘Lex, I just *left* him there.  He’s never going to forgive me,’ she thought ruefully.<br>
<br>
‘He left you at the dance and you forgave him,’ Lex reminded her.<br>
<br>
‘That was different,’ Chloe argued.  <br>
<br>
‘How do you figure?’<br>
<br>
‘Clark left me at the dance because he thought Lana’s life was in danger --- not that there was anything he could have done about it, but that’s not the point.’<br>
<br>
‘What *is* the point?’<br>
<br>
‘The point is that he left because he was trying to be heroic or something, and I left because I apparently have no control over my hormones since our little accident at the plant.’<br>
<br>
‘I wish I could say I’m sorry for your moral dilemma, but ---’<br>
<br>
‘You’re not,’ Chloe finished understandingly.  ‘But I think that’s only because we were both affected by the chemical.  I mean, can you honestly say that you would have stormed over to Clark’s house, kissed me, and said *mine* if you hadn’t lost some control over your own hormones?’<br>
<br>
‘It’s entirely possible,’ Lex murmured inside his head, temporarily forgetting that Chloe could hear everything he thought.<br>
<br>
‘No, it’s not.  You’re just being stubborn.’<br>
<br>
“*I’m* being stubborn?”  Lex asked aloud.  He pulled his car into the long circular driveway in front of the manor and Chloe pulled up in back of him just a minute later.  Lex got out of his car and stared at her in disbelief.  “I’m not the one who’s still fawning over Clark after a lousy kiss.”<br>
<br>
‘I should certainly hope not,’ she thought snarkily with a quirky smile.  Lex felt the corners of his own lips start to curl upward.  Chloe glanced at the manor to the side of her and inwardly groaned.  ‘What the hell was I thinking?  I shouldn’t be here.’  Lex came up behind her and placed his hands on her hips as he moved his mouth to the crook of her neck.<br>
<br>
‘Yes you should.’  He kissed her neck softly before darting out his tongue and moistening the soft skin beneath his lips.  Without realizing that she did it, Chloe tilted her head to the side to allow him better access.  Lex tightened his grip on her hips and drug his teeth along the moistened skin.  Chloe closed her eyes and let out a small moan.  <br>
<br>
“Lex,” she half-whispered.  <br>
<br>
“Mmm?”<br>
<br>
Chloe’s eyes widened when she saw a figure watching them from one of the upstairs windows.  She jerked herself away from him and Lex shot her a confused look.<br>
<br>
“Don’t tell me you didn’t like that, because ---”<br>
<br>
“Someone’s watching us,” she interrupted, motioning to the window with her head.  Lex’s gaze moved to the window, but nobody was there by the time he looked.  He squared his jaw, knowing only too well who it was.<br>
<br>
‘Dad must be staying here while he’s in town,’ he thought.  Chloe turned around to face him and looked for her car key on her key ring.  Lex frowned.  “What are you doing?”<br>
<br>
“Leaving,” she said bluntly.  “If I had any questions about whether to be here or not, they were just answered.”  Lex caught her arm as she took a step forward.<br>
<br>
“I’ll get rid of him,” he offered.  Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“As much as I ---” she shook her head.  “The only way you’d be able to get rid of him now is to kill him, and as attractive as that option might sound, it’s hardly conducive to setting a romantic mood.”  Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
“You’re probably right, but allow me to make a rebuttal before you go rushing off?”  He asked.  Chloe nodded once and Lex’s mind drifted to an image of the two of them together - naked and wrapped around each other as Lex was thrusting forcefully into her.  Chloe closed her eyes as the warmth of her arousal tingled through her body.  <br>
<br>
“Lex, don’t do this here,” she whimpered.  Lex took her in his arms and started to kiss her passionately as he let his image of them continue.  Chloe hands rested on his chest as they kissed and she could feel his length pressed up hard against her.<br>
<br>
‘Tell me you don’t want me,’ he thought.  ‘Tell me and I’ll let you leave.’  In their shared daydream, he could see she was almost at the point of release.  Chloe’s arms wove around his neck.<br>
<br>
‘Fine.  I don’t wa-  aaah,’ her thought turned into a small scream as her orgasm rolled over her.  Lex reached his own climax soon after and they rested their bodies against each other for support.<br>
<br>
‘That wasn’t terribly convincing,’ he finally teased.  Chloe smiled, but it fell as she looked up at him.<br>
<br>
‘I can’t stay.’<br>
<br>
‘I’ll get rid of him,’ Lex thought again.<br>
<br>
‘Lex ---’<br>
<br>
‘Hear me out.’<br>
<br>
‘The last time I did that, we ---’<br>
<br>
‘I’ll talk to him when you’re in the other room.  You can give me just enough information about the situation with Axis Chemicals to make him wonder where the leak in his organization is, and he’ll leave us alone to pursue it.’<br>
<br>
“Actually, that’s not a bad idea,” Chloe mused aloud.<br>
<br>
“Thank God,” Lex said under his breath.  “I thought I was going to have to carry you in there for a minute.”  Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
“You wouldn’t have,” she said.  Lex smirked at her and Chloe’s eyes narrowed as she thought of something.  ‘Just like he wouldn’t have driven over to Clark’s and claimed you in front of him,’ she thought.  Lex arched an eyebrow and Chloe took a step back from him.  “Lex, I think you’re being affected by the chemical more than I am; or at least in a different way.”  Lex took a step toward her and viewed her thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
“You seem to be pretty affected,” he said suggestively.  Chloe tilted her head and sidestepped him as he kept coming toward her.<br>
<br>
“That’s not what I meant,” she said.  “In all the time I’ve known you, which admittedly hasn’t been long; you’ve always kept your emotions in check – no matter what else is going on around you.”<br>
<br>
“And now?”  Lex asked as he caught hold of her.  He nibbled on her earlobe and Chloe had to force herself not to give into the sensations that emerged.<br>
<br>
“And now, it’s like you’re primal instinct guy,” she said.  Lex ran his tongue along the shell of her ear and Chloe tried to push him away.  <br>
<br>
“And that’s a bad thing?”  He asked huskily into her ear, causing goosebumps to cover her body.<br>
<br>
“It’s not bad ---” she paused when she felt his mouth on her neck again and his hand creeping up under her shirt.  “It’s just not you.”  ‘And I don’t want you to be pissed at me for taking advantage of you when this whole thing is taken care of and we’re back to normal,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘I don’t mind you taking advantage of me,’ Lex thought.  ‘I’m used to it; and it’s kind of a nice change that it’s not for my money this time.’  Chloe sighed in frustration and Lex pulled away, keeping his grip on her upper arms.  He looked at her seriously and Chloe closed her eyes as he spoke.  “If you really think that’s what’s going on, then I won’t push you into anything.  Alright?”  Chloe nodded.  “I *would* like your help with my dad though.  And seeing as how you’re the one with the information ---”  Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“No problem.  I can do that,” she said.  Lex grinned at her and they started walking toward the front door of the castle.  He held the door open for her and bit her lip.  How was she going to bring the topic up gracefully?  At least she didn’t have to say it aloud.  ‘Oh, and Lex?’<br>
<br>
‘Yes?’  He asked giving her a strange look.<br>
<br>
‘You might want to change your pants before you meet with him,’ she thought.  Lex briefly glanced down at the slacks he was wearing and then he pursed his lips.<br>
<br>
‘You’re a terrible influence; you realize that, don’t you?’  He joked.  Chloe smiled and started laughing.  <br>
<br>
‘If I am, then it’s only because I’ve been hanging around with you in my head for the last few days,’ she thought.  He smiled at her, but the smile quickly disappeared when he heard a familiar voice.<br>
<br>
“Son, aren’t you going to introduce me to your friend?”<br>
<br>

‘Oh – it’s the devil,’ Chloe thought.  She gritted her teeth and placed a wide fake smile on her face as she stepped in front of Lex.<br>
<br>
‘Thanks.’<br>
<br>
‘I didn’t mean it that way,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘Neither did I,’ Lex thought.  ‘I meant thanks for standing in front of me and blocking his view of my slacks.’<br>
<br>
‘Oh,’ Chloe thought in surprise.  ‘Yeah, sure.  No problem.  So, you weren’t offended by the devil comment?’<br>
<br>
‘Why would I be?’<br>
<br>
‘I ---’<br>
<br>
“Interesting,” Lionel said.  “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you speechless before, Lex,” Lionel said.<br>
<br>
“Not speechless Dad, just ignoring you.”  Lex gave him a small smirk and Lionel rested his tongue in the pocket of his mouth.<br>
<br>
“I certainly hope my son’s poor manners don’t rub off on you, young lady.”<br>
<br>
‘Too late,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Shut up.’  Another fake smile lit up Chloe’s face and she stuck out her hand.  “Sorry ---”<br>
<br>
‘Don’t apologize to him.’<br>
<br>
“Chloe Sullivan,” she greeted, ignoring Lex’s thoughts.<br>
<br>
“Lionel Luthor,” Lionel said, reaching out his hand to shake Chloe’s.  <br>
<br>
‘Eww.  Don’t touch him,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘*Eww*?  I didn’t think I’d ever hear that coming out of your mouth.’<br>
<br>
‘Technically you didn’t.’<br>
<br>
“Sullivan you said?  Are you related to the local plant manager by chance?”  Lionel asked, interrupting Chloe and Lex’s internal dialogue.<br>
<br>
“Her dad ---”<br>
<br>
“And the reason I’m here,” Chloe interrupted.  Lionel arched an inquisitive eyebrow at her.<br>
<br>
‘Plan?’<br>
<br>
‘I don’t know; papers or something,’ Chloe thought hurriedly.<br>
<br>
“Right.  Do you think you could wait a few minutes for those papers, Chloe?”  Lex asked as he placed a hand on her shoulder.  “I’d like to have a few words with my father first.”<br>
<br>
“Sure.  Knock yourself out,” Chloe said nonchalantly.  Lionel grinned almost leeringly at her sense of bravado and Chloe had to suppress a shudder from taking over her body.  ‘Or him.  Either way.’  Lex snickered and coughed into his hand to keep from laughing.  <br>
<br>
“I’ll be back shortly,” Lex said and walked past her and his dad quickly so he wouldn’t have to explain the damp area on his slacks.  Lionel followed behind him as they walked down one of the long hallways.<br>
<br>
“I don’t believe for a minute that she’s here because of some paperwork,” Lionel started.<br>
<br>
“No one’s asking you to,” Lex countered.<br>
<br>
“She’s quite attractive, and although Gabe Sullivan is usually a docile man, I can see him killing you if he were to find out that you were dating his daughter,” Lionel sneered, firm in the belief that he had the upper hand.<br>
<br>
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Lex said dryly.  “But, I think we both know what you really want to talk to me about, so why don’t you just get it over with while I get the paperwork that Chloe needs from my office?”<br>
<br>
‘Whoops,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘Whoops?’<br>
<br>
‘You’re the one who said you wanted to have a few words with him, not the other way around.  He’s sure to catch the slip,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘You’d think so, wouldn’t you?’<br>
<br>
“Yes,” Lionel said.  “And I’ve been meaning to ask you: how *did* you find out about Axis Chemicals anyway?”<br>
<br>
“You don’t really believe that I’d give up a source, do you?”<br>
<br>
‘Hey!  That’s my line!’  Chloe argued.<br>
<br>
‘Sorry, *sweetheart*.’<br>
<br>
‘Yeah, okay,’ Chloe thought in aggravation.  ‘I’m leaving now.’<br>
<br>
‘You promised to help,’ Lex reminded her.<br>
<br>
‘I can help you without physically being here.’<br>
<br>
‘Chloe,’ Lex half-whined.<br>
<br>
‘Lex,’ Chloe thought, mimicking his tone.<br>
<br>
‘I can keep you here by force if I need to,’ Lex told her.  Chloe scoffed and started to walk toward the front door.<br>
<br>
‘What are you going to do?  Have your security guards wrestle me to the ground?’<br>
<br>
‘No.  I’d prefer to do that myself.’<br>
<br>
“What are you smirking at?”  Lionel asked.  “Certainly you don’t think you’ve gotten a step up on me just because you have a few tidbits of information about my private business dealings?”  He tsked and Lex squared his jaw.<br>
<br>
‘Okay Chloe.  Whatever you have on my dad – spill it.’<br>
<br>
‘Whatever I have on your dad, or whatever I have on his dealings with Dobson and Axis Chemicals?  Because they’re completely separate issues and ---’<br>
<br>
‘Chloe,’ Lex thought in a warning tone.<br>
<br>
‘Fine,’ Chloe thought almost poutingly.  ‘Ted Dobson works for the EPA.  Axis Chemicals is a subsidiary of LuthorCorp, although it’s under about a zillion different shadow companies --- your dad’s good.  I had a hard time tracking down who was actually in charge and ---’<br>
<br>
‘Chloe?’<br>
<br>
‘Oh, right.  Turns out that Dobson is on your dad’s payroll too, although that shouldn’t come as a big surprise; and he’s been signing off on forged reports saying that the stuff they’re producing there has no toxic value whatsoever, when in reality, they’re basically poisoning the entire community.’<br>
<br>
‘How does that tie in with him coming to Smallville?’  Lex asked.  He and Lionel reached his office and Lex started digging around in his desk for something he could pass off as important papers.<br>
<br>
‘Ah, the best part,’ Chloe mused.  ‘You know how into meteor rocks I am?’<br>
<br>
‘Ye-ah,’ Lex thought hesitantly.  <br>
<br>
‘Some of the chemicals they’re experimenting with come from ground up meteor rocks.  In fact, since they started the project, which by the way they totally need to change the name of, many of the workers have mysteriously mutated or died.  Kind of cool, huh?’<br>
<br>
‘You think death is cool?’<br>
<br>
‘No!  No, I mean, the validation for my theory is cool,’ she thought.  Lex grinned at Chloe’s excited ramblings.<br>
<br>
‘What’s the name of the project?’<br>
<br>
‘*Excelsior*,’ Chloe thought and then rolled her eyes.  ‘Please.  They started pushing it when one of the workers developed some higher intellectual abilities when on a day trip to Smallville to visit family, but they obviously didn’t realize that not everyone reacts the same way.’  Lex stopped walking and gave his dad a measured glare.<br>
<br>
“Tell me about ‘project excelsior’ Dad,” Lex said coolly.  Lionel paled ever so slightly and he once again looked surprised that his son was able to come up with that much information.  “I’d love to hear your side of it before I turn you and Ted Dobson into the higher ups at the EPA.”  Lionel pursed his lips and Lex let a small smirk grace his lips.  ‘Don’t mess with the bull ---’<br>
<br>
‘You’ll get the horns,’ Chloe finished.  ‘That was my favorite line in The Breakfast Club.  Although, in this case, he would be messing with the cow since I’m female – and I would really prefer not to be referred to as a large, fat animal if you don’t mind.’  Lex’s smirk turned into a full smile as he felt the laughter begin to shake his body.  He forced it down and grabbed some blank paper.  He shoved it into an empty folder and smirked at his father once again.<br>
<br>
“I have to say, I expected better of you, Dad.”<br>
<br>
‘No you didn’t,’ Chloe thought.  Lex grinned and started to walk toward the door.<br>
<br>
“Oh, no wait.  That’s right.  I didn’t.”  He tilted his head at his father and Lionel stormed out of the room.  ‘Chloe?’<br>
<br>
‘Still here,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘Do you know how to get to my bedroom?’<br>
<br>
‘Number one, how would I know that?  Number two, that’s kind of presumptuous of you to think that ---’<br>
<br>
‘My father just left the office and it looks like he’s on the warpath.  He’ll be ready to strike out against me any way he can, and that involves ---’<br>
<br>
‘Oh,’ Chloe thought in understanding.  ‘Well, can’t I just duck into a closet or something?’<br>
<br>
‘Are you trying to kill my ego?’<br>
<br>
‘Depends.  Is it working?’  She quipped.  A wry grin quirked at Lex’s mouth as he knew just the way to keep her there.<br>
<br>
‘Do you remember that comment you made about ‘wrestling to the ground’?’  He asked.  Chloe’s eyes widened.<br>
<br>
‘Lex, don’t,’ she thought.  ‘At least wait for me to get out of the living room.’  Chloe blushed and she ran a hand over her face.  ‘Crap.  Please tell me you didn’t hear that.’  Lex chuckled and started on his way down the hall.  Chloe crashed into him and they fell to the ground with her on top.  <br>
<br>
“I thought you were in the living room,” he said.<br>
<br>
“I was bored,” she tried to explain.<br>
<br>
“So, you thought you’d take the opportunity to explore?”<br>
<br>
“Something like that,” she said.  Chloe blushed again when she realized that she was still lying on top of him and his hands were securing her there by grabbing at her hips.  “I should get up.”  She tried to push herself off of him, but Lex pulled her back down and rolled them over so that he was on top of her.<br>
<br>
‘Or not.’  <br>
<br>

Chloe let out a small laugh.<br>
<br>
‘Yeah, right,’ she thought sarcastically.  ‘Right here in the hallway.’  Lex smirked as he hovered over her and Chloe’s eyes grew wide.  “No.”  Lex lowered his mouth to hers and began to kiss her.  ‘Lex, I mean it,’ she thought as she tried to push him off of her.  <br>
<br>
‘Uh-huh,’ he thought in an unconvinced tone.  His tongue maneuvered its way into her mouth and Chloe felt her resolve melting away as the kiss deepened.  Her arms wound up around his back and he inadvertently started to grind against her through their clothing.  Chloe let out a small moan as Lex released her from the kiss and his mouth moved to her neck.  Her bare legs wrapped around his waist, hiking her skirt up her thighs, and Lex gently dug his teeth into the soft skin of her neck.  Chloe’s moaning deepened as Lex kept rocking himself against her.<br>
<br>
“We – aaah – can’t do this here,” she managed to get out.  Her nails scratched at his back over his shirt and Lex smirked before kissing his way down to her collarbone.<br>
<br>
‘Why?’<br>
<br>
‘Because we’re in the middle of a hallway?’  She thought as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.<br>
<br>
‘And?’  He moved one hand to push up her shirt and Chloe took in a swift gasp of air when she felt his tongue on her nipple.  <br>
<br>
“Lex.”  His name on her lips came out breathy and not at all how she intended.  ‘Argh!  It had to come out sounding like that.’<br>
<br>
‘How was it supposed to sound?’  Lex started to suckle her and roll her other nipple between his fingers.  Chloe started rubbing against him in an effort to seek release.  ‘That’s what I thought.’  Chloe whimpered and then tried to push him away again.  “Don’t tell me you don’t want this,” he murmured.<br>
<br>
‘I didn’t say that.  I just said that I don’t want it *here*,’ she thought.  Lex didn’t stop his attentions to her body and Chloe bit down on her lip before speaking aloud.  “We really have to stop.” <br>
<br>
‘No, we don’t.’<br>
<br>
“Yes, we do,” she said firmly and finally succeeded in pushing him off of her and rolling out from underneath him.  She sat up and fixed her bra, and then pulled her shirt down.  ‘Did it ever occur to you that we don’t have protection?’  <br>
<br>
‘Well ---’<br>
<br>
‘No.  Of course not,’ she interrupted.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe,” he said and ran his fingers up her leg.  Chloe closed her eyes and tried to will his husky tone out of his head.  Lex grinned at her stubborn determination.  “Fine.”  He stood up and Chloe was startled that he had agreed to not having sex with her so easily.<br>
<br>
“Really?”  She asked as she pushed herself up to a standing position.  ‘I can’t believe he doesn’t want to have sex with me,’ she thought in an almost relieved inner voice, temporarily forgetting that he could hear her.  The smirk on his face quickly reminded her.  “Shit.”  Lex took a few steps toward her, closing the small space between them.<br>
<br>
‘When did I think that?’  He taunted her.  <br>
<br>
‘Lex ---’<br>
<br>
Lex’s hands wove into her hair as he slammed his mouth against hers.  When he pulled away to breathe, he took in Chloe’s appearance almost lovingly.  Her heavy breathing, her swollen lips, her half-closed eyes, her frumpled clothing from the time they spent on the floor.  <br>
<br>
‘Oh, God.  I’m falling for her,’ he thought.  Chloe’s eyes shot open.<br>
<br>
“What?!”<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” Lex said.  Chloe eyed him warily.<br>
<br>
“What’s going on with you?  First you call me your girlfriend in front of Clark, and then you think ---”<br>
<br>
“You are,” Lex interrupted.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“My girlfriend,” he answered.  ‘Unless you make it a habit to sleep with men you’re not in a relationship with.’  <br>
<br>
‘You *know* I don’t,’ she thought, referring to the fact that he had just taken her virginity the other day.  She sighed and ran a hand through her hair when she saw the apologetic look on his face.  “Maybe I should go home.  The chemical is obviously affecting you more than me and ---”  Lex backed her against a wall and kissed her, effectively cutting off what she was saying.  She returned his kiss, but didn’t expect what was coming next.  <br>
<br>
Lex grabbed her ass and pulled her body upward as her back rested against the wall.  Chloe wrapped her legs around him and the material of her loose skirt fell back against her body.  Lex reached down with one hand, effectively unzipping his slacks and freeing himself, and then pushing Chloe’s underwear to the side before plunging himself into her.  It had all happened so quickly that Chloe didn’t have time to think about it until she felt him between her legs.  <br>
<br>
She was still sore from the previous day and she winced at the pain mixed with pleasure that his thrusting was causing.  The wall was digging into her back and she had no doubt that there would be a lovely set of bruises all over it by the end of the day.  Lex slowed and allowed Chloe to take over the rhythm.  She slowly rose and fell onto him, but the desire building between them was too great to keep the slower pace.  <br>
<br>
“Lex,” she gasped out as her pulled her away from the wall and manipulated their fall to the floor so that she was astride him and he was still inside her.  She started riding him, her face contorting in pleasure as he filled her.  Lex felt her inner walls clamp around him and as Chloe’s body started to shake with her orgasm, he found his own release.  Chloe closed her eyes and leaned down so she was lying on top of him.  <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Clark paced back and forth in his ‘fortress of solitude’ until he finally came to a decision.  It had been a good four hours since Chloe had left and by now she would be home with her dad and Lana probably having dinner.  He would be sure to reach her if he called over there – or so he thought.  He rushed over to the house and quickly dialed Chloe’s number.  He listened to it ring three times, impatiently thinking that if he used his super speed he could have been over at her house by then.<br>
<br>
“Hello?”  Lana answered.<br>
<br>
“Hey Lana, it’s Clark.  Is Chloe there?”<br>
<br>
“No.  I thought she was studying over at your house today?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but she and Lex left a long time ago,” Clark said, worriedly running a hand around the back of his neck.  <br>
<br>
“What was Lex doing there?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” Clark said hesitantly.  “I think that chemical spill is affecting them.”<br>
<br>
“I know!  They can read each other’s minds.  Isn’t that weird?”  Lana gushed, happy to finally have someone to talk to about it. <br>
<br>
“Yeah, it’s more than that though,” Clark said.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”  Lana asked innocently.<br>
<br>
“He, um – he came over and was kind of angry.”<br>
<br>
“Really?  They seemed to be getting along yesterday.”<br>
<br>
“They started fighting and he called her his girlfriend.”  Clark rushed the words out so quickly that Lana needed time to process what he said.<br>
<br>
“What?”  She asked with surprise.<br>
<br>
“I know!  And then he, uh – then he kissed her.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, my God,” Lana said.  “So, you think ---”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” Clark said.  “Maybe their hormones are being affected or something.  But you should have seen it, it was ---”<br>
<br>
“Clark, no offense, but I really don’t need that mental image right now,” Lana said.  ‘Or ever,’ she thought.  Clark blushed. <br>
<br>
“Yeah, sorry.”<br>
<br>
“So, she’s not there and she’s not home yet – do you think she’s with Lex?”  Lana asked in a now hushed voice.  Clark furrowed his brow until he realized that Chloe’s dad must be nearby.  <br>
<br>
“Maybe.  You think I should call over there?”<br>
<br>
“Do you think you could borrow the truck to drive over there?”  Lana asked.  “If  they’re as affected as you say they are, you might need to – break them apart or something, you know, before they do anything they might regret.”  Clark paled as Lana whispered the last part into the phone.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah,” was all he could get out.<br>
<br>
“Okay, I’ll see you soon,” she chirped, faking a smile for Gabe as he passed by her.  She hung up the phone and Clark felt his stomach sink.  <br>
<br>
He wanted to just run over there, but then there would be the inevitable questions about how he got there.  He took a deep breath and grabbed the truck keys off the key rack.  Heading toward the truck, he only hoped Lana was wrong.<br>
<br>

Lex grinned to himself as Chloe rested her head on his chest.  They had made their way to his bedroom a few hours ago and had pretty much spent the time exhausting themselves with their lovemaking.  <br>
<br>
“Don’t let me fall asleep,” she mumbled before closing her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Okay,” he lied and lightly stroked his fingers over her hair.  He just started to nod off himself when there was a rather abrupt knock at the door.  ‘If that’s my dad, I’m killing him.’  Chloe nodded slightly and rolled over on the bed, snuggling her head up to the pillow instead of Lex.  Lex crawled out of bed and hastily threw a pair of slacks on before going to answer the door.  He opened the door and frowned at his butler.  “What?”  He half-way snapped at the man.<br>
<br>
“Clark Kent is here to see ---”  He trailed off and cleared his throat as he motioned into the bedroom.  Lex squared his jaw.<br>
<br>
“No,” he said and started to close the door.<br>
<br>
“He was quite insistent, sir.  I doubt he’ll simply go away without an explanation.”<br>
<br>
Lex inwardly groaned and Chloe sleepily started to get out of bed, wrapping one of the sheets around herself for cover.  <br>
<br>
‘Don’t,’ Lex thought, hearing her motions behind him.<br>
<br>
‘It’s okay Lex.  It’s almost dinner time.  I should be getting home anyway.’<br>
<br>
‘We have food here,’ Lex argued.  Chloe rolled her eyes and reached down to grab her scattered clothes off the floor.  She flashed a blushing smile to the butler, who seemed to be trying hard not to look at her.<br>
<br>
“Tell him I’ll be down in a little bit,” she said.  The butler nodded and hurried away from the door as if his life depended on it.  Lex closed the door and frowned at her as she slipped into her clothing.<br>
<br>
“I wish you hadn’t done that,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Lex ---”<br>
<br>
“He’s going to want you to leave with him.”<br>
<br>
“I brought my own car, remember?”<br>
<br>
“I know, but he’s still going to want you to leave.”<br>
<br>
“And I *should* be leaving,” Chloe said.  “So, it’s not a big deal.  We’ll see each other at the lab tomorrow morning anyway.”  She smiled at him and then gave him a kiss on the cheek as she reached over to open the door.  Lex caught her wrist and stared almost menacingly at her.  She furrowed her brow.<br>
<br>
‘Mine,’ he thought.  Chloe couldn’t resist rolling her eyes.<br>
<br>
“No,” she stated.  “Remember?  We agreed that we’re just being affected by the chemical and ---”  Lex moved his hand into her hair and Chloe’s eyes drifted shut.  “Lex ---”  In one swift movement, his mouth was on hers, his lips coaxing and persuading hers to open for him.  “Mmm.”  Their tongues wove together and her hands went up to his shoulders.  Lex had just started backing her toward the bed when there was another loud knock on the door.  She pulled away from him and he cursed under his breath as he went to open the door again.<br>
<br>
“What?!”  He yelled in aggravation before seeing who was on the other side of the door.  Chloe’s eyes grew wide and her cheeks started to color when she saw who it was.<br>
<br>
“Clark,” she greeted with an uneasy and forced smile.  “I was just on my way down.”<br>
<br>
Clark desperately wanted to say ‘no you weren’t’, but then he would have to admit to being able to see through doors.  Instead, he settled for scowling at Lex and speaking curly to Chloe.<br>
<br>
“It’s time to go.  Lana and your dad are worried that you’re not home for dinner yet,” he said, extending his hand for her to take it.  She looked at Lex.<br>
<br>
‘Uh-oh.  He’s pissed.’<br>
<br>
‘So?’<br>
<br>
‘How did he get up here so quickly?  The butler just left.’<br>
<br>
‘Adrenaline works wonders on him,’ Lex thought, tongue-in-cheek. <br>
<br>
“Okay, I brought my car,” Chloe said to Clark.  “So, I’ll ---”  She trailed off as she followed Clark’s intent stare at the messed up bed, and then she winced.  ‘Shit.’  Clark looked back and forth between Chloe and Lex and his face drained of any color that had been left in it.  Lex tried to ignore his reaction.<br>
<br>
“No,” Lex said, bringing Clark’s attention back to him.  “She’s not leaving.”  ‘Ever.’<br>
<br>
‘Don’t start,’ Chloe warned him.  She gave a small sigh and then smiled nervously at Clark.  “Lex is being affected --- differently by the chemical and ---” Clark growled, effectively cutting off whatever else Chloe was going to say.  He stared angrily at Lex and took a threatening step toward him.<br>
<br>
“You took advantage of her,” he said.  His volume was low, but the underlying threat was received loud and clear.<br>
<br>
“No, I ---”<br>
<br>
“No, he didn’t Clark,” Chloe interrupted, placing her hand on his arm in an effort to stop him from getting closer to Lex.  Lex saw her hand on Clark’s arm and snapped.<br>
<br>
“Stop touching him!”  He yelled at Chloe.<br>
<br>
Clark was startled by Lex’s outburst and looked at his friend with concern.<br>
<br>
‘Lex, now *really* isn’t the time to start wigging out,’ she thought.  ‘If he thinks you took advantage of me, he’ll kill you.’  She turned her attention to Clark again, but made sure she had removed her hand from his arm.  “Like I said, he’s being affected by the chemical.  It seems to have made him more --- primal.”  Clark looked at the bed and then at her.<br>
<br>
“Did he – did you ---?”<br>
<br>
“He didn’t rape me, Clark.  He wouldn’t do that.”<br>
<br>
“But you said the chemical – and why else would you – you know?”  Clark stammered.  Chloe closed her eyes for a second.<br>
<br>
“We’re both being affected.  You already knew that,” she explained.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but I didn’t know you were sleeping with him because of it,” Clark argued.  He frowned at his own inability to let the situation go.  It wasn’t Chloe and Lex’s fault that they were being influenced by some chemical, but he had a feeling they would both blame him for not breaking things up earlier once they were cured.  “Come home.  You guys are getting it fixed in the morning, and staying here might not be the best idea given the circumstances.”<br>
<br>
His head whipped around when he heard a feral growl come from Lex’s throat.  He knew that Lex couldn’t hurt him, but that didn’t make him any less intimidating.<br>
<br>
“Lex, think about it,” Clark said.  “You have to let her go home, have some dinner, and get some sleep.  You guys are going to the lab early tomorrow and ---”<br>
<br>
“You think I don’t know what you’re doing, Clark?”  Lex asked.  “You tried to take her away from me.  You’re still trying to take her away from me.”<br>
<br>
‘And here we go again,’ Chloe thought.<br>
<br>
‘Chloe ---”<br>
<br>
“I’m not *yours* Lex.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, you are.”<br>
<br>
“No, I’m not.”<br>
<br>
Clark frowned as he listened to them argue.  Chloe sounded tired and worn down, like they had the same argument several times before – which, Clark realized, they probably had if Lex was being as affected by the chemical as it looked like he was.  <br>
<br>
“Guys ---”<br>
<br>
“Shut up Clark,” they both said at once.  Clark’s eyebrows rose in surprise at their tone and the fact that they had said the same thing at the same time.  It was more than a little disconcerting.  <br>
<br>
“It’s time to go,” he told Chloe again.  <br>
<br>
‘Don’t you see what he’s doing, Chloe?  I swear I’ll kill him if he ---’<br>
<br>
‘If I stay, you have to promise not to hurt him,’ Chloe interrupted.  Lex’s rage boiled up inside of him.  Even though she would be staying, she was essentially choosing Clark over him because she would only be staying to keep Clark out of harm’s reach. <br>
<br>
“I’m not promising anything,” he said sternly.  <br>
<br>
“Lex,” she started to protest, but was suddenly overcome with a wave of dizziness that almost knocked her to the ground.<br>
<br>
“Chloe?”  Lex asked in concern.  He had heard her thoughts trail off, and it worried him.  The concern grew when she seemed to lose her balance and began to fall to the floor.  Clark was closer and he caught her, but when he tried to stand her back up, they both realized that Chloe’s eyes were shut and she was unconscious.  “Chloe?”  Lex repeated with a little more urgency in his voice.  ‘Talk to me.’<br>
<br>
No words came from her mouth and no thoughts came from her mind.  Lex shot Clark a panicked expression.<br>
<br>
“I can’t hear her,” he said almost fearfully.  Clark frowned and carried her to the bed.  He lay her down upon it and then looked at Lex.<br>
<br>
“Maybe it’s just wearing off,” Clark suggested.  <br>
<br>
“She wouldn’t have passed out if it was just wearing off,” Lex said.<br>
<br>
“You don’t know that,” Clark pointed out.<br>
<br>
“If that’s the case, then why didn’t *I* pass out?”  Lex countered.  Clark frowned.  He didn’t have an explanation for that.  Clark noticed it first.  As he watched Chloe’s chest rise and fall, her breathing became progressively slower and shallower.  And then it stopped altogether.<br>
<br>
“She’s stopped breathing,” Clark said in a fearful voice.  Lex called for an ambulance immediately and Clark tried to do mouth to mouth resuscitation on her.  Lex managed to bite back whatever jealousy he was feeling over Clark’s lips touching Chloe’s, reminding himself that he was only trying to save Chloe’s life.  Unfortunately, it didn’t seem to be working<br>
<br>
Lex ran a hand over the back of his neck as he watched on.  It scared him to see her lying there, not moving, not breathing, not thinking.  For the first time since the accident had first occurred, he would have given anything to hear her voice in his head.<br>

<br>
“The purpose of dinner is to actually *eat* the food in front of you,” he teased. <br>
<br>
“Sorry.  My mind is somewhere else tonight,” she said.<br>
<br>
“You’re worried about Chloe,” he observed.  Lana paled, wondering how much Chloe’s dad actually knew about what was going on.<br>
<br>
“I ---”<br>
<br>
“Lana, if there’s one thing I know about my daughter, it’s that she’s a big girl.  And in most cases she can take care of herself.  I’m sure she’s just trying to brainstorm a way to write about what’s happened to her --- and driving Lex completely out of his mind.”  He said the last part with a smile and Lana forced a grin onto her lips.<br>
<br>
‘Either that or they’re --- it’s a good thing Mr. Sullivan can’t read my mind,’ Lana thought.  <br>
<br>
The phone rang, snapping Lana out of her thoughts, and she practically jumped out of her chair to get it.  Gabe shook his head lightly in amusement.<br>
<br>
‘Teenagers,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
“Hello?  Sullivan residence,” Lana answered.<br>
<br>
“Lana – it’s Clark,” Clark said hurriedly.  Lana’s face fell and she turned away so Gabe couldn’t see the worried expression that she was sure now commanded her facial features.<br>
<br>
“What happened?”  She asked in a quieter voice.  “Did you get there in time?”  Lana cast a weary glance in Gabe’s direction, but he was thankfully concentrating on the food in front of him.<br>
<br>
“Chloe – she stopped breathing.  Mouth to mouth didn’t work.  The paramedics were able to get her heart beating again, but ---”<br>
<br>
“What?!”  Lana asked in panic.  Gabe’s head turned quickly in Lana’s direction and he looked at her questioningly.<br>
<br>
“She’s at the hospital now, but she hasn’t woken up.”  Clark paused and Lana could practically see the apprehensive look on his face.  “Lex says he can’t hear her,” Clark said somberly.  Lana suddenly felt ill and the phone dropped from her hand.  Gabe got up from his chair and put a steadying arm around her back as she tried to sink down to the floor herself.  He moved her to the chair and she sat down.  “Lana?  Are you still there?”  Gabe picked up the phone.<br>
<br>
“Hello?”<br>
<br>
Clark cringed when he heard Gabe’s voice come through the receiver.<br>
<br>
“Hey – hi – it’s Clark,” the young man stammered.  He took a deep breath and then released the words he needed to say in a rushed blur.  “Chloe’s in the hospital.”<br>
<br>
“What?  How did this happen?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know.  We were talking and she just --- collapsed.  Then she stopped breathing.  They had to use those electric paddle things to get her heart started again, and ---” Clark rambled emotionally and Gabe now knew the reason Lana had almost fainted.  <br>
<br>
“Clark?”  Gabe asked, cutting the boy off.  “Where is she now?”<br>
<br>
“The hospital.  They’re running tests.  Lex thinks it might have something to do with that chemical that they were exposed to.”<br>
<br>
“Okay,” Gabe said with a calm he didn’t possess.  “We’re leaving now.  We’ll meet you there.”  He hung up the phone without saying goodbye and then grabbed his keys off the key holder.  Lana stood up and followed him out to the car in a complete daze. <br>
<br>
She couldn’t believe this was happening.  She mentally berated herself for being so concerned about what Chloe and Lex might have been doing when it seemed so trivial now.  From what Clark had said; Chloe had technically died.  When a person stops breathing and their heart stops beating – that’s death.  Lana wrapped her arms around herself for the duration of the ride to the hospital.  Not only had Chloe died and been revived, but now she wasn’t waking up, and Lex couldn’t hear her in his head.  She wasn’t sure why that last part bothered her so much, but it did.  Because it meant that although Chloe’s body was still there, that Chloe might not be.<br>
<br>
Clark watched them come in through the emergency entrance and he walked over to them.  He and Lana hugged, but it was obvious it was just for mutual comfort.<br>
<br>
“Any news?”  Gabe asked.  Clark shoved his hands in his pockets and shook his head.<br>
<br>
“They need to get your permission to send some of Chloe’s blood out for additional testing in Metropolis, but she hasn’t woken up yet,” Clark said.  His eyes briefly lit up.  “Oh!  But she’s breathing on her own now, so the doctors are optimistic.”  Gabe paled.  He didn’t realize there had been a point where his daughter hadn’t been breathing on her own past the initial moment of collapsing.  <br>
<br>
“Can we see her?”  Lana asked.  Clark looked uneasy and Lana looked at him questioningly.<br>
<br>
“They wouldn’t let me or Lex in to see her,” he said and then looked at Gabe, “but you’re family, so they might let you in.”  Gabe nodded once and then left Clark and Lana alone while he went to talk to someone behind the admissions desk.<br>
<br>
“It’s bad, isn’t it?”  Lana asked quietly.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah.”<br>
<br>
“Do you really think it has something to do with the chemical they were exposed to?”  <br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” Clark said.  “Maybe.  But it seems like if that was the case, then Lex would be sick too.”  <br>
<br>
Lana looked at the floor and fidgeted with her hands.  <br>
<br>
“Did you – I mean, did they ---?”  She trailed off and looked imploringly at Clark, hoping he would know what she was talking about.  She felt bad for even bringing it up, but if they had then there was a chance that it might have something to do with why Chloe was sick.  ‘Okay, that’s reaching,’ she thought.  But stranger things had certainly happened in Smallville.  Clark blushed and ducked his head.<br>
<br>
“I – um – don’t know for sure,” he said.  &quot;When I got there, they were kissing and ---” Clark paused while he ran his hand around the back of his neck.<br>
<br>
“And?”<br>
<br>
“And Lex didn’t have a shirt on,” he said in a hushed voice.<br>
<br>
“Oh.”  Lana crinkled up her nose and caught Clark’s eyes with her own.  “Well, that doesn’t mean anything.  Maybe you got there just in time.”  Her tone was entirely too hopeful and Clark couldn’t bear to tell her that the heavy musky smell that had been in Lex’s bedroom would suggest otherwise.<br>
<br>
“Maybe,” he said, forcing a fake half-smile onto his lips.  <br>
<br>
Gabe came back over to them and motioned to the hallway that led to the elevators.<br>
<br>
“They’ll let us in now, but only for a little while,” he said.  Lana looked relieved and Clark looked worried.<br>
<br>
“What about Lex?”  He asked.  Gabe glanced around the ER’s waiting area.<br>
<br>
“Where is he?”<br>
<br>
“He went to get coffee,” Clark said and then smiled when Lex came back through the doors he had seen him leave through.  Lex walked over to them with a cup-holder holding four coffees.  Gabe arched an eyebrow and Lex curled up one corner of his mouth in a sad grin.<br>
<br>
“I figured you and Lana would get here while it was still hot,” Lex explained.  Gabe grinned gratefully at him.<br>
<br>
“They’re going to let us in to see her,” Clark said, interrupting the silence that settled upon the group as each person took a coffee from the holder.  Lex gave him a somewhat blank stare in disbelief.  <br>
<br>
Why hadn’t Clark just told him that the second he came over?  Lex turned on his heel and started walking toward the elevators without waiting for the rest of them.  Clark turned to Gabe, who seemed surprised by Lex’s actions.<br>
<br>
“He’s been --- worried,” Clark explained.  ‘Obsessive, angry, crazy,’ he immediately added inwardly.  Gabe nodded and the three of them set off for the elevators as well.<br>
<br>
They reached Chloe’s room and Lex winced when he saw her hooked up to the machines.  He still couldn’t hear her voice in his head, and tried to make himself believe that there was a possibility that Clark was right about the chemical reaction wearing off, but it didn’t work.  Gabe started talking to her, convinced by the doctors that Chloe could somehow hear him in her comatose state.  Clark went next and uttered a string of apologies that Lex just wanted to kill him for.  And then it was Lana’s turn.  The poor girl actually had tears in her eyes as she sat down in the chair next to Chloe’s bed.<br>
<br>
“You can’t leave, Chloe,” she said with overwrought emotion.  “Everyone always leaves me.  My parents, Whitney --- I can’t lose you too.  Please wake up.”  Gabe and Clark seemed sympathetic to Lana’s speech, but Lex suddenly heard a familiar voice in his head.<br>
<br>
‘Oh, God.  Shut up, shut up, shut up!’  Chloe thought.  ‘They didn’t *leave* you!  They died!  There’s a difference!’<br>
<br>
Lex couldn’t help himself.  A broad smile spread across his lips and he started laughing loudly – partially because of what Chloe had thought and partially out of relief that he could hear her again.  Lana, Clark, and Gabe all gave him strange and almost horrified looks.  He managed to pull himself together enough to talk to her.<br>
<br>
‘God!  Don’t ever do that to me again, Chloe,’ he thought warningly.<br>
<br>
‘Why?  You have a nice laugh,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘That’s not what I meant and you know it.’<br>
<br>
‘Prove it,’ she thought teasingly.  He chuckled again and Clark, Lana, and Gabe continued to stare at him.<br>
<br>
‘You’re getting me in trouble, Sullivan.’<br>
<br>
‘It’s not my fault you have a good sense of humor,’ she countered.  Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
‘You’re only saying that because it’s the same as yours.’<br>
<br>
‘Yep.’<br>
<br>
‘But I meant what I said,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
‘Lex ---’ <br>
<br>
‘I was scared,’ he admitted.  ‘And Luthors don’t get scared.’<br>
<br>
‘I’m not sure what to say.’<br>
<br>
‘You don’t have to say anything,’ he thought.  ‘Chloe, there’s something you should know.  I think I lo---’<br>
<br>
Lex was so engaged in his inner conversation with Chloe that it took him a minute before he realized that Clark had been trying to get his attention.<br>
<br>
“You can hear her again, can’t you?”  Clark asked hopefully, cutting off Lex’s thoughts.  Lex nodded and Clark gave him a lopsided grin.  “I don’t suppose you could tell her to wake up?”<br>
<br>
‘I don’t suppose you could tell him to go away so I can take a nap in peace?’  <br>
<br>
‘Tell him yourself.’<br>
<br>
‘Spoilsport.’  Chloe’s eyes started to flutter open and Lana gave her a smothering hug.  ‘Air – need – air.’  Lex chuckled and watched as Gabe and Clark gave her hugs as well, only barely restraining the growl he felt from coming out when Clark hugged her.  Chloe smiled weakly at them.  “Hey,” she said in a raspy and whispered voice.<br>
<br>
One of the doctors chose that precise moment to walk into the room, surprised by the amount of people surrounding the patient, and even more surprised that Chloe was now awake.  <br>
<br>
“How are you feeling?”  He finally managed to ask.<br>
<br>
“Okay.”<br>
<br>
‘Really?’  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
‘No, but I’m not telling him that.  He’ll want to keep me here longer.’<br>
<br>
‘He’ll want to do that anyway.’<br>
<br>
The doctor glanced at the paperwork on the clipboard in front of him and a small, concerned frown graced his lips.  He looked at her visitors.<br>
<br>
“I need to talk to Chloe alone, so if you all ---”<br>
<br>
‘The hell you do,’ Lex thought, shooting daggers at the man with his eyes.<br>
<br>
‘Calm down.  He’s just the doctor.’<br>
<br>
‘But ---’<br>
<br>
Chloe smiled warmly at him and Lex’s resolve melted away.  He nodded once.<br>
<br>
“We’ll be in the hall,” he said.<br>
<br>
“There’s a waiting area just a few doors down,” the doctor said.  “I’m sure it will be more comfortable.”  Lex squared his jaw.<br>
<br>
‘Tell me again why I shouldn’t kill him?’<br>
<br>
The doctor, oblivious to Chloe and Lex’s inner conversations, grinned at her visitors.  Clark tugged on Lex’s arm to get him to leave the room and the doctor could have sworn he heard an animalistic growl come reverberate from Lex’s throat.  After they left, the doctor shut the door and took a breath before making eye contact with Chloe.<br>
<br>
“Something came up on your blood work with the tests we ran here, but I suspect you already knew that,” he said.  Chloe barely nodded.  <br>
<br>
‘Great.  The stupid chemical is in my blood and they’re going to ship me off to a government facility to determine if I’m an alien,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘What?’<br>
<br>
‘Not really.  At least I hope not.’  Chloe forced herself to concentrate on the doctor as he continued to speak.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, I know that it must have been hard to accept the results, but I hope you know that no matter what else is going on, there are options.”<br>
<br>
‘What the hell is he talking about?’  She thought.<br>
<br>
“There’s always adoption, or even abortion if ---”<br>
<br>
“What?!”<br>
<br>
The doctor gave her a strange look and Chloe shook her head.<br>
<br>
“I think you guys mixed up my results with someone else’s,” she said.  The doctor looked through the paperwork again and then shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Chloe Sullivan,” he read.  “High HCG levels accompanied by an unknown substance presumed to be a toxin.”  Chloe’s eyes widened.<br>
<br>
“But ---”<br>
<br>
“Listen, your near experience with death may have been enough to make you reevaluate things, but I’m not willing to take chances on your life or your baby’s, so I’m putting you on suicide watch for the next forty-eight hours.”<br>
<br>
Chloe’s mouth dropped open and the doctor turned around to leave the room.<br>
<br>
“This isn’t happening, this isn’t happening,” she repeated to herself in a mantra-like form.<br>
<br>
‘What isn’t happening?’<br>
<br>
‘They’re putting me on suicide watch,’ she thought, carefully bypassing the rest of the news.<br>
<br>
‘Why?’<br>
<br>
‘Apparently they think I tried to kill myself because that stupid chemical leeched into my blood.’<br>
<br>
‘I’ll talk to them,’ Lex offered.<br>
<br>
“No!”<br>
<br>

Chloe sighed and ran a hand through her hair, quickly regretting it when her IV cord got stuck between the bed and its railing.  It yanked at her hand and she gritted her teeth in pain as she fixed it.<br>
<br>
‘Ugh!  Stupid IV,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘Chloe ---’<br>
<br>
“They messed up my results with someone else’s, alright?”  She snapped at him aloud.  <br>
<br>
‘All the more reason to talk to them about it,’ he thought.  Chloe snickered and she could practically see the questioning look on Lex’s face.<br>
<br>
‘Sorry, you sounded like the big bad wolf from ‘Little Red Riding Hood’,’ she explained.  Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
‘Interesting.  I’ve been referred to as the spawn of the devil, but never as the big bad wolf.’<br>
<br>
‘I didn’t call you the big bad wolf; I just said you sounded like him.’<br>
<br>
‘What did the test results say?’  He asked, steering the topic back to the original conversation.<br>
<br>
‘They think I’m pregnant and that I tried to kill myself using some kind of poison because of it,’ she said dryly.  ‘Do you ever wish the people in this town weren’t such fucking morons?’<br>
<br>
‘Constantly,’ he thought.  ‘And you can’t be pregnant.’<br>
<br>
‘No shit Sherlock.  What tipped you off?  The fact that we only had protected sex or that we only started having it yesterday?’<br>
<br>
‘Hmm, better not mention that,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Mention what?’<br>
<br>
‘Nothing,’ he lied.  ‘Why don’t you let me talk to them?  I think they’ll actually let *me* get a word in edge-wise.’<br>
<br>
‘Okay.’<br>
<br>
‘You’re agreeing with me?’  Lex asked with surprise.<br>
<br>
‘Well, yeah.  I want to go home,’ she pointed out.  Lex chuckled.<br>
<br>
‘I should have known you’d have some form of ulterior motive for sicking me on them,’ he quipped.  There was a moment of silence and Lex grinned.  ‘What?  No witty retort?’  More silence followed and Lex started to worry.  ‘Chloe?’<br>
<br>
A siren sound could be heard down the hallway and Lex looked around the corner of the waiting room to see what the commotion was.  Members of the hospital staff were running into Chloe’s room and Lex felt his heart sink.  <br>
<br>
The doctor was able to bring her heartbeat back, but he had a feeling that his patient was going to die during her stay there.  <br>
<br>
Lex cornered him the minute he got out of Chloe’s room and the doctor was taken aback by the furious look on the younger man’s features.<br>
<br>
“This is *your* fault,” Lex said through clenched teeth, trying desperately not to let his fists do the talking for him.<br>
<br>
“Sir ---”<br>
<br>
“Instead of running all of the tests that you *should have* been running, you assumed by looking at one blood test that she was pregnant and suicidal – of which, she is neither.”<br>
<br>
“B-but --- how did you know that?”<br>
<br>
“There was a chemical spill at the plant.  Chloe and I were both exposed to it and now have a temporary telepathic bond, and no, I’m not making this up so don’t bother calling your resident psychiatrist,” Lex said coolly.  His patience had just run out.  “My specialists will be taking over from here on in.  Expect a phone call from your hospital’s administrator.”  Lex turned on his heel and left the man standing there with his mouth gaping open in shock from the bizarre verbal assault.<br>
<br>
It didn’t take long before Lex’s specialists got there.  They did a series of tests on both Chloe and Lex and came up with results that startled the original doctor on the case.  He apologized to Lex and to Gabe for jumping to the wrong conclusions, but Lex disregarded him and went to talk with the doctors he had hired.<br>
<br>
Lex rubbed his temples with his fingers to try and ease some of the pain that his head was feeling.  He had been listening to his so-called experts explain things for the last half-hour and he still only grasped a small part of what they were saying.  He never had liked doctors.<br>
<br>
“Can you fix it or not?!”  He snapped.  The doctors looked apprehensively at each other.<br>
<br>
“Well, it could be difficult.  As we were saying, the chemical seems to have taken root in your bodies differently.  In your body, it has heightened your testosterone levels to --- well, it’s a good thing you don’t have any hair because it would be gone with the levels being this high,” one of the men said.  Lex glared at him and another doctor continued.<br>
<br>
“And, in Miss Sullivan’s body, it has not only heightened her estrogen levels, but actually transformed them into an entirely new compound that we’ve never seen before.  It closely mimics HCG on the mechanized blood tests, but when seen under a microscope, well --- it’s really quite fascinating.”<br>
<br>
“Unfortunately,” the third specialist said, “this new compound seems to be attacking the part of her brain that’s responsible for unprovoked neurological responses, such as telling the heart to beat or the lungs to breathe.”<br>
<br>
“Can you fix it?”  Lex repeated, barely keeping his anger in check.  The doctors looked at each other and then shook their heads.<br>
<br>
“In time, I’m sure we’ll be able to come up with something.”<br>
<br>
“How much time?”  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
“Too much for your friend to live,” one of the doctors finally admitted.  <br>
<br>
“But there’s always a possibility that the compound may change, may stop attacking her,” another man said.  “We don’t know anything about it, so we can’t say for sure.”<br>
<br>
Lex stood up and pumped his hands in and out of fists.  He scowled dangerously at them and released a feral growl that made each of the three men take a step back.<br>
<br>
“Just fix it,” he said in a threatening voice.  “Because if Chloe dies, so do you.”<br>

<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
A consoling grin curled up one corner of Gabe’s mouth when he saw that Lex was still in the chair next to Chloe’s hospital bed.  The young man hadn’t left the hospital since Chloe had been rushed there – instead, he had some clothes and personal affects brought over and was basically living in Chloe’s upgraded room.  Lex didn’t seem to notice Gabe in the doorway and Gabe cleared his throat.<br>
<br>
“You know, I’m not sure I approve of you and my daughter living together at her age,” Gabe said in a teasing voice.  Lex’s head snapped around in his direction and he couldn’t hide the look of surprise that graced his face.  What Gabe didn’t know was that the surprise was more because of his comment than his presence there at all.  Lex quickly recovered and forced a fake grin to shoot back at the man.<br>
<br>
“I’d like your approval, but I don’t need it.  Sixteen is the legal age of consent in Kansas,” Lex quipped, mimicking Gabe’s previous tone.  Much to Lex’s relief, Gabe chuckled and walked into the room.  He stood on the other side of the bed and looked down at his daughter, his face falling into a stoic expression; but Lex knew from his own experience that it was only a defense mechanism Gabe was using to keep from completely breaking down.<br>
<br>
‘You’d better not be talking to him about what it sounds like you’re talking about,’ Chloe thought, only catching the very last part of what her dad said and then what  Lex responded with as she woke up.  Lex let out a breath of relief and grabbed her hand.<br>
<br>
‘It would be really great if you’d stop dying on me,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
‘Yeah, cuz’ it’s my fault and everything,’ she replied sarcastically.  Lex smiled.<br>
<br>
“Have the doctors ---?”  Gabe trailed off when his eyes drifted up from his daughter and caught Lex holding her hand and staring at her.  An uncomfortable feeling crawled across Gabe’s skin and settled in his gut.  He knew the look on Lex’s face only too well.  He cleared his throat, but Lex didn’t look up at him.<br>
<br>
‘Have the doctors --- *what*?’  Chloe asked suspiciously.<br>
<br>
“I’ll tell you if you open your eyes,” Lex said.  Gabe blinked a couple of times in surprise.  Maybe he had misread Lex’s previous expression; maybe Lex was just pleased because he could obviously hear Chloe’s thoughts again.  <br>
<br>
‘Although, I’m not sure why he would be so happy about that,’ he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
“Spoilsport,” Chloe mumbled in a groggy voice as she started to open her eyes.  She squinted them and held up her hand to block the harsh light that lit the room.  Without saying a word, Gabe quickly walked over and shut off the lights – only allowing the light from the hallway to temper the darkness of her hospital room.  “Thanks, Dad.”  She turned her head to the side and looked at Lex.  “So, the doctors ---?”  Lex and Gabe shared a reluctant glance at each other and Chloe narrowed her eyes.  “What?”  She asked suspiciously.<br>
<br>
“Um, the thing is sweetheart,” Gabe started, running a hand around the back of his neck nervously.<br>
<br>
‘*Sweetheart*,’ Lex thought, trying to lighten Chloe’s mood before the news was dropped on her.<br>
<br>
‘*Dumpling*,’ she retorted and then looked at her dad expectantly.  “The thing is ---?”<br>
<br>
“Um --- Lex?”<br>
<br>
‘Coward,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘I dare you to say that to his face.’<br>
<br>
‘I think I’ll pass on that one.  I have a feeling that he would kick me out of your room.’<br>
<br>
‘Probably,’ Chloe agreed.  Lex looked her in the eye and she almost cringed at the seriousness that was etched on his face.  She sighed.  “Just tell me.”<br>
<br>
“The chemical we were exposed to – you were right,” Lex said.  Chloe arched an eyebrow, urging him to continue.  “It’s affected both of us.”  Chloe nodded once.  <br>
<br>
“More than the telepathy thing.  Yeah, I had a feeling,” she said as she tried to push herself up to a sitting position.  Lex grinned and pushed the button on the bed railing that would raise the upper portion of the bed.  “Thanks.  So, what gives?”  Lex and Gabe shared another look and Chloe sank back against the bed.  “Why do I have a bad feeling about this?”  Gabe sighed and moved to sit down on the edge of her bed.<br>
<br>
“We don’t know how, but somehow the chemical has tapped into the glands that produce your hormones,” he said.  A glint of a smile played at Chloe’s lips.<br>
<br>
“So, what?  I’m just going to be all PMS-y all the time?”  She joked.<br>
<br>
“Uh, not exactly,” Gabe said.  “You see, in Lex, it increased his levels of testosterone ---”  Chloe cut her dad off with an amused snicker and Lex grinned at her.<br>
<br>
‘Why does that not surprise me?”  She thought.<br>
<br>
‘I can’t imagine,’ Lex replied sarcastically.<br>
<br>
“In you, however,” Gabe started speaking again.  “Instead of just raising one of the hormones that your body naturally produces, it has managed to change the hormone altogether.  It combined with the estrogen in your body to make a new compound, and ---” Gabe turned his face away, not wanting to let Chloe see the tears forming in his eyes.<br>
<br>
“It’s killing you,” Lex finished for him.  Gabe closed his eyes for a second and Chloe saw a single tear roll down his face.<br>
<br>
“O-kay,” she strung out.  “That’s bad.”<br>
<br>
“It is,” Lex agreed.  “And despite my threats, so far the doctors haven’t been able to come up with a way to help you.”<br>
<br>
‘Your threats, huh?’  Chloe inwardly chuckled.  ‘What did you tell them?  Or do I even want to know?’<br>
<br>
‘The usual,’ Lex thought in a light-hearted tone, ‘I’m the son of the devil, he’ll come after your souls - that sort of thing.’<br>
<br>
‘Using your dad as a threat --- interesting.  *And* well played I might add.’<br>
<br>
‘Thank you, thank you.’<br>
<br>
“Sweetheart, I’m so sorry,” Gabe said in a choked voice, bringing Chloe’s attention back to him.<br>
<br>
‘He’s not going to start actively crying, is he?’  Chloe asked.  <br>
<br>
‘It looks like it.’<br>
<br>
‘Well, can you just lie to him and tell him the doctors will fix it or something?’<br>
<br>
‘I doubt he’d believe me,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘I don’t know --- you can be pretty convincing when you want to be.’  <br>
<br>
Her sudden sexual undertones didn’t escape Lex’s attention and he smirked at her.<br>
<br>
‘You too,’ he thought, copying her tone while rubbing the pad of his thumb in circles on the top of her hand.  God, he had missed this.  The last few days had been torture, but now – now, Chloe was alright if only for a moment and back into their sexual innuendo-laden banter.  It was all Lex could do not to shove Gabe out the door and tell him to come back in an hour.  Chloe saw the gleam in his eye and she chuckled aloud before turning her attention back to Gabe.<br>
<br>
“I’m sure I’ll be fine Dad,” she said reassuringly.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe ---”<br>
<br>
“Dad, you of all people should know that meteor freaks don’t die in Smallville – well, not unless someone kills them – so what makes you think that ---”<br>
<br>
“You’re not a ‘meteor freak’,” Gabe interrupted.  Chloe raised her eyebrows and smiled at him.<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh,” she said, unconvinced.  “What would *you* call it then?”<br>
<br>
“You were affected by a chemical at the plant,” Gabe started and watched Chloe’s head nod agreeably with him.  <br>
<br>
“A chemical that the meteor rocks in my bag fell into,” she reminded him.  Lex and Gabe both looked temporarily taken aback by what she had said.  <br>
<br>
“What?”  Lex asked.  “Why didn’t you tell me that before?”  Chloe shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Sorry, I thought you knew.  You were there, you saw me pick them up and put them back in my bag.”<br>
<br>
“I ---” Lex trailed off, shaking his head absently as he contemplated what Chloe was saying to him.  ‘That might be the reason the doctors haven’t been able to come up with anything,’ he thought to himself.  Gabe was apparently thinking the same thing.<br>
<br>
“They should know,” he said.  Lex nodded in agreement and Gabe turned to face Chloe again.  “Where are they?”<br>
<br>
“They?”<br>
<br>
“The meteor rocks,” he clarified.<br>
<br>
“In my brown bag at home as far as I know,” she answered.  <br>
<br>
“Okay.  I’ll – um – I’ll be back in a little while, okay sweetie?”  Gabe leaned over and kissed her forehead before getting up to leave.  <br>
<br>
“Okay,” she said and gave him a small wave as he left the room.  Lex got up and closed the door, but didn’t turn the lights back on.<br>
<br>
“Can I call you *sweetie* now?”  He teased.<br>
<br>
“Not unless I can call you *dump*, which doesn’t sound nearly as endearing,” she said.  Lex snickered and made his way through the dark room to her bedside again.  She felt his weight settle down on the side of the bed and she sighed.  “So, I’m dying, huh?”<br>
<br>
“The doctors don’t know about the meteor rocks yet,” Lex said.  “Maybe they can do something.”<br>
<br>
“Maybe – if they don’t completely laugh my dad out of the room.”<br>
<br>
“They won’t,” Lex assured her.  “They’re grasping at straws as it is.  They won’t turn down a new theory.”<br>
<br>
“You’d be surprised how stubborn people can be about my meteor rock theory though.”<br>
<br>
“Poor baby,” he teased.  “Feeling neglected, are we?”  He could barely make out the line of her smile in the room that was now only lit by the machines that were hooked up to her.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” she said, her voice taking on a teasing seductiveness.  “Are *we*?”<br>
<br>
“Mmm,” he agreed as he leaned down to kiss her.  <br>
<br>
His lips missed their aim, kissing the side of her mouth first, and she smiled.  Chloe wound her arms around his neck and they started kissing, their tongues sweeping into each other’s mouths almost ferociously after their period apart.  <br>
<br>
‘I love you.’<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Second, this chapter is a little hard to follow at first.  Just warning you ahead of time.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Caught up in the moment, Chloe murmured breathlessly against his lips.<br>
<br>
“I love you too.”<br>
<br>
Her words were enough to make Lex lose whatever little self control he had left.  He moved his mouth against hers again and an image floated into his mind of the two of them together in his bedroom at home.  Her hands were running up his shirtless chest and --- Chloe inwardly chuckled and it transferred to her dream self.  <br>
<br>
‘Something funny?’<br>
<br>
‘You picture this room a lot,’ she thought.  ‘Why not someplace…different?’  Her mind changed the image to her smaller bedroom at her house and Lex arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
‘Because it’s unrealistic,’ he thought as he moved his mouth along her jaw until he reached her neck.  <br>
<br>
‘How is it unrealistic?’<br>
<br>
‘Because we won’t be living there,’ Lex thought to himself, temporarily forgetting that Chloe could hear everything he thought and not just what he chose for her to hear.  <br>
<br>
“What?”  Chloe asked as she tried to pull away from him, but Lex kept a firm grip on her hip and back and she let her body sink back into his attentions.<br>
<br>
His tongue darted out onto her neck and swirled around in a circular motion before his teeth grazed the spot lightly.  He fixed his lips around the area and started suckling at the smooth skin.  With each burst of pressure, Chloe felt the waves of pleasure lap at her body.  She let out a whimpered moan and Lex changed the image in their minds back to the bedroom in his house, where he started backing her toward the bed.  <br>
<br>
Chloe didn’t care anymore.  The sensations coursing through her body were taking over and she began to arch her body toward him.  Her fantasy skipped ahead to him pumping himself into her and both of them nearing climax.  <br>
<br>
Lex moaned as the strong arousal overcame his body and he unconsciously started rocking his lower body up against her in time with the thrusts in their shared image.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe,” he panted against her neck.  Chloe’s nails dug into his shoulders and back as her orgasm rolled through her.<br>
<br>
“Lex!”  <br>
<br>
Her scream prompted a physical response in Lex and he felt an imaginary tightening around his cock.  He let out loud satisfied groan of her name as his body shuddered with release and his head dropped beside hers.<br>
<br>
The nurse assigned to Chloe’s room heard Chloe’s scream from the other end of the hallway and started running to the room at a fevered pace.  She couldn’t make out what Chloe had said, but she recognized the manner with which it was screamed.  She slowed her pace and shook her head.  Surely that couldn’t be right.  The girl had just technically died, and even if she hadn’t, her boyfriend wouldn’t be foolish enough to initiate intimacy while she was in the hospital.  The nurse opened the door quickly and her mouth dropped open and closed a couple of times.<br>
<br>
“What do you think you’re doing?”  She asked sternly.  <br>
<br>
Chloe’s eyes were closed and Lex nuzzled his face into the crook of Chloe’s neck.<br>
<br>
‘Whoops,’ Chloe thought.  ‘Guess I was too loud.’<br>
<br>
‘Never,’ Lex replied.  ‘Just ignore her.’<br>
<br>
‘Contrary to what my dad tried to tell me when I was younger, I’ve found that ignoring people doesn’t always make them go away.’<br>
<br>
‘You’re talking about me, aren’t you?’<br>
<br>
Chloe smiled when she felt Lex’s smirk against her skin and the nurse cleared her throat loudly.  Lex sighed and turned his head as he sat up straight on the bed and then stood up.<br>
<br>
“Was there something you needed?”  He asked casually.  Chloe snickered.<br>
<br>
‘I’m amazed by your ability to do that.’<br>
<br>
‘Do *what*?’  Lex teased suggestively.<br>
<br>
‘Don’t start.’<br>
<br>
‘Are you sure?’<br>
<br>
‘The nurse is standing right there, Lex.’<br>
<br>
‘So?  It’s not like we haven’t done it in front of people before.’<br>
<br>
‘Clark doesn’t count.’<br>
<br>
‘He’s not a person?’<br>
<br>
‘The jury’s still out on that,’ Chloe joked with a smile.  Lex started laughing and the older woman by the door looked at him as if he had lost his mind.<br>
<br>
The nurse pursed her lips and crossed her arms, realizing that she had a bit of a predicament on her hands.  She didn’t want to lose her job for being rude to Lex Luthor, but visiting hours were over, he was obviously a little mentally unstable, and he *had* just been physically accosting her patient.<br>
<br>
‘Not that she seemed to mind,’ the nurse thought.  She inwardly sighed and then forced a tight grin onto her lips.  “I’m sorry, Mr. Luthor; but visiting hours are over.”<br>
<br>
‘She’s kicking you out *dumpling*,’ Chloe thought as she tried to restrain her laughter from bubbling out.<br>
<br>
‘She’ll cave.’<br>
<br>
‘You think so?’<br>
<br>
‘She’ll lose her job if she doesn’t,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
Gabe appeared in the doorway and lightly rapped on the door to get their attention.  He flashed Chloe an almost beaming smile and she smiled back at him.<br>
<br>
“Good news?”  She asked.  Her dad nodded and then looked at Lex.<br>
<br>
“They seem really encouraged by this latest information and they got started on it the second I told them about it,” Gabe said.  His smile fell to a confused grin in a second flat.  “But they said they already had meteor rock samples at the lab when I said I could bring some in.  I didn’t know you were doing testing on those?”<br>
<br>
Lex could almost feel Chloe’s inquisitive look bearing a hole into his back and he barely contained his wince.<br>
<br>
‘You’re testing meteor rocks?  And you didn’t tell me?’<br>
<br>
‘I would have gotten around to it.’<br>
<br>
‘No you wouldn’t.’<br>
<br>
‘Crap,’ Lex thought.  ‘One minute I’m having a nice moment with her and the next ---’<br>
<br>
‘I can hear you,’ Chloe thought in a sing-song voice.  Lex turned his head to face her and he gave her a half-smirk.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, *sweetheart*.  Please forgive me?”  <br>
<br>
Chloe burst out in laughter at his mock-serious tone and Gabe and the nurse exchanged confused expressions.<br>
<br>
“I – um ---” the nurse stammered and turned to Gabe.  “I was just telling Mr. Luthor that visiting hours are over.”  Gabe gave her a slow nod of his head and looked back at Lex.<br>
<br>
“We should be going then,” he said to Lex.  Gabe grinned at Chloe.  “I forgot to ask how you’re feeling.  You look better.”<br>
<br>
Chloe tried to push down the blush she felt rising to her cheeks and Lex smirked at her.<br>
<br>
‘Maybe I should stay,’ Lex thought.  ‘Apparently it’s good for your health.’<br>
<br>
‘Oh, shut up.’<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Lex sat down on his bed at home.  He was still a little in shock that they had actually kicked him out.  <br>
<br>
‘You’re not still sulking are you?’  Chloe’s voice came through in his head.<br>
<br>
‘No.  What gave you that idea?’<br>
<br>
Chloe pictured him sitting on his bed, with an expression much like the one he was wearing.  Lex furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
‘That’s weird,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
‘What?’<br>
<br>
‘It’s almost identical to what I’m actually doing.’<br>
<br>
‘Really?  I was just kidding,’ Chloe thought.  <br>
<br>
‘Great,’ Lex thought sarcastically.  <br>
<br>
Chloe bit the inside of her lip.  She felt bad that they sent Lex home just because they said she needed rest.<br>
<br>
‘I’ll have to do something to make it up to him,’ she thought.  Lex arched an eyebrow and flopped his back against the bed.<br>
<br>
‘Thinking to yourself again.  Never a good sign, Sullivan,’ he teased.  Chloe smiled and shook her head lightly.  ‘So, how are you going to make it up to me?’  <br>
<br>
Chloe pictured him sitting on the bed again.<br>
<br>
‘I’m lying down now,’ he corrected and altered the image to fit his position in reality.  Chloe was going to roll her eyes, but she decided to just go with it.  She pictured herself coming into the room and walking over to him.  Lex smirked and changed her outfit to the hospital gown he had seen her in just an hour before.  Chloe started laughing when she saw the gown.<br>
<br>
‘You’re joking, right?  I hate to break it to you, but hospital gowns aren’t exactly a big turn-on, Lex.’<br>
<br>
‘It worked earlier,’ he thought smugly.  Chloe blushed and Lex somehow sensed it.  ‘Wow!  I got a blush out of you,’ he thought in a proud voice.  Chloe sighed.<br>
<br>
‘Okay, that’s it.  I don’t know why I felt the need to console you anyway.’<br>
<br>
A pleased grin crawled across Lex’s mouth.<br>
<br>
‘Because you love me,’ he thought.  <br>
<br>
‘What?’  Chloe asked in confusion, completely forgetting her slip in the moment of passion earlier.  <br>
<br>
‘Because you *love* me,’ he thought again.  <br>
<br>
‘Lex,’ Chloe thought hesitantly.  Lex’s eyes drifted closed and he pictured the two of them together in his room.  He saw Chloe walking over to him and climbing on the bed to straddle his waist.  The warm tingle of arousal spread through Chloe’s body and she let out a moan when her image slowly slid down Lex’s cock.  ‘Oh, God.’  <br>
<br>
Lex watched his fantasy play out, with an image of Chloe starting to bob up and down on top of him.  He was only vaguely aware that the strangled groans were actually coming from his throat and not just from his imagination, but at this point he didn’t care.  In the dream, he could feel Chloe’s inner walls squeezing tight around him and he let go inside her.  His breathing slowly returned to normal as the image faded away.<br>
<br>
‘That was ---’ he trailed off and shook his head lightly.  ‘I don’t know if I’ll be able to live without being able to do that with you once they find a way to cure us.’  <br>
<br>
‘I’m sure you’ll survive.’<br>
<br>
‘Well, I’ll still have the real thing,’ he thought smugly.<br>
<br>
‘Ye-ah, about that ---’ Chloe was pulled out of her thoughts by a knock on the door.  “Come in.”  <br>
<br>
‘What?’<br>
<br>
‘One of your ‘specialists’ is here,’ Chloe thought.  The man greeted her with an uneasy smile and she noticed the folder in his hands.  <br>
<br>
‘Which one?’<br>
<br>
‘How should I know?’<br>
<br>
“Well, I’ve got some good news and some bad news for you,” the doctor said.  Chloe placed a fake smile on her lips, but inwardly prepared herself for the worst.<br>
<br>
‘Okay, I’m dying.  No big deal.  I can leave the Torch in Clark and Lana’s hands and ---’<br>
<br>
“What?!”  Lex yelled, cutting off her inner ramblings.<br>
<br>
“How about I give you the good news first?”  The doctor asked, forcing Chloe to temporarily abandon what she was sure was going to be a very angry Lex.  Chloe nodded.<br>
<br>
“I could use some good news,” she mumbled.  <br>
<br>
“Well,” the man started with the uneasy smile again, only proving that there was indeed bad news on the horizon, “We think we’ve come up with something to help you.”  Chloe’s eyes widened with the doctor’s words.<br>
<br>
“You can fix us?”  She asked excitedly.  <br>
<br>
‘They can fix us?’<br>
<br>
“Not exactly,” the doctor said.  “The only thing we’ve been able to come up with will be able to counteract one of the chemical’s effects in your body, allowing your estrogen glands to return to normal.”  Chloe creased her brow and tilted her head.<br>
<br>
“That’s good – right?”<br>
<br>
“You won’t be in imminent danger of dying anytime soon, so yes, it’s good news,” he said.  Chloe smiled and felt a sudden urge to hug the older man.<br>
<br>
‘I’m not dying!  Well, I am, but I won’t be,’ she clarified.  <br>
<br>
‘Go over that again,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Hold on.  He’s just about to tell me the bad news.’<br>
<br>
The doctor placed the folder in his left hand and ran his right hand around his neck nervously.<br>
<br>
“The bad news is that even with the new information about the meteor rocks; we can’t seem to find anyway to get rid of the chemical altogether.  We’re still researching of course, but it could take years to find a way to neutralize or dispose of it, and in the meantime ---”<br>
<br>
“Lex and I are stuck together,” Chloe finished for him.  The specialist nodded and gave her an apologetic look.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry.  I wish I had better news for you,” he said.<br>
<br>
“It’s okay,” she responded.  He gave her a nod and then started to turn away, but stopped and swung his head back around.  <br>
<br>
“Oh!  They’ll be bringing up your first dose of SMRC-24 in a few minutes,” he said.  Chloe frowned.<br>
<br>
“So, am I going to have to take this cure, or whatever it is, for the rest of my life?”  She asked.  The man shook his head.<br>
<br>
“We’ve calculated that with your body size, it should take five days with a dose every hour to get your system back to normal – or as back to normal as we can make it,” he answered.  “And if our testing proves accurate, then your glands will build up sort of a barrier, so they won’t allow the chemical back inside.”  Chloe faked a grin and nodded absently.<br>
<br>
“Thanks.”<br>
<br>
“Any other questions?”  He asked.<br>
<br>
“You haven’t come up with anything for Lex at all?”  <br>
<br>
‘You’re concerned about me?’  Lex asked, feeling a little tug of emotion at his heart that she would care enough to ask.  He knew she said she loved him, but he knew enough from her demeanor afterward that she had probably said it in the heat of passion.<br>
<br>
‘So?’<br>
<br>
“I’m afraid not,” the doctor said and shook his head.  “But we’re still trying.”  Chloe nodded and watched the man leave the room, and then she let out a sigh.<br>
<br>
‘I suppose you’d like to be filled in,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘That would be nice.’<br>
<br>
‘To sum it up: they’ve come up with something that’s supposedly going to keep me from dying, but they haven’t found a way to completely get rid of the chemical in our systems or its other effects on our bodies.’<br>
<br>
‘But you won’t be dying anymore?’<br>
<br>
‘No, but I have to stay here for five days – which, really, is *almost* like death,’ she joked.  Lex grinned and shook his head.  How Chloe was able to still keep a light-hearted attitude about the situation was beyond him.<br>
<br>
‘I’ll visit you every day if that will help.’<br>
<br>
‘You don’t need to,’ she thought.  ‘After all, it looks like you’re going to be stuck with me for a long time.’<br>

<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“Le-x,” Lionel strung out his son’s name in a sneer as he walked into his office at the plant.  “Would you care to explain this to me?” <br>
<br>
Lex glanced up from his computer monitor to see his father holding out some sort of file; which, as if on cue, he threw on Lex’s desk.  Lex didn’t even get a chance to look at the documents that lie within before Lionel started his semi-rant.<br>
<br>
“It wasn’t enough that you had the nerve to berate *me* for doing experimental testing, but then you do some of your own?”  Lionel asked accusingly.  “And I suppose you thought that I wouldn’t find out?”  He pursed his lips and tilted his head to the side, a sure sign that he was about to change tactics.  Lex inwardly scoffed.<br>
<br>
‘Great,’ he thought sarcastically, ‘now I get to listen to another long-winded speech on why I should partner up with him.’<br>
<br>
‘Your dad?’  Chloe guessed.<br>
<br>
‘Who else?’<br>
<br>
‘Are you giving him that dry stare you do?’  Chloe teased.<br>
<br>
‘Dry stare?’<br>
<br>
‘I’m not sure I can describe it much better than that, hon.’ Chloe’s eyes widened and then she cringed when she realized she had thought ‘hon’ on the end of her sentence.  ‘Oh my God, I didn’t just say that.’  Lex coughed into his hand, but was inwardly laughing at her reaction to her own statement.  ‘Shut up.  Go deal with your dad or something.’<br>
<br>
‘Whatever you say sweetheart,’ he thought.  Chloe noticed that he didn’t emphasize the term of endearment, and she seemed a bit flustered that it didn’t bother her.  Lex turned off his computer and pushed his chair away from his desk.  “To my knowledge, you don’t hold any sort of patent on the meteor rocks,” he told his father.  <br>
<br>
“You stole one of my best researchers, Lex.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, I did,” Lex admitted with a nod of his head.  He gave his father a small smirk and folded his arms across his chest.  “You should be more careful about renewing people’s contracts if you want to keep them working for you.”  <br>
<br>
“Le-x,” Lionel strung out again in tone that Lex thought made him sound like a whiney three year old.  “You’re missing the big picture.  I don’t care about some random scientist.”  He took a few steps closer to his son.<br>
<br>
‘And here it comes,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
“But to have you back in the fold ---” Lionel paused and Lex had to force himself not to roll his eyes at what was supposed to be a convincing look on his father’s face.  “It’s your destiny, Lex.”<br>
<br>
“Ah.  Well, there’s the thing about destiny, Dad,” Lex said, taking a step closer to him, “I like to make my own.”  With that, Lex turned on his heel and walked back to the position behind his desk.  He started to pull the chair up without looking at Lionel.  “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a lot of work to do today.”  Lionel narrowed his eyes for a second and pursed his lips, but he finally gave Lex a curt nod that Lex wasn’t looking up to see.  Lionel made it all the way to the door before stopping and turning his head halfway around.<br>
<br>
“Speaking of work, what *did* you need my cellular chemist for?”  <br>
<br>
“That’s confidential,” Lex said with a small smirk curling the corners of his lips upward.  ‘And I wouldn’t tell you anyway.’  <br>
<br>
Chloe snickered.<br>
<br>
‘It’s so nice that you and your dad have such a loving relationship,’ she said sarcastically.  Lex rubbed his eyes after his dad left the room.<br>
<br>
‘I don’t suppose you have anything else on him?’<br>
<br>
‘Why?’  Chloe asked.  Lex blinked in surprise.<br>
<br>
‘Is that a ‘yes’?  How could you keep something like that from me --- with our voices in each other’s heads and everything?’  He asked, hoping he didn’t come off sounding too affronted by the information.<br>
<br>
‘I’m amazing,’ she responded in a mock-serious tone.  Lex let out a sigh of relief and Chloe arched an eyebrow.  ‘What?’<br>
<br>
‘Nothing,’ he lied.  ‘So, you were going to tell me what else you have on my father?’<br>
<br>
‘I was?  I don’t remember agreeing to that,’ she thought as a teasing smile lit up her face.<br>
<br>
‘You’re hilarious Sullivan,’ he thought dryly.<br>
<br>
‘I try.’  She groaned when the nurse came in to give her the hourly injection of SMRC-24. <br>
<br>
‘What’s wrong?’<br>
<br>
‘They’re going to put more of that green goop into me,’ she complained.  <br>
<br>
‘Hmm.  Well, I would tell them not to, but it’s saving your life, so I’m not particularly inclined to do that,’ he thought.  Chloe scoffed.<br>
<br>
‘That and they can’t hear you,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘That too,’ he agreed with a grin.<br>
<br>
“Ugh,” she grimaced as the green liquid made its way down her IV cord.  <br>
<br>
‘Does it hurt?’<br>
<br>
‘No, I’m groaning about it because it’s so much fun,’ she quipped.  <br>
<br>
‘I could take your mind off it,’ Lex thought suggestively.  Chloe’s eyes widened and the nurse gave her a strange look.<br>
<br>
“Is it worse than normal?”  The older woman asked.  <br>
<br>
Lex pictured them kissing, their hands running over each other’s naked bodies and Chloe felt her heart start to pound against her chest.  <br>
<br>
‘Lex, don’t do this,’ she thought, letting her eyes flutter closed.  <br>
<br>
‘Don’t do what?’  He thought with a smirk.  He sat back in his chair and closed his eyes as well.  <br>
<br>
Then he did something that Chloe wasn’t expecting.  He changed the image of them together to her back being leaned down against his desk and him kissing his way down her body.  Chloe’s breathing grew ragged as she felt her body flush with anticipation.  She let out a whimper and the nurse frowned.  She held up the back of her hand to Chloe’s forehead and let out a ‘tsk’ before leaving the room to retrieve a thermometer.  Lex daydreamed about kissing her inner thigh and Chloe could practically feel his smooth head underneath her fingertips.<br>
<br>
“Lex,” she moaned in a hushed voice.  <br>
<br>
“Mmm --- Chloe,” he said, his volume just as low as hers.  He pictured himself darting his tongue out to lick her slit from top to bottom.  <br>
<br>
Chloe started writhing in her bed and when the nurse came in again, the concerned frown appeared to be a permanent fixture on her face.  Her patient had been on the mend one minute, and then after she received her injection she was warm, sweaty, and squirming around in her bed with her eyes closed.  The nurse didn’t take it as a good sign and made a mental note to let the doctors know as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Chloe and Lex let the shared image play out in their minds.  Lex was thrusting three fingers in and out of her while circling her clit with his tongue and Chloe had her hands clenched until her knuckles were white at the sides of the desk.  <br>
<br>
‘Lex, oooh, right there,’ she thought, her words coming through in the daydream.  Her body started to shake as her orgasm rolled through her and the nurse shook her head.  There hadn’t been anything in the girl’s paperwork to suggest seizure activity, so it must be a side-effect of the experimental drug.  She quickly left the room and closed the door behind her.  As if he sensed that the woman left, Lex pictured himself positioning himself at her entrance and then plunging his cock into her depths in one swift movement.  “Lex!”  <br>
<br>
Her inner walls clamped around him as he brought her to climax a second time with his entrance.  He groaned her name and started a steady rhythm of pumping in and out of her.  Chloe squeezed her inner muscles and Lex let out a strangled cry of her name as the thrusting came faster and faster.  <br>
<br>
The nurse slowly opened the door and pointed to Chloe as the doctor stepped in behind her.<br>
<br>
“See?”  She asked in a whispered voice.  Chloe’s body was flailing about as her third and final orgasm took hold of her body.  She let out a series of struggled moans as she let the pleasure encompass her.  The doctor frowned and nodded, walking toward the bed to examine his patient.  Chloe’s breathing was labored, but her body started to come to a still in exhaustion.  Her eyes slowly opened and she squinted as they focused on what was going on in the ‘real world’.  <br>
<br>
‘Oh, crap,’ she thought.  ‘How long have *they* been here?’<br>
<br>
‘Who?’<br>
<br>
‘The nurse and a doctor,’ she explained.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe?”  The doctor asked.  Chloe turned her head to look at him.  “It looks like you’re back with us now, but you gave us quite a scare there.”  Chloe gave him what she hoped would pass as a questioning look.  “It seems that the drug has brought on some seizure activity, so we’re going to do a few tests.  Alright?”  He didn’t wait for her to give him an answer before he turned and left the room.  The nurse gave her a compassionate smile and followed the doctor out the door.<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe this is happening,” Chloe said under her breath.<br>
<br>
‘What?’<br>
<br>
‘They saw me,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
‘So?’<br>
<br>
‘No, Lex.  They *saw* me.’<br>
<br>
‘Oh.’<br>
<br>
‘They think the drug is bringing on seizure activity now,’ she thought.  Lex smiled broadly and started laughing out loud.  ‘That’s not funny.’  His laughing only got harder.  “Argh!  You are *so* going to pay for this, Luthor!”<br>

<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe you’re back at school after *dying*!”<br>
<br>
“It was only for like a minute, Pete,” Chloe said with a bemused smile as she turned the computer in the Torch office on.  <br>
<br>
‘What was?’<br>
<br>
‘My brush with death,’ Chloe thought in a light-hearted tone.  <br>
<br>
‘Mmm.  How are you feeling?’ Lex thought.  He casually glanced through the file that was sitting atop his desk.  He had a lot of work to get caught up on, but his concern for Chloe took priority in his mind.  An evil grin crept across Chloe’s lips and she looked down so Pete couldn’t see it.<br>
<br>
‘Vengeful.’<br>
<br>
Lex’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.<br>
<br>
“What?” he asked aloud.  <br>
<br>
Chloe’s attention snapped to Pete when she realized that he was still talking.<br>
<br>
“Still, you could have milked it for way more than just a week off,” Pete said.  Chloe chuckled and Pete smiled at her.  “So, are you going to do a big article on your near-death experience?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t think so,” Chloe answered, her mood suddenly shifting into something a little more sullen.  <br>
<br>
“Why not?  I thought that would be front page material.”<br>
<br>
Chloe tucked some hair behind her ear and forced a small grin onto her lips.<br>
<br>
“Maybe after I’ve gotten used to it a little more,” she said.  Pete nodded in understanding.  Reporting on others misfortunes was much different than detailing your own.<br>
<br>
“I better get to practice before coach reams me,” he said, flashing her another smile before heading toward the door.  “It’s good to have you back, Chlo.”<br>
<br>
“Thanks, Pete.”<br>
<br>
‘Is he gone?’<br>
<br>
‘Yeah.’<br>
<br>
‘What did you mean by vengeful?’<br>
<br>
‘What do you think I meant?  You subjected me to a whole new series of tests because that nurse and doctor saw me – and I *told* you I would get you back for it.  Did you not believe me?’<br>
<br>
‘I was hoping you had changed your mind,’ Lex admitted.<br>
<br>
‘And what happened to give you *that* false hope?’<br>
<br>
‘Would you like me to remind you?’ Lex asked suggestively.  Chloe pursed her lips.  She was at school, and basically anyone could come walking into the Torch office…<br>
<br>
“No,” she said, focusing her attention on the screen in front of her.<br>
<br>
‘No?’<br>
<br>
“No,” she repeated.  She heard Lex inwardly groan and arched an eyebrow.  ‘What’s going on?’<br>
<br>
‘I have a meeting with my dad this afternoon,’ he thought.  ‘It was scheduled weeks ago and I completely forgot about it.’<br>
<br>
‘Sure you did,’ she thought sarcastically.  ‘You never forget anything.  I’d say it was more wishful thinking than anything.’<br>
<br>
‘So?’ Lex quipped.  ‘Fuck.  The bastard’s here now.’<br>
<br>
‘Well, don’t mind me – not that it’s not the perfect time to enact my revenge or anything,’ she thought.  <br>
<br>
‘Chl-oe,’ he strung out her name as a warning in his head.  ‘Don’t.’<br>
<br>
“Lex,” Lionel sneered cheerfully as he walked into his son’s office.  “How are you today?”  Lex didn’t bother to rise from his chair, only briefly glancing up at his father before turning his attention back to his computer monitor.<br>
<br>
‘I don’t suppose you could save the whole ‘getting even’ thing for another time and just give me more information on my dad?’<br>
<br>
‘What do I look like – your own personal detective?  Get the information yourself.’<br>
<br>
Lex’s mind flitted to an image of her wearing nothing but a long trench coat and a fedora.  <br>
<br>
‘Mind out of the gutter, Luthor.’<br>
<br>
‘Isn’t that what you had in mind for retribution?’<br>
<br>
“Have you heard a word I’ve said?”  Lionel asked.  <br>
<br>
“To be honest, my mind is on other things besides this pointless meeting.”<br>
<br>
“I would hardly call combining our forces ‘pointless’, Lex.”<br>
<br>
‘God, not this again.  First he can’t wait to get rid of me and then when he realizes that I actually know what I’m doing, he can’t wait to get me under his thumb again,’ Lex thought.<br>
<br>
‘Would you like me to cheer you up?’ Chloe asked.  A small grin curled up the corners of Lex’s mouth.<br>
<br>
‘Please,’ he thought suggestively.  The evil smile returned to Chloe’s lips as she came across the site she had been looking for.  With a few quick clicks, she reached the page she was looking for and a bubbly, cartoon-sounding song started to fill the Torch office as well as her head.  Lex creased his brow as Chloe started to sing along with the music that was now drowning out every other sound in the room.<br>
<br>
Come along with the snorks<br>
Swim along with the snorks<br>
So much to see<br>
Waiting for you and me<br>
Have some fun with the snorks<br>
<br>
Play along with the snorks<br>
Sing along with the snorks<br>
Happy we’ll be<br>
Living under the sea<br>
Come along with the snorks<br>
<br>
If you could breathe underwater<br>
Where would you go?<br>
If you had friends underwater<br>
Who would you know?<br>
<br>
Come along, sing along, swim along too – yeah!<br>
<br>
Come along with the snorks<br>
Swim along with the snorks<br>
So much to see <br>
Waiting for you and me<br>
<br>
Swim along with the, have some fun with the, come along with the snorks<br>
<br>
Lex blinked a couple of times as he tried to regain his bearings.  Lionel was staring at him with what looked like concern.  He knew his son didn’t particularly care for their little talks, but he had never been so obvious as to blatantly ignore him before.<br>
<br>
‘Chloe?’<br>
<br>
Chloe started laughing wildly, clutching her gut as her body shook with amusement.<br>
<br>
“Yes?” she asked aloud through her laughing.<br>
<br>
“What the hell was that?” Lex asked.  Chloe laughed again and when Clark came into the office, the song started to replay.<br>
<br>
‘*That* was retribution,’ she thought.  ‘I can only imagine the look on your dad’s face when he saw that you weren’t paying attention to anything he said.’<br>
<br>
‘When you said you were going to get even, I thought – well, you know.’<br>
<br>
‘I’m aware of what you thought,’ she responded.<br>
<br>
“Chloe?” Clark asked.  At the sound of Clark’s voice, Chloe turned in her chair to face him.  She gave him a wide smile.  <br>
<br>
“Hey, Clark.”<br>
<br>
“Why are you listening to the theme song to The Snorks?”<br>
<br>
“You don’t like The Snorks?”<br>
<br>
“Well – I – I don’t know.  I mean, I haven’t watched cartoons for a long time,” Clark said.  Chloe rolled her eyes. <br>
<br>
“And yet you recognized the theme song,” she pointed out.  Clark opened his mouth to speak, but quickly closed it when he realized he had no rebuttal.  Chloe turned her chair back around to look at the computer.  “And for your information, I used to have a crush on Junior.”<br>
<br>
‘I beg your pardon?’<br>
<br>
“You had a crush on a cartoon character?”<br>
<br>
“You make that sound like it’s a bad thing,” she said.  Clark stared at her in disbelief, not sure of what else to say.  <br>
<br>
‘It is a bad thing.  Who is Junior?’<br>
<br>
‘None of your business,’ Chloe thought.  ‘And speaking of business, is your dad still in the room?’<br>
<br>
Lex looked over and saw his dad still just staring at him with a worried look on his face.<br>
<br>
‘Crap.’<br>
<br>
Chloe started laughing again and Lex squared his jaw.<br>
<br>
