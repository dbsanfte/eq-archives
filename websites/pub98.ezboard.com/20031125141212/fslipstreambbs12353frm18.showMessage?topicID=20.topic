<br>
Overall, the show can be characterized as lacking any focus or direction.  There is no sense of who the Commonwealth is, it's purpose in the universe, whether the universe is a better place with it than it was before, and, for me, most importantly, no sense of DYLAN'S place in all of this.<br>
<br>
Only in Cui Bono has the issue of Dylan's role in the Commonwealth been addressed and there has been NO follow through on that.  None at  all.  For the most part Dylan travels through the galaxies wavering between vigilante and hero and railing against a Commonwealth he created, refuses to help run, and now refuses to do anything about.<br>
<br>
The writing has largely been, well, I don't know any other way to say this....it's been mediocre at best and dismal at worst with four exceptions.  I'll get to those in a sec.<br>
<br>
The mediocre:  If the Wheel is Fixed; Shards of Rimni; For Whom the Bell Tolls.<br>
<br>
The dismal:  Mad To Be Saved; Slipfighter the Dogs of War; And Your Heart Will Fly Away; Delenda Est.<br>
<br>
Of the remaining 4, the Leper's Kiss was imo a very enjoyable episode but the contrived premise of the episode, i.e. the sudden and unexplained appearance of a hitherto unmentioned old friend of Dylan who apparently helped him start the Commonwealth without any of us viewers knowing about it, is indicative of the dedication on the part of tptb to simply ignore the original premise of the show.  <br>
<br>
Okay so that leaves Ash and Zack.  Hey, the best for last right?<br>
<br>
Gentlemen:  Cui Bono, Lone and Level Sands, and the Unconquerable Man have been very bright spots in an otherwise dismal first half.  In Cui Bono you did what I didn't think could be done:  you turned Uncle Sid into a complex layered character.  Quite a feat.  For one episode I  actually had a sense of what the CW is and Dylan's place in it.  Thank you.  In Lone and Level Sands you brought back the Dylan I used to love.  The man who had a purpose in life, who had a mission, who would do anything to get back to performing that mission.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
And TUM.  Well um, I can't say it enough.  It's a love letter to fans like me.  And I can't thank you enough.<br>
<br>
On to the characters.<br>
<br>
Dylan:  I'm in mourning for Dylan.  Once a classically quixotic character of depth with the potential for real exploration of the price of power and the cost to the soul of using ruthless means to achieve a just end.  Now, largely a one note, one line spewing smart ass, who for most of this season has come accross as tired, bored, and thoroughly uninvolved.  Grade:  D (not an F because of L&amp;LS, one third of Bell, and Cui Bono).  Lone and Level Sand is almost painful to watch because through it Dylan keeps talking about how he has to get back to his mission.  What mission?  WHAT mission???<br>
<br>
Beka:  With the exception of Slipfighter, where she suddenly became mini Dylan in the &quot;let's put Tyr down&quot; sweepstakes, Beka is the one character that has consistently remained herself this season.  Lisa has consistently and convincingly continued to portray the woman who's discovered the hero within without giving up her toughness and her innate rebellion to authority.  Given what's happened tothe remainder of the characters, I need to give most of the credit for this to the great Lisa Ryder.  Lisa....well what can I say.  You rock.  Grade:  B+<br>
<br>
Tyr:  Ah, Tyr.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  What to say?  Once so cock sure in every word he spoke.  Once so strong.  Now turned into a glorified henchman who seems to be there largely for the purpose of Dylan putting him down or trying to make him look inferior.  You know it's bad when &quot;Tunneler possessed&quot; Tyr is among the best Tyr seen this year so far.  But he had some good things in Cui Bono, in L&amp;LS, and in TUM and well in TLK he actually looked like he was having fun.  Grade:  D<br>
<br>
Trance:  *sigh*  Laura is a FINE actress.  But it has become painfully clear that NO one still working on this show has the faintest idea what to do with Trance.  To be sure, she was never well developed from day one, but if you're going to go around ordering wholesale changes in a character, you should have some idea of what you want to change the character *into*.  Clearly they didn't.  They still don't.  When Bob Engels writes her she says strange things about bubbles of time or comes accross like a real...um...well clueless person (like in Shards...).  Ironically in Wheel, I had the feeling that maybe Trance would be okay because in that ep it sounded like someone FINALLY had a handle on her.  Sadly no.  Only in one subsequent ep, The Unconquerable Man, has Laura been used to  true potential.  Grade: D- (not an F because of Wheel and TUM)<br>
<br>
Harper:  Oh my.  Well let's see, when he's not making tasteless crude remarks about PHDouble Ds he's not bad.  I think that behind Beka he's come through the best.  He was very good I thought in Shards, and he had some nice stuff with Beka in Bell, and I thought he shone in TUM.  But the one liners have plagued this character almost as badly as they've plagued Dylan.  But as a character he at least hasn't DEVOLVED which is better than what's happened to Tyr, Dylan and Trance.  Grade:  C+<br>
<br>
Rommie:  Talk about Aces and Spaces.  In TUM, Cui Bono, L&amp;LS, and Wheel she is the lethal yet elegant machine and woman in one.  In Bell, Shards, Slipfighter, and MTBS she's a ditz.  As was the case in season two, this character continues to be the most inconsistently written of them all.  Either she's brilliant or I want to hit her.  Then there's Delenda Est where she just looked bored.  I've always felt that Ash and Zack had the best handle on this character and I cringe when I think of her in other hands.  Grade:  C (because of the three Zack/Ashers and Wheel)<br>
<br>
So, what to say so far?  I'd rewatch 4 of these 11 eps (hey I would rewatch Wheel if I  didn't know what was coming after).  That's not a good percentage.  <br>
<br>
Overall thus far:  D. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heroicfool>HeroicFool</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#0000FF, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='user title'>Triumvir</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 1271<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/4/03 8:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/angelwings/fhfx104.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Season 3 Half Time Report-SPOILERS</span><hr size=1> Wheel is the one episode I have watched this season...<br>

Why do I feel like paraphrasing a line from &quot;Clueless&quot;?<br>

Looking for a story arc in Season 3 is like looking for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.<br>

At least the Eagles and Raiders GOT to the playoffs.<br>
<br>
If you want a football analogy let's talk Cincinatti Bungles or better yet, the Detroit Lions--a case of wasted potential.<br>
<br>
At least the Lions have Mariucci coming next year.  Drom's got the same front office and head coach next year AND they lost there best coaching staff (in Ash and Zack).  In short they stink and there is no indication that they will do anything *but* stink for the foreseeable future (with the exception of a few cool things left this year, courtesy of ash and zack). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ogami1>Ogami1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Alpha(Opacity=100, FinishOpacity=0, Style=1, StartX=0, StartY=0, FinishX=580, FinishY=0)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Official Critter Wave........</span></td></tr></table> </span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/12/03 2:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~jo567779/coily.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Season 3 Half Time Report-SPOILERS</span><hr size=1> (chuckle) Seriously, I hope that the rest of the season will be an improvement.

I would never watch Rose as long as I live!  I have to agree that season threes worst episodes are (in order from least suckiest to most suckiest) Delenda, Shards, Heart, and Mad to be saved takes the cake for worst yet.  I hated Heart too.  My favourite so far has been TUM.  I also tend to agree with the whole young men and cleavage comment.  Too many bimbos in the show.  We need the old Tyr back (with bone blades and all) and a Trance that makes sense.  YES Beka has been the only consistent and well portrayed character so far and I mostly watch the show to see the development of her character.  I've lost all hope of a story arch for Beka and Tyr after Heart and I think if it seems to have some kind arch it's just to lure us in.  I've noticed that in several episodes.  <br>
