Knowing the gift she harbored within herself, Meleri refused to acknowledge that she knew about these creatures but would do nothing about them. It was about this time that her parents found out about Midnight College.<br>
Knowing the gift their youngest had within, they pulled her from her normal school so that she could attend the college made just for others like herself. At first Meleri tried to ignore the teacher’s help as they tried to let her harbor her power. It was only when the spirit of her sweet sister started to haunt her that Meleri understood that what she had could protect others that might fall as her sister had to the shadows.<br>
With this purpose in mind Meleri pressed on with her life and decided to devote her skills to being a teacher at Midnight college. It wasn’t long that she was given the rule as principle within the school. She enjoyed the deal she was given and the free range to also teach her favorite subject, dance.<br>
Then the officials from the government came and she thought she would loose her freedom with the school and students. They gave orders that those students that attended her precious school would be trained so that they could defend the world from the Shadow Beast. Meleri rebelled against their authority, but fell to their bidding when they made threats to her students.<br>
Not want what was to fall upon her school and the children that would come here, Meleri had the classes divided so that each would learn both skills in life and in power. Since the humans with power seem to be the only ones who can not fully be possessed from the darkness of the creatures they had the ability to destroy them. So they would, but by her rules.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">AOL - CodiDurche</span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/bfallenangels24862" target="_blank">Midnight College</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 										<span class="value">		<dl>				<dt><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862frm39.showMessage?topicID=8.topic&index=5" title="post" target="_blank">a bit of powerplaying to get to the garden</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862frm39" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Faculty Housing</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862frm40.showMessage?topicID=109.topic&index=1" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Emiru 'Emi' Black</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862frm40" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Application</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862frm39.showMessage?topicID=8.topic&index=3" title="post" target="_blank">idea</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862frm39" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Faculty Housing</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=194.topic&index=2" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Busy</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862generaldiscussion" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">OOC Discussion</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862frm40.showMessage?topicID=108.topic&index=4" title="post" target="_blank">Re: ~Kaola~</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862frm40" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Application</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=192.topic&index=2" title="post" target="_blank">huh</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/ffallenangels24862generaldiscussion" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">OOC Discussion</a></em></dd>				</dl>				</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
