One thing you can say for this season is that Andromeda sets a new standard for science fiction. Note that I didn't say better, just new. This week, we get Andromeda's version of the 6th season <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Next Generation</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> episode, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Cause and Effect.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> In that episode, the starship Enterprise exploded repeatedly each time we faded out to commercial break. Eventually the crew began noticing they were repeating themselves, and came up with a means of acting differently. This was enough to avoid the future where the ship was destroyed, and everyone was left happy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://startrek.com/library/tng_episodes/episodes_tng_detail_68542.asp">startrek.com/library/tng_..._68542.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Andromeda takes that story concept, works in a bonsai tree, a cheap Darth Vader costume, and surgically removes anything interesting or entertaining in the concept. An unstoppable alien intruder teleports aboard the ship, and goes about killing crew members and ultimately destroying the Andromeda. Each time it does this, Trance is shown being in some other place, restarting the timeline so that the scenario plays itself out again. Rather than shoot scenes from new angles, as they did on Star Trek, they simply make the viewer watch footage being rewound onscreen, and then replayed. There is some variation, but it looks like they shot a 15-minute episode and just made us watch it repeatedly.<br>
<br>
Opening quote: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You might say reality is the result of complex negotiations between the observer and the observed.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There's nothing complex about this season of Andromeda, sad to say. The episode opens with a shot of Beka being very dead. We then see Tyr is also dead, as the Andromeda spins out of control. Hey, there's a human crew member with Tyr, he has a mask on. Maybe that means they have to pay the extra less. Harper is getting a billion volts, and Dylan is laid out against a rail. An armored intruder is shown throwing Rommie down the engine well, he looks like a cheap Darth Vader ripoff. Anyone remember Hardware Wars? We'll just call this guy Dark Invader. Dark Invader goes about his business, blowing up the Andromeda with him on board. I guess he's not worried. The view switches to Trance in some other reality, where she is before a bonsai tree. She prepares to snip a branch off it as we fade off to credits.<br>
<br>
The first few minutes is an apt summary of the third season of Andromeda thus far: The characters dead, the show spinning wildly out of control as it explodes in a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Earth: Final Conflict</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> self-immolation. Trance says it doesn't work? You got that right. <br>
<br>
We return to Trance snipping off a whole branch, and time apparently rewinds. We see what led to the destruction, Beka has just finished piloting the ship out of slipstream to normal space. There's some meaningless banter that Beka is the butt of, and they are confronted by an approaching object traveling at high speed.<br>
<br>
Beka: Fifteen LS? That's a sneaky object.<br>
<br>
Huh? They just dropped into normal space on top of this thing. How is it being sneaky heading right for them? They fire some missiles at it, which are shown to be missing it by a great distance. Now I'm no expert on High Guard missile technology, but if the ship can have a little square on a viewscreen representing the object, then why can't the missiles track it the same way? If the footage showed the missiles going <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>through</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the object, that might make sense. But they miss it by a country mile. (The viewer gets to see this repeatedly if you missed it the first time.)<br>
<br>
Closing, the object disappears, and Harper finds Dark Invader standing in the machine shop doorway. Dark Invader pulls off a wall access panel, causing a massive shower of sparks. Gee, I'm glad the fuse box lid in my house isn't designed that way. What a strange access panel. <br>
<br>
Now at this point in the episode, Trance already knows what will happen. Why didn't she immediately say &quot;Slipstream out of here, right back the way we came&quot;? I guess she wanted to try all possibilities though, so she waits until near the end of the episode to try that obvious choice. Dark Invader teleports (tesseracts, whatever) to the bridge, and shoots Beka. Trance is back at her bonsai tree, she's going to run through this again. We're back to the start, Dylan is asking Rommie to identify the approaching object.<br>
<br>
Rommie: It is non-responsive to hails and exhibiting hostile behavior.<br>
<br>
It's what?! How does she know that? Is the object flipping the finger as it approaches? Does it have a mean face? Is it scrolling a message that says &quot;Die Andromeda Die&quot;? If you're flying in a straight line to another ship as fast as you can, what exactly else are you doing that indicates hostile behavior? Maybe it's an escape pod running out of air, we have to reach the Andromeda before it's too late! But none of that matters, fire the missiles. Oddly, for some reason they never try firing the lasers, it's always missiles. They had lasers last week.<br>
<br>
Harper sees Dark Invader, and Dylan mutters &quot;Not again&quot;, referring to the teleporting Derivas from last week. Dylan orders Tyr to meet with the security team on Deck 12. They have a security team? When did that happen? They would have come in useful the past half-dozen episodes. You could have had them searching for maggots. You could have had them intercept Naz before he got to the bridge. Thank goodness none of them got blown out into space from those vacuums last week. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The security team consists of two short asian guys, typecast as ninjas. Dark Invader is shown accessing the control rod console, popping the control rods out. You remember these, destroying just one could blow up the ship! But apparently not in this episode, as Harper fires his blaster all over Dark Invader and the control rods, and nothing happens. Dark Invader shoots Harper and teleports to the bridge, ready to shoot Beka, as we fade to commercial.<br>
<br>
Now this is important, we return to find Dylan notices the intruder and shouts a warning to Beka. Yet Trance did nothing to change any of this! She just stands there wideeyed. Dark Invader starts putting his hands up, intercepting the high guard blaster shots like Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. Tyr and the rest start shooting a zillion shots at him, but he only teleports away. Andromeda reports with bad news, Harper is still alive. (grin)<br>
<br>
Rather than simply reset things on her bonsai tree, Trance works on Harper even though it is hopeless. Rommie has some new information on the intruder, and this is sadly the only information we get on him at all. The fragments from his armor indicate Dark Invader comes from a time 12000 years ago, before the old Commonwealth was ever created. If that's the case, then how would he ever know what a High Guard vessel is? He knew the precise wall panels to go to, the precise people to shoot. <br>
<br>
We switch to Harper dying, as Trance goes overboard with theatrics. She screams &quot;Nooo!!!!!&quot;, and then starts working on the bonsai tree like Homer Simpson trying to avert a nuclear meltdown. &quot;D'oh, stupid time-traveling bonsai tree!&quot;<br>
<br>
We then get a bunch of multiple views as Trance tries again and again to save Harper, but all the realities she rewinds to end the same. This episode is just one more nail in the coffin of old purple tailed Trance. That character was interesting, believable, compassionate, and intiguing. New gold Trance is simply annoying, no matter what she tries to do. So she's now more powerful than Q on Star Trek, altering reality to suit her whims. Well what does this make the rest of the crew? Worse than fifth wheels. Why have the others around, if Trance can do all this? What a stupid premise and ridiculous assassination of an interesting character. Gold Trance isn't the savior of this series, she's the iceberg.<br>
<br>
Rewind again, we're back to the closing object. Again we're told it's hostile without any indication why or how this is known. Is it wiggling the Rhumba while approaching? Harper is accosted by Dark Invader again, Trance yells for Harper to run away. Dark Invader succeeds in destroying the cables behind the wall panel, various people tell us that he is disabling Andromeda's detection systems. <br>
<br>
Dark Invader next finds himself in a firefight in the corridor with Tyr and his &quot;security squad&quot;. Dark Invader gets the better of the pathetic Nietzchian warrior, and breaks his neck. Dylan clearly watches this from a great angle, as there is a convenient security camera there. <br>
<br>
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but Andromeda has some sort of figure recognition ability when it appears on a viewscreen, so that she is talking in the right direction. She knows how to judge where people are standing, and in what direction. Here we see Andromeda's security cameras show the intruder just fine. Why can't Rommie try increasing the ship's gravity where it appears to be standing? Okay, maybe it wouldn't work, but the fact that she doesn't even bother to try is laughable. Once again, the ship goes kablooey.<br>
<br>
Trance snips again, and we are treated to yet more rewinding footage. What a budget saver. Repeating the bridge footage, then Trance informs Dylan that he's wasting his time by firing the missiles. She identifies the threat this object poses, how it will kill them all. Gee, why didn't you say that at the start of the episode?! Trance just stands there the whole episode, keeping all this to herself. Duh.<br>
<br>
The intruder suddenly drops down onto Dylan from a great height. Gee, there's that artificial gravity, pulling the intruder down onto Dylan like that. Wouldn't it be nice if Rommie had any control over that gravity? She doesn't here!<br>
<br>
Dark Invader is laying out human crew members left and right, or at least off-screen. Hey, it's an improvement over previous episodes, where the command staff acted like they were the only ones on board. Andromeda goes kablooey again, and Trance is talking to her bonsai tree. She trims again.<br>
<br>
We are treated to a lot of rewound footage from the previous segment, boy this really saves on budget! Harper observes he has a guest in the machine shop. Trance talks to her plant again. Harper starts blasting the intruder, and gets killed. The bonsai tree regrows what she has cut, avoiding the risk of having nothing but a stump. Trance has another overwrought scene with dead Harper, and she and Dylan get some time to muse over Harper's loss. Dark Invader must have been so moved by this scene, he paused to watch rather than immediately blow up the ship as has been shown in all the previous attempts!<br>
<br>
Dylan puts the ship on alert for battlestations, geez this is like hours after Harper was taken to the medlab! I guess only after musing about fate with Trance is there call to sound &quot;Code Black&quot;. Returning from commercial, Tyr comes across some guy working in the slipstream core, and tells him to beat it. So much for his first appearance, maybe his last. Dylan the ship go to Slipstream, trapping the creature so that at least it's stuck on the ship, but still able to teleport and fire at will. Funny definition of being trapped.<br>
<br>
Tyr confronts Dark Invader in the slipstream core, and Dylan can still get a camera view of the situation. The bad guy has disabled all internal sensors, remember? Oh well. Dylan orders Beka to the Maru, so they can tow the Andromeda out of slipstream with her ship. One security guard goes down, leaving Tyr and one survivor. Tyr threatens the other guy to leave, he's such a tough Nietzchian. Rather than attempting to blast the intruder with the blaster on his waist, Tyr goes after him with his knife and gets knocked down. <br>
<br>
Dark Invader goes to the control rods, the same ones that were in the machine shop earlier. I know those control rods were in the machine shop because that's where they were in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mad to be Saved,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and apparently where Harper was too. I guess there are more of them in the &quot;slipstream core&quot;, the location they're currently in. I know, it's the same set redressed, but why have him accessing controls that are the same in two rooms? Hiliariously, Tyr wakes up and blasts Dark Invader and several control rods. A huge stream of sparks from the console sprays one control rod. I guess that's not as dangerous as a bunch of crazy people banging on these things. Or maybe it is, the ship blows up again. <br>
<br>
Trance is down to one last chance, even though there are two large branches of leaves on the bonsai tree. Maybe she's saving that one for her own use. It's time for more theatrics...<br>
<br>
Trance (to bonsai tree): That was it. The last scenario. Our last hope, and we failed! Oh, I wish I had more time. If only I had more time. To find that perfect possible future. All I have is reality, and reality is never perfect. There is one more way, one true thing to trust. Dylan. <br>
<br>
The camera focuses on one stump as we go to commercial. I was hoping this would be like Shards of Rimni, you remember how they kept showing that crappy trinket being put together? I assumed they'd do the same with this bonsai tree, and the episode would end with it being a stump. It didn't work out that way, but I had to find something to focus on.<br>
<br>
Snip, we play a whole bunch of footage from the last segment going in reverse. I mention this each time only because it obviously doesn't add to the plot, it just fills out a threadbare episode. They fire missiles, this time to a wholly different CGI effect that doesn't bear any resemblance to missiles being fired, and miss. Trance speaks up.<br>
<br>
Trance: Dylan, please, it is extremely dangerous. We have to avoid any confrontation between this creature and the crew. Trust me.<br>
<br>
Um, Trance could have said this from the very start, yet she stayed silent. I guess she wanted to explore all the ways things could go wrong, precisely because she kept her mouth shut about the threat. Well that's freakin' bright.<br>
<br>
Dylan decides to take matters into his own hands, he runs to the core. Amazingly, he does so through deserted corridors, where'd that human crew go? It really is funny. At least have the massive security squad run by the other way. Dylan opens up the hatch to space, and has to hang onto a rail. Dark Invader confronts him, and tosses him away. Dylan manages to hang onto a rail, and climbs back to battle Dark Invader.<br>
<br>
He sticks Dark Invader <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>once</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with the end of the force lance, and that cripples the creature and sends him tumbling into space. Didn't those two security guards also have these same lances? Fifty thousand laser blasts won't stop this guy, but one jab in the belly with a quarterstaff does the trick. <br>
<br>
Dylan is left hanging onto the rail, I guess he couldn't ask Andromeda to close the hatch for him. Trance appears to help Dylan hold on, and then several seconds later reaches over to slap the button to close the hatch. She could have reached that first! Pretty funny. But all is not safe, as Dark Invader reappears. Maybe he's going to hand Dylan a dagger, like those losers from last week! Nope, he just teleports and flies away. So much for his deep story, we learn nothing more about him than we knew at the start. A bad end to a bad plot.<br>
<br>
Ah, but it's not over until the zombie-skinned lady sings. Yuck, does her skin look gross, what was the makeup department thinking when they invented gold Trance? Her major skin tone looks like zombie flesh from a living dead movie, and then she has some bizarre brown sweat marks at the top of her cleavage, looks like rotten apple butter got stuck there. Focusing this episode on her didn't make me appreciate her anymore, I still wish she'd disappear and we'd get purple Trance back. Or heck, just put Laurie Bertram there without any of that stupid FX makeup, I'd settle for that. She's a wonderful actress,and she deserves better.<br>
<br>
Dylan: So, you experience a million possible futures in the time it takes me to blink my eyes. And each one of them looks, feels, sounds, smells, and tastes as real as the conversation we're having right here, right now?<br>
<br>
And every one of them sucked.<br>
<br>
Trance: In a word, yes.<br>
<br>
So wow, we're supposed to be filled with wonder and awe at the super-being that is Gold Trance. If Commander Data had been like this on Star Trek, it would have been real boring, real fast. No one on the ship is in control of their actions, because Trance is there to enforce the reality she wants, whenever she wants. Why should we care? What does this have to do with science fiction? What is the point? On appearance, Trance is more powerful than we ever imagined. In practice, it's a copout, a copout for bad situations the writers get the crew into, and don't know how to get them out of. <br>
<br>
Heaven forbid Dylan Hunt or anyone else on the crew be written as having the wisdom, intelligence, luck, or determination to solve problems, no they've got Trance doing endless replays whenever something comes along that seems too tough. Well I'm sorry, but that's lousy writing, and a lousy way to wrap up difficult situations for the crew. Q, despite his power, tried to avoid that at all costs. Recall this exchange:<br>
<br>
Picard: Q, 18 of our people have died. Please, tell us this is one of your illusions.<br>
Q: Oh no. This is as real as your so-called life gets.<br>
<br>
Trance acts worse than Q, and makes such decisions for the rest of the crew. Trance rigs a reset switch, big deal. How does this add to the series, or our appreciation for the characters? Not one bit.<br>
<br>
My brother and I put off watching an episode of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; to watch this crap. It wasn't entertaining., it didn't advance the characters, character interaction, or the third season in any way. This show is heading into the realm of static, and the static is starting to look mighty good by comparison.<br>

Good review Ogami.<br>
The rewind drove me absolutly nuts after the <br>
first time. <br>
You didn't cover that drek after Dylan tosses the <br>
invincible bad  guy out the hole. He reappears beside<br>
the ship and then tesseracts into the  ship  and then disappears again. Trance says from his perspective he <br>
hasn't found us yet. Whaaat? (Bangs hand on side of <br>
head) Okay i'm just an old stupid guy. Explain what the<br>
hell this is suppossed to mean.<br>
So when he does find them we have to sit through this crap <br>
again? <p>_________________________________________________________________<br>

Thank you Ogami!<br>
<br>
I heard really good things about this episode and was looking forward to it all week.  But it just sucked!!<br>
<br>
You hit on most of the things that bugged the hell out of me but I'll add some and hit on the biggies.  <br>
<br>
First, the wasted time with reruning the same sceens and the rewinds.  After the first one, we get it!  We don't need our hands held through the whole episode.  We-Get-It.  They could have used the extra time to add in some better character interaction.  Which brings me to my second biggie:<br>
<br>
With all the emotional stress of a major character dying in every possible future, I really didn't get the sence that these people cared for each other.  Expecally with Harper dying.  One minute they have Trance crying over the newly dead Harper, the next shot is Beka and Dylan joking in command over what to do with thier &quot;bad guy&quot;.  HELLO!! Could you guys please show alittle morning or something.  It just killed any drama that the deaths caused.  Hell they could have just moved thier meeting to med dec, at least acknowlege his death with the other characters.   Make them a little more somber or something.  No wait, silly me, that would be dark and dramatic...not fun. Cause you know death is fun!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And my last biggie,  did anyone one else notice how the final future was at the cost of many other crew member's death.  You know the dissaparing crew.  The crew that (I believe) Rommie said were getting killed in the last &quot;future&quot;.  And it was a plural crew, so many people died on Andromeda, but Trance don't seem to upset over that.  As long as the main crew is ok, it doesn't seem to matter how many &quot;red shirts&quot; die.  THIS is the exact reason I hate having nameless crew on a ship.  Thier lives are no less important than the main crew but apperantly thier deaths mean nothing to the main crew.  What a nice bunch of people, thier co-workers die and they bearly notice.  This is exactly what pissed me off about the new Star Trek movie too.  <br>
<br>
OK, there's my two cent.  I'm not sure who messed up on this episode, I do trust Zack and Ash, so maybe this just got messed up in editing or by the director or producers. I've heard in other episodes of many great emotional sceens that end up on the cutting room floor, so maybe that is what happened here.  I would be really intresting to hear Zack and Ash's take on this episode.  <br>
<br>
I keep thinking Andromeda is Farscape, I don't know why, but I gotta stop.  I'm expecting way too much from this show.  All I gotta say is.....<br>

<br>
I only watched this episode twice, anymore would have caused aneurysms, fainting, and hemmoroids.<br>
<br>
What I latched onto was the off-screen notice from Andromeda that the object was now flying away from the ship, never to return. I don't know why Dark Invader didn't hand Dylan a dagger at the end, or why he just decided to give up and leave. The ending made no sense, but that gels with an episode that was brain-dead in itself.<br>

Hey, you're welcome. I wrote this review for the minority, those of us who thought this script sucked galactic-sized ass.<br>

<br>
If you look over the episode, this episode featured virtually zero character interaction or character progression. It was everyone running down the corridors at different times, reacting to the deadly menace. Thank the Divine I never had to sit through a Next Generation episode as deadly dumb as this. A writer on any decent SciFi show would have been fired for turning in something this stupid. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>With all the emotional stress of a major character dying in every possible future, I really didn't get the sence that these people cared for each other.

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BINGO!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> My brother noticed this too, if I could award you a prize I would. One moment, it's a heart rending moment for the crew as Harper dies. Then immediately afterwards, Beka and Dylan are cracking jokes. No, they are not covering their grief, it's clearly a case where the writing for one segment forgot what just happened in the prior segment. That's a deadly mistake, considering the nature of the episode.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Could you guys please show alittle morning or something. It just killed any drama that the deaths caused.

<br>
Brain-dead writing leads to brain-dead characterization. There's nothing to praise about the juxtaposition of these two scenes, having an editor on the show might have caught this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And my last biggie, did anyone one else notice how the final future was at the cost of many other crew member's death. You know the dissaparing crew.

<br>
Hey, they only signed onto the ship to get to earth, as stated in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Lone and Level Sands.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> We had it confirmed by one of the writers on the Official Board that this is the crew from the Bellerophon. They were only passengers onroute to earth, and look what they died for. <br>
<br>
The writing on this show is so brain-damaged, we never even got any reports on how many of the crew died from the vacuums opening up last week. Rommie reported they were all over the ship, but not a word (or an appearance) by the human crew. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>As long as the main crew is ok, it doesn't seem to matter how many &quot;red shirts&quot; die. THIS is the exact reason I hate having nameless crew on a ship.

<br>
If the command staff doesn't care or even act like there is a human crew on board (which varies from week to week), why should we? All I see are endless scenes of Dylan Hunt running through deserted hallways, and I wonder where the crew is, humans or robot drones. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>OK, there's my two cent.

<br>
The best episodes this season have been their work. There are only two possibilities with this episode. One wonders if ZackAsh were aiming for a scorched-earth policy on their way out, or was this just the victim of bad upper management?<br>
<br>

<br>
I am bending over backwards this season, trying not to expect or want too much out of this show. But when they blatantly rip off one of the better Next Generation episodes, and then mangle it so badly in execution, the gloves are off.<br>
<br>
This show is in the toilet, and I feel like all I'm doing sometimes is stirring the pot. Maybe I should just watch Mad TV on Saturday nights instead of writing these reviews, I don't know. A lot of people seem to be lapping this stuff up, when they know this is nowhere near the quality of the first season.

I thought it was interesting.  The interesting thing was, of course, Trance.  But I was rather baffled by the science - (and we need you in AU QUICK!)<br>
<br>
The truth is that this is as good as it's going to get for Drom - Zack &amp; Ashley write an interesting story from Trance's perspective.  The ailien is no worse than any other we've been getting (and probably better than anything coming in Season 4), and so I'm determined to enjoy what's left of something that mostly resembles Old Drom, before we lose the last of the writers who knew what Drom was supposed to be.<br>

<br>
Not every single ep of every show has to advance a story line (not that there even IS a story line on this show anymore and that's hardly Ash and Zack's fault).  But in the end in this ep something DID happen.  Eventually they did encounter the creature and they defeated it.  But more importantly, FINALLY we got a real glimpse of Trance and how very alien she really is.<br>
<br>
Was it perfect?  No.  The new crew members thing has been bugging the hell out of me since it happened and I would definitely have liked to know more about the villain. But the first is a production issue over which the writers have no control and the latter is a function of the mythos behind this show having been gutted by Tribune and Fireworks.  Despite that it's a well written, well acted 42 minutes of television that features the crew working together as a team and gives some much needed insight into what has hitherto been the most underdeveloped character on the show.<br>

<br>
There is a point that I maintained over on the old SS, and it's this: Engels and whoever else in charge is actually trying to manage a story arc this season, but they're being so murky and obtuse about it that its almost impossible to see.  Engel, as discussed before is responsible for the 2nd season of Twin Peaks, and that was a disaster.<br>
<br>
That being said, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TDB</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> actually explained a lot of things about the show...things stretching back all the way to S1.  I smell RHWs genius at work here; TPTB have taken the hidden concepts of Trance and put them to work in this ep, I believe.<br>
<br>
The crux of this ep is the old argument of Free Will vs. Fate.  Even Dylan stops to reflect on it, commenting that choices belong to us, the rest is fate.  That statement sidesteps the whole debate: do we have Free Will in our lives, or are we at the mercy of a predetermined schedule of events and suffering under the illusion that we have some control?  Here, Trance is portrayed as outside of all events manipulating them...because she is driving Dylan Hunt to the &quot;one perfect possible future.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why Dylan?  Uh...besides the fact that Kevin Sorbo has top billing, it's already been shown that Hunt is the one to &quot;lead our armies in the battle to come&quot; whatever that cryptic shit means.   Was one of the original concepts of the show an Armageddon-like battle between the Authors of Creation and the Spirit of the Abyss (no, not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Lil</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->...the OTHER Spirit Of The Abyss...)???  Or is this a recent invention of TPTB?  Is Trance an agent of Creation?  It's been speculated that she is the spirit of a sun, but would a sun have the physical properties allowing it to mull over multiple futures?  A black hole would, since time stops on its edge...is Trance a rogue black hole?  Perhaps the one that originally trapped Dylan?  Nahhh.....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TDB</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, like many eps this season, was ripe with potential, and used more of that potential than others, but dropped the ball on so many things...usually little things.  As <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ogami</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> pointed out, the bad guy looks like Darth Vader, or more like Sauron IMHO.  The Ninja security guys hiding behind Tyr needed to stay at home if that's the best they could do.  Also, as our thread author pointed out, the rewind sequences got a little tiresome, and as in &quot;Cause &amp; Effect&quot; should have been shot from different angles each time.

Well it's as I have ALWAYS maintained...  Trance is a damned manipulator.  It's why I NEVER liked her from the beginning.  No one else really matters but Trance and her manipulation of time, space, and character actions.<br>
<br>
They're all just puppets on Trance's string.<br>

If I was on the Andromeda and felt that I was being so used and manipulated like that I would dump Trance out the nearest airlock ASAP. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
Let me lay this out for you.<br>
<br>
Andromeda, unfortunately, is not run like a normal show.<br>
<br>
On most shows, staff writers get to actually go to the set to supervise shoots of their episodes, precisely for the purpose of seeing to the integrity of their scripts.<br>
<br>
Sadly, this is not the case for Andromeda, a show in which yours truly has spent as much time on the set as Zack Stentz (he told me so).  And that was one whole day.<br>
<br>
On Andromeda, the writers sit in LA while the actors and about six other people make &quot;notes&quot; on their scripts.  Unfortunately the final arbitor of which notes stay is NOT the script writer.  Thus you end up with things like the &quot;Dylan is the only thing that can save us&quot; or things like ninja security men or things like silly technical errors like equating light seconds with real time seconds.<br>
<br>
In short:  these are things that are ultimately NOT within the writers' control.<br>
<br>
Bob Engels doesn't &quot;get&quot; science fiction.  When I had lunch with the man he expressed real fear of fans who glom on to technical issues and he looked about ready to bolt when I told him about the Star Trek Technical Manual.  And unfortunately he is not only one of the six (along with Sorbo) executive producers of the show, he is also the head writer and he is not interested in science or making the science even coherent.  That is why you get bullshit like Wheel with it's technobabble fixes to space tunnels (written by Bob Engels), or Delenda Est (which for the life of me I do not understand ANYONE who wants science in their fiction liking) which features miniature space tunnels in the ship that can be cured by firing force lances at them (also written by Bob Engels).  He's the guy the buck stops with.<br>

<br>
LOL, spoken like a true Tyrant!<br>
<br>
Actually, if I were Trance, I would keep these little insights about herself under wraps for just that reason.  I'm amazed she admitted it to Dylan at the end.  <br>
<br>
But then, she could always go back and fix it...<br>

It's annoying as hell.<br>
<br>
The manipulation thing is where the whole Tyrant/Trancer split started you know...<br>
<br>
That's why I couldn't stand Trance.  It wasn't the hotpant or the ditzy attitude...  It was the fact that it was all an act and that she was manipulating people mercilessly.<br>
<br>
If there's one thing I cannot stand in a person, it's that.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
