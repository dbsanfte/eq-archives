I'm agnostic, but I tend to lean towards there being nothing after death.  I think it is &quot;lights out&quot;, but I know that there is a chance I could be wrong.  Everyone seems to have a different concept of heaven, and everyone seems to have a different set of rules for getting into heaven.  So, here is my thought:<br>
<br>
Many people feel that if you don't have faith, or if you sin, then you won't get into heaven.  Heaven is described as the ideal place where you will basically feel total exhiliration and be happy for all eternity.  My idea of heaven would be spending an eternity with my husband and son, and anyone who loves their family feels the same way.  Well, let's say I decide tomorrow that I have total faith, and that I live by every single rule in the bible in order to gain passage to heaven.  Now let's say that my husband and son don't follow the same path.  I go up to heaven, but they aren't allowed in.  How can this truly be heaven for me when I have to live through an eternity without the two people I love most?  An eternity without my loved ones would be hell for me.  So, would they get in anyway in order to reward me, or do I get punished regardless of how faithful and good I was?  If I don't get in, then what about my loved ones who went before me that would suffer by watching me get sent below?  Doesn't this seem inconsistent to some people, or is there some other explanation that the various religions have come up with?  I'm just curious.<br>

<br>
I've said this before:  It's no fun thinking of loved ones spending eternity in torment...but either I acknowledge it, or I deny Jesus, because He taught frequently of it.  I can't deny Jesus; the evidence for me is too strong that He is who He claimed to be.  So I've got to accept hell.<br>
<br>
God offers Christ, freely and openly.  For me, it's more difficult to understand how a holy and just and good God could allow anyone to go to heaven when everyone deserves hell because all have sinned against Him (Rom. 3:23)<br>
<br>
I don't like the idea that hurricanes sometimes level hundreds of homes and kill scores of people in a single swipe.  But just because I don't like it doesn't deny the reality of it...the same applies to hell.<br>
<br>
THose in heaven are blessed and living in the present, not the past.  I don't see it as possible for those who live in an eternal present to regret and mourn the dead past.<br>

<br>
Candy - the one problem I have with your analogy is that God supposidely isn't an unthinking uncaring force of nature. He is suppose to be the Father of us all. What type of father banishes his children from his sight to an eternity of torture and torment? Most people I know of would call a father like that abusive. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My ideal heaven.... hmmmmm I don't know. Time to study and learn. Gain knowledge, enjoy loved ones, learn to create (paintings, music, poerty, not life). To finally have the damned answers to all those unanswered questions. And lastly, to look at all those fundies who think they were better then everyone else and go &quot;neener neener&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Even then, I'm not sure if those will remain in a sort of hell as most Christians define it today.<br>
<br>
As already alluded to, I cannot believe that a God who is defined as &quot;love&quot; in His scriptures would damn most of the world to hell.  It makes no sense to me.<br>
<br>
I like to think of heaven as a place where loved ones reunite, and we can further our understanding on spiritual and physical things.  But who's to say what it will be like?  I've often wondered if it will be more a matter of us, energy beings, changing into another form of energy when we die.  I guess in that sense, I also wonder about reincarnation.<br>
<br>
Interesting to ponder...<br>

It makes no sense to me to say, &quot;God loves us *so* much that he gives us these complex minds to search and ponder, but if you happen to choose the wrong religion He will banish you to eternal suffering.&quot;  I don't see how anyone who sees God as a loving parent (father) can relate to this--can any of us imagine sentencing our children to spend eternity in hell, no matter what they did?  And my belief is that the love I have for my daughter comes from God, so His love for us must be all the more perfect.<br>
<br>
I also don't think of this belief as denying Jesus.  I have done a lot of research on the topic, and it seems the Bible was written for such specific audiences and has been changed and edited so much to fit certain groups' agendas that what Jesus truly said and meant is not well represented in the Bible we have today.  <br>

<br>
We believe that when you die, your spirit leaves your body and goes to the spirit world.  We believe you retain your own personality and tendencies that you have on earth.  We believe that missionary work is going on there too and that many people will hear the Gospel there.  They will have an opportunity to accept it.  However, they will still have to exercise faith because Christ is not living in the spirit world.  The time spent in the spirit world is usually what the bible is talking about when it refers to hell.  It's more of a state of mind than hellfire and brimstone.  And it's not permanent.  When Christ returns to earth in all his glory, the resurrection will begin.  After we are resurrected we will be judged according to our works, knowledge and the desires of our hearts.  We will then be placed in a degree of glory.  The Celestial Kingdom is where God dwells.  Christ rules the Terrestrial Kingdom and the Telestial kingdom has the influence of the Holy Ghost.  All 3 are part of &quot;heaven&quot; and where we will spend eternity.  We will continue to learn and grow and we will be with our families.  We're also taught that everyone will be happy/comfortable with where they end up.  <br>
<br>
There is a 4th place where Satan and his followers will spend eternity.  This is outer darkness.  It is reserved for Satan and the spirits that followed him and never received a body.  Also for the sons of perdition.  These are people who had a sure knowledge of Christ and then denied his existence.  The Bible referrs to it as blaspheming the Holy Spirit.  <br>

BUT I have not been able to let go of the idea of continuing somehow when we die though. I think that when we die, we (or our internal energy) all baiscally go to the same place (another dimention if you will). I am not exactyly sure what this dimention is all about, but the thought of it keeps me from accepting that we just fade to nothingness. I do not believe that this place is a paradise or even a hell. I just think of it as another existance.<br>
<br>
When I was xian, I tried to accept the fact that not everyone went to heaven. I had a very hard time tryingto accept the fact that not everyone I loved would be there, YET every time someone died, I was told they were in heaven. It is a comforting thought to think that you will see your dead relatives again and some people take comfort in knowing that people like Dahmer(sp?) will be in hell. It is something to make life easier to bare.<br>

My guess is we blink out, but if there is an afterlife, I think it is a part of nature, and it is our biology that puts us there, not our actions/beliefs. So yeah, everyone gets in. It would just be another form of existance, and I personally am awfully thankful for the little bit of time we have in the here and now...anything else would just be existental gravy.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kristymom2rainbaby>KristyMom2RaiNBaby</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200301101305160656.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/14/03 9:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200301121435423738.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Heaven: Do We All Go?</span><hr size=1> cool Leah!!  yeah she was unexpected on that day!! lol i was for sure I would go over my due date of 12/9 lol but nope she wanted to come! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-3-200301121455231859.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">Kristy</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:silver;">wife to Karl</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">mommy to Raianna 12/7/00</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:silver;">and Elyse 12/3/02</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
&quot;For me, it's more difficult to understand how a holy and just and good God could allow anyone to go to heaven when everyone deserves hell because all have sinned against Him (Rom. 3:23)&quot;<br>
<br>
I find your view on this consistent with Christianity. After all, there is no need of salvation without hell. When people say they don't really believe there iIS a hell, I wonder what they think Christ saves them from.  However, I am curious how you feel about the theological issues I discussed in a post titled &quot;Salvation Theory.&quot;<br>
Here's the thread:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessage?topicID=60.topic">pub98.ezboard.com/freligi...D=60.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Specifically, I am struggling to understand how &quot;a holy and just and good God&quot; creates people who are too flawed to live up to his rules, or conversely, creates rules that he knows are too difficult for his people to live up to. I also can't see how the death (or maybe resurrection?) of an innnocent atones for the past, present and future sins of all mankind.<br>
<br>
I am hoping you will elaborate.<br>
<br>

I don't see it as possible for those who live in an eternal present to regret and mourn the dead past.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, you would just consider your children your &quot;dead past&quot;?  If my child chokes on his lunch today, then I will never think of him as my &quot;dead past&quot;.  I will always love him, and will always retain the changes he has made to my life.  I don't see how this would be different in heaven.  Maybe I'm not fully grasping the concept since I don't really believe in heaven, but I just couldn't bear living through an eternity without him.  I couldn't really say that he wouldn't be part of my present, because he would have shaped my present.  Our children are part of who we are, and if our soul would have been good enough to get into heaven, then our children get credit for shaping that soul.  Heaven just wouldn't be heaven without my little guy.  If he can't go, then I wouldn't want it anyway.<br>

If you believe the bible for what it says then thats a big NO!  <br>
There are TONS of scripture to back that up.  I'll give one<br>
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world THROUGH him might be saved.  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br>

<br>
I truely do not understand this whole thing about sending his son to die so that we (2000 years later) can be forgiven, etc. etc.  It's not the wording that I don't understand (I'm not thick <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) - I just can't get my head around the concept.<br>
<br>
Also if god is all knowing, all seeing then he would have already known that Adam would eat from the tree and cause all the trouble etc.. why would he have had to have taken &quot;drastic steps&quot; by sending himself (or his son...that's another thing I don't understand), when in reality he would have known what the situation would be in advance?<br>
<br>
Like I said..I'm not jumping on you....I would just like to at least know where people are coming from when they quote these things - and I'd rather not have to go and sit through a sermon to find out! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.growthspurts.com/drivee/images/434360233606.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=momluvsum>Mom luvs um</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/14/03 8:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: heaven</span><hr size=1> Gaia25,<br>
God made man to have a free will.  Before Christ people had to follow the law and do sacrifices all the time.  He sent his Son so that we may be reconciled unto Him.  God says he loves us so much that he sent his son.  Its called grace.<br>
Someone defined grace as this:<br>
Grace is basically unmerited favor--God's choosing to love us, save us, and bless us while we are yet in our sins. Because of grace, we can receive something for nothing. Ephesians 2:8-9 says that we are SAVED by grace, and John 1:14 tells us that the Lord Jesus was full of GRACE and TRUTH. Someone has said that grace is God's Riches At Christs' Expense.<br>
The word is also used in reference to the present dispensation in which we live, the &quot;dispensation of the grace of God&quot; (Eph. 3:2).<br>
 <br>
   <br>
The bible says Is 55:8 that  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.<br>
there are just things we are not going to fully understand until we get to heaven.  <br>
