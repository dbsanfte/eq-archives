I was raised LDS, but I will tell you the things that to me are appealing outside of the spiritual/emotional.<br>
<br>
First, I think it is the only church in existance today that has all of the things that were taught in the new testament.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Christ organized the Church. Eph. 4:11-14<br>
2. The Church must bear the name of Christ. Eph. 5:23<br>
3. The Church must have a foundation of Apostles and <br>
Prophets. Eph. 2:19-20<br>
4. The Church must have the same organization as Jesus' <br>
Church. Eph. 4:11-14<br>
5. The Church must claim divine authority. Heb. 5:4-10<br>
6. The Church must have no paid ministry. Isa. 45:13,<br>
1 Peter 5:2<br>
7. The Church must baptize by immersion. Matt. 3:13-16<br>
8. The Church must bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost by <br>
the laying on of hand. Acts 8:14-17<br>
9. The Church must practice divine healing. Mark 3:14-15<br>
10. The Church must teach that God and Jesus are seperate and <br>
distinct individuals. John 17:11, John 20:17<br>
11. The Church must teach that God and Jesus have bodies of <br>
flesh and bone. Luke 24:36-39, Acts 1:9-11<br>
12. The Church officers must be called of God. Heb. 5:4, <br>
Exodus 40:13-16<br>
13. The Church must claim revelation from God. Amos 3:7<br>
14. The Church must be a missionary church. Matt. 28:19-20<br>
15. The Church must be a restored church. Acts 3:19-20<br>
16. The Church must practice baptism for the dead. 1Cor. 15-16 <br>
and 29<br>
17. By their fruits ye shall know them. Matt. 7:20<br>
<br>
<br>
And then you have the Book of Mormon.  If you read it you can see that a teenage, youngadult without a formal education cold not have written this book.  There are also things like the fact that the book was found buried in a stone box, before other stone boxes were found by archeologists.  The description of landscape and travel distances that exist in the area (Israel) that is in the book, and Joseph Smith had not been to Israel at the time the book was published.<br>
<br>
Then the whole purpose of life and the fact that we are God's  children and we can grow to be like Him.  It is the cycle of life. Parents have children, those children grow up to be like their parents and the cycle goes on.  The fact that the fall of Adam was already planned for before the earth was even created and in fact, was part of the plan so that we can live and grow by our experiences. The role of the Savior to suffer for our sins (basically take the punishment so we can become free from the stains of those sins _ see &quot;the file room&quot; on the other side of this board)  It is just so perfectly planned out.  Knowing that my life is not just a random event is very satisfying.<br>
<br>
We dont discuss the temple ceremony much outside the temple, but it gives very symbolic instruction that is very layered (much like the parables that Christ taught in the NT and the more prepared you are spiritually, the better you understand it. Like deep literature that makes you think and challenges your intellect.<br>
<br>
A great book to read is called Jesus the Christ, by James E Talmage one of the greatest intellectual minds ever.  It helps if you have a good background in Greek and Latin roots.  <br>
<br>
If you want to read another great LDS intellect, Elder Neal A Maxwell is just incredibly bright.  I have to stop taking notes when he speaks because his words are really composed not written and it takes all my energy to just absorb what he is saying.    <br>
<br>
Ok so that is a good start.  I also think that the perfect organizational structure and consistent way of teaching &quot;all the flock (11 million of us) around the world is representative of the perfect order that God showed as he created the world.  He is a God of order and His church is a church of order and planning.  anyway that is something to chew on for a while. Have fun.  If you wanted to check out Elder Maxwell, go to LDS .org and check out the conference records there.  do a search and just type in his name and all of his stuff will come up or you could go to Deseret Book. com and find the books he has written ( you can find Jesus the Christ there too.) - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=minusrusty>minusRusty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#3333ff>(5/15/03 11:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=203.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hi KMT.

Because I have a son and I wanted him to be exposed to an organized religion without all of the dogma and structure the Catholic Church where I was raised.

Why is meeting with likeminded people, and being exposed to different ways of thought, all with no pressure to ever conform to what we hear, or ever to profess something we don't believe in...I see it as no different than going to a humanist meeting. I like knowing I am surrounded by people who have interesting experiences and perspectives to bring to the table, so to speak.... The sermons are amazing. Really thoughtful, and I like the way it opens the world for my children to celebrate the differences among people.<br>
<br>
Do you know what the modern UU church is like? There's no dogma, and you don't have to profess belief in anything. That's not the focus.<br>
<br>
I was suspicious when I first heard about it, but now that I belong, I totally understand how empowering it can be. It's like going to school on Sunday for a fascinating lesson. Some of it really makes me think, and I have learned so much about what makes others tick.<br>
<br>
Anyways, it works for me, so I guess that's what  is most important.....Perhaps I'd feel differently if my congregation wasn't mainly atheist.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Mony</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(5/16/03 9:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=203.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   UUism</span><hr size=1> I'm a pagan UU--and it does seem as though the majority of our church are atheist or have pagan/buddhist leanings, although I know we have one former Methodist minister attending.

Yeah--I recommended UU/UUA to my pagan friend and her local one was more than half xian and it showed. Liberal xian to be sure, but she found the discussion groups to be more like church ones and it just wasn't her cup of tea. When she tried to explain why she left xianity and found it mysoginistic, she just had to leave, but did find one other atheist guy there she liked. From what I hear it depends highly on where you live, but then I keep telling her to move anyway<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There is a difference between sermons and discussions and bible studies and humanist groups, but since I go to neither I suppose I can't speak to whether Humanist groups get preachy. My initial reaction to atheists in church was the same, but I say--to each his own. I totally disagree that you need to have kids experience church to understand religion (if not, what about alcohol, drugs, unprotected sex????...seems an odd method only used for religion), but again--parents should instruct their children how they see fit, including moral instruction. UUA seems to make many people happy, and those that still yearn for the rituals and traditions of religion without the spirituality seem to find this works very well in many places.<br>
<br>
P.S. Like I said, I'm too meeting'd out and lazy to make it even to the local Atheist or Humanist gatherings so far, but wouldn't that be more of a like minded place for atheists? I can see in churches that everyone has the same doctrine, but a pagan/atheist/Jew/xian have such very different belief systems it woudl seem more of a learning center than church....semantics I suppose. Maybe that's what Rusty meant.<br>

<br>
Yes, ST, pretty much.<br>
<br>
The terms &quot;church&quot; and &quot;sermon&quot; have much more of a religious meaning, and &quot;atheism&quot; has much more of a religious-rejection conotation. One can go on and on about &quot;atheism&quot; being simply a disbelief or lack of belief in god/s, but the much more typical atheist tends to reject more religiousity and religious association than that nominal definition.<br>
<br>
Also, using terms like &quot;church&quot; and &quot;sermon&quot; is more distinguishing, if you will, than more nominally &quot;social&quot; groups.<br>
<br>
But like I said, if it suits you, no skin off of my nose.<br>

We also aren't technically a &quot;church&quot; but a society (and the UUA is an association).  It's just a heck of a lot easier to say &quot;church&quot; than to go into a long spiel with people.  <br>
<br>
I decided I wanted to attend a regular weekly service, not because I missed the rituals, but I missed the community.  My fondest memories growing up are being part of our neighbourhood church--ham &amp; bean suppers, junior choir, ringing the bells after service.  I want that for my children.  Our church is also very active on social issues and I like knowing that my kids will be growing up in a community that puts caring actions behind its words.  <br>
<br>
As for the services, I wouldn't call it so much a &quot;learning center&quot;.  There is a segment of the religious education program that focuses exclusively on the various world faiths, during which the kids (12-13 yo) visit churches, synogogues, buddhist retreats, etc.  But aside from that, the services are not about comparing one religion to another or offering mini-lectures on belief systems.  Some do have a scholarly bent, topics like the Book of Thomas or similarities between the mythical stories of various cultures.  But mostly they are reflections on aspects of the human condition--love, war, loss, joy, pride, our relationships with nature and each other...  No, there is no dogmatic spirituality here, but it does offer time during the week to focus on those things that are larger than our own individual lives, that we all participate in in some way or another.  After a while of being bogged down with the day-to-day stuff, I know I need that hour or so to get outside myself and my own little world, to focus on the bigger life stuff.<br>

That's exactly how I would describe it. I use the colloquial terms of sermon and church, just because it makes it more accessible, but my UUA is just how you explained yours..... <br>

First, the word church means--<br>
 a building for public and especially Christian worship<br>
2 : the clergy or officialdom of a religious body<br>
3 : a body or organization of religious believers: as a : the whole body of Christians b : DENOMINATION c : CONGREGATION<br>
4 : a public divine worship &lt;goes to church every Sunday&gt;<br>
5 : the clerical profession &lt;considered the church as a possible career&gt;  <br>
<br>
Please note that even if not xian, a church is a body of &quot;believers&quot; and though you can share beliefs or be like-minded and gather, this does not equal church...a meeting/political party/quorum/association etc. So for the person that pointed out UUA is an association, I guess it wouldn't apply if it's not called church.<br>
<br>
Coupla reasons why it strikes me as illogical to say, &quot;you need to have kids experience church to understand religion&quot;:<br>
<br>
1. There is a big difference between studying something and participating in it--especially harmful things like drugs, smoking, religion...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Do parents who use this argument apply the same logic to other life lessons? I haven't met one, but perhaps. <br>
What I suspect is really at hand is exposing kids to the social benefits of religion as perceived or missed by the parents (beanie dinners and fellowship). This is where I split with these other atheist parents, I don't see this part of going to church as a &quot;gift&quot;, rather indoctrinating kids into the &quot;fun&quot; parts of religion that will make it more difficult for them to leave it later or more likely they will fall into it as adults. For many questioning religion, it is not strict theology, but the social consequences and missing of holiday fun that holds them back from making the break.<br>
<br>
2. The argument is applied to xian or xian based churches mostly, so it also seems illogical to me as the only &quot;religion&quot; being exposed here is xian. I do know of a few atheists who attend Buddhist Temples and one who goes to Synagogue, but in both cases the children are exposed to xian celebrations and theology by other family and, sadly in public schools as well.<br>
<br>
3. If you're not looking for the tradition or routine of church, the chicken dinner/fellowship stuff, and can research, teach and discuss religion without the aid of a minister or person who attended seminary at home, then church seems to be what I think most religious folks see it as---a place of worship. Why do I need to take my child to a place of worship to understand what prayer and worship is? If I want her to learn about other religions the best place is from me, a formal education, the library or a person of that religion.<br>
<br>
An elderly online atheist buddy of mine who is in her 80's once advised not to hide our atheism or make it like a secret or something to be ashamed of when we were struggling around the holidays. She's the one who first used the phrase &quot;let's not raise them to be religious apologists&quot; and it really struck me. I could see the difference in dd right away when we stopped telling her to not mention about not believing in god or Santa or the Tooth Fairy. <br>
<br>
For us, taking her to church would seem to be conceding that we need this religious activity to fit in, feel good and be like others because we miss the feelings and associations of church. I don't want to do that and honestly do feel it is incongruous for atheist parents, who largely agree the motivation is based in some longing for things they got from regular xian churches. That's essentially why I disagree with the logic of the assertion quoted above both from a teaching/educational and atheist parenting perspective.<br>

What do they believe in? And who says it has to be Christian?<br>
<br>
That hasn't been true of UU churches for hundreds of years.  <br>
<br>
Yes, We are the Unitarian Universalist Association.  But it's an association of churches/societies/congregations/fellowships.  The Association is the large governing body.  I grew up in a UU church, and now we attend a congregation.  It's semantics.  We are a recognized religious denomination.  Some UU groups choose not to be members of the Association.  <br>
<br>
We have sermons, we have worship.  I'm an atheist.  I do not have to worship a darn thing.  I can if I choose.  Everyone can.  You could cross yourself if you felt the need after a sermon.  No biggie.<br>
<br>
We have ordained ministers.  We have our own seminaries.  Why? We have our own way of doing things; and while there are those who'd disagree, we have our own belief system (gays deserve equal rights, Jesus was a man, no trinity, Bible is a nice book to read...)  Only our seminaries fully reflect our values.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and though you can share beliefs or be like-minded and gather, this does not equal church.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Why not?  There are hundreds of thousands who disagree.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What I suspect is really at hand</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
So we're judging a system we know nothing about?  And who says the kids are only being exposed to xian stuff?  Yes, we indoctrinate our children.  We pound it into their head that no religion has all the answers, no one religion is perfect or 100% true.  We pound it into them that they are the sole source of knowing what they choose to believe.  We teach them what other religions believe.  We teach them to ask questions.<br>
<br>
The &quot;fun part of religion'? Again I am confused.  Church is fun, learning is fun, being with friends is fun.  Can I tech my child all this at home? yes, in a very isolated, one sided kind of way.<br>
I prefer my child to learn about LDS from those who have left the church and found UUism, same goes for Judiasm, and all the other isms.  I prefer my child to learn about Wican and Pagan rituals, from Pagan and Wicans with UU values- who will approach the lessons from the stand point of &quot;this is what I believe&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm also not sure where the holiday stuff comes into the UU churches.  We celebrate just about every special day that is on (and off) the calendar- in our own way of course (ie- for hte past 2 yrs, it's been Mary and Josephine; this yr they sought shelter in the Statosphere Hotel Casino)<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not aware of an Atheist UU who is hiding their atheism.  There are some who I don't know if they are atheist or not, but for me it's really a question of not caring- they're UU, whether they are agnostic, humanist... really doesn't matter to me.<br>
<br>
I don't attend the UU church out of some longing for something lost.  I have never belonged to another religion.  I attend because the UU beliefs are what is in my heart and mind.  <br>
<br>
I can also assure you, we are not raising our children to be religious apologists.  Quite the opposite.<br>
<br>
As a former Director of Religious Education, a UU of 30+ years, a lay minister and a soon to be seminary student,  I'll gladly answer any questions you have.  I don't however particuarly enjoy assumptions made about the UU religion, especially by someone who is claiming they are the best person to teach their child about religion.<br>

“First, who says church is a building of believers?”<br>
Merriam-Webster-the dictionary from which I quoted. Sorry I should have footnoted that.<br>
<br>
“What do they believe in? And who says it has to be Christian?”<br>
I suppose that depends, and noone said it had to be xian, though most other religions use another word that is similar in meaning like temple, synagogue, mosque…<br>
<br>
“It's semantics. We are a recognized religious denomination. Some UU groups choose not to be members of the Association.”<br>
<br>
Do they then get the tax breaks of a religion and church? That would be a big difference then between them and the Az Humanists that meet at the buffet every month that someone asked about. <br>
Those that are choosing not to fall under the umbrella of a “recognized religious denomination” are probably more the groups most folks here go to that are more secular then, but still I personally feel the semantics are important. As I also said at least 3 times here, UU varies wildly so the one I referred my friend to was mostly xian and did have prayer etc….perhaps they were the religious type.<br>
 <br>
”We have sermons, we have worship. I'm an atheist.”<br>
This has nothing to do with the question asked of me, but it is the part Rusty and I find incongruous. Like we both keep saying though—if you want to be an atheist and worship and go to seminary and follow an established belief system of a “recognized religious denom” then you should do what makes you happy.<br>
<br>
”And who says the kids are only being exposed to xian stuff?”<br>
Not me. The celebrations are certainly more Am xian in tradition even if the pagan roots are explained in the sermons, but still not fasting over Ramaddan or Diwali. I betcha more kids in UU do the Santa thing than pray 5X a day to Muhammed…that’s what I meant by xian traditions. <br>
What I DID say was that the people I KNOW who take their children to xian churches (as opposed to UU) don’t also take their children to temples, mosques, synagogues etc. and so their arguments to me that they are teaching about religion don’t wash since it’s only one religion they are exposing them to.<br>
<br>
”I prefer my child to learn about Wican and Pagan rituals, from Pagan and Wicans with UU values- who will approach the lessons from the stand point of &quot;this is what I believe&quot;”<br>
<br>
As do I, but this has nothing to do with taking them to church. My children know pagans, xians of all strains, Jews and Muslims. We just don’t attend these churches or pray with them.<br>
<br>
”I don't attend the UU church out of some longing for something lost. I have never belonged to another religion. I attend because the UU beliefs are what is in my heart and mind.”<br>
I believe you, but another person here (sorry, can’t remember who) said she DOES go because of the fellowship, church dinners etc. she misses and this is the sentiment I was addressing. I should have been more clear that I was answering the general question KMT posed and not specifically talking about UU with every sentence. Why adults go to a church is also separate from why they might take children or expose them for the purposes of educating, which is what KMT asked me about.<br>
<br>
”I don't however particuarly enjoy assumptions made about the UU religion, especially by someone who is claiming they are the best person to teach their child about religion.”<br>
You may take issue with my assumptions about UU, and with my UU friends who may be lying to me or have the opposite experiences you do, but in what way does that make me not the best person to teach my child about religion? Is not every parent the best person to provide moral instruction and all others resources?<br>
<br>
Look—my point here was not to get into a doctrinal debate over UU—we could do that in another thread, but frankly I don’t care what UU believe. Sounds a lot like my sister’s Episcopal Church which is quite liberal and sounds nice, but still church and doctrine.  As you said yourself, you have your own beliefs and that’s why you have seminary like other recognized religions. I've said several times that I find it incongruous, but also if it works for you then do it.<br>
<br>
The question I was answering was why I don’t agree that you have to take your children to church to teach them about religions. I don't see anything in your response that refutes that.<br>

<br>
I looked through the thread and haven't been able to find this quote about having to take your kids to church to teach them about religion.  If you're referring to when I said, &quot;I like knowing that my kids will be learning about all different beliefs systems without bias&quot; then know that my meaning and your interpretation are far apart.  I do not believe one must take their child to any church--UU or otherwise--to know what religion is or to gain a basic understanding of world religions and cultures.  If you are able to teach your children about other faiths in an unbiased way that promotes tolerance towards other, that is terrific.  And if you live in an area where there is religious diversity, even better still.  The latter is not an option for me.  Even if NH were a hotbed of multiculturalism (which it isn't), religion is not the kind of thing we just up and talk about with each other--we Yankees don't generally like to stir up controversy.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     I am fascinated by other religions, which is part of the reason I'm here--I better understand my own beliefs by understanding others'.  And I floundered around for years because I knew I wasn't a Xian, but didn't know what all else was out there.  I want my kids to know what is out there, and to feel free to choose what feels right to them without my interference.  In short, I want for them what I didn't have, and UU gives me that opportunity. <br>
<br>
&quot;I believe you, but another person here (sorry, can’t remember who) said she DOES go because of the fellowship, church dinners etc. she misses and this is the sentiment I was addressing.&quot;<br>
<br>
I believe that person was me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But please don't interpret my statement as implying that I am &quot;longing for something lost.&quot;  It's more about what I feel is important, and I think community is very important.  I truly believe that we do more good for each other and for this world when we come together--be it for a time of reflection, a peace rally, or a potluck supper.  By building a community of like-minded people, we are able to put forth that group effort toward things that we care about, including each other.  For me, this is totally different from the relationship I have with my friends, which is supportive and fun but not necessarily purposeful.  Again, if you don't care about this kind of thing, or you live in a place where there are other outlets for it, then that's great; some choose to seek community involvement through a UU group.  It doesn't stand to reason that they are either surreptitiously or subconsciously seeking out some kind of pseudo-Xian lifestyle to help them &quot;fit in&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>n what way does that make me not the best person to teach my child about religion? Is not every parent the best person to provide moral instruction and all others resources?&quot;<br>
<br>
I think you will agree that &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;moral instruction&quot; are two separate things. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds a lot like my sister’s Episcopal Church which is quite liberal and sounds nice, but still church and doctrine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since you've already stated that you don't care what UUs believe, perhaps you'd like to reserve judgement on our &quot;doctrine&quot; until you've taken time to read and understand it; what it sounds like to you and what it actually is may be two totally different things.  In fact, you are sounding eerily like some of those others who had no interest in reading up on Satanism because it &quot;sounds evil&quot;.<br>

So if we called it a UU temple it would be better?   <br>
<br>
UU's don't pray with their friends anymore than you do- regardless of which faith they identify more with (UU Pagan, UU Buddhist...).  Santa isn't Christian.<br>
<br>
Yes, UU churches get the &quot;tax break&quot; however, many many, many UU churches pay the tax anyway. Yup, they write the check and usually hand deliver it so it's not returned.<br>
<br>
There is no established belief system in the UU church; there is no doctrine, there is no creed.<br>
<br>
The part about you not knowing or seeing the difference between the Episcopal church and the UU church should be proof in itself that most parents aren't up to teaching their children about other religions.<br>
<br>
Do you teach history right out of the book, or tell verbal stories you recall from your schooling? Do you watch movies, or go visit the places?  Which is a better way to learn? By lecture and book, or by experience and life?  UU children do both.  We read about religions, we talk about them, we compare them, we debate them, we invite in those of that faith, and we visit them in their house of worship.  What better a way to turn a child off of Catholisim than to sit through mass with dead guys bleeding all around them?  Have you ever seen thousands during call to prayer?  Even without believing in what they are praying, it's an awesome experience to see that many people, act as one; be as one- an amazing sense of community.  Apparently our interpretation of education and teaching is different. (I could get into a whole Sabbath/Sunday vs society/culture/family thing right now, but I'll let it go.)<br>
<br>
I think you need to ask your friend about that &quot;prayer&quot;.  In no UU church will there be a led prayer to any diety of any kind.  The word prayer may be mentioned or quoted (as in the poem &quot;A Prayer for Our Children&quot;), but that's it.  Unless it's a Christian UU church of course, but that's another whole ball game (Christian UU as opposed to UU Christian)- they'll readily advertise/post that they are Christian though.<br>
