<br>
Alright, this is the character thread for the RoTK rp.  This is not like the game, but it is more similar to Dynasty Warriors in a way.  But the rules of the forum are as stands so please follow them.  <br>
<br>
1.  You may not create a character who is invincible IOW A guy clad in armor that weight 300 pounds total running at the speed of a skinny dude in no armor at all.<br>
<br>
2.  2 character limit!  But if your character dies, you may create a new one.  But if the character dies within a certain thread, they may not return to the thread.   <br>
<br>
3.  Keep profanity to a minimum, unless your character has a problem with the other.  <br>
<br>
4.  Have Fun (put the General RP rules here as well.)<br>
<br>
Alrighty, this is how the character profiles will go then.<br>
<br>
Name:<br>
Age:<br>
Gender:<br>
Height/Weight:<br>
Side: Wu/Shu/Wei(keep these sides until more join)<br>
Weapon of Choice<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  no more than two)<br>
Appearance:<br>
Fighting Style: (just make one up if you don't know one exactly)<br>
History:<br>
Motivation:<br>
Weakness<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  as in, are you strong? Intelligent? put a brief description)<br>
Strength: (same as Weakness, just vice versa)<br>
Personality:<br>
Skills: (Horseback, lancing, spearmanship, swordsmanship, stealth, assassin, archery, magic-limited-, strategy, firepower-manpower-)<br>
<br>
(As I have been said in the general rp rules, do not control another player.  If you attack give the character a chance to dodge, if the dodge is illogical, you may kill.  IF there are any other suggestions, please tell me.  Try to keep people off of the same side, we need more than all Shu)<br>
<br>
Sorry about this, I would like to add several things.  You can mix your skills, a limit to 3 skills per person unless otherwise advised.  I will set a list for what each one does.<br>
<br>
Horseback: Ability to ride a horse more well then some.<br>
Lancing: Ability to flank with a longated spear.<br>
Spearmanship: Ability to use a spear better than others. (those without it will have a less chance of winning against one with it.)<br>
Swordsmanship: Same as above, but with a sword. <br>
Stealth: Ability to slip in within a fortress or building with minimal detection, goes great with Assassin.<br>
Assassin: Ability to kill without sound or trail.  This is good for officer killing though if others have stealth, then it will be harder to kill.<br>
Archery: Ability to use a bow and arrow, or crossbow better than those without it.<br>
Magic: Ability to use magic, most can't do this.<br>
Strategy: More intelligence.  You may use this once every thread.  It is the ability to forsee a plan, if you are not around when a plan is being plotted, then you cannot make your men magically appear where they are going without Strategy as an ability.<br>
Manpower: Mostly for leaders, whom have the ability to call forth more masses of men.  Max: 1 legion=1000 men.<br>
<br>
Also, before I forget, you are allowed to have a title, such as Protector of the West.(but these have no meaning, just means you are an officer of a sort.)  And you may have relationships with other characters, or you may have one with several other RoTK characters(Zhou Yu, Xu Huang, etc.)  <br>
<br>
Next, I would like to point out that dodges are to be judged by an admin, a mod, or a GM(mostly me).  But if you feel that the dodge was logical, please PM me, I will try and get back to you ASAP.  <br>
<br>
I would also like to make a rule about the setting and the situation.  If you post something like (Wu and Wei are in a battle, Wei has full supply and twice as many men as Wu, the officer is on deathbed) then you will be pushed out of the thread and it will be deleted.  But if you post (Wu and Wei are in a battle at Xu Chang, both Wei and Wu are under strict pressure, battling through rain and trials, both seem to be at evens.  Wei may have more men, but Wu has the skill within them to succeed) Then this is acceptable.<br>
<br>
Finally, I would like to point out, fortresses.  If you are starting a thread(go ahead, its out of your free will) then you may have a fortress.  The fortress must not be impossible to break through, and must be within the provinces of the territory in which your kingdom resides.  Please follow these rules, or you will be thrown from the thread and told elsewise.<br>

One day while he was shopping for his mother he ran into someone new. There was something about this person, something that intrigued the boy. They were close in stature but the other was taller. The boy asked his name. The person was Guan Tao, who was 2 years older. The two became good friends and played together each day. Goergyboy became fascinated with the high virtues of his friend, and tried to mimic him. When they started to learn how to use weapons Goergyboy became fascinated with swords, while Guan Tao liked pole arms. When Goergyboy and Tao fought with swords Goergyboy would win, when they fought with polearms Tao would win, and when they both used their weapon of choice they were in a deadlock. Eventually Goergyboy choose the katana as his weapon of choice and began using one in each hand. He became known as the man with two swords. Then came the Yellow Turbans. Goergyboy and Tao entered the service and never seen each other again. Now Goergyboy is fighitng for the Sun family on the side of Wu, and has no clue of his old friend fate.<br>

When in combat he fights like a tiger, fierce and fast, with a blazing fire in his eyes. He always fights to the death, and never flees unless directly ordered to by his leige. <br>
