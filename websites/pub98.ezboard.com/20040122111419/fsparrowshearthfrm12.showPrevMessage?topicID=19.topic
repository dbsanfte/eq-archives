a few years ago my daughter had a kidney infection. she was in the hospital a few days and when she got out i had to give her medicine. she around 2 at the time.<br>
<br>
the first time i gave it to her she cried and barely got any. i tried to put it in ice cream..which worked a little better, but then read that you couldnt get the medicine that cold.<br>
<br>
finally i had to kneel down and hold her around her back...lean her back on my knee, get her head tilted back and wait till she would breathe in while crying then dump it in her mouth.  and it was lot of medicine...it was chalky and gross. but the doctor said she had to have it.<br>
<br>
when i would call her and tell her it was time to take the medicine she would come to me, stand there and say &quot;hold me&quot;, and lean back onto my arm. <br>
<br>
i hated doing it..it broke my heart to be the one who made her go through that and i would end up with tears in my eyes too.<br>
<br>
and i realized thats how God is with us. when we go through something he knows we have to..and he must feel the way i did. I just hope that i have the same trust and faith that she did. she would always come to me when it was time...she trusted me...and only wanted me to hold her when i did it.<br>

<br>
then she would say thank you to the nurse. <br>
<br>
my daughter teaches me as much as i teach her. <br>
<br>
another time she had a fever for a day and wouldnt eat or drink. When i put her to bed her diaper was dry and hadnt been changed for a long time. I was worried and thought i should have taken her to the Dr. And figured I'd be taking her in the morning. No liquids isnt good for that long a time. I couldnt sleep well at all and laid in my bed praying for her. I was alone in an area I didnt know well and far from home. <br>
<br>
The next morning i heard her talking and singing and went in. I asked how she felt...she told me Jesus had come to her room and healed and gave her water. I'm not one to quickly accept things that are said about that kind of thing. but she was better. Still...she may have gotten better anyway in that time. <br>
<br>
the thing that made me stop and think was when i went to change her....her diaper was soaked. And she hadnt had a thing to drink all night...and most the day before.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rheyanarose>Rheyana Rose</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/The_Attic/images/rose_bloom.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=green><b>Child of God<br>Lady of the Woodland</b></font></span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#B87333>(11/6/03 12:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/The_Attic/images/EOA_7d.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: my daughter teaches me about God</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>my daughter teaches me as much as i teach her. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->...I admire this open and childlike spirit of yours that is humble enough to receive learning even as a adult.

But yes, as adult we think in logical terms. The reason I say this is because when my daughter was 3, we were in the car about to drive off. She was talking softly with her head turned away from me. So I questioned her as to whom she was talking to. She said to me, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Shhhhh.
