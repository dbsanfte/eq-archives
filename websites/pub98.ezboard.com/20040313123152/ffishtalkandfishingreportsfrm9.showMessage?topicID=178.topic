Well first and formost even though the temps were chilly, Florida this time of year is still way better then Indiana!  But you all could guess that.<br>
<br>
My fishing buddy Marc and I flew down to Florida so he could compete in the Wal Mart FLW tournament.  He was fishing as a co-angler.  It was quite an experience to say the least.<br>
<br>
Day 1 (Wed) had him fishing with Pro Brennon Bosley and me making a 1hr 45min trip to Sarasota to see family.  Marc brought in 5 fish at 8lbs 2oz.  That put him around the 30th place out of 200 anglers for day one.  I watched as one of the Pro's pulled out a 9lbs 11oz TOAD.  Man that was a huge BASS!<br>
<br>
Day 2 (Thur) he fished with Pro Mike Wurm in the Crown Royal sponsored boat while I went fishing with an ol Math teacher who happens to spend winters on the big O.  Marc brought in 3 fish at 4lbs 8 oz which put him at 59th out of 200.  Not being in the top 10 also means he was done with this tournament.  Meanwhile my former teacher and I were catching some dinks here and there.  Maybe 15 fish for the whole day and the largest was a 2 1/2 lbs class fish.<br>
Not exactly what you go to the Big O for.  O and that was caught by him, not me.<br>
<br>
Day 3 (Fri) Since Marc was now out of the tournament, we once again fished with my old teacher.  He had a friend come along so we could have two boats.  Both Rangers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It was really a horrible fishing day.  Super windy. Cold, and a rotten bite to be sure.  I had one bite that came off before I got it to the boat and for all 4 of us there were not more then 10 fish I think.  The cold front that hit Thursday afternoon really turned them off.<br>
<br>
That was the end of our fishing.  On Saturday we went to Fort Lauderdale to the BASS Pro Shops to kill some time and since the IGFA fishing musuem was right there we went to that too.<br>
<br>
Overall, both Marc and I learned a lot.  Him from the Pros he fished with and I from the two experienced guys I fished with.<br>

<br>
Did you pick up anything at the BPS while you were there?  I'm also curious what techniques you and the math teacher were using to catch your fish.  Ofcourse if you don't mind sharing.

<br>
Those guys may have T-shirts on in that photo, but I can tell you that putting in at the boat ramp everyone was in damn near winter garb.  See pic <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.boomfish.com/1/fishing/2004_flw_okee/pages/2004_flw_okee-" target="top">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  I was in a t-shirt and that lady was dressed for Christmas. lol   It was cold especially on the lake.  When I went out Thursday morn, I had on a t-shirt   sweatshirt   light windbreaker jacket.  I was comfortable in that except for my hands and by about 10am I was down to just the T-shirt.  Lows were in the high 40's and highs were in the 60's.<br>
<br>
What was really funny though was when we were at the Cincinnati airport.  We had to go outside to board our plane and I only had a short sleeved polo shirt on.  The snow was blowing sideways and the temp was around zero.  The expressions and comments by people were entertainment enough for me to forget about the minor discomfort.<br>
<br>
The teach caught his big one on a very specific setup they do down there.  50lbs   Spiderwire with a 1 1/2 bullet weight / big hook and a Gambler BB Cricket Craw (blk/blu).  They have this mat stuff down there (hydrilla I think) that is uber thick.  What they do is flip into it.  Sometimes you have to toss the lure up high so it can actually punch through the mat.  The heavy line is to get the fish out of it, cause they ain't coming peacefully.  We didn't do that very long but if you were not sight fishing beds, then your best bet in getting large fish was with this technique.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, most people at the weigh in were using sinko's.  I mean like 4 to 1 over anything else I heard mentioned.  Most were getting hit on the fall.  Some on a slow retrieve.<br>
<br>
Now the teach and I also caught some on spinner bait (rippled water areas), watermelon colored generic lizard type deal, and flukes.  They rig there flukes with a 1/32 oz screw in weight Texas style.  Throw it out and let it fall, don't move it for like 20 seconds, then slow retrieve.  I can only assume this is very much what was happening with the sinko's people were using without weight. <p>//  b o o m f i s h . c o m<br>

I would bet that half of those won't say that on the networks.  They will say they are using one of their sponsor's similar products.<br>
<br>
I absolutely love flipping and pitching.  So Florida would be a great place for me to fish someday.  I just don't think I could get all my tackle on a flight.  Would probably have to drive down there to haul it all.  <br>
<br>
I guess it was a little colder than I thought.  That picture didn't come up in your link, but from what you describe with the winds the last day can make it cold.  Not as cold as the Cinny airport, but cold!<br>

There were a couple guys that I heard that did that.  Like a couple guys said how they used a Tiki Stick which is basically exact same thing.  However what I was watching was what they were taping for TV though.  I think it airs on the 15th of Feb.  Of course you know that the majority of what they air is going to be about the top 10 pro's who will of course only plug their sponsors.<br>
<br>
As an interesting side note.  They had this huge tent set up at Wal-Mart with all kinds of booths around it.  BF GoodRich, Minn-Kota, Pedigree, Solar-Bat, Ranger, etc etc etc, and they were handing out free nick knacks and doing stuff for kids.  It was cool.  While that was going on, they had stand in people playing pros and they were rehearsing the camera angles and comentary for the taping of the final weigh in.   Its funny that they have all these boats that just sit there till they are needed for sponsorship shots etc. <p>//  b o o m f i s h . c o m<br>
