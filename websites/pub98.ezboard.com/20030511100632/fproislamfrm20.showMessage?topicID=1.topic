Subject: Re: Your support of &quot;The Savage Nation&quot; <br>
 <br>
Jamal, <br>
<br>
I'm sorry to hear you won't be using our firm in the future. <br>
We are an advertiser and don't agree with everything any host says completely. I buy commercials on ABC,CBS,CNN etc. and don't agree with the hateful and bigoted speech I hear there but it doesn't preclude me from advertising with them for if It did I would have no medium to expose the public to our company. <br>
<br>
It has been our experience not to pay any attention to boycotts. Quite frankly they make me sick. Whether it is the Rev Jackson or Don WIldmon from American Family. They are based on extortion which I believe is very anti-American. <br>
I'm sure your intentions are pure and I appreciate you living out your convictions but boycotts normally hurt a lot of innocent employees of the companies that are targeted that have no dog in the fight. It cost people their jobs which is more hateful on behalf of the boycotters than the speech they oppose. <br>
<br>
If you need a referral of a company in our business that is not an advertiser on Savage we can provide you with one. <br>
I'm sorry if we have offended you in any way. That is not our intention. We merely buy ad space. If you think that is wrong you are entitled to your opinion. <br>
<br>
By the way, Our Jewish and minority employees take offense in your easy use of the words &quot;neo-nazi&quot; and &quot;fascist&quot; when referring to our firm. We are neither. We have contributed millions of dollars to charities that try to help people. That doesn't sound Nazi like to me. But I suppose that makes no difference to folks like you Jamal.  Maybe you should try some of the love you speak about on those you oppose versus the clearly  hateful tone you used in your message to me. It looks like a line letter to me anyhow. I have seen it hundreds of times since advertising on Savage. <br>
I suggest you get your facts straight before you openly attack us. To not sue our firm is your choice but to call us names because you don't like where we spend our ad money is not only childish but unfair. <br>
<br>

President <br>

As a corporation, your company has a responsibility to the community that you serve.  There are many media formats and outlets that are available to companies that are less hateful or disgusting than the savage nation.  By continuing to support this individual's hate speech through your dollars, you are contributing to an environment of fear, intimidation, and racism.I am sorry if boycotts make you sick. I find your support of Mike savage to be sickening as well.  You indicate that you are insulted by the un-American extortion-like appearance of boycotts, and yet you provide advertising dollars whose speech could not be more anti-American in its hate, its lack of plurality, and its appeal to the baser instincts of man.  <br>
<br>
It is not my intention to hurt your employees; it is my intention to bring to your attention that by supporting Mike Savage, you are supporting his views and opinions by association and through monetary promotion.  You are responsible for his voice across your neighborhoods and into the hearts and minds of the people that listen to him.  If he did not have your advertising dollars, he would not be able to air the vitriol that he does.<br>
<br>
I am sorry that your Jewish and minority employees were insulted by my comments.  You should take a few moments and review some of the things Michael Savage has to say about them if you find me insulting.  After all, he believes &quot;Hispanics breed like rabbits&quot; and that &quot;women should be denied the vote.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am amazed that you have read my letter many times, as this is the first time I have written it, and have posted it on a website only two days ago.  You must have precognition.  <br>
<br>
Regards, <br>
<br>

Jamal, <br>
<br>
Your argument is so ludicrous it doesn't warrant further discussion. For if you really believe that buying ads on any program is an endorsement or allows that individual to continue is ridiculous. <br>
<br>
There were plenty of advertisers on Savage before we bought ads and there are many waiting in the wings behind us if we leave. Did you know that the program's ad space is sold out months in advance? <br>
<br>
So go ahead and continue to believe what you would like about our firm but your thoughts couldn't be farther from the truth. If your logic applied in the real world nobody would advertise with anyone for every host has someone who doesn't like what they say or finds offense. I found Bill Clinton totally offensive but I suppose he was and is your hero. <br>
<br>
Sincerely <br>
