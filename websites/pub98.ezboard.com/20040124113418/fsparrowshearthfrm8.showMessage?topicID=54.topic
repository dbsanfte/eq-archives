<br>
Why are we as Christians so prideful?<br>
<br>
Now I'm not accusing anyone here of being prideful.  I don't know any of you well enough to ever do such a thing.  But here's a list of things I've seen in my life where I've been prideful and things I've heard from others about how they'd been prideful and so on.<br>
<br>
* We're not honest with our emotions.  It's pride that holds our emotions in, afraid of feeling exposed by showing our true self.<br>
<br>
* We're not honest about our faults.  So often if someone tries to point them out to us, we get defensive or we play the blame game.  We don't want others to think we have serious faults.  We try to make people believe our lives are together and perfect even when they're falling apart.  It's our pride that tries to show off a false image of who we are.<br>
<br>
* We behave as the Pharisee.  When the tax collector came into the temple, the Pharisee thanked God that he was not like the sinner or tax collector.  We try to put off an image of being better than others and we outwardly show despise towards those we think are bigger sinners.  In fact, we might get angry at the person we think is a bigger sinner, maybe even disgracing them in front of others behind their backs as a way to make ourselves feel better that our sins aren't nearly as bad as that person.  And we make up reasons to justify us talking bad about that person.  Perhaps using the popular phrasing of they sinned against me, or they wronged me.  We seek others to tell us we're right and that sinner was wrong which inflates our own ego and strengthens our pride to make it harder to break down.<br>
<br>
*We behave as the older brother.  We become indignant when someone we think of as being less worthy than ourselves gets special treatment by God.  It's jealousy, but it's also pride for us to think that in some way, we are worthy.  We believe we are worthy of the grace on the cross when we are not.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to me how so many people in the Bible who suffered from pride were in positions of power or prestige.  They were essentially in leadership roles.  The pharisees and the older brother.  When I was younger, I hungered for a position of leadership and now anymore, I'm not so sure I want it.  Because I think it's easier for people in leadership positions to become prideful and to justify their pride.  They tend to have followers who adore them and carry attitudes that their leader can do no wrong.  But leaders are just as human and perhaps have an even bigger temptation to try and overcome.  But it's harder to reach a leader when so many people around them are telling them they're right and everything they do is right.<br>
<br>
But not just leaders are prideful.  Certainly I've experienced pride in my life when I wasn't in a leadership position.  They say pride goeth before a fall.  The Bible tells us to get rid of pride.<br>
<br>
It takes God's stubborn love to break through our stubborn pride.  It takes God's stubborn forgiveness to bring us to our knees.  It reminds me of the song &quot;Stubborn Love.&quot;<br>
<br>
**********************<br>
<br>
Caught again, your faithless friend<br>
Don't You ever tire of hearing, what a fool I've been?<br>
Guess I should pray, but what can I say?<br>
Oh it hurts to know the hundred times I've caused You pain<br>
The &quot;forgive me's&quot; sound so empty, when I never change<br>
Yet You stay and say You love me<br>
Still forgiving me time, and time again<br>
<br>
It's Your stubborn love, that never lets go of me<br>
I don't understand, how You can stay<br>
Perfect love, embracing the worst in me<br>
How I long for Your stubborn love<br>
<br>
Funny me, just couldn't see<br>
Even long before I knew you, you were loving me<br>
Sometimes I cry, You must cry too<br>
When you see the countless promises I've made to You<br>
I keep saying that I'll trust You<br>
Though I seldom do<br>
Yet you stay and say &quot;I love you&quot;<br>
Still knowing some day, I'll be like You<br>
<br>
It's Your stubborn love, that never let's go of me<br>
I don't understand, how You can stay<br>
Perfect love, embracing the worst in me<br>
How I long for Your stubborn love <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>
