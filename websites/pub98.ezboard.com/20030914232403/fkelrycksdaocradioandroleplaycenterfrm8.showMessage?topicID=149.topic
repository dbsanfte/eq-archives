Long black hair hung straight down her back, except for the stray lock that constantly tumbled across her cheek. For the hundredth time that day, Rhalm pushed it behind her ear, and moments later it slipped free again and went unnoticed. <br>
<br>
Her slim fingers cradled a tiny glass vial, filled with a liquid that resembled quicksilver. Over and over she turned it in her hands, watching the potion flow round and round as her heart steadily pounded in her breast. The day had just begun; all was still silent around her, as silent as her voice had been for all of her nineteen years. But those few precious drops of quicksilver in her trembling fingers could change all that. <br>
<br>
Months ago she’d happened upon a bit of text in her studies, alluding to a ceremony once performed to cure a young girl not unlike herself. In truth, she’d never dreamed of such a thing being possible. In her exuberance, she’d carried the volume to her guildmates, to the clerics Kaidric and Landric. She remembered how she shifted foot to foot as the two of them read, her vibrant slate gray eyes watching both of them for their reactions. The two had brightened though worry creased their brows. The potion called for was nearly impossible to create, dangerous in the least and possibly deadly to consume. Kaidric had taken the book, and promised her he’d consult with more people, and that was the last she’d heard about it for weeks. <br>
<br>
Truthfully, she’d nearly forgotten about his promises. The mute girl had spent much time in the Defender’s Hall and had not seen Kaidric. Then, a few days ago he’d found her, and gently pushed into her palm the small glass vial. Quietly he whispered to her of the dangers, that it might even kill her if she tried it. He asked her to let him be there for her, and silently she’d nodded. <br>
<br>
But as the last few days went by, as she debated in her heart and mind if she should attempt this cure, she knew she had to do it alone. She’d risen this morning well before dawn, and made her way to the one spot that held any meaning for her. A small patch of soft, sweet grass along the riverbank was where she headed. Even now, the flush crept across her cheeks as she recalled the night spent here in his arms, the first night she’d spent with any man. His soft, trembling voice as he told her he’d loved her and promised his life to her for always. Carrington, the word tumbled silently through her mind. He’d disappeared from her after she’d lost their child, after the tiny life was snatched away from them. Where he’d gone, she knew not. Whispers and rumors she’d caught over the months, snatches of conversations. But none of that mattered, the spot was still special to her and here of all places, she felt returned to those days where someone found her beautiful and special even in her silence. <br>
<br>
All around her, the hills of Camelot still lay sleeping as she worked free the tiny cork. Her tongue rolled in her mouth, wetting her lips as she swallowed hard against her fears. A silent prayer and she upended the vial against her lips. The foul taste nearly gagged her as it slithered across her tongue and the quicksilver potion disappeared down her throat. Savagely it burned the tender flesh and she coughed and sputtered. A wave of dizziness careened through her and she doubled over, arms clasping her stomach and her eyes clenched shut. <br>
<br>
Her stomach roiled about, threatening to spew its contents and she fought it. The precious potion was irreplaceable, and she kept it down with the force of her will. Sweat slicked her skin as she struggled, and then the visions began to swim across her closed eyelids. The touch of a kindly cleric carrying a new babe in the crook of his arms; the same cleric laying in a pool of his own blood as an assassin carried her away. A woman frozen in the snow and the gentle eyes of a highlander scout as he brought away his Sarrah, and her mind swam with the remembering of her life with him. Trucking through the frontiers with the tall scout, and the small amber flower that once graced her slender neck she recalled vividly, as well as the moment of his death at the hands of a kobold shadowblade. <br>
<br>
She groaned and rolled to her side, wrapping herself into a tight ball of pain. Other images kept flowing through her mind, the kindly friar that had taught her to read and write. There stood Carrington clutching a small child to his chest, gazing at her hopelessly as her heart broke. The Norseman Kelryck who’d taken away the pain of her loss and brought her back from the brink of self-destruction. She could almost feel the touch of his beard and hear the soft laughter spill from his lips. More rapidly the images flew by, almost her entire life became one huge blur of colors as she lay there gasping for air. <br>
<br>
Blackness crept into the edges of her vision, and began to cover the flashing images of her life. Slowly it edged across, as her heart slowed and her body slowly relaxed. There on the edge of the river, as the world began to awaken around her, a young friar gave into the void that sought to claim her. She fell back into the icy waters of darkness, and her heart stopped beating. <br>

<br>
Kaidric sat in the study of his brother Rynnthorn’s estate. The room was fairly ornate; the desk and book shelves were trimmed with gold, the chairs covered with skins of rare beasts. Kaidric sat in one such chair, reading what an old volume of some sort. <br>
<br>
The book itself was unremarkable, much like the man reading it. He was tall for a Briton, but rather plain looking. Still wearing his unadorned, dull silver armor; made for him by his brother’s friend Athelston. His chain helm lay resting on the desk alongside the book and the cloak of his wood was pulled back. <br>
<br>
Kaidric’s blue were so fixated on the passage he was reading that he did not hear his brother Rynnthorn enter the study. Rynnthorn and Kaidric were very dissimilar. Rynnthorn was a politician who occasionally passed for a soldier of Albion. Kaidric had no interest in politics, and was instead fully devoted to the Church of Albion and her teachings. They had little in common, beyond the blood of their shared father, but still they had found brotherhood after years of separation. <br>
<br>
Rynnthorn stood over Kaidric for a full few minutes before giving up on getting his attention. “Kaidric.” Rynnthorn spoke, rather loudly. <br>
<br>
Kaidric barely moved, his eyes did not leave the page. He simply raised his hand in the air, holding up a chain clad index finger to indicate he needed a moment. <br>
<br>
Rynnthorn sat down in a chair, noticeably irritated at having to wait. He shifted around in his chair impatiently, hoping the noise would distract his brother. <br>
<br>
“Rynnthorn?” Kaidric looked up at his brother. <br>
<br>
“Kaid, what are you doing here?” Rynnthorn asked, he wasn’t used to either of his brothers stopping by often. Predian was always off defending the frontiers and Kaidric preferred the surroundings of the church. <br>
<br>
“This book, the one you found about restoring Rhalm’s voice. There was a passage I wanted to re-read.” Kaidric paused before continuing. “It’s bothering me Rynnthorn. It talks about giving something up, in order to regain one’s true voice. I need to learn more before she takes the potion.” <br>
<br>
“Kaidric, you should find her then.” Rynnthorn withdrew a bell from inside his pocket and rang it. A few seconds later a well dressed servant entered the hall. Rynnthorn turned his attention to the servant. “Where was the friar, Rhalm, last seen?” <br>
<br>
Kaidric rose to object, unaware and visibly bothered that his friend was being followed. Before he could voice an objection, the servant described the river bank where Rhalm was. <br>
<br>
“Rynn!” Kaidric scowled. <br>
<br>
“Relax brother, my people keep tabs on our entire family and their friends, in case of an…emergency.” <br>
<br>
Kaidric was visibly angered but his desire to find his friar friend was overwhelming. He scopped up the book under his arm, returned the chain helm to his head and pulled his cloak’s hood forward. <br>
<br>
Kaidric stormed out of the room and then the estate, without another word to Rynnthorn. At the estate’s stables, he mounted a horse and road off to the river bank. He ran his horse along the river bank, looking for Rhalm. What he discovered instead, shook his soul. <br>
<br>
The girl lay still with an empty vial next to her. Rhalm had taken the potion. <br>
<br>
Kaidric dismounted from his horse and approached Rhalm. Her body seemed lifeless and a sense of urgency overcame the cleric. He instantly summoned the Church’s powers of healing and cast a spell on the girl. No effect. <br>
<br>
Angrily and with more desperation, he called upon the Church again, to raise the dead. The spell failed. He tried to cure her of poisons and then of diseases with no result. Now teering, the cleric repeated every spell known to him, shouting angrily at the God to which he prayed. <br>
<br>
Rhalm’s body remained lifeless, and Kaidric fell to his knees over her, sobbing. He reached into his pouches, searching for something to use out of desperation. He withdrew a small leather bag filled with strange leaves and herbs. A healing mixture his Druidic sister had given him. <br>
<br>
He fought to remember what his sister had said about the herbs, he could hear Thrennoadae’s voice, but not make out what she was saying. With his mace, he ground the herbs as finely as he could, scooped them up into his hands and forced them into Rhalm’s mouth. He forced her unmoving body to swallow them. <br>
<br>
His heart broken, angry at the Church for not giving him the power to heal, sad for the loss of his friend, and full of guilt for providing the potion; the cleric collapsed over Rhalm’s body.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thrennoadae>Thrennoadae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/16/03 8:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Voice Never Heard</span><hr size=1> She drifted on a sea of blackness, inky soft velvet darkness that seeped through her limbs with its cold fingers and pulled her through the currents of her mind. Voices from her past whispered to her as she floated near, idle remnants of her life like flotsam in her wake. A pinprick of light illuminated the darkness and silently she began to move towards it. The depths of her memories around her grew warmer, more comforting as the light grew brighter. <br>
<br>
Slate gray eyes began to blink away the sheer magnitude of its dazzling light as she drew close enough to lift upwards an arm, finger extended as she sought to merge herself into that beautiful white light. From the darkness around her she felt the embrace of the souls that had passed before her, the love from each caress of her past. She heard her name whispered from each mouth, each name different yet still her own. She felt the bittersweet kisses pressed to her forehead as she came ever closer to that sweet white glow. <br>
<br>
“Mother?” she murmured as her eyes fell upon the figure of a woman. Golden hair flowed about her, illuminated by the grace of the light behind her. A gentle smile formed on her lips and she opened her arms wide to Rhalm. <br>
<br>
“MOTHER!” she exclaimed and fought the murky sea that tried to hold her back. Slogging through the darkness she reached out and her arms wrapped about the figure of the woman. Shuddering tears shook her body as her arms wrapped about the slender woman, and her mother held her tight. A tingling coursed through her veins like fire, yet there was only comfort in that sweet embrace. <br>
<br>
“Rhalm, you must listen to me,” came her mother’s voice. <br>
<br>
“No mamma, don’t send me away,” she whispered back. <br>
<br>
“Rhalm, it’s not time for you yet, Rhalm, you must go back.” <br>
<br>
Tears flowed from her eyes and she looked past her mother’s shoulder and there stood the scout, the only man she truly loved as her father. She almost laughed to see his fiery red hair again, that kind smile on his face. <br>
<br>
“Father,” she squealed, at once resembling the five year old girl she had been last she’d seen him alive. <br>
<br>
“Sarrah, me sweet Sarrah,” and his arms wrapped about her and she was whisked through the air. “Sarrah, ye must listen ta me..” <br>
<br>
“No poppa, don’t send me away,” she replied. <br>
<br>
“Sarrah, its nae time fer ye yet, Sarrah, ye must go back.” <br>
<br>
Both figures dimmed and it was then she heard the sound of sobbing from somewhere in the darkness. She tilted her head to the side, and it sounded a bit louder. She turned her eyes again to the prismatic light that tugged at her and she took a step forward. Her mother and father’s eyes pleaded with her. <br>
<br>
“Rhalm, not yet...” <br>
<br>
“Sarrah, nae yet...” <br>
<br>
Behind her, she could hear the sobbing again, and her eyes swiveled to her mother. “Mother, what.. what is happening?” <br>
<br>
The woman’s silvered fingers reached up and stroked against Rhalm’s cheeks, and her gentle blue eyes filled with love and sadness. “You must go back Rhalm, its not your time. But, there is a price.. You will have your voice, but you must leave something else behind.” <br>
<br>
The words confused her as the sobbing behind her grew louder. She felt compelled backwards through the inky darkness, to the coldness. “Momma… I don’t understand… Help me?” Her face turned from the light as she began to push backwards, the light fading behind her. “Momma?” her voice called plaintively again. <br>
<br>
No reply was heard. <br>
<br>
She drifted back through the memories of her life, and uncomprehendingly watched as each one dimmed, and sank out of sight. She glanced back towards the light, and the figures of her parents were gone from view, as was the warmth of their arms about her. All about her, it grew darker and darker, the black emptiness chilling her through, while the sobbing grew louder. <br>
<br>
In a rush, she felt herself slammed against a cold, hard wall, and then her eyes blinked away the touch of daylight. She felt a solid weight against her and groaned as she tried to shove it away. Kaidric rubbed at his eyes in disbelief as he felt Rhalm move against him, heard the sudden rush of breath as she inhaled. Her grayish skin slowly grew warm again, filling with the vibrancy of life. <br>
<br>
He watched as her eyes opened, those stunning slate gray eyes as they blinked away the light of the sun. <br>
<br>
“Rhalm.. Rhalm.. are you alright?” <br>
<br>
Her face swiveled to his voice, eyes slowly focusing on his face. Her mouth moved as if she was attempting to speak, but no sound passed her lips. Kaidric sighed, it failed, the potion failed, he thought to himself. He brushed her hair from her face, and offered a weak smile to comfort her. She wet her lips, and tried to speak again, this time, a soft sound whispering from her mouth. <br>
<br>
He blinked and leaned close, trying to understand. She tried again, and this time, he could hear her words. <br>
<br>
“Who are you?” she whispered. <br>

<br>
The girl’s eyes fluttered as she tried to focus on his face, and in a voice hardly more than a whisper she uttered, “Who?” <br>
<br>
Gently, laughing more from relief than anything, he lowered his voice and said, “You can speak! The potion worked. Rhalm.. it’s amazing!” <br>
<br>
Her eyes narrowed and she shook her head. “What .. do you mean?” It voice was soft, tentative as she forced the air from her lips. <br>
<br>
“Your voice, it’s returned. You can speak.” Worry began to inch its way back into Kaidric’s heart as he gazed at his friend. She didn’t seem to recognize him at all. Those beautiful eyes that once shared his laughter seemed empty of recognition. The soft voice coming from her lips gave him hope though, yet the responsibility for her condition fell across his shoulders. <br>
<br>
Slowly she sat up, pushing herself back a few inches with a groan, and gazed warily at the cleric. Again she repeated, “Who are you?” <br>
<br>
“Kaidric. You know me Rhalm,” came his reply. The fear clamped in his stomach. What had he done? Slowly he slipped off his hood and his helm, hoping the sight of his face would jog her out of whatever it was. <br>
<br>
A bit of a breeze drifted across the pair, stirring the cloak across his back, and a few stray locks of her dark hair twirled across her cheek. Gently she bit down on her bottom lip, then whispered, “I do not know you. Rhalm, … is that my name?” <br>
<br>
“Yes, Rhalm is your name, you don’t remember? <br>
<br>
“I remember.. other names.” <br>
<br>
“What names?” <br>
<br>
She searched her mind, seeking those thoughts that twisted and evaded her grasp. They darted about as if afraid of the light touch of her mind, eluding her. “Evee … Sarrah. I am Sarrah.” She clung to that name as it surfaced and refused to let it free. She was Sarrah. Bits of other stray thoughts associated with that name came clear. <br>
<br>
“No, you are Rhalm, you have always been Rhalm.” Kaidric picked up the tiny vial, shaking his head sadly. “You drank this, to bring back your voice…” he trailed off, unable to admit his fault in helping her. <br>
<br>
“I do not understand,” a slight scowl touched her features as she shook her head and gazed at the vial in his fingers. <br>
<br>
“I thought you had died…” and anguish cut him off as he felt again that emotion when he’d caught sight of her limp form strewn across the ground. “Your breath was gone, and I could not heal you. What is the last thing you remember?” <br>
<br>
Long moments passed as she gazed across the river. She could hear the sounds of his chain clinking lightly as his weight shifted, the soft inhale and exhale of his breath. Her palms pressed against the leather that confined her as she turned over and over that one memory she’d been able to clasp. “An amber necklace.. of a flower.. and a bearded man.” <br>
<br>
“I don’t know those things. Rhalm, I don’t know what has happened. <br>
<br>
“Sarrah,” she corrected, clinging to that thought as if it would save her. It touched her gently, to hear the name Sarrah, a soft burr to the voice in her mind. The beard she imagined was not unlike Kaidric’s with its soft glint of red. But the figure shrouded behind the beard and the voice dwarfed Kaidric in size. Gently she repeated, “Sarrah, my name is Sarrah.” <br>
<br>
He fought back the sob that threatened to make him lose what little control he had left. A tear formed in his eye as he acknowledged her, “Sarrah.. What have I done?” She seemed lost in her thoughts, eyes drifting across the water unseeing as she tried to find herself, to remember anything. Gently, his voice pulled her back. <br>
<br>
“Rhal… Sarrah?” <br>
<br>
“Yes?” <br>
<br>
“Do you recognize your possessions? Your leather armor? The papers you carry?” <br>
<br>
Her eyes drifted down to the things around her. A small bag that would hook over a shoulder. A simple wooden staff. Inside the bag she pulled free a sheaf of papers, covered in handwriting. Vaguely, she heard him speaking to her still, yet she was distracted by the written words. <br>
<br>
He pulled free a note she’d given him long ago, words inconsequential. “Those are your words.” Her slate gray eyes drifted across it, taking in the words, but no hint of recognition was visible. <br>
<br>
“You say, I wrote that?” Her voice was sounding hoarser, strained, not surprisingly since she’d never used it before. Her eyes strain to find some meaning, some hint of who she was from the words on the paper. Her oval face turns upwards, slate gray eyes filled with uncertainty. “I do not understand. Help me? Help me Kaidric?” <br>
<br>
Gently he grasped her hand, and helped her to unsteady feet. Yet he could feel the shyness in her, and gently released her fingers after he was sure she wouldn’t tumble over. Quietly, he led her to the small town of Cotswold, to the building they kept as a guild house. His heart broke over and over as she passed by person after person, no hint of acknowledgment upon her features. She gazed around as if a newcomer, a stranger. He led her up to the room she claimed as her own, and stepped aside at the doorway. Fingertips ached to reach up and push the stray lock of hair from her cheek, yet he refrained. She had no memory of the kiss they once shared so many months ago. <br>
<br>
“Its late.. this is your room. Tomorrow, we can find the answers Rha.. Sarrah. I will not rest until you are whole again.” <br>
<br>
Those stunning gray eyes gazed at him, clouded over with non-understanding. She nodded, refraining from speaking, her voice gone too hoarse and her throat throbbing with dryness. Quietly, she opened the door and stepped into the darkened room. The sun had just set outside, and the twilight filled the corners, masking from view the furnishings. She took a hesitant step forward, trying to pierce the darkness and Kaidric sighed, and gently pushed past here. <br>
<br>
“Here.. the candle is here,” he quietly said, then lit it. “We would talk sometimes, at night after dinner.” The flame was lit with his flint, but the light was not bright enough to illuminate the blush on his cheeks. She glanced about, though the room was rather well-kept and there were not many articles on display. <br>
<br>
”Thank you,” she forced out, wincing. <br>
<br>
“Tomorrow then? I promise you, we’ll fix this ..Sarrah. I promise.” <br>
<br>
Quietly he exited the room, pulling the door shut behind him. Inside, she sat down in the darkness, illuminated with the flicker of one single candle. She fingered the bedspread as she stared at the belongings of a stranger. “Sarrah,” she whispered through cracked lips. “I am Sarrah,” and she clung firm to that one memory, lashing her entire being to it tightly and refusing to let it sink into oblivion. <br>
<br>
The full touch of darkness seeped into the realm of Albion, and carried to bed its inhabitants. One lone building, one lone room, one lone girl awash on the tides of a mishap of birth, floundering through the morass of a price she unwittingly paid. <br>

Nothing worked. His angst grew as did his frustration, gazing upon the sweet face of the girl he’d only wanted to help, the tears welled up in his eyes. Inwardly he vowed again that he’d make right this horrible wrong, but he was at his wits end. Perhaps Landric would know, but Landric had moved on and he knew not where to find him.<br>
<br>
In the meanwhile, Rhalm, or Sarrah as she thought of herself, was trying to adjust to her life. The room she stayed in pleased her well enough, there was a small window with a beautiful view of the city of Camelot. At night the torches that lit the gates flickered just out of direct view, and the seat at the window let her watch the people passing in and out of the capital. She’d taken to watching people, listening to their voices as they spoke. Voices in anger, happiness, greeting, voices lifted up in happy song as some of the rover bands would arrive. A few made her laugh out loud, once she was brought to tears as she watched the sad parting of a couple. <br>
<br>
As for her own life, she didn’t really live at all in those first days. Her sleep was a tormented waste of time as she tumbled across the sheets, flitterings of her past brushing butterfly wings across her sub-conscious. The voices came to her still, teasing her with hints of recognition then laughing mockingly as they darted away, tearing free the gossamer strands of her memory as she tried to clutch them to her.<br>
<br>
Only the one memory was hers to keep. She was Sarrah. The bearded man, the amber necklace she was still trying to decipher, but she *knew* she was Sarrah.<br>
<br>
It was mid afternoon and she’d taken a horse ride to Avalon, and the shimmering purple-blue of the portal to Gothwaite Harbor beckoned her. She stepped through and her senses were immediately assaulted by the smells and sounds of the harbor. The fresh ocean air with its hint of fish, the sand beneath her feet making walking a bit more challenging. Proud adventurer’s setting forth with weapons readied as they rode deep into the heart of the Avalon Isle. Something inside her whispered that she too had done such a thing. But the staff she carried felt awkward in her hands. The mace slung at her hip offered no comfort either. She’d objected when Kaidric had asked her to continue to wear what she’d always worn. But the look in his green eyes had changed her mind. He was trying to help, even though she didn’t fully understand.<br>
<br>
So she still dressed in her leathers, though she had no intentions of fighting anything. She still carried her staff, but it was merely a walking stick. She wandered around the town, admiring a few of the shops when she’d found a group of people working with cloth. A few strands of silk caught the wind, and the ends tumbled recklessly as they caught a stray beam of light. Rhalm stepped closer and watched for a while, listening to the women talk softly and laugh amongst themselves as their fingers wove through the fabric, and needles darted. <br>
<br>
After many long minutes, one woman about her own age, noticed Rhalm and beckoned her over. “You look as if you want to try,” and she smiled up at her. Rhalm shrugged her shoulders and laid her staff down beside her as she knelt. “Here, like this…” and the girl handed her a square of leather, a needle and some linen thread. Carefully she began to sew, making sure to lean over and gently correct Rhalm as she watched and learned.<br>
<br>
“My name is Emilli,” she said, then introduced the rest of the circle. <br>
<br>
“Sarrah, my name is Sarrah.”<br>

Nothing changed, no new revelations were forth-coming. Kaidric was at his wit’s end, for he’d found no cure for what ailed her, except the repeated “Time will tell.” He never stopped searching, but Rhalm’s reactions were disheartening.<br>
<br>
The sweet, mute girl had changed. She’d always had her own mind, her own desires, but so easily did everyone around her transform that nod of yes, into whatever it was they wished her to say. For her, it had been easier to simply agree and go along with their whims than to try to push against the flow. How did a mute argue with someone unwilling to read her words?<br>
<br>
She might not remember her past, but now she did not forget her voice. And use it she did. One morning, Kaidric was at her door again, bright and early with another visit to yet another elder cleric planned. Rhalm padded to the door, clasping a robe around her small body as she gazed up to see Kaidric’s face. She scowled. <br>
<br>
“No Kaidric. Not today,” and she started to push the door shut. <br>
<br>
“What do you mean? I’m trying to help you Rhalm.”<br>
<br>
“My name is Sarrah,” she repeated, for the hundredth time. “And I am fine, I don’t need your help!”<br>
<br>
“But Rha.. Sarrah, you have no memories, you…” her glare cut him off. Those slate gray eyes of her flashed with anger he’d never seen before. He was hurt deeply, knowing he’d brought this on her. “Its my fault, I’m trying to fix it. Please?”<br>
<br>
Her ire was up, and she never been able to express it like this before. Perhaps she didn’t realize that, but part of her could feel it. And it felt damn good. “GO AWAY!!” she yelled, waking up half the guild hall in the process. “I don’t WANT your help. GO AWAY and leave me BE!!” she bellowed at him, the anger coursing through her.<br>
<br>
The hurt look upon his face as he nodded and turned away finally broke through the anger she felt. Her body was tense and overwrought, her emotions were raw, but that pained look he gave her was as if a bucket of ice had been dumped on her head. She eased the door shut, ignoring the looks from the other guild mates as they peeked their heads into the hall. As the door clicked closed, she leaned her back against it and her body slid to the floor in a heap. She felt the tears rising and the tightening at the back of her throat. Drawing her knees to her chest, she buried her face against them as she tried to drown the sound of her own sobbing. <br>
<br>
Down the hall, Kaidric heard, but his humiliation overrode his feelings, and he forced his feet to continue their path. If she didn’t want his help, he’d not force it on her. But it wouldn’t stop him from seeking the answers himself.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Hours later, after she’d dried the tears and made her way once again to Gothwaite, she was yet again working with her needle and thread. A stray lock of hair obscured her vision a moment, and she sunk the needed into her finger with a soft yelp of pain. She stuck the offended digit into her mouth, tasting the tang of the blood and a jolt hit her. Her vision swam and she saw a small house, a hovel against a river bank. She felt the sting of a slap against her cheek, the bite as her teeth closed on the flesh of her mouth. In her mind’s eye she saw the woman as her hand drew back again, and felt the ringing in her ears as her hand connected with Rhalm’s face again.<br>
<br>
“Lazy wench! Little lazy tramp!!” echoed in her ears and she dropped the stitching in her lap. Her fingertips pressed tight to her temples as she tried to push away the memory. “Better fer all if the likes o’ ye were just dead and gone!” came the voice again, and Rhalm felt herself crawling away and curling into a ball to hide the pain she felt from the beating the woman bestowed upon her.<br>
<br>
Another memory had surfaced, and Rhalm wished it never had. Cold and dark, full of anger and hatred for a girl that had done nothing wrong. A woman taking out her bitterness at life against a mute girl that was hardly more than a child herself, this memory brought nothing but pain and hopelessness back into Rhalm’s life. <br>
<br>
“No,” she thought, she didn’t want to remember that. But try as she might, it would not fade. It bobbed and glinted against the surface of her mind as bright as the sweet memories of the scout with his bearded face, and the lilting voice that called her Sarrah. A mental shove at the memory, trying to dislodge it back to wherever it came from. “I don’t want to be that girl anymore, its not me!” she pleaded with her subconscious, but it still floated there, defiant of her wishes.<br>
<br>
Around her, no one seemed to notice the inner battle she fought, as she quietly picked back up the sewing. Soon her fingers were working the materials again, mindful of the sore fingertip as she glared inwardly at the memory that had surfaced. For now she recalled another name, and it was Rhalm. Rhalm, uttered by a hateful woman instead of the sweet Sarrah of her father’s voice.<br>
