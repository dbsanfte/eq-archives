<br>
The cab pulled up in front of the building as they stepped out of the car in awe. Both could hear the waves crashing on the shore behind the cloud-touching structure and immediately fell in love with their new home. <br>
<br>
They walked into the front doors after paying a worker to take their stuff up to their condos. Jennifer stood in the center of the room and stared at the huge chandeliers that covered most of the ceiling while Andrya walked over to the desk and told her that condos 1800 and 1801 where in. The front desk worked like a hotels, they gave you messages and transferred calls. It was a very nice place to be. <br>
<br>
Andrya walked back over to Jennifer and they got on the elevator together. <br>
<br>
&quot;I wanna press the 18&quot; Andrya declared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope, I want to!&quot; argued Jennifer.<br>
<br>
Both girls reached forward and pressed the button together, then started laughing. <br>
<br>
Nothing happened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it broken?&quot; asked Andrya.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, oops,&quot; Jennifer pulled out her key and turned the 18th floors security hole. Andrya had told her about the building's security system for the top floor condos in the cab. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Gah Andrya is blonde</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thought Jennifer, but didn't feel like saying it out loud. <br>
<br>
The elevator's doors closed and started going up. It seemed like an eternity for it to stop because it was up so high and both girls were eager to see their new homes. <br>
<br>
Once the doors opened, a medium sized area opened up to them. The area had a small couch, a table, a phone, and two doors across from each other. A silver set of numbers was on each door, with the two girl's names underneath them.<br>
<br>

<br>
Both girls went to their doors, and unlocked them at the same time. The doors slowly opened and each girl with to her own condo<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Andrya walked into her condo and her eyes opened so widely. Everything was so pretty. It was partly furnished, and had everything she just had to have but wasn't fully furnished so she checked out each room to see what she'd need to buy.<br>
<br>
It was longer than it was wide, which made Andrya figure that since her room was on the right side,  then the door to Jennifer's condo must be on the left side. She didn't worry about that at the time.<br>
<br>
She walked into her living room and immediately loved how large it was, it had huge sliding glass doors showing the balcony and ocean. Her kitchen was a decent size also, with nice breakfast bar. <br>
<br>
She walked into each room, deciding which would be the office, the guest room, and her room. Obviously, she chose the master bedroom as hers. She walked to the front balcony and opened its glass doors, then looked down. She was going to love it here, the view was beautiful and her best friend was right next door.  <p>--------<br>

&quot;Wow..&quot; She put her bag down and looked around. The first thing she noticed was the beautiful view of the beach from her window. &quot;remind me to thank Andrya for, ever!&quot; She walked through it, seeing the spacious three rooms, and choosing the biggest one as her own. She sat on the bed, and noticed a door on the hall. &quot;probably connects to Andrya's rooms. This is going to be fun.&quot; She walked around in awe, &quot;man, we're going to have to make serious coin to stay here,&quot; She smiled and plopped down on the couch. &quot;But it'll be worth it,&quot; She looked to the journal, and picked it up, flipping to the next available page and started writing.<br>

Just as Jennifer was closing the book Andrya raced through the door. <br>

The guy at the front desk giving him the key. &quot; Remember to put the key in the keyhole in the elevator.<br>
<br>
Yaten bowed, taking the key and rushing into the elevator before it closed. He put the key in the hole and pressed the floor his room was on. <br>
  When the elevator door opened he ran out, looking for room 1805, he than found it smiling. He opened the door, looking inside. He looked around in awe. &quot; Wow..its nice. &quot; He sat on the couch, closing his eyes. &quot; it sure it nice..to be here alone.. &quot; <p>---<br>

&quot;Oh God, I don't even know. He says he's from the future and he lives on one of those things that fly in the air.&quot; Andrya saw Jen's face. &quot;Noo, not an airplane.&quot; <br>
Then the two friends burst out laughing as Andrya continued.<br>
&quot;Well last night I got waay too drunk for my own good. I'm surprised I didn't use my powers on something. Anyways, stupid me got drunk and I asked if we could leave. He took me back to his crib and I basically passed out, then crawled into his bed about halfway through the night.&quot; <br>
Andrya grinned when she thought about it. <br>
&quot;Okay, so how is that different from all the other guys,&quot; Jennifer teased. &quot;Besides the fact that you didn't do anything!&quot;<br>
&quot;Ugh,  you don't get it. Jacob's different. And no, he doesn't know about the powers, or our &quot;business&quot;.&quot;<br>

Andrya thought about it for a second. Then she decided they should go car shopping next.<br>
&quot;Eh, let's go. I need a new ride.&quot; Andrya told her friend as she winked.<br>

Andrya walked into the building and stopped at the counter before heading to her condo. <br>
<br>
'Hello! 1800 is in, any calls?'<br>
<br>
'No ma'am'<br>
<br>
Andrya's heart sank as she thanked the worker and got on the elevator. She really missed him. Especially it being Valentines day and all.<br>
<br>
She unlocked her door and walked into her bare home. It wasn't exactly the scene she wanted to come home to. She wanted Jacob to be there, waiting for her. She knew it wouldn't happen though so she set her stuff down on the table and threw her keys on the counter. She wasn't what you would call happy.<br>
<br>
Her eye caught site of the beach through the glass doors, so she walked over and went out on the balcony. This is why she was willing to pay big bucks for this place. It would calm her in times like this. <br>
<br>
She watched the waves gently hit the shores as she waited for him to call her...<br>

Jacob dialed the number she had left him.  He waited, and hoped, she would answer.  His heart was beating faster than he could remember, but didn't care.  He liked her, and wanted to see her again. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.redrival.com/Scott/simonsig2" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
She walked over and picked up the phone. The caller ID showed nothing, so she simply opened the cell.<br>
<br>
'Hello?'<br>
<br>
'Hey, Andrya?' she heard a male voice say. <br>
<br>
Once she knew it was him, she was so happy. Maybe she wouldn't be so miserable after all...<br>

'God, his voice is so gorgeous' Andrya thought to herself as he talked. 'Do something... Of course I want to do something!' she thought again, but not wanting to sound anxious, she kept her cool.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure! I could go back over to your place? Maybe for a nice little dinner and a movie or something?&quot; she asked him. <br>
<br>
Her condo wasn't exactly ready to have visitors yet, but she promised herself to decorate it this week so Jen and her could host a party. <br>

Andrya blushed. She hated it when people complimented her like that, but she didn't mind much when he did. <br>
