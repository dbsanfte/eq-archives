I'm copying a post made on his great site <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.skipsoutdoors.com/" target="top">Skip's Outdoors</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  It has to do with reel oils and maintenance on your reels.  I think it's very beneficial to know some of these findings.  Hope it helps you folks out as much as it did me.  Here's the threads in a Nutshell.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;font-size:medium;">Bigbass101<br>
I need some recomendations and advice on the Rocket Fuel. I've been using the Abu Garcia lube and oil on my reels in the past, and to be quite honest. I don't like them. Do any of you have some recomendations on which Rocket Fuel to use on Shimano Baitcasters? Red, Yellow, or something else. Any info on some good grease would also be helpful. Is there a difference in the greases on the market?<br>
<br>
Hey man I've been there done that. I found the best thing to use is Rem Oil. It is teflon coated and it will make those baitcasters smooth.<br>
<br>
Skipper's post below:<br>
<br>
Hey Bigbass,<br>
<br>
You've picked something I know something about.<br>
<br>
A few years ago, I did some testing of different oils in reel bearings. Mind you, it was redneck garage science, but it told me what I wanted to know.<br>
<br>
I tested several oils. ABU's oil, Rocket Fuel, X1R, Rem Oil, a Slick 50 product, and a few others. The tests were done with a new set of ABEC 7 Grade bearings that were completely flushed after each test and installed in one of my best reels which happens to be a customized ABU3600.<br>
<br>
One thing I tested for was evaporation. I applied a couple drops of each oil to pieces of aluminum foil and put them in a plastic box to keep dust off them, and left them in the garage for a few weeks. The ABU oil evaporated, but still provided some lubrication, The Rocket fuel and X1R did not evaporate and were essentially the same consistency they were the day I put them in the box. The Rem Oil did evaporate a little but not completely, the slick 50 product tuned to a blob.<br>
<br>
I then tested them in the reel individually. Prior to this test, I had almost exclusively used ABU oil. That's not the case now. The X1R and Rocket Yellow were the 2 best performers in the reel with Rem Oil a close 3rd. The others were a distant 4th and 5th. <br>
<br>
From there, I changed my standards. Since then, I have used X1R and Rocket Yellow. The X1R is slightly faster than RF Yellow, but, being thinner, its not likely to last as long (Doesn't in longer term use). Depending on the reel and the user, I only use the 2 brands. If its my reel, and I know I can oil it when I need to, I use X1R, if its someone who fishes several times a year and brings their reels in every year, I go with yellow, if its one that doesn't clean and lube regular, go with red. The red while slower is thicker and will last longer in the bearings. You don't want to dryspin the bearings. I still like the grease that comes in the pack with the X1R, that's by far the best grease I have used on reels. <br>
<br>
Skipper<br>
<br>
Bigbass101<br>
Thanks Skipper for the excellant reply. Forgive my ignorance in this subject, but what exactly is the X1R grease? Where can I purchase some?<br>
<br>
Here's another couple tricky questions. I've been searching around the internet and have located the Rocket Fuel being sold on several different sites. However, one site was considerably cheaper than the others for the same product. It was <br>
TG's Development .<br>
<br>
It was only $4.95 for a 1 oz. bottle. I also noticed the company was located over in Europe. I'm not sure if it has distibutors through out the states, but they advertise free shipping. There was also one other site that caught my eye was Jonestackle. It advertised the Shimano Grease for the drags. Do you have any info on either of these?<br>
<br>
Pretty proud of myself this evening. Took one of my Curado's completely apart for the most part and got it back together in one piece. It was by far the worst of the bunch, and too be honest a experiment reel to work on. Other than the basic cleaning, I've been too worried to go very far in taking one apart. I had a real bad experience with Diawa spinning reel that I took apart. It was a son of a gun to put back together. Ended up taking days, and that was with a Schematic and help. So since then I have not messed with them, but this is a new year and I want to clean the rest of the reels the right way.<br>
<br>
Flushing the bearings? I've heard of guys using carborator cleaner, reel magic, and some others. What do you recommend?<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the help Skipper. It is most certainly appreciated.<br>

Flush with STP Carb cleaner, but be careful. I use a 5 gallon drywall can for a catch basin. The stuff doubles for fence line weed killer in the summer.<br>
<br>
X1R is sold in a blister pack at Wal Mart and other places. It has a 1 oz bottle of oil in it and a small tub of grease in the same package. You know how Wal Mart is though, not all of them carry it, and you might have to look around some. I had True Value order it for me once when Wally quit carrying it for a while.<br>
<br>
RF is sort of expensive. I've never bought it for $5, that's a good deal. Jump on it.<br>

I cleaned that Curado 200 out.  Flushed the bearings, and lubed it up with the Rocket Fuel Yellow oil.  Man what a difference!  I spooled it up and took it out in the back yard to make some casts.  I couldn't believe how smooth and how far it cast without hardly any effert.  I'm totally pumped up about this deal.  Going to do the rest of them now.  I'll probably replace those drag washers too.  Thanks Skipper for all the help.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :thumpup --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif ALT=":thumpup"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Second thought.  I'm going to wait to do the rest in a couple month's.  I figure the closer we are to spring the better the lubrication will be.  Less likely to get dust in the reel.<br>

From what I gather on their site.  You need to keep the washers free of grease and oil all the time.  Otherwise it will affect the performance of the drag.  What would you recommend cleaning them with if some oil, dirt, or grime were to seep in.  Will alcohol on a cotton swab do the trick? <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">

You can't help from it inside the reel.  I'd say a little alcohol would clean it, but like I said, I've never had the need to clean one.  I guess if they really got soaked, it would be a problem, but no more than might work its way on them inside the reel, it shouldn't be a problem.<br>

They need cleaned and lubed maybe bi annually.  One of the reasons I don't do many of them is their cost.  Unless you get into the Sustains and the high priced Daiwas, most spinning reels are less than $50 in new value.  I wouldn't break down, clean and re-assemble a spinning reel for less than $15 and more like $20.  They are much more tedious to re-assemble and get apart than are bait casters requiring more time and attentiion.  Unlike a baitcaster, the spool doesn't rotate for the cast, and its not as critical to keep the bearings clean and lubed.  Most of the work I do on spinning reels is repair, and even at that, they usually aren't worth fixing if they need much of a part.  <br>
<br>

I came across something else that may be helpful when cleaning the reels out.  I bought some Electronics cleaner for keyboards etc..  Basically it's compressed air in a can.  I used it to spray in hard to reach areas for cleaning, and also used it to spray in the bearings after flushing.  It will blow out any remaining residue or crude.  It also ensures that it is complety dry before oiling and putting back together.  Those hard to reach areas like the worm drive it also comes in handy after flushing and cleaning.  Blows everything right out of that spiral worm drive.  Just thought I would pass along the helpful hint.  <br>
<br>
I do recommend letting the bearings sit for a while to dry before putting back together and oiling.  Thanks for the tip there Skipper.<br>
<br>
**I don't recommend using compressed air  inside the gear casing where you may lose some springs or some vital components of the reel.   <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">
