Spoilers: Sequel to Five Questions; set after ‘Fever’.<br>
Summary: Chloe gives Lex a ride back to the Talon.<br>
Disclaimer: Not mine, no infringement intended, please don’t sue.<br>
Feedback: YES!! REVIEW!!  Geez, that sounded incredibly needy.<br>
Archival: Sure – just let me know where.<br>
Author’s Note: Happy birthday Peggy!!!  It’s a short one, but she wanted a ride back to the Talon and a fic with the song is “You’re the Inspiration” by Chicago (and I don’t own the rights to that either, by the way). <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe laughed lightly and shook her head as she drove down the back country road.<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe he bought it,” she said.<br>
<br>
“I must say, I’m impressed,” Lex said, turning his face toward Chloe as she drove to give her a half-smirk, half-smile.  “Although you’re lucky he didn’t catch your ‘tell’.”  Chloe scoffed.<br>
<br>
“*I’m* lucky?”  She shook her head again.  “*You’re* lucky he didn’t catch on to your poorly hidden innuendo.”  <br>
<br>
“Please,” Lex said sarcastically.  “How many sexual innuendos have you thrown at him over the years?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t think that’s any of your business,” she said indignantly.  Lex smiled.<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh. And how many has he caught?”<br>
<br>
“None,” Chloe admitted.  She paused for a second and then furrowed her brow.  “And what do you mean, ‘my tell’?”    <br>
<br>
“It’s something that ---”<br>
<br>
“I *know* what a *tell* is, Lex,” Chloe interrupted.  Lex grinned and leaned back in his chair.<br>
<br>
“But, do you know what *your* tell is?”  He asked.  Chloe rolled her eyes and made a grumbling sound with her mouth.  “What was that?”  Lex asked, pretending not to catch what she had said.<br>
<br>
“I was fidgeting with my hands,” she said a little louder.  <br>
<br>
“Forgive me for asking, but if you know what your ‘tell’ is, then why didn’t you make an effort to stop?”  Lex asked.  Chloe shrugged.<br>
<br>
“It’s not like anyone has ever noticed it besides you,” she answered.  “Well, and my dad – which is probably why it’s so much easier to get away with lying to him over the phone.”  Lex chuckled at her sidetracked logic.<br>
<br>
“Probably,” he agreed.  A mischievous grin tugged at the corners of Chloe’s mouth.<br>
<br>
“I know your ‘tell’,” she said teasingly, her grin turning into an almost evil smile when Lex turned his head to stare at her with a completely serious expression on his face.<br>
<br>
“I don’t have a ‘tell’.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, you do.”<br>
<br>
“No, I --- fine.  Please, Miss Sullivan,” he said, emphasizing her last name, “what do you think my ‘tell’ is?”<br>
<br>
“It’s hard to explain,” she said.<br>
<br>
“I would imagine it’s impossible to explain, seeing as how I don’t have one,” he said smugly.  Chloe laughed and Lex’s smile fell.<br>
<br>
“It’s a combination,” Chloe said.  “First you do this semi-smirk thing, and then you use a certain tone of voice.”<br>
<br>
“Tone of voice?”<br>
<br>
“I’m sure it makes most people think you’re sincere,” Chloe said with a somewhat apologetic smile, but only so she wouldn’t risk getting him angrier with her.  <br>
<br>
“But not you.”<br>
<br>
“But not me,” she agreed.  “Tell you what, why don’t you turn on the radio so this doesn’t turn into a big argument over nothing?”<br>
<br>
“Avoidance,” Lex said in an admiring tone.  He smiled at Chloe.  “Well played, Sullivan.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” she said with a beaming smile.<br>
<br>
“Do I get to choose the music?”  He asked with a slight gleam in his eye.  Chloe looked at him apprehensively.<br>
<br>
“I – guess – so,” she strung out.  <br>
<br>
Lex smirked at her and turned on the radio.  He flipped through the different stations until he found an older song that he was familiar with, but he doubted Chloe knew.  Granted, it wouldn’t have been his usual taste in music, but it was hardly a usual situation he was in at the time either.  The music wafted out of the speakers and seemed to flow into the wind around them.<br>
<br>
<br>
You know our love was meant to be<br>
The kind of love that lasts forever<br>
And I need you here with me<br>
From tonight until the end of time<br>
<br>
You should know, everywhere I go<br>
You’re always on my mind<br>
In my heart<br>
 In my soul<br>
<br>
You’re the meaning in my life<br>
You’re the inspiration<br>
You bring feeling to my life<br>
You’re the inspiration<br>
Wanna have you near me<br>
I wanna have you hear me sayin’<br>
No one needs you more than I need you<br>
<br>
And I know, yes I know that it’s plain to see<br>
We’re so in love when we’re together<br>
And I know that I need you here with me<br>
From tonight until the end of time<br>
<br>
You should know, everywhere I go<br>
You’re always on my mind<br>
In my heart <br>
In my soul<br>
<br>
You’re the meaning in my life<br>
You’re the inspiration<br>
You bring feeling to my life<br>
You’re the inspiration<br>
Wanna have you near me<br>
I wanna have you hear me sayin’<br>
No one needs you more than I need you<br>
<br>
<br>
Chloe pulled her car to a stop in back of Lex’s Jaguar and arched an eyebrow at him.  <br>
<br>
“Interesting choice of music, Luthor,” she said with a teasing smile.  “I was expecting something more along the lines of Audioslave or Biohazard from you.”  He smirked at her.<br>
<br>
“If we were in my car, then maybe,” he said.  “Speaking of which ---” Lex motioned to his car with his head.  <br>
<br>
“I’ve taken up enough of your time today,” she filled in for him.  He gave her a bemused look and tilted his head slightly as he opened the door.<br>
<br>
“Actually, I was going to ask if you wanted that test drive now; but if you’ve changed your mind ---” he trailed off when he saw Chloe’s face light up.  <br>
<br>
“Really?!”<br>
<br>
“Well ---”<br>
<br>
She jumped out of the car and ran over to him the second she saw the smirk on his lips.  She rose to her tiptoes and threw her arms around him in an emotional hug.  Lex was so surprised by the action that he didn’t have time to embrace her before she pulled away.  She stayed on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek.<br>
<br>
“Thank you, thank you, thank you, Lex.  You won’t regret this,” Chloe said giddily.  Lex chuckled lightly and lowered his mouth to hers for a soft kiss.<br>
<br>
“I know.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The End<br>
