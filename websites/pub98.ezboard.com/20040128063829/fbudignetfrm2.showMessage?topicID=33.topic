It has been a quiet day with the weather fiendishly gray and cool as one can get spoiled fast with some of the nice days we have already experienced the last month or so.  It has also been a day of rest for Jaci as she had a busy day on Friday with a lunch visit from two friends from work and a visit with Pastor Jay.  Jaci seems much more refreshed when she gets a full day of rest after a busy day as it allows her to rest up for warmer days that are always just around the corner this time of the year.  She really enjoys getting out for a ride in the van or a walk on the path in her wheel chair when the weather is nice!  <br>
<br>
Jaci remains alert and aware of what is going on despite her body needing a lot of rest.   Her vitals remain strong and she continues to eat, drink and function as good as one could expect.  The past few weeks have been emotional but important for Jaci with visits from Donna, Herb and her sister Sue a couple weeks ago, and Michelle, Jaci’s other sister who was able to spend a few days with us this past week.     <br>
<br>
Sam is here this weekend and believes he will come back for weekends as much as possible if he is clear of his studies at Washburn University in Topeka.  Though he does have some work lined up at the Overland Park Golf Course, I know a big reason he wants to come home is to be around for Jaci.  He is a lot of help and I know it is a comfort to Jaci and I as well as to Sam that he is able to help as long as it does not distract from his studies as Jaci so astutely has explained!  He really likes it at Washburn and was one of only two alternate RA’s selected from a group of 30 candidates.  Given normal attrition, it is highly likely Sam will be a RA next year and he is looking forward to the position and having his own room.   <br>
<br>
Heidi keeps driving along as a busy sophomore and I do mean driving as she now has her driver’s license.  I am comforted by the fact that she is a very good driver and has matured substantially over the past few months as many have observed.  Tonight she is at a 16th Birthday Party for one of her good friends and seems to be doing OK with everything going on with much of this a result of some good friends at both school and church.  <br>
<br>
I have some fun ahead for me as I found out that an injury playing basketball in late January is a ruptured Achilles tendon.  While I made the basket, it sure puts another wrinkle into what is going on.  I have an appointment this coming Tuesday at Johnson County Orthopedic to discuss where we go from here.  It does not hurt and I have been able to keep chugging along.  <br>
<br>
As mentioned previously and as a reminder, Jaci is now under hospice care as the Mayo Clinic concurred with Dr. Lee that any further treatments would likely be so toxic it would do more harm than good.  Having all of her treatments and care under the umbrella of the same system is comforting in that the hospice care nurse is able to talk directly with Jaci’s Doctor on what is going on.  Jaci and I are very happy with her hospice nurse Tammy, as was Michelle during her visit.  The hospice care also includes access to a very good social worker, a bath person that comes in twice a week and even a dietitian.   All of the nurses have been wonderful.  They are very special people doing very remarkable things when one thinks about it.  <br>
<br>
While Jaci’s strength continues to be very weak, and her voice is very soft, she is able to communicate very well and for the most part her thoughts are very coherent.  I believe at times the amount of rest her body needs does make it confusing to figure out what day of the week or what time of day it is but I can’t keep this straight either!  She does not have the strength to stand on her own so is basically confined to her bed or to her wheel chair though we can get her into the van with relative ease as she does enjoy these road trips.  <br>
<br>
Jaci and I would again like to thank everyone for all of the thoughts, cards, prayers and concerns coming her way from all over the place.   A special thanks to Michelle for her idea to set up a “treasured times” string in the update forum as Jaci does find these to be uplifting even though most will bring her to tears.  If you do have a memory you would like to share please do this in the “treasured times” string as it is much easier to keep track of all of her wonderful gifts and stories under this one string.  <br>
<br>
Jaci and I continue to take each day and each moment for what it provides and we are thankful that Sam and Heidi are doing OK.  We are looking forward to the upcoming week as Jaci’s brother Kevin and sister-in-law Kathy, with their children Nate and Nik, are planning a visit!  While these are tough and difficult days, we know warmer days are just around the corner! <br>

I just read your latest note Dan and felt so deeply for you all.  I see such a similarity between the &quot;battles&quot; your family are going through and the ones being fought in Iraq these past two weeks. There are such wonderful soldiers on both fronts (in KS and in Iraq).  You are &quot;all&quot; so brave in facing the future that lies ahead.  Good luck with your leg Dan and the reptured Achilles tendon.  We're hoping somehow it can mend itself - Is that ever possible?  I hope the sun is shining on you both today and that there will be many more trips outdoors to enjoy the beautiful newness of a spring day.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Bud  Barb</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(3/31/03 11:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbudignetfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re:Update</span><hr size=1> Hi Jaci,Dan,Sam&amp;Heidi, Again, thanks for your updates Dan,we always like to hear how you are all doing.Sorry I did not post the memories from England in the right place but am sure you read them.Am glad that you are able to enjoy the Spring days out driving around Jaci, so many wonderful things to see.We now have so many ducks, geese &amp; seagulls swimming on the now open lake,each day there are more.Sorry to hear about your injury Dan,hope it wont take much to fix it,like somebody said, without surgerywishful thinking eh?

I responded yesterday but missed something as my message didn't go through, who says you can teach an old dog new tricks?!  Anyway, my message was mainly praise for all of you.  I can't think of any family that has been more supportive than yours.  You have really shown all of us the true meaning of caring for one another and living each day to the fullest.  I'm so thankful that you, Dan, are able to spend so much time at home with Jaci and hope that your tendon problem will be easy to correct.  You need to take care of yourself, just a little &quot;advice&quot; from a long time friend!  I think of all of you daily and pray for you along with so many people that love and care for you.
