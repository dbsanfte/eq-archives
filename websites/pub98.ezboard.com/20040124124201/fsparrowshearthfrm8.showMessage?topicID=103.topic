I saw some got upset that she was making an ad trying to sell her paintings.  However, I saw her link to two images only and did not link to any place where you could actually buy her paintings.  I also did not see her talk anything about trying to sell her paintings to us.  I saw no information at all regarding us being able to buy her paintings.  I was totally under the impression that she was just trying to share her artwork and she happened to mention that this is her career that she makes a living off of.<br>
<br>
So just from that aspect alone, I saw no problem with her post and was not offended by it.  She wasn't advertising to us as far as I could see.  If she were, she'd have provided us with information on how to buy her paintings.<br>
<br>
Okay, that was just my two cents worth. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

The thread was closed because HJ and Femme thought they could get the last word about it and be totally hateful! which is just wrong!  You know it wasn't an advertisement, anyone who reads what she posted can tell it's not an ad--if it was she would've posted a website link where you could buy her art-she didn't!!! I think it was in bad taste to close that thread with only 12 posts and all the other threads on here have like 20 or more posts in it!!<br>

That's the only point I'm making.  I imagine part of why she posted that they were for sale was so that nobody took them and posted them elsewhere on the internet.  I don't see her post as an ad.  To me, she'd post her real name and a link to where you could buy her paintings if that were the case.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>NOT only that, but HJ KINDLY made HER rules plain and got major attitude.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
True, I did see her get immediately offended by HJ and thought her response was a bit immature.  I'm not saying the thread shouldn't have been closed.  Her attitude wasn't the most friendly.<br>
<br>
One thing HJ said was this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You already have your website posted on your bio page, so people may view your work if they are so inclined.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I went to the link in her bio and it took me to a web site called &quot;In Touch Ministries&quot; and I'm having a heck of a time finding her paintings.  Is that a link to her site or someone else's site?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>this is not helpful Peaches. If you felt compelled to say something, why not email HJ?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You're right, emailing probably would have been a better way to go.  I didn't think about that until after the fact.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The thread was closed because HJ and Femme thought they could get the last word about it and be totally hateful!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Now that's being too harsh.  I don't think either have been hateful in the least.  Or perhaps it's just that I know them well enough to know they're not hateful people.<br>
<br>

Hey Pot, it's me the Kettle, did you know you are black?<br>
Really, it doesn't help with any conversation once certain adjectives are used in a conversation?  Is it possible, since the situation is now taken care of, to start fresh?  Let this issue fade/die whatever?  <br>
<br>
Heartjoys, maybe, as a suggestion, the rules should state something about solicitation, and that if one wants to show their artwork they are welcome to, but to state if it is copyrighted or whatever within the message?  If someone is interested in purchasing something that someone has posted, or seeing more of their work, for them to contact eachother via e-mail or private pm for that situation?  <br>
For everyone:<br>
This board is very precious, and I know being hurtful is no one's intention.  I know I'm not a moderator either, so no one has to point that out to me.  I'm trying to be helpful though, knowing Heartjoys, Femme, and Peaches pretty well.  I hope everyone understands.<br>
<br>
God bless,<br>

I think you're right about maybe changing the rules--since Celticdmgirl did provide her email incase anyone wanted to contact her personally..<br>
<br>
as for the pot calling the kettle black..i never once called either HJ or Femme any name(s)! But if someone aquires an attitude with me..they can pretty much expect to get one back. <br>

I thought I was just expressing my opinion over that person's post.  As I mentioned above:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm not saying the thread shouldn't have been closed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So I wasn't questioning your decision at all.  I was just trying to address the issue of whether it was a solicitation or not.  I think maybe perhaps then it might be a good thing to discuss to determine what is and isn't considered solicitation?  That might help people who visit the board in the future if the rules are more clearly defined.<br>
<br>
So I hope you see I wasn't questioning your moderating ability.  And perhaps that's why I didn't email.  I think I was trying to bring up a topic so that we could all gain a clearer understanding of this rule.  We all love rules ya know. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :flws --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/flowers1.gif ALT=":flws"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But yes, I'll stop talking now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

<br>
This will be my last post in this.....board. I think it's funny how it stresses caring and love in a Christian way..yet certain people are only concerned with being smart allecks..and they never once appologized for the name calling and rudeness..it's ridiculous. HJ-you have a great board going on here...but it's just not for me.. I'm sorry if i've offended anyone or came accross as rude. I have a loving heart through Christ-so i dont mean to be mean to any of his children. some of you should do the same.<br>
<br>
 God bless you all! <br>

I get busy at work for a couple of days and....  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :ebr --><img src=http://www.geocities.com/anne_g_ivy/eyebrow.gif ALT=":ebr"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
I've checked over all the posts in all the two threads on this subject and as far as I can tell it isn't going to get better without a cool down period.<br>
<br>
So, in my best police voice:  &quot;Everyone take two steps away from the keyboard?&quot;<br>
<br>
I know we alread locked one thread, and I'm going to lock this one - temporarily.  I'll reopen it in 24 hours.  Since we are all Christians here, I think that it would be best for everyone to leave the subject for at least a full day.  I'll reopen it then and hopefully things will be better.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
