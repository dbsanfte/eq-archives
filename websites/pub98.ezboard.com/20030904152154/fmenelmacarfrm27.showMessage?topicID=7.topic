Note: I have switched between reality and recwar pretty seamlessly here. I'm hoping you're all smart enough to be able to tell the difference without it being delineated. Now, without further ado:<br>
<br>
Gather around the Talefire, and Ill tell you of the story of how the Ard-Baron gained his throne, of how the bloodthirsty Babkhans were twice repulsed, of how the ancient prophecies were fulfilled, and of how the Middle Land was incomparably enriched  the story of Treesia.<br>
<br>
The Republic of Treesia was founded in August 2000 by Thomas Hubert, a citizen of Tulsa. President Hubert divided the country into three states: Kalatonia, Johnson, and Fabon, and managed to get a sizeable citizen base, most significantly Steven York, Jordan Borders, and Kevin Tennent. Though there was a legislature, Prime Minister Hubert was extremely powerful, and usually got his way despite frequent legislative opposition. Usually Kevin Tennent would oppose his moves, Steven York would go either way, and Jordan Borders would support him. The standard debates in the legislature were foreign policy and the form of government.<br>
The form of government debate alternated between them being a republic and a principality. Prime Minister Hubert had a lot of power, but people were generally unwilling to make him a prince, even a rather ceremonial one. So as a compromise, they became a principality with Jordan Borders as princess. This was kind of odd, because Borders seemed incredibly (pardon my French) stupid. She would usually just agree with anything Thomas said and then threaten to perform bodily functions upon anyone she disagreed with. But in any case, she became the princess, and Thomas remained Prime Minister.<br>
The other issue, foreign policy, was a bit more complex than it ought to have been. Thomas, looking around one day, found the nation of MyNation, which appeared to be deserted. I may not have mentioned the history of MyNation in the Apollo class, so here goes  Automatic citizen Matt Lamantia, as a parody, founded a country that satirized everything silly about micronations. This country actually did sort of well for a while, but died after about a month and was annexed by Blackrock and the United Demesos. Later Audentior got a part of it too, but thats irrelevant. By the time this story takes place, Audentior and Demesos are gone, and only Blackrock remains in control. But they havent really bothered to put anything indicating their reign on the site, so Hubert marches in and claims it. For whatever reason, Matt had left the password up on the site, so Treesia now has administrative control over it too.<br>
<br>
When Blackrock heard about this claim, they became upset. No one insults Blackrock. Theyre sort of like what Attera would be if the Atterans had a sense of humor, if youll forgive the comparison. So anyway, Shane stodlum Odlum, the Blackrock leader, gathers his allies (which include Jasonia) and threatens Hubert, saying hell attack if they dont give MyNation back. Hubert delays and delays until Blackrock sets a deadline, and at the last second he acquiesces.<br>
Treesia then sets out on a sort of world tour of every foreign policy error its humanly possible to make. Thomas spams Lyrica, insults the Rasinate, mocks Jasonia, annexes a few places that are not what one would call annexable, and does all kinds of other things until everyones calling for his head. But he always apologizes and escapes at the last moment. Except that Blackrock doesnt accept apologies<br>
Blackrock decides that Treesias definitely a problem and that they might as well go and destabilize it and take it over. First agent Alan Waldock joins under the name SidneyL who starts a civil war, but with help from some of the other Apollonians (who are not aware that its Blackrock) the loyalist forces win out. Now Blackrock decides theyre going to have to launch a full scale operation, which they do. Although a number of people are involved, their main agent is Official Prejudgicat Eoin Dornan, who joins Treesia and works his way up to become their President.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, Im the head of the Jasonian Intelligence Network, and I (totally unaware of Blackrocks plan) come to the similar conclusion that Hubert needs to be eliminated. So I set up a secret operation myself, and I enlist the help of most of the Treesian legislature (who by this time is downright sick of their crazy Prime Minister) and President Dornan. Being a Secret Agent, I use the code name Arjuna for the whole affair, but due to technical difficulties Eoin figures out its me right away. Anyway, Thomas mentions that hes leaving on a trip for a few days and I figure I can get the legislature to impeach Hubert and then make Eoin president. Well, the plan sort of works, but Blackrock then implements their plan at the same time, which leads to a total mess of no one knowing whose side who is on or even how many sides there are. When Thomas Hubert comes back, he realizes hes been beaten and he deletes Treesia. Blackrock, however, hacks into Treesia and makes it one of their provinces. In the hacking, the information comes out that Jordan Borders was in fact Thomas Huberts double login, which explained a lot.<br>
But theres more! In the middle of the chaos, Kevin Tennent, governor of Fabon, figured all was lost and revolted. Knowing that Hubert would come after him, he enlisted some very powerful allies  specifically, the Rasinate  Ras Diga was Fabons defense minister person, which should mean something. Anyway, Fabon survived as a prosperous if rather small separate country until October.<br>
<br>
So, Treesias now a Blackrock province. Its given to Eoin to govern since he was really in charge of the operation against it. But on October 14, Blackrock falls. *pauses for crying* Its will gives Treesia over to Eoin to do what he wishes.<br>
And what Eoin wishes is to implement an idea hed obviously been planning for some time. A lot of places were derogatorily called fantasy nations  Jasonia, Shirerotheven Audentior. But what about a REAL fantasy nation? One that didnt even pretend to seriousness, but where noble knights could fight evil dragons, the good Baron could distribute feudal lands, and there were always a few damsels in distress around needing saving? Eoin created a new board, the Barony of Treesia, and asked Kevin Tennent if Fabon would like to be reunited, now that Hubert was gone. Kevin said yes, and the nation became The Barony of Treesia and Fabon.<br>
<br>
The new Barony was quickly organized into Knightships. Originally there was Hundland, Llacheu, Wickhigh, Koroch, Fabon, Breigh, and Ecosse. But Eoin quickly sold off Ecosse to the Rasinate to gain some much needed cash, and Blackrocks other province, MyNation joined, having its name changed to Vembria. The Knightships were handed out  Bill got Hundland, Jason Llacheu, dStryker Wickhigh, Kevin Tennent Fabon, Kevin Brenneman Breigh, Blackrockian general Brandon Frymire Vembria, and Eoin himself kept Koroch.<br>
<br>
But almost immediately after its founding, the Barony had to deal with the formation of the Union of Apollo States. There was a major debate on whether the Barony should join. Originally, Eoin supported it in the name of Apollo unity, but a number of his people fought against it, and he soon changed his mind and did what everyone else did  that is, create a state in UAS but leave Treesia independent. The state created was Erior, Land of Mermaids, but this was never really developed.<br>
<br>
In Treesia proper at this time, the most important event was that Brandon Frymire departed to Realms Unknown, and his replacement as Knight of Vembria was Sir Iain Vembria, who seemingly came out of nowhere. Iain would, of course, later become pretty much the foundation on which everything Treesian was constructed and equal to the Ardbaron in power if not in rank. At the time, however, he mainly just gave lots of riddles, which were a lot of fun. Everyone came to Treesia to participate in Iains little riddle games, or to complain about how stupid they were. More than one time a multinational war almost broke out over whose answers to the riddles were correct. Iain also made everyone like him by giving the various knightships Christmas presents. (this ploy to get people to like him worked surprisingly well considering none of the presents were real). On the other hand, I made as a Christmas present an entire website for Fabon, and no one seemed to notice, but no, Im not bitter. <br>
<br>
Around this time, we also got the beginnings of the Treesian economy and religion. The economy was based on Gold Pieces, with smaller denominations being silver and bronze pieces (and dont forget 9.5 left over Easter Eggs for the Zinc Piece). These were purposefully very non-decimal and confusing. As for religion, it began very innocently with a few Treesian saints and stories of their deeds (one of whom, by the way, was St. Zor, Slayer of Idiocy). But then dStryker offered to donate a large sum of money if Gardexscatilbisc was canonized god of telephones. Never ones to refuse donations just for the sake of dignity or sanity, the Church accepted. But they did get the last laugh. Old Gardexscatilbisc survives in the current pantheon as Ardescit Soundsenser, The Ears of Laguna, God of Communication. By about the middle of 2001, there were definitely the Irdia and Mandorallen, and the basic structure got further developed in the end of that year. But Im getting ahead of myself.<br>
Also in early 2001, Treesia took control of its first two Palatinates, New Bruges and Elpidos. New Bruges was originally founded as an independent country in late 2000 by Caesar Augustus, a Treesian Knight and the Lord of the Centaurs. When Caesar disappeared, New Bruges was briefly ignored and then madly scrambled for (in the matter of many inactive lands). The winner of the scramble was Treesia, because they had the moral authority of being the last known residence of Bruges founder. In the beginning, it had the official status of Protectorate, and Treesia sort of calmed its angry ghost by memorializing it in the Bruges Memorial College, which was rather active for a month or two before going the way of all other micronational colleges. The next place to join Treesia was Elpidos. After the fall of the Flying Islands of Jasonia, its old territory, Tapfer, and the islands directly north of it under its control, were sort of in limbo. Bill Dusch, their leader, impressed with the quality of Treesian culture and by Eoins promise to elaborate on the history of any lands under Treesian control, gave them to Treesia on August 31. Originally, it consisted of five knightships of its own, places like Elivia, Esthar, Ptia, et cetera. But when it became obvious that this would be a bit unwieldy, Iain pushed through the Council Chamber a new policy that organized external territories as Palatinates. New Bruges became one retroactively, and Elpidos was reorganized. The leader of a Palatinate was a Baron-Palatine, which theoretically made them equal to the Baron of Treesia. This was bad, so another act was made promoting the Baron of Treesia to Ard-Baron of the United Baronies of Treesia. This United Baronies concept worked so well that eventually the name of the country was officially changed to it, although I think its stupid and everyone continues to call it Treesia anyway.<br>
<br>
But now Ive gone and ruined the chronology. Were now in about the middle of 2001. Its the summer, and we all know what summer means. People go away on summer vacations. And that is what Eoin did, for about two weeks. To France, if I recall. Land of cheese-eating surrender monkeys. But I digress. Anyway, a few months before, when he was working on the history of the different knightships, he casually mentioned that Llacheu was once ruled by talking dogs. Some crazy joker (when I find out who it is, Ill strangle them outright) thought it would be a good idea to create a Fido The Talking Dog login. Anyhow, Fido then said that the Talking Dogs had been oppressed by the humans for too long and they were going to do something about it. So they revolted against the leader of Llacheu at that time, who was The Micronationalist Formerly Known As Jason. Unfortunately, during the course of this revolt it was discovered that Jason was in fact a potent Inferno Mage, and so Fido had to call for reinforcements. He summoned Duke The Talking Dog, a diplomat, Spot The Talking Dog, a warrior, and Star The Talking Dog, a wizard (albeit an incredibly bad one). With their help, the revolt lasted perhaps a week, until everyone grew bored, which brings us back to our original point, Eoin taking a vacation to France in mid 2001. The Talking Dogs decided that with the Baron away, their result would have a much better chance of success. Fido reappeared and declared himself the true Baron, making a few random decrees (of which my favorite is changing the countrys official name from The Barony of Treesia and Fabon to The Barony of Fabon and Treesia). Chancellor Iain was around, but, in the tradition of these sorts of things, chose to do little and let the game go on. When the Baron returned, he started a crackdown on the Cynian (the Talking Dogs call their city Cynos) rebels. The Talking Dogs then appealed to the Babkhans for help. And the Babkhans came.<br>
<br>
In fact, they came a bit too zealously. For they were led by the insane general Sarhang Ataxerxes, and he was on some kind of bizarre Zoroastrian crusade to level the land of Treesia, enslave its inhabitants, and salt its fields. The Knightships of Breigh and Vembria soon fell to their advance, and they attacked the New Bruges embassy and college. They also called in their friends the New Soviets, who caused a bit of trouble and, rather unwisely, invaded their own embassy (and captured it!). But the Treesians struck back. They called on the remnants of Jasonia, who now called themselves the Paladins of Micron, and on the Magi, who were led by Bill Dusch, and they kept the Babkhans and Soviets in check. Perhaps the highlight of this war was the great dual atop the Tower of Fire, where a newly revealed Dog Magus, Spark The Talking Dog, challenged a champion of the Treesians to a duel. The one who came was a being from the dark mists of antiquity, an evil spirit named Lord Erion who nevertheless defends Treesia when it is in need. Spark summoned some spirit helpers, but Erion called on his two friend/servants, Sir Benovic and Sir Ergonzo, and the battle was a bit of a draw. Finally, Spark used an ancient weapon of Mandorallen against the Towers foundations, but it came up against the power of the Tower itself, and both Spark and her archenemy the Inferno Mage, who were in the region, were catapulted by the clash to another dimension, from which they only exited a few months ago. After this, the tide of battle turned once again, as Stjepan Aracic lent the awesome powers of the Stormrider Sword and the Istvanistani Armies to the Treesian cause. While the Stormrider Sword did not have its much-vaunted effect of reducing its enemies to charred skeletons, the Istvanistani Armies did have their much-vaunted effect of producing boatloads of spam. Eventually it became too much trouble to wade through it all and everyone went home. Someone yelled at Stjepan over the matter and Stjepan got really touchy about it. Everyone parted on pretty bad terms, which I suppose is usual for a war, but hardly desirable. <br>
<br>
When the conflict was over, it became necessary to make some sense out of it. Eoin declared that the war had been ended by the successful completion of a Quest To Cranmarlar, the Tree At The Center Of The Earth. Also, it was to be called the War of the Orchids. Since no one had any clue WHY it would be called the War of the Orchids, Eoin asked Scott to write something on the subject. Bad idea. The Book of the Orchids is now a three book long poem and growing every day (well, not really, I dont work on it nearly as often as I should). <br>
<br>
After the War of the Orchids, things calmed down (they could hardly fail to do so). There was a brief interlude when a Comrade Redstorm threatened to take over and hack the country and put the military on alert, but we can all guess who that was (hintthe initials were T.H.) but there was really a big decrease in activity until the foundation of Tymaria. That was when (surprise, surprise) the Second War of the Orchids started up. By this time, the crazy insane Sarhang Ataxerxes had changed his name to Ardashir and become Shah of Babkha, and he was working on conquering the world. Treesia happened to be in the way, so he went in and invaded, using brutal scorched-earth tactics. Most of Treesias old allies came to its aid once again, and the Babkhans were defeated with minimal loss, especially since a clone of the Shah, Ardashir the Red, defected and joined the Treesian forces. But this time, the Treesians were not content. Ard-Baron Eoin ordered the creation of a great fleet that would allow the Treesians to bring the war to Babkhan soil, and Marach Siskind called a crusade against the foe. After the completion of what was to be called the Tiarnuil Fleet, Treesia, with allies from South Mondesia, Proletaria, Tapfer, and elsewhere, attacked Babkha and burnt the city of Susa. Finally the Shah granted Treesia the right to spread their religion in Babkhan lands, and the Treesians, satisfied, went home. <br>
<br>
At the same time as the Second War of the Orchids, a more long-lasting development was taken place. Treesia had had its little mythology  Eoin introduced the Irdia and the Faldia in a class at the Bruges College  but it had never had a real religion. Thus Eoin conceived the Treesian Unorthodox Church. He set up a hierarchy using Irish names and having some pretty strict rules, and asked people to join as clergymen. Only one person did  Scott Siskind of Tymaria, who was also a citizen of Llacheu at the time. Together, Eoin and Scott planned the vast elaboration of Treesian mythology, until there were about a hundred gods and each had a distinct personality, history, and relationship. They then started going and preaching the good news in foreign nations. The first mission, Saint Derwick, appeared in Babkha (as stated above). Around that time, one of Eoins real life friends (and I use the term friend very very loosely here), Stephen of Koroch, joined. Stephen volunteered to lead the Babkhan mission, and Scott started work in Cumquat. Missions began to be set up everywhere from Tymaria to Amerada to Pacary, and provided a major need to flesh out the religion, something which was done far quicker than it probably should have been. A number of new people, like Benazir Malik of Babkha, joined, and a new Treesian named Friedel, who is the current church leader.<br>
<br>
Now that Ive abandoned the concept of chronological order completely, I might as well get to the three other Palatinates. Terra Firma was a part of Alteria under the control of Sir Iain. When Alteria fell, Treesia got Terra Firma. Tallandor was a very nice nation that unfortunately never made it off the ground. Its leader I guess just got really fed up and called it quits, leaving the country to Eoin. And the Skerry Isles  they seceded from Tymaria when Dafydd decided he didnt like the United Republic very much, but there wasnt a Baracao back then, so Dafydd gave it to Treesia, being pretty good friends with Eoin.<br>
<br>
Theres probably a lot Im missing here. Its hard to do a history of Treesia very well since history and culture are so inextricably bound up. A lot of the country just exists to create the culture, and a lot of the culture has done its part in creating the country. Treesia could honestly be a whole separate class here (and perhaps someday it will be) but I hope this has given you a bit of clarity as to its origins and the way it functions. And as you learn Treesias past, participate in its present, and shape its future, always remember  somewhere, behind it all, FINBO is watching.<br>
