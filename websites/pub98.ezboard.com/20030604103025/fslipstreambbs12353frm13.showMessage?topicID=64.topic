Friendship is not necessary for a Nietzschan.<br>
It is however not devoid of value.<br>

<br>
<br>
        &quot;Captian Hunt, over here.  You must see this,&quot; a Persied High Guard officer holding the rank of Lieutenant called excitedly from across the old Guard Station.  They had discovered this facility, one of the last High Guard strongholds to fall during the Nietzschean Uprising, only a few days before.  When Dylan Hunt heard about the grand discovery he could not help it, he had to check out the old station for himself.<br>
<br>
        Dylan approached the young officer to see what had made him so excited.  As he approached Dylan could make out a number of old damaged stasis pods and what looked like a medical facility beyond.<br>
<br>
        &quot;What is it Lieutenant Timrek,&quot; Dylan asked as he came up beside the officer.  Timrek was standing in front of one of the stasis pods holding a portable scanner up to it.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Sir,&quot; the Persied began, &quot;This stasis pod is still active and there is someone inside.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Dylan pushed the Persied aside and using his sleeve he cleared the centuries old fog from the glass viewport.  Stumbling away from the stasis pod in utter shock he looked at the know very confused and upset Persied.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Open that pod,&quot; Dylan ordered.<br>
        &quot;But we do not know...&quot; the Persied began but was cut off by Dylan's hard gaze.<br>
<br>
        &quot;I said open it,&quot; Dylan ordered again, this time Timrek complied.<br>
<br>
        A haze escaped the pod as Timrek cracked the ancient seal and opened the stasis pod.  Inside a Nietzschean, wearing a High Guard uniform, violently inhaled his first breathe in three hundred years.  Disoriented the Nietzschean opened his eyes and tried to take his first step from the pod.<br>
<br>
        On shaky feet the Nietzschean stepped forward falling to the ground the moment he tried to support his own weight.  Dylan rushed to the side of the fallen Nietzschean knelling by him and trying to turn him over on to his back.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Khalid,&quot; Dylan said trying to gain the Nietzschean's focus.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Dylan,&quot; the confused Nietzschean replied, &quot;What's going on?&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;We need to get him back to the ship,&quot; Dylan ordered, &quot;And check the rest of these stasis pods.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
        A few hours later Dylan went to check on his old Nietzschean friend.  He was still on Med Deck undergoing a series of tests, making certain that his long stasis had no detrimental effects on his genetic structure.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Captian Ismail Khalid,&quot; Dylan began, &quot;There is just no keeping you down.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;You know what they say, Dylan, &quot;Khalid responded laying on the analysis bed, &quot;What ever doesn't kill you, just gets in the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Indeed,&quot; Dylan replied.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Where are we,&quot; Khalid asked, &quot;This Med facility is to small to be on the Andromeda.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;You right,&quot; Dylan told him, &quot;The Andromeda is undergoing some upgrades so she laid up in space dock for the next few days.  This is a brand new Raptor's Claw Rapid Assault Ship, the latest design for the Restored Commonwealth.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Restored Commonwealth,&quot; Khalid smiled, &quot;You restored the Commonwealth.  I always new you had superior genetics for a human.  So what do you call this tug?&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;The Swift Defiance,&quot; Dylan told him, &quot;The fastest ship in the Commonwealth.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Impressive,&quot; Khalid responded.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Do you want a tour,&quot; Dylan asked.<br>
<br>
        &quot;If my doctor agrees,&quot; Khalid said.<br>
<br>
        A little while later Dylan and Khalid were walking through the corridors of the Defiance.  Khalid listened as Dylan reported the specs of the new ship.  The Defiance in physical appearance did not stray far from the old Commonwealth aesthetic.  It's main hull was similar in design to the updated Glorious Heritage-Class ships like the Renewed Valour.  It had two &quot;wings&quot; that stretched out in front of the ship like those on the Andromeda but they did not form the two loops at the rear of the ship or attach to any kind of slip-runner pylons.  Underneath there was a large ramscoop again the same as that found on the Andromeda.<br>
<br>
        &quot;She's four hundred and seventy metres long,&quot; Dylan was saying, &quot;and has a crew of one hundred and twelve.  She is armed with twenty ELS missile tubes, four Antiproton Cannons and six point defence lasers.  She also can carry a full squadron of twelve slipfighters.<br>
<br>
        &quot;And she's fast, with a cruising speed of 60 PSL and a max. velocity of about 70 PSL.&quot;<br>
<br>
        They together strode onto the Command Deck.  The smallish bridge contained only the most necessary stations for the combat effectiveness of the ship.  In the centre of the deck a slipstream piloting station complete with pilots chair, beside a control station for the use of the Captian.<br>
<br>
        The first officers station was on the opposite side of the slipstream station and both Captian and First Officer station looked over two small crew pits.  In the crew pits the ships tactical and sensor stations were located, while along the back of the deck engineering and flight control systems were located.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Captains on deck,&quot; a Sergeant called out gaining the attention of the Defiance's Captain.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Welcome aboard, Captain Khalid,&quot; the ships captain said as she approached, &quot;I am Samantha Riley, Captain of the Swift Defiance.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Riley?&quot; Khalid asked looking at Dylan but it was Riley herself that responded.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Yes, Sara Riley was my great, great, great aunt,&quot; she told him, &quot;Thanks to you Sara Riley was able to save a lot of people.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;I'm glad to hear it,&quot; Khalid replied, &quot;I was worried that I would never be able to find out what happened to her.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;She founded a colony,&quot; Dylan said, &quot;the last remnant of the Commonwealth.  She gathered as many people as she could together, the surveyors of my crew and the Starry Wisdom and their families a they built themselves a new world.  I believe some of your family joined here there also.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Good,&quot; was all Khalid could say.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Let me show you to your quarters,&quot; Dylan said, &quot;Trust me, discovering that three hundred years has gone by is a lot to handle for one day.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
        Later in his quarters after having spent several hours helping Dylan sort through the old Guard Station, Ismail Khalid was reviewing Dylan's mission.  The last three years had seen the rise of a new Commonwealth, the rebuilding of the High Guard and the threat of a new holocaust at the hands of the Magog.<br>
<br>
        The rest of the known worlds were still in chaos as Nietzschean Prides continued to fight each other for dominance while warlords and opportunists reeked havoc across space.<br>
<br>
        A sudden vibration followed by an battle alert punctuated Khalid's research.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Battle Stations,&quot; Captain Riley ordered over the intercom.<br>
<br>
        Not knowing exactly what to do Khalid decided to head for the Command Deck to see if he could be of assistance.  High Guard personnel were running up and down the corridors heading toward their battle stations, Khalid followed a group of them that seemed to be heading in the general direction he was going.<br>
<br>
        Stepping on to Command a few moments later a scene of near chaos struck him.  Captain Riley stood at her Station directing the fight against one of the Nietzschean's large Leviathan Roused Cruisers and at least two dozen of the Garuda heavy fighters.  Already the Defiance's slipsfighters had already launched and were engaging in battle.  A second enemy cruiser was attempting a flanking manoeuvre with dozens more fighters as support.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Lt. Timrek,&quot; Riley ordered, &quot;Get us to slipstream.&quot; <br>
<br>
        &quot;Sir,&quot; the Lieutenant replied, &quot;They are firing AG mass packets, the gravity is bogging us down.&quot;<br>
<br>
        A massive missile strike prevented Riley from responding as she was tossed across the deck by force of the impact.  Picking himself off the deck, Khalid ran to the Captain's side.  A pool of blood was forming underneath her skull, she was dead.<br>
<br>
        Turning to look to Dylan, whom he assumed would now take command, Khalid was surprised to see that Dylan too was laying still on the deck.  With his enhanced Nietzschean vision and hearing, Khalid was able to determine that Dylan was still breathing.<br>
<br>
        &quot;I am Captain Ismail Khalid and I am assuming command of this ship,&quot; Khalid called out, &quot;Target the lead Nietzschean cruiser and open fire with everything we've got.&quot;<br>
<br>
        The crew paused for a moment unsure if they should follow the orders of a Nietzschean, particularly one they had just met.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Fire now,&quot; Khalid ordered as he took the captain's station.<br>
<br>
        The twenty missile tubes opened fire with massive salvos of kinetic missiles.  The Nietzschean cruiser was caught flat footed in the barrage and was forced to peel off from its attack.  The second cruiser still approached from behind the bogged down Defiance.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Get those mass packets of the hull,&quot; Khalid said, &quot;How long till slipstream?&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Five more minutes at least,&quot; Timrek reported.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Full stop,&quot; Khalid ordered.<br>
<br>
        &quot;What,&quot; Timrek replied incredulously, &quot;We'll be killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;I'm a Nietzschean,&quot; Khalid told him, &quot;Do you think I want to die.&quot;<br>
<br>
        That seemed to satisfy the twitch Perseid and he rapidly reversed thrust bringing the ship to a full halt allowing the Nietzschean ship to approach.  The black form of the Nietzschean cruiser came closer, soon they were in real-time communications range.<br>
<br>
        &quot;This is Fleet Marshal Cuatemoc aboard the Drago-Kazov Warship Rising Star,&quot; the voice came over the communication system, &quot;Surrender your vessel and prepare to be boarded.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;This is Captain Ismail Khalid, out of Jasmine by Abram,&quot; Khalid replied, &quot;And your already dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
        The Defiance's six heavy A-P Cannons opened fire on the Rising Star striking the cruiser before they could possibly respond.  The Nietzschean ship began to break apart as the antiprotons ripped into the ship.  A handful of escape pods managed to launch before the entire vessel erupted as its own fuel tanls exploded.<br>
<br>
<br>
        &quot;And you said no one could keep me down,&quot; Khalid joked to Dylan.  There places were now reversed, Dylan was on the analysis bed and Khalid was the visitor.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Well you know what they say...&quot; Dylan repiled, &quot;I've read your report Ismail, you did good today.  The Defiance is going to need a new Captain, I'd like you to take the job.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;What,&quot; Khalid replied, &quot;I haven't even been unthawed for two days and your offering me a commission?&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;That's right,&quot; Dylan replied, &quot;I've spoken with the Definace avatar and the first officer Cdr. Sturm, they both agree you've earned the job.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Thank you Captain,&quot; Khalid said, &quot; I won't let you down.&quot; <p>&quot;Requested items: One Mark V ECM unit, 1000 km of fullerene cable, one low yield nuclear warhead. Stated purpose: birthday party for foreign dignitary.&quot;  --Argosy Special Operations Service requisition form, CY 9512  <br>
