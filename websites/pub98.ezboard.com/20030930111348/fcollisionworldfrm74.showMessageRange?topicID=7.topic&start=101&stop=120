Do you think she wants to know that?  Do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Azalea suddenly seemed lost for words.  She didn't know why or how she had told this to Aeli, but now she regretted it.  Her eyes narrowing, she moved forward and quickly, but gently, pushed Laurena into his arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here,&quot; she said, teeth gritted.  &quot;You take her.

<br>
&quot;Oh, Aeli...&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I had such a horrible dream...but thank goodness you're okay.&quot;  She hugged him as tightly as she could with her one arm, the other one she couldn't move.  &quot;Kelin saved me, Aeli...but I'm glad you're back.&quot;  Suddenly she shivered.  &quot;W-where is Tryphaena?  Is she gone?&quot;<br>
<br>
She vaguely noticed as many sirens came up to her and started asking questions that warbled in her mind.  They attacked her with words, and all she wanted to do was fall back into that sweet darkness where their words could not reach her for the moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Phoenix!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Phoenix, oh no!  Is she okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's Tryphaena?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tryphaena's alive!!!  Oh, no!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We're not safe anymore!&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena tried to calm their fears, but she could barely string two words together.  &quot;I'm sorry...&quot; she whispered, regardless of whether they could hear her or not.  She buried her face into Aeli's chest in a desperate attempt to make the noises stop.<br>

Laurena laid very still as Azalea cast a healing spell upon her.  she felt herself burn a little as the foreign magic claimed her, sealing the clawmarks of the dark siren and mending her arm.  She only looked away, feeling very embarrassed and useless.<br>
<br>

&quot;Why?  Why doesn't she just kill me and have it done? Why does she have to torture me and everyone I care about?

&quot;Are you sure you love me?&quot; He whispered. Why couldn't he beleive those words she spoke so sincerely? Why? He saw no deception in her eyes when she spoke them, so why wouldn't his heart accept them? Maybe becuase he didn't want her to love him...maybe that was the reason. <br>
<br>
If she loved him, there were so many more things that could happen to her than if she didn't. So many of his enemies...he'd already seen her tormented enough. He couldn't stand much more of her torment. He just couldn't. With all his heart, his wished he could just, die. That wish wasn't easy to hold back either. So much happened to him...Laurena was even at risk right now. She'd always be at risk, for the rest of her life. <p>Sekihoutai PRIDE!<br>

<br>

&quot;I'm willing to bear this pain for you.  I just have to learn how.  I'll learn how to fight...to defend myself. Defend you.  I just need a chance, that's all.&quot;<br>

A long moment passed as she suddenly felt a chill of fear, though so warmly wrapped in Aeli's embrace.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you...sure...you love me?&quot;  She forced the words out of her mouth.  Even if he wasn't sure, if he didn't love her, that was alright.

He gently rested his head atop the siren girl's and closed his eyes. <br>
&quot;Why else would I go after you when you've been kidknapped. Why else would I hold you like this time after time?&quot; His voice was so soft and timid at this point, he could barely hear himself. <br>
&quot;Or hurt every time I saw any sign of pain, of any sort on your face, or in your eyes. Why else would I devote my every breath to you? Or watch the sparkle in your eyes so fondly.&quot; His voice got louder, but barely. <br>
&quot;Or feel as if i'm the luckiest man alive, just to see you smile or hear you laugh. Why else?&quot; It ended in a whisper again as he held her closer. <p>Sekihoutai PRIDE!<br>

Suddenly frightened, as if he would evaporate at any moment, Laurena held tightly to him.  This was one person Tryphaena would not have the pleasure of taking from her. <br>
