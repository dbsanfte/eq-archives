The sound of a loud thud coming right before each increase in their size.  Soon small bits of the wall began to crumble as parts of it began to break, though amazingly it still held enough to not shatter against what was ever pressing against it.  A bright flash trailed through the middle of it right before everything stopped.  The noise that had once come from the inside of the building suddenly silent.  The calm lasted a short time before a cloud of dust blew through every crack that had lined the wall, shattering it and sending the rumble along the street.  Within it was the sound of footsteps treading quickly over the bumpy ground as something shifted within the rubble, the dust still to thick to see much detail.<br>
<br>
The middle of the cloud of dust that filled the air suddenly bending inward as if something had cut it, yet the length of the cut seemed far to long for any weapon that anyone could have wielded with such speed.  “Ok I need to make a note not to come back to this place   A few quick coughs could be heard after the voice as the dust began to clear.  All that was there was one man, a sheathed sword in his left held, held at about its middle.  His right hand sweeping back and forth in front of his face a few times to help clear away the dust from the air.  Though the effects of it truly did very little compared to the amount that was there.  Beneath his one footing was the remains of another, by the looks most could have figured it to be a vampire.  How there seemed to be little to any wounds visible minus one.  The one that had been fatal too it.  Behind the one stranger, back in the remains of the building were a few other that shared the same fate.<br>
<br>
Brushing the hair from his face as he looked around the ruins of the city that he had seen so many times before.  Even in the dark of night his mind could visualize enough of the place that he knew his way well.  After all he had spent perhaps more time here then most other places.  Attempting to take out as many as was possible, yet it seemed no matter the number there was always another to replace.  <br>
<br>
Walking over and past the fallen remains of the wall, waiting to see if the noise that he had made would attracted any other attention.  However from the silence that hovered in the air it apparent that for the moment there was nothing.  Slowly he moved to the center of the entire place, yawning for a second.  The place was always so empty of anyone, least anyone that was friendly and didn’t want to make him a meal.  Some company from time to time would be nice.  However from all that he had seen in his travels there wasn’t much left anywhere.  Then again he had really only gone one way and that is what lead him to this very place.  <br>
<br>
However just as he went to sit down something caught his eye.  A shadow moving just slightly in the distance, in the remains of another buildings.  Something watching him through the window.  With the permanent dark around it was impossible to tell what it was that was watching him.  Though his first guess was something that was not very welcoming of strangers.  His grip on the sheath tightening slightly as his view locked towards whatever it was.  Though by now the shadow had faded from view.  Either it had noticed that it had been seen and wished to be no more.  Or its intention was to be seen and it was now in wait.  <br>
<br>
His muscles tensing for a second before he darted forward at nearly full sprint, which to anyone that watched was rather fast.  Speeds that normally it seemed only a vampire could reach.  As the building neared, bending at one knee and jumping straight towards the window, which happened to be the second floor one.  The opening was not large enough for anyone to have more then looked through.  However just as before there was one quick flash across the window and the rubble that blocked it.  The drawing of his sword and the strike that it had made going so fast it was nearly impossible to follow.  However just as he reached the peak of the jump at the window, its blockade falling out from it allowing him an easy landing.  Sheathing his sword as he looked around the immediate room for any signs of what might have been watching.  “Well that was a waste of a great show off moment.” <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showPrevMessage?topicID=1.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.emailToFriend?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.threadControl?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="kalaberiafrm36">Mortal and Kindred Laws<option value="kalaberiafrm37">Character Biographies<option value="kalaberiafrm38">Character Plotting<option value="kalaberiafrm45">Times Square<option value="kalaberiafrm40">Central Park<option value="kalaberiafrm41">Stanton Isle<option value="kalaberiafrm42">Abandoned Subway<option value="kalaberiafrm43">Chitter Chatter<option value="kalaberiafrm44">Advertisements <option value="kalaberiafrm46">Admin and mods<option value="kalaberiafrm47">Warehouse District</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia>MidnyghtRising</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45>Times Square</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br> <a href=http://www.runesofdesire.com><img src=http://runesofdesire.com/rod6.jpg></a><br><br>
