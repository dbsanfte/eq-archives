What your bin men did was pathetic. How on earth are you going to get the message across by simply taking a few days off work?<br>
It's like the railway strikes - not all the trains stopped ... a half-hearted pathetic little strike, that really brought across very little.<br>
<br>
I'd rather not have strikes, but if people sincerely believe that they are being treated wrong - then they should do it properly.<br>
We should learn from the French, they strike properly. They get their message across and cause panic in boardrooms, and once the issue is resolved go back to work as if nothing has happened without a grumble.<br>
The fuel protest was hyped up as a big thing, when really it was only a small protest by French standards. However it DID achieve something, despite its rather half-hearted approach. Just imagine what would have been achieved had ALL petrol been stopped and the protests went on for a few days longer, so that supermarkets were almost empty?<br>
<br>
So next time you have a grievance, dont just take a day off work. Make it a national all encompassing strike, and go cause some havoc in Central London. I suggest pouring bath foam in the fountains - we did that in Amsterdam once and it made a great mess.<br>
<br>
Viva la revolution.<br>

I dont agree with strikes over every little thing but workers should have rights imo, remember the tolpuddle matyrs that founded the trade union movement in this country? They paid the price for the freedom that workers today have to protest.<br>
<br>
I agree with the right to strike when the cause is just. Workers in public servises for local councils are among some of the lowest paid around, everyone with a job deserves a decent living wage, that is a simple human right. They are on strike because they want a wage increase of 6% that isn't so much when you realise that many of them earn only £10,000 a year or less, after tax there isnt much of that left. In recent years council workers have been treated like shit, they've had compulsory redundancies cos of the tories bringing in private firms tendering for jobs. All this did was lower the standard of work that many councils got, workers that have previously been employed by the councils were often made compulsory redundant, then reemployed by private firms on lower wages, and often on shortterm temporary contracts that meant they had no employment rights and no holidays or anything. That is wrong imo.<br>
<br>
Think of big business with the fat cat bosses that get huge bonuses every year for nothing, that money could give your every day worker a decent living wage. No one needs to earn the kind of money some of these bosses and chaiirmen are geting.<br>
<br>
So a one day strike means a little inconveininece, doesnt always make the cause wrong. Would we feel the same if nurses struck for more money? Or firemen?<br>
<br>
I back strikes and other forms of non violent protest where all else fails. I backed the lorry drivers protest against high fuel prices. <br>
<br>
The british are crap at protesting, look at the french, and how they protested about high fuel prices and otehr things, we should be more like them then our governament wouldnt treat us so badly. <br>

Just wait until they start striking Iraq. Then you will know what striking is really about. It looks to me like we should be worried about nuclear warfare, not sanitation collection. Someone is finally standing up to Britain, well done Saddam - you mad maniac killer you! well done!<br>
<br>
Dear Speaker, I was watching PMQs (prime ministers question time) today and I must say, they do waste an awful lot of time talking absolutely bullshit. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Thank you Speaker<br>
<br>
I heard it was a 4% increase for the majority of them. I watched as the bin sat outside all day, as the green sticker on the side said 'Compost Test Area B' and the red and blue stickers listed the holidays where the normal timetable would differ. It was a sad day for the old men and women who stay at home to watch their bags of rubbish or bins to be collected.<br>
<br>
30 years ago, or 20 -I neither know or care about the date - there was a strick which lasted over a week in Belfast. There was a name for it, but I just call it, 'they wanted more dosh so striked week'.<br>
<br>
Now, if you want anything, you must strike. It is not too old, it is not too new, it might be borrowed and the bin bags might sometimes be blue. The 4% rise would mean for some of them a 4.5p extra an hour. As a recent TV program revealed, the PEOPLE who walk around Britains street cleaning up your coke cans and your crunchie bar wrappers, could be getting paid even less than the MACHINE that steals your money, and rarely even works, when you park your car and stick 35p in the parking meter, or a few pounds if its the city. Some people say its because the machine goes to the bother of printing you a sticker saying 'Always wear your seatbelt!' on one side and '18/07/2002 -00:43 -40 minutes - Your car may be clamped and removed if you fail to pay properly' on the other side, sometimes it even uses colour ink, and the other version, the bin collector, doesn't leave you anything for taking your rubbish, but I think its got more to do with the government getting more money, so the people must therefore get less. As the Tories put it, pumping more money into health &amp; schools will not get rid of the problems. Change must be made.<br>
<br>
And change is what is happening. The government has introduced, 'Let the MP's go absolutely bonkers weekend!' where they say taxes are going up, prison sentences are going down, judges are becoming gods, and maybe they will go so far to give N Ireland a border poll.<br>
<br>
Ahah! I have returned to that topic once again! Absessive perhaps! Or maybe I just spend too much time watching QVC, actually, the answer is, I spend no time watching it at all, I couldn't even tell you what channel it is!! The government plans to release a statement in the next week, not apologising for the thousands of non-combatants they have killed and terrorised in Ireland for thousands of years, but allowed David Trimble to hold a border poll in N Ireland along with the local UK elections, in May 2003. <br>
This will allow the people of N Ireland to vote whether they want to stay in the United Kingdom or create a United Ireland. During the week I have no doubt a deal was being made in Dublin, if a United Ireland does appear then the Northern Ireland Assembly will have new rights to join the Dail and therefore act as MP's there. I have no idea what way this system will work, but it will end rule from London over a period of years. Probably, what will be the longest years ever.<br>
If they stay in the United Kingdom, as there is a good chance of happening, then the Unionists will be merry. It will prove a huge result for the Republicans, as I am sure there percentage will be amazing, and even though the British have tried to kill them in the north, they will show that they have managed to get over 40% - I presume the unionist/nationalist vote will be very slim. Yet there is a year to go before the elections, so you never know what might happen. Figures show a Catholic majority in Northern Ireland by 2020 since they refuse to use the old anti-baby thingy. Why do I rant on in this post, you ask? Because I wouldn't dare start another post which you wouldn't read.<br>
Anyhow, Tony Blair is supposidly going to allow the election sometime next week. The IRA released a statement through a Dublin newspaper, An Phoblacht (spelt right?), translated as Republican News. It basically said sorry for all the non-combatents (innocent citizens) it had killed 30 years before, when they planted 20 bombs throughout Belfast in restuarants, pubs, and popular places. It said sorry for the hurt it had caused to the people of Northern Ireland during that day, and acknowledged all the hurt, pain and suffering caused by all sides during that day. Unlike Channel 5 News thought, and that stupid Daily Mail reporter, the IRA was not talking about Canary Wharp, or the bomb in Thatchers hotel, as the IRA released it to meet the anniversary the Bloody Friday bombs in Belfast, and I very much doubt they meant any of the bombs in England or anywhere else recently.<br>
Tony Blair is meant to expel Sinn-Fein from the N I Assembly after the police, well, lets get this right, the big fat donut-munching never-done-any-work-in-my-life policeman said (I am not judging the police, I am judging one specific policeman whom I hate), claimed the IRA planned to start a riot on the 12th in Belfast. Well, why not, its when the other side planned to as well, but at the last minute the leaders stopped them. I very much doubt the IRA has been involved in any stuff, they might have been keeping intelligence, but thats as far as it would go. If there is ever any violence it will be a seperate group that has split from the IRA. God, this has kinda went off the strike topic, hasn't it! The IRA has apparently killed over 2000 people. They introduced the knee-cappings (bullet through the knee of a protestant who apparently had links with a secretarian group) and then the UVF/UDA etc. introduced the punishment attacks - young catholic beat up in alleyway as he walks home from pub, or in some cases, any random boy who is catholic.<br>
<br>
Without strikes, the government would just let the workers go without any money. The fact is, many of them complained they could no longer afford to live. They couldn't buy food if they paid for their accomodation. Don't mind me, but I am sure some of you would strike if this happened to you. We should respect any support the strikers, they just want to be equal. While at the same time 2000 jobs are lost in mining, thats sad as the miners say there is still plenty of coal down there, but it costs too much to run these huge machines, than the coal sells for. As one person put it, by 2020 (I think thats the year) the UK will run on 70% gas, and 90% of that gas will come from abroad, how can the oil and coal workers in the UK survive? These jobs are going to go even if there is more coal/oil!<br>
<br>
As Silva said, strikes are little inconvenience. And yeh, I liked the way the french protested. They also blocked the ports at one time with their lorries, but I have a feeling that was because they didn't want the British getting something across. lol. The french normally do it in style. easyJet has also called new tax when you fly into, stansted or another london airport, 'Fat Cat Tax' as thats what it is. It's to fund the bosses more than the airport. Someone might have more details on that.<br>
<br>
I hope I don't bore you people too much. I just start typing and don't stop. I haven't even got to talk about the 6 people killed in the helicopter trip or more about iraq! or how bush is dead as the stock markets are crashing and the US financial system runs into $200 billion in debt. <br>
Oh, I must add. I heard Bush say his first proper sentence today!! It's like a baby saying his first words! He was talking about debt and said the US wouldn't go further into debt. unless there was war, terrorism or someother thing, ok, so, I fell asleep.<br>
