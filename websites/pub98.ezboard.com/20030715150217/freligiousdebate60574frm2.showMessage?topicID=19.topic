<br>
My MIL is independant Baptist. Her minister teaches that people of different races should not marry as its against the bible. She's mentioned the verses but I don't remember them. In my mind and point of view this is just another way to discriminate another race and to make hers a better one, in her point of view. She also uses those verses to not create any type of tie to people who are not saved in her opinion.<br>
<br>
I've asked a few christian friends, and they have said that the second is closer to the actual meaning. But I'm wondering just how wide spread the first teaching is among different congregations. <br>
<br>
This debate between MIL and I was the straw the broke the camels back so to speak. After that point I stopped even trying to figure out a way to reconcile my beliefs with the christian faith (though she dealt a huge blow previously with the whole Catholics are damned belief and thus I'm going to hell for having been baptisted a baby and later confirmed but that's another debate in and of itself). I'm not complaining, I'm actually happier and more at peace with myself and the world then I was before. But I'm just curious as to how wide spread this belief is. Hmm think I've stated that before <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I better end this before I really start rambling. <br>

Yolked??</span><hr size=1> Hi Kim,<br>
<br>
To put it bluntly, your MIL's pastor is way off base.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   There is nowhere in the Bible that prohibits different races from marrying.  I think the &quot;yoked&quot; verse you're referring to is in 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 14 which says, &quot;Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Apostle Paul was clearly talking about marrying people of other faiths...not of other races.  I've heard people use the part in the Old Testament where God tells the Israelites not to marry people from the other tribes to coincide with their racist views as well.  BUT God was not telling them not to intermarry b/c they were of a different race, but b/c the other tribes practiced idolatry and paganism.  Again, another belief system.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Tina <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#3333ff>(12/30/02 5:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Non-LDS xianity has no racist history</span><hr size=1> I know most of the Christian Identity movements claim that only whites are descended from the 12 tribes and worthy to spread the word of god, but I haven’t seen any verses to back that up from the OT or NT. In fact, everything I can find is to the contrary and I don’t see anything against race mixing in the majority of xian sects. There is this one page <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://expage.com/page/fourthcase,">expage.com/page/fourthcase,</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> but I’m not convinced it’s racism, just your typical biblical violence, pettiness, advocacy for slavery and bloodshed and other gross things like gathering the foreskins of your enemy…ewwww.<br>
Didn't Moses marry an Ethiopian woman? Hard for this heathen to remember<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The Mormons (who I consider to be a sect of xianity) on the other hand, have indeed claimed non-whites to be unworthy of the priesthood and Native Americans were marked and made darker by their god as a punishment for some transgression. All of this is claimed to not affect their current theology as one of the prophets received a revelation that the darker skinned humans are now okay and worthy. I have not yet found a Mormon to justify why their god would be a racist, but they feel he has his reasons and trust he knew what he was doing when he forbid negroes to hold the priesthood until the late 20th Century.<br>
From the Mormon book -“Three Degrees of Glory”<br>
Pg 22 - Now, my brothers and sisters, I would like you to understand that long before we were born into this earth we were tested and tried in our pre-existence and the fact that of the thousands of children born today, a certain proportion of them went to the Hotten-tots of the south sees, thousands went tot the Chinese mothers, thousands to Negro mothers, thousands to beautiful white Latter day Saint mothers.  Why this difference?  You cannot tell me that the entire group was just designated, marked, to go where they did.<br>
 Why is it in the Church we do not grant the priesthood to the negroes?  It is alleged that the Prophet Joseph said - and I have no reason to dispute it - that it is because of some act committed by them before they came into this life.  It is alleged that they were neutral, standing neither for Christ nor the devil.  But, I am convinced it is because of some things they did before they came into this life that they have been denied the privilege.  The races of today are very largely reaping the consequence of a previous life.<br>
Pg 23 -  Our particular branch is the House of Joseph through his son Ephraim.  That is the group from whence shall come the majority of the candidates for Celestial Glory.  That is why we are doing the work for our ancestors and not for theirs (baptism for the dead).  Let us not imagine that in this dispensation we shall do the work for the dead Chinese or Hindus.”<br>
<br>
There are some who argue that evolution leads to racism, but that’s crap too and it cannot be defended with sound argument. While I am convinced most Mormons today (at least that I personally know) are not racist, their history and scripture is steeped in it and they don’t really try to deny it too much, except to say their god had his reasons and it wasn’t really a guideline to be mean to or physically harm these dark skinned peoples, just not to be missionaries to them or allow them the priesthood—but then that was all Jehovah, not any LDS in particular.<br>

I believe that sometime in the 1970's or 80's LDS started ordaining non-caucasions. <br>
<br>
The yoking is usually interpreted as refering to religion, not race.<br>

I just really found the whole thing to be well, hypocritical. My FIL is 1/2 native American. Yet MIL and FIL both feel interracial marriages are wrong. She justifies hers because they didn't know FIL was 1/2 native American (his mother was adopted as a very small child, and they didn't know...found out many years later she was sold for food by her native american parents...very sad and depressing story), and because her children look white, she feels that G-d has accepted her mistake. <br>
<br>
And so I asked her, if I had married someone 1/4 African American and he looked African American would it be wrong. She is like &quot;yes&quot; and I'm like, &quot;what's the difference aside from how your son looks and that senerio&quot;. Ugh, really upset me. But I didn't know enough to even attempt to show where she was wrong. Or even if I should bother. I just don't want her pressing those beliefs onto my children. I want them to be open and tolerant, and if they find a love in another race, I don't want them to feel its wrong or whatever to marry them. <br>
<br>
I don't know if I feel better knowing that the ILs preacher isn't alone in preaching this, or if I should feel disgusted over it. Is it a southern thing perhaps? <br>
<br>
Anyway, thankyou for answering my question. <br>

<br>
As far as what was said about LDS beliefs, I’m one of those LDS people who is uncomfortable with trying to explain our Church history on the matter of race and the priesthood because I have to admit that on it’s face it looks pretty bad and even as a member it IS difficult to understand, let alone explain to others because we don’t believe God has fully explained the reasons.<br>
<br>
That said,  I’m going to trudge ahead anyway and comment on some of what was said in one of the posts to this thread in case anyone is interested (warning, this gets long) because I think a better perspective can be put on it.<br>
<br>
For starters, here are a few other quotes from the same time period as the one from Melvin J. Ballard’s sermon “The Three Degrees of Glory” that was already posted here.  I think it will give a better overall picture of historical attitudes of LDS  on this matter.  Also, to put Ballard’s quote into context, this sermon was not at all about “races”.  Those remarks that were posted here were made in passing in the context of a sermon that was about doing proxy work for people who already passed on so that they will have a full chance to accept gospel ordinances.  In other words, the essence of his sermon is that that gospel is inclusive of every single soul, that no one gets left out, even if they leave this life without having heard it or had a fair chance to accept it.  He was talking about how people would be doing this proxy work for their own ancestors.  Given the enormity of that work and the limited resources of their times of course he could not imagine that anyone would be doing work beyond their own lineage any time soon.  I’ll put the quotes in a different font to help distinguish them from my own comments.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Providence is over all, and that he holds the nations in the hollow of his hand; that he is using not only his covenant people, but other peoples as well, to consummate a work, stupendous, magnificent, and altogether too arduous for this little handful of Saints to accomplish by and of themselves. <br>
 (elder Orson F. Whitney, Conference Report, April 1921, Afternoon Session 32 - 33.)<br>
<br>
Shortly after that he added this comment (remember this was being said in 1921 so it isn’t exactly “politically correct” wording but I think the idea he is conveying is clear, and quit a contrast to how some other Christian sects viewed other cultures/races/belief systems).<br>
<br>
“All down the ages men bearing the authority of the Holy Priesthood—patriarchs, prophets, apostles and others, have officiated in the name of the Lord, doing the things that he required of them; and outside the pale of their activities other good and great men, not bearing the Priesthood, but possessing profundity of thought, great wisdom, and a desire to uplift their fellows, have been sent by the Almighty into many nations, to give them, not the fulness of the Gospel, but that portion of truth that they were able to receive and wisely use. Such men as Confucius, the Chinese philosopher; Zoroaster, the Persian sage; Gautama or Buddha, of the Hindus; Socrates and Plato, of the Greeks; these all had some of the light that is universally diffused, and concerning which we have this day heard. They were servants of the Lord in a lesser sense, and were sent to those pagan or heathen nations to give them the measure of truth that a wise Providence had allotted to them.”<br>
 (1790elder Orson F. Whitney, Conference Report, April 1921, Afternoon Session 33.)<br>
<br>
A few scriptures on the matter:<br>
<br>
&quot;[Jesus Christ] inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that<br>
     come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and<br>
     all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile&quot; (The Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 26:33). <br>
<br>
     &quot;Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous is favored of God.&quot; (The Book of<br>
     Mormon, 1 Nephi 17:35)<br>
<br>
     &quot;Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in;<br>
     yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my<br>
     great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.&quot; (The Book of Mormon;<br>
     Alma 26:37)<br>
<br>
The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated in 1987: <br>
<br>
     &quot;We repudiate efforts to deny to any person his or her inalienable dignity and rights on the abhorrent and<br>
     tragic theory of the superiority of one race or color over another.&quot; (Church Global Media Guide)<br>
<br>
President Spencer W. Kimball taught:<br>
<br>
     &quot;We do wish that there would be no racial prejudice…. Racial prejudice is of the devil…. There is no<br>
     place for it in the gospel of Jesus Christ. (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pp. 236). <br>
<br>
President Hugh B. Brown called for:<br>
<br>
     &quot;full civil equality for all of God's children,&quot; saying &quot;it is a moral evil…to deny any human being the right to<br>
     gainful employment, to full educational opportunity, and to every privilege of citizenship, just as it is a<br>
     moral evil to deny him the right to worship&quot; (IE 66 [Dec. 1963]:1058.)<br>
<br>
Elder M. Russell Ballard taught:<br>
<br>
     &quot;All of us, regardless of race, color, or creed, belong to the family of our Heavenly Father.&quot; (See &quot;How Is<br>
     It with Us?&quot; for Elder Ballard's full comments&quot;)<br>
<br>
Joseph Smith said “to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to provide for the widow, to dry up the tear of the orphan, to comfort the afflicted, whether in this church, or in any other, or in no church at all, wherever he finds them” (Times and Seasons, 15 Mar. 1842, 732).<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Non-LDS xianity has no racist history<br>
<br>
Actually, all of Christianity has the same history of the priesthood only going to those of certain lineage at certain times.  It could be argued actually that “LDS Christianity” is the only one to not be racist because in this dispensation the priesthood has actually gone out to all worthy males.  I wouldn’t put it that way myself though because I don’t think it was “racist” to handle it that way, but I’m thinking of Aaron and Levi, there being a “chosen people,” etc.  Also, when Christ was living among us the gospel went first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles.<br>
<br>
It also help to understand that though blessing do come through the priesthood, holding it is not a “perk” or “reward”, it also has heavy responsibilities.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, in early LDS church history we were persecuted for not being racist!  LDS teachings were against slavery pre and during civil war era which was not popular with some folks.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;have indeed claimed non-whites to be unworthy of the priesthood&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Actually, to say they were claimed to be “unworthy” is inaccurate.  Sorry if this seems like splitting hairs, but when the priesthood was extended it was announced that it would now go “to all worthy males” meaning that there were many who were worthy all along, that that “worthiness” wasn’t the issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and Native Americans were marked and made darker by their god as a punishment for some transgression.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Again, not to split hairs, but they were given darker skins as a mark.  The mark itself was not a “punishment” but a way of separating them because they had become non believers, so again, it is the belief at issue.  Later in the Book of Mormon those groups with darker skins were actually more righteous than their brothers.  Essentially, through the generations, the societies came and went as far as being righteous or not, and the most wicked society of all as recorded in the Book of Mormon was actually a Nephite society which had light skin.<br>
<br>
Don’t ask me why a mark was given at the particular time it was and not again at other times, shrug, but it wasn’t always light skin people were considered to be “believers” and dark skin not, at times it was the other way around.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;All of this is claimed to not affect their current theology as one of the prophets received a revelation that the darker skinned humans are now okay and worthy. <br>
<br>
It isn’t that it doesn’t affect our current theology.  We believe in eternal principles that never change so our theology hasn’t changed, it’s just that the practical way in which those principles are being applied are different now.  The priesthood is still the same, it just isn’t held by all people at all times.  It was not held by all people in the Old Testament times either, only those of certain lineage.<br>
<br>
Also, again, it wasn’t that they were considered “not okay” or “not worthy” before.   It was not said “now they are worthy,” but instead that it  “can now be extended to all worthy” implying that the worthiness was already there.<br>
<br>
I know, probably seems like more hair splitting :-P, but I think it is a fundamental and important difference worth pointing out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;There are some who argue that evolution leads to racism, but that’s crap too and it cannot be defended with sound argument. <br>
<br>
I don’t get this actually.   If a person believes evolution is how we came about, then isn’t everything, including racism, a product of evolution?  Or are you saying that you yourself do not believe solely in evolution?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;While I am convinced most Mormons today (at least that I personally know) are not racist, <br>
<br>
I am glad to hear that J<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;their history and scripture is steeped in it <br>
<br>
Hopefully I’ve been able to change your perception of that a bit, though honestly I understand that to someone who has no motivation to delve very deeply into Church doctrine (which you may or may not be) that on it’s face it appear to be racism, can’t blame you there.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and they don’t really try to deny it too much, except to say their god had his reasons and it wasn’t really a guideline to be mean to or physically harm these dark skinned peoples, just not to be missionaries to them or allow them the priesthood<br>
<br>
Yep.  Except that there was never any restriction on baptism.  There were also never segregated congregations.  Back then LDS were being criticized by some because we weren’t racist.  In any case, I’m just glad I’m living now ;-)<br>

<br>
This is of course crap.<br>
<br>
The superiority of any given set of physiological differences has to be evaluated in the environment to which it is adapted or the one for which superiority is to be established in.  Consequently, in a hot, sun bathed climate with little escape from sun, a tall slender build with heavy pigmentation provides the least surface to harsh sun with maximal protection and is at a competative advantage.  This same set of traits will develop in different original populations, as evidenced by the genetic commonalities between abroginies and asians contrasted against african origin people.  Aboriginies have more in common with asiains geneticly and are presumed to have developed off a branch more closely related to them, yet they arrived at the same set of physiological adaptations that afrian people did in a similar environment and are furthest related across populations.  (Whites are apparently a genetically transient state between black africans and asians.)  <br>
<br>
There is further suggestion by racists that there is an inherent superiority of intellect in a given race, frequently citing heaps of test scores and such in an effort to back themselves up.  Unfortunately, this field of study has become taboo among scientists and lacks funding, so it cannot be readily refuted and since the majority of the few studies done tend to produce results in line with the expectations of those who funded them, there is little reliance on the ones we have (re: The Bell Curve - allegedly racist results funded by a racist organization.)  Intuitively though, we can examine this with an understanding of how evolution works.  In order for one race to superiorly develop intellect, while another developed inferiorly, there would have to have been a competative advantage to being dumb.  There is no situation in which being dumb is preferable to that of being intelligent so there can be no natural force promoting ignorance.  IE, it is still crap.<br>
<br>
Any acomplishment advantage presented by one population is governed by the resources provided.  For example Europe discoved America and not the other way around because there were no draft animals in the Americas for which they could leverage wheel based technology into industry.  No horse = no cart = less productive industry (the llama is no match for the horse.)  Another example is the Yellow River Valley region in asia where mathematics was first developed.  They were in a harsh climate and lived or died by the availability of water in the region.  Mathematics was developed in response to the needs of water supplies and thus, they developed math before anyone else.  Not that asians were smarter, or aztecs dumber.  Resources dictated what was possible and results followed from their environments.<br>
<br>
In reason.<br>

It could be argued actually that “LDS Christianity” is the only one to not be racist because in this dispensation the priesthood has actually gone out to all worthy males.”<br>
This is an excellent point and it is true that xianity throughout the ages has condoned and/or promoted slavery and definitely hatred toward certain races and nations at certain times (whom Jehovah promptly helped his chosen people slaughter, rape and pillage---see the quotes I included in the earlier post), but I suppose I was thinking of public church policy. You are right though—I cannot think of any African priests from say, the Middle Ages, but there are saints and priests of all races and ethnicities and I still say LDS is the only religion that outright prohibited it to blacks. I could agree with your point about racism in the religion in general though. You got me--it's all xians,<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

”It also help to understand that though blessing do come through the priesthood, holding it is not a “perk” or “reward”, it also has heavy responsibilities.”<br>
Oh brother! Yeah and so is winning the lottery or being a CEO or the president….goodness sakes is this supposed to be some sort of conciliation to women and previously excluded minorities…”Sorry Kuwomba you are not worth of the priesthood, which you wouldn’t want anyway..all that responsibility---uffda, downright exhausting!!” I know you didn’t mean it that way, but this is just as patronizing as every “weaker vessel” and “submission” argument. <br>
<br>
”Interestingly, in early LDS church history we were persecuted for not being racist! LDS teachings were against slavery pre and during civil war era which was not popular with some folks.”<br>
This may be, but not if you are equating abolitionists with non-racists. True, many advocated equality, but many who were against slavery (which the bible advocates BTW) were indeed racist—they just didn’t think the inferior or unworthy races should be enslaved. <br>
<br>
”Actually, to say they were claimed to be “unworthy” is inaccurate. Sorry if this seems like splitting hairs, but when the priesthood was extended it was announced that it would now go “to all worthy males” meaning that there were many who were worthy all along, that that “worthiness” wasn’t the issue.”<br>
So, your god admitted that these black men had always been “worthy” but he prohibited them from the priesthood anyway? Uh, okay…but still racist and frankly more petty than I had thought the Heavenly Father already was, but I’ll take your word for it.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I said, “…and Native Americans were marked and made darker by their god as a punishment for some transgression.” And you countered that this is untrue because “Again, not to split hairs, but they were given darker skins as a mark. The mark itself was not a “punishment” but a way of separating them because they had become non believers, so again, it is the belief at issue.”<br>
So they were turned darker as a way of separating and marking them permanently (and all their offspring regardless of religious belief BTW—oopsy again Heavenly Father) because they were non believers but you consider this not to be a punishment? Yes, you are splitting hairs here…no wait…you’re splitting hair molecules!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And yet your god chose to exclude not the light but the dark skinned males from the priesthood…curious behavior. Has he said why? I bet not, that's because there's no good reason any intelligent being would have for this differential and racist behavior. After reading this part of your post I'm more convinced than ever the HF is a nasty, spiteful racist who punishes and marks children for the sins or non belief of their forefathers...what a jerk!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This is justifying changes in belief and to be fair, all the xian sects—heck even Judaism does it. I hear all the time the OT doesn’t apply where shellfish and wool is concerned but homosexuality is still rebuked and the 10 Commandments kept. It’s pick and choose and change to fit the times where all are concerned Mormon, Catholic, Baptist, JW…that is certainly true.<br>

”Also, again, it wasn’t that they were considered “not okay” or “not worthy” before. It was not said “now they are worthy,” but instead that it “can now be extended to all worthy” implying that the worthiness was already there.”<br>
Again, this is clearly a justification for a racist policy. Imagine a US president claiming black slaves were never held to be less than white or unworthy of freedom or land ownership, just that after the Emancipation Proclamation freedom would be extended to all who were worthy!!!

I appreciate the effort as it must truly be embarrassing to have this mark on your history and try to explain it away to folks. My MIL is sort of  the same way about her JW background and all their end of the world predictions…there’s always an excuse but they mostly serve to make her feel better rather than convince anyone. This is all key to the denial necessary to maintain faith in a clearly flawed, racist, mysoginistic, outdated system. <br>
<br>
”I don’t get this actually. If a person believes evolution is how we came about, then isn’t everything, including racism, a product of evolution? Or are you saying that you yourself do not believe solely in evolution?”<br>
No you didn’t get what I was saying. I'm not saying every concept or theory is based on evolution since Home sapiens are part of the physical process of evolution, I'm saying some people have tried to use evolution as a springboard for racism even though it's always flawed.<br>
<br>
”Yep. Except that there was never any restriction on baptism.”<br>
It is very xian to allow minorities and foreigners to be baptized but not hold positions of power or influence, so this actually goes to your point about the long history of exclusion and racism in the xian religion in general, which I am ready to concede. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Seriously though, it IS hard to understand.  I'm going to cut and paste this reply I made in another thread here because I think it explains better why some of us still believe in the face of what obviously looks bad.  I guess it's just all in how we are looking at it and why things are the way they are.<br>
<br>
By the way, don't take anything I said above as my end all be all explanation for why I think there are different types of skin color, I was more trying to explain that I don't think nor do I believe LDS teachings are that one race should consider themselves above another.<br>
<br>
OK, here was my addition in another thread to what the conversation about &quot;the plan&quot; might have been like (said in humor of course):<br>
<br>
Well everyone, it's time to move onto the mortality phase of your progression. As you know, this means that not only will you get to experience growth and greater joy but will also be vulnerable to tempation and suffering, but I'll be patient with you and provide a way for you to correct your mistakes. It's going to be a rough ride but in the end it will be worth it.<br>
<br>
Because you will be behaving like idiots for a good portion of the time and using Me as and excuse for it (OK, &quot;idiots&quot; is my choice of words there, He is much more patient and kind than that) things like prejudice and discrimination are going to make it more difficult to pull this plan off but we'll chip away at it as best we can until everything that is needed is fulfilled.<br>
<br>
In other words, I think God would love nothing more than if everyone would choose to do what is right, but he will not take away our agency. Therefore, He just has to work with us the best He can. I don't think it is that he is withholding things from us, I think he tries to give us (meaning humankind as a whole) as much as we can handle, and sometimes that's just a little bit at a time, which explains things like &quot;first tot he Jew, then the gentile&quot; and how the priesthood didn't go to every lineage at once, etc. People as a whole were not ready for it.   I'm not saying the people of the church weren't ready to accept so much as I think that for society in general, including people in and out of the church, it would have been the final straw.   I mean, the LDS church members just about got exterminated as it was, kwim?<br>
<br>
This would be consistent with how I believe other things have been done. For instance, early in the LDS church they tried to live something called the &quot;law of consecration&quot; where everything was held in common. It had to be done voluntarily. It also would only work if the people were truly unselfish.  You know what? They couldn't do it. So, God said OK, we won't ask you to go that far yet and provided a &quot;lesser law&quot; to help them grow by in the meantime.<br>
<br>
Just more rambling from me. And can someone tell me why my house is such a mess? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/3/03 6:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   LDS apologetics</span><hr size=1> This really IS an interesting experience with LDS apologetics, but it still smacks of a cover up--sorry.<br>

Perhaps, perhaps not. Blacks and other minorities could have been made priests in their own homes and temples as was done by Catholics in many cases and had already been done by the time your missionaries started travelling the globe. Also this strikes me as an argument in conflict with your own doctrine. If good Mormons pray on revelation and follow god's edicts then why would his own people have &quot;not been ready....in and out of the church&quot;. Maybe the non-LDS, but heck you were got way more slack for polygamy and there were many, many black ministers and reverends around at this same time and those other faiths were able to weather it.<br>
<br>
&quot;For instance, early in the LDS church they tried to live something called the &quot;law of consecration&quot; where everything was held in common.&quot;<br>
This actually pre-dates LDS. Early xian sects were totally communal and socialistic though I am sorry to say I can't speak to their fates right now....DBC you got this on the top of your brain??? <br>
<br>
Also--why would god speak so clearly against tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and for plural marriage and things like blood atonement then step back on the priesthood (held in a man's own home)? No, your explanations are good attempts, but not logical and they often paint for me a worse picture of HF than I previously held...but I can see again where holding onto these justifications is key to holding onto your faith.<br>
