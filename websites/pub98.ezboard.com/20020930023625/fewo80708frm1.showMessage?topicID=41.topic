The fans give a standing obation as The Rock walks out to the front of the ramp. The Rock walks down the people's ramp and climbs the steel steps. The Rock grabs a mic from Lilian Garcia as he cuts it short and then begins to speak as it looks like he's in a hurry.<br><br><I><font color=blue>Finally, The Rock has come back to Atlanta. The Rock hasn't been to Atlanta for a while. He hasn't seen the dirty bird. He hasn't seen the braves. And he hasn't seen the mighty Hawks. The Rock has missed all those things but most of all The Rock has missed the fans. But more important than that The Rock has a match tonight against two other tag teams. The Rock will be going two on two on two against Primetime and somebody and RVD and somebody. Now The Rock does not give a rats ass who their partners are but The Rock has found a partner of his own. The Rock has found a partner none other than the Olympic Hero Kurt Angle. Now The Rock knows that Kurt Angle is not the most likable person in the world but The Rock doesn't care. The Rock is goin in for a one man show and The Rock is comin out victourious. The Rock is goin in for two other reasons as well. One to kick the living crap out of RVD. And two, to beat -the living hell out of the stubborn jackass Primetime Elix Skipper. The Rock doesn't care if he scored two touchdowns in one quarter but The Rock wants to know can he dance at the big dance and can he go one on one with the most electryfying man in sports entertainment today. The Rock is wondering if he could stand getting his ass kicked by The Great One in front of the millions and millions of The Rock's fans when they're chanting his name. Can he go one on one when it's all comes down to the final minute and The Rock puts the People's Elbow on you. Well, Sunday The Rock is gonna find out but right now The Rock doesn't care. On Monday night, tonight in Atlanta Georgia. The Rock is going to be in the event to watch. In the event where The Rock is going to come out on top. So The Rock has three words for all of you and even Kurt Angle. The Rock says Just Bring IT! If ya smelllalalallaalau what The Rock is cookin.</I><br><br><font color=red>The Rock drops the mic and then walks out of the ring. He walks up the ramp and then back to the locker room as the camera fades and eWo goes to commercial.<br><br><font color=green>OOC: Sorry about it being so short and no pictures. I'm really tired right now. And also, does anyone know where I can get pictures of The Rock.</B> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> KurtAngle</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF0000>(8/25/02 9:59:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Finally Angle and Rock together</span><hr size=1> <Font color=red>Rock is pacing back and forth backstage as he is getting ready for his big tag match with Kurt Angle later on in the show, as he is confronted by none other than Kurt<br><br><Font color=black>Angle: Rock<br><br><Font color=red>Angle puts big smile on his face<br><br>Rock stares down angle<br><br><Font color=black>Angle: I'm looking so forward to our match tonight.  I mean this is great, this is so cool.  You must feel so priviledged having the opportunity to walk down that ramp tonight side by side with your Olympic hero, I mean it must just give you goosebumps.<br><br><Font color=red>Rock continues to stare at Angle<br><br><Font color=black>Angle: I mean I thought about it for awhile, why out of all the wrestlers in the EWO would you pick me to tag with.  And then I realized.  THAT'S IT everywhere I go, I win.  You need the absolute best wrestler to allow you to win in the match.<br><br><Font color=green>Crowd: boos<br><br><Font color=red>Angle puts on a big grin<br><br><Font color=black>Angle: I mean the people know that I'm the greatest, the people know what I bring to this business and I've got to say Rock that I am completely honoured that you would....<br><br><Font color=red>Rock cuts Angle off<br><br><Font color=blue>Rock: THE PEOPLE!  THE PEOPLE Kurt.<br><br><Font color=red>Rock puts a big smile on his face<br><br><Font color=blue>Rock: See Kurt Angle there are reasons that I chose you for the big match tonight.  You are without question one, and I said ONE of the best wrestlers that this company has to offer.  You unquestionably have talent and the Rock recognizes this.  But the Rock knows that while you are ONE of the best wreslers in the EWO, the Rock is THE best wreslers in the EWO, and that Kurt Angle is what the people know.<br><br><Font color=green>Crowd: screams and yells in excitement<br><br><Font color=blue>Rock: You see because the Rock is the peoples champion.....not .....Kurt Angle.  And that is why tonight in Atlanta, Georgia.  The Rock is going to make history and he doesn't care who RVD's partner is, he doesn't care who Primetimes partner is.  Because the Rock is going to wipe the floor with all four jack-asses tonight in Atlanta and the honest truth is that the people have come to see THEIR champion....NOT, Kurt Angle.  Cause that Kurt Angle is true, it's damn true.<br><br><Font color=red>Kurt Angle looks confused, but then puts a smile on his face<br><br><Font color=black>Angle: Oh man Rock that was a great speech I love everything you do, the dramatic pauses, the eyebrow thing, it's really entertaining man.  You really had me going.  It sounded for a minute like you didn't like me.  Like you just picked your partner out of a hat or something.  Oh no but you respect me, and it's that respect that you give me that makes me love you Rock.<br><br><Font color=red>Rock looks a little uncomfortable and then stares Angle down<br><br><Font color=black>Angle: Good luck tonight Rock.  Give me a high five bud!<br><br><Font color=red>Angle puts his hand up to high five the Rock<br><br><Font color=red>Rock looks at Angles hand and walks off<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=41.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.threadControl?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ewo80708frm1">eWo RP Board<option value="ewo80708frm2">eWo OOC Board<option value="ewo80708frm3">eWo Nitro<option value="ewo80708frm4">eWo 2 NighT</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bewo80708>eWo</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1>eWo RP Board</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
