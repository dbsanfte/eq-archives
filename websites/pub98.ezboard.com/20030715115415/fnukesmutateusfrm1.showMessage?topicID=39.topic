We don't know how or who did it, but the only thing the person did was IM Devan and ask her for cybersex.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Jared was able to get his account back and change his password, and so far, there hasn't been another break-in, to his system or anyone else's.<br>
<br>
Of course, there is the lingering question: Who did it?<br>
If it was one of you guys, I'm asking you to please just own up to it right now before it gets out of hand.  I'm sure we can all just forgive and forget this and move on, and all I ask is that you don't do it again.  I think everyone here will agree with me when we say it's best that you please don't do this; obviously, if Jared's at risk, so is everyone else, including this board.<br>
<br>
Well, I don't even know if the hacker is here or what, but I just hope it doesn't happen again.  The moral of the story? GET A FIREWALL!<br>

In fact, I believe he is a mod. The hacker is....JARED HIMSELF!!! <br>
<br>
Think about it and it all fits...<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;The person only imed Devan and asked her for cybersex. If it was truly a hacker than they had no way of noeing that Devan was a girl. And holding to the normal behavioral pattern of those who just like to hack an sn to fuck around...the person shouldve imed us all. Not one person in particular. That doesn't make any sense. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, it seems as though the conversation was normal up until the time that &quot;Jared&quot; asked for cybersex. If this is the case, then there's no reason to suggest that it wasnt Jared online. If it was a hacker he a) wouldve imed us all and b)wouldve messed with her more, rather than a normal convo with the sudden question of cybersex<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Finally, lets think of the motive of Jared to ask and then make up the story about the hacker. HE would ask, b/c he was horny or something. He would've made up the story when he realized he was in serious shit with Devan. IT makes sense...JAred is a smart guy...and he would do what we all would do. <br>
<br>
It makes sense...im not saying it happened...but im just playing devil's advocate.

Certainly a plausible theory. But, then again, it could've also been someone random who was able to guess his password. But if it was someone random, why would they IM just one person and, of all things, ask for cybersex? That doesn't seem to make any sense. <br>

I wonder how much shit Jared is in because of the hacker incident. I hope they didnt say anything to anyone on his Buddy List that would piss them off. Cause that would certainly suck.<br>

<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;The person only imed Devan and asked her for cybersex. If it was truly a hacker than they had no way of noeing that Devan was a girl. And holding to the normal behavioral pattern of those who just like to hack an sn to fuck around...the person shouldve imed us all. Not one person in particular. That doesn't make any sense. <br>
<br>
ok, 1. I don't know if he IMed others. It's possible he did, he was only on for a few minutes so that limits how much he could have done. 2. In AIM you can add buddy comments; I add names to some of the SNs, I had devan's name on hers and so if the hacker knew who devan was then he would just look for devan. But more plausible is that this was a targetted attack on me and devan.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, it seems as though the conversation was normal up until the time that &quot;Jared&quot; asked for cybersex. If this is the case, then there's no reason to suggest that it wasnt Jared online. If it was a hacker he a) wouldve imed us all and b)wouldve messed with her more, rather than a normal convo with the sudden question of cybersex<br>
<br>
I did not IM devan that night, I was tired, it wasn't thinking about it. The hacker IMs devan right away around 5 minutes before 11 (this is corroborated by her) and out of the blue asks for cybersex and says some other shit. I was not talking with her. Again, you go under the assumption this was a random attack; it was not. inresponse to your 1: it was a targetted attack, 2: again I said the hacker didn't start off with niceties, just jumped into it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Finally, lets think of the motive of Jared to ask and then make up the story about the hacker. HE would ask, b/c he was horny or something. He would've made up the story when he realized he was in serious shit with Devan. IT makes sense...JAred is a smart guy...and he would do what we all would do. <br>
<br>
But again I didn't talk to her that night and you can even ask her. So why would I ask out of the blue? I may be horny, every guy is at some point, face it, but am I stupid enough to do something as moronic and low as that?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Certainly a plausible theory. But, then again, it could've also been someone random who was able to guess his password. But if it was someone random, why would they IM just one person and, of all things, ask for cybersex? That doesn't seem to make any sense. <br>
<br>
guess my password? no one for the life of them would be able to get it except if they stole it off my comp or had a password cracker. Again I don't think it was random: it was targetted.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My point exactly...it DOESNT make sense. And how did the person know that Urican D2 was a chick...i mean its not easy to guess from the sn, and there's no way they could guess. So the &quot;hacker&quot; knew exactly who they were iming.<br>
<br>
my point EXACTLY as well. again I refer you back to the point the hacker must have recognized her SN and the fact I had a buddy comment on it. again supports targetted attack.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;No problem there b/c as far as we know the person didnt im anyone else. Thats yet another confusing thing. It has to have been Jared<br>
<br>
again supports targetted. BTW when I IMed thelastanzac under his control, I checked his profile and you know what: no profile. That means it was not being run on my comp. And if you check me at the same time when I am in control, I had my profile up. More proof for a hacker. <br>
<br>
You people are all full of shit. You didn't know all the details, like I didn't talk to her that night and the hacker just started in trying to cyber with her. And now I think it was targetted: some mean bastard parading as my friend goes and pulls shit like this. The person probably thought it was funny but i can assure it was not.<br>
<br>
I can't believe I get victimized and all I get is that I am lying and pointing fingers to save my own ass. I have more honor than that: I stand by what I do and what has happened and not just dissappear into thin air.<br>

RichNYC87: when every1 was int eh chat room that time he probably added the sns to his list<br>
TheLastANZAC: who keiten?<br>
RichNYC87: no tim<br>
TheLastANZAC: but he started it<br>
RichNYC87: then gave them to keitan<br>
TheLastANZAC: but keitansolja started the room and had to get the SNs from somewhere<br>
RichNYC87: hmm<br>
TheLastANZAC: give it up rich<br>
TheLastANZAC: I know you are keiten solja<br>
RichNYC87: i didnt give him any of the sns<br>
RichNYC87: why would i make another sn just for kicks?<br>
TheLastANZAC: give to whom, keitansolja?<br>
TheLastANZAC: another sn to hide your identity<br>
RichNYC87: i have 2 sns, thats it<br>
TheLastANZAC: well, I don't know, you could make a third<br>
TheLastANZAC: or even go on someone elses<br>
RichNYC87: and this is the only one ive been using with regard to every1 i know for the past 4 years<br>
RichNYC87: the other one is my gaming sn<br>
TheLastANZAC: but you could have purposely went on, with cloned AIM and invited everyone under the guise of keitansolja<br>
RichNYC87: why the hell would i do that?<br>
TheLastANZAC: I know you &quot;officially&quot; go on richnyc87<br>
TheLastANZAC: I don't know<br>
TheLastANZAC: that's what I need to find out<br>
TheLastANZAC: but<br>
RichNYC87: are you suggesting i am the hacker?<br>
TheLastANZAC: it is funny how he knew the SNs of people you know <br>
TheLastANZAC: no<br>
TheLastANZAC: you were involved with it maybe<br>
RichNYC87: how? i dont know your password<br>
TheLastANZAC: now I quite possibly think it was a well thought out plan with multiple people<br>
TheLastANZAC: yes, but someone hacks<br>
TheLastANZAC: another cracks<br>
TheLastANZAC: and one person helps add to the confusion<br>
TheLastANZAC: or whatever amount is needed<br>
RichNYC87: i was not on most of the time yesterday<br>
TheLastANZAC: under THIS sn<br>
TheLastANZAC: but you were on last night<br>
RichNYC87: no, period.<br>
TheLastANZAC: and conviently after the hacker was done<br>
RichNYC87: and what purpose would i have for doing such a thing?<br>
TheLastANZAC: and if I were say the hacker, that I made it up, think how confusing it is to deal with multiple windows with multiple SNs<br>
TheLastANZAC: I don't know<br>
TheLastANZAC: get back at me for dean<br>
TheLastANZAC: *devan<br>
RichNYC87: exactly, there is nothing i could gain<br>
TheLastANZAC: get back at her<br>
RichNYC87: for what?<br>
TheLastANZAC: but<br>
TheLastANZAC: it might not<br>
RichNYC87: im not out for anything<br>
TheLastANZAC: have been your motives<br>
RichNYC87: never have been, never will be <br>
TheLastANZAC: it could have easily been someone else who solicited your help<br>
RichNYC87: the hacker couldve been anyone<br>
TheLastANZAC: and your apathy doesn't satnd in the way<br>
TheLastANZAC: yes<br>
TheLastANZAC: true<br>
RichNYC87: i dont know shit about hacking an sn other than you need to know someones pw<br>
TheLastANZAC: this can all apply to everyone<br>
TheLastANZAC: but as I said, someone hacks, the other cracks<br>
RichNYC87: cause that happened to me once and i had to change my pw<br>
TheLastANZAC: also<br>
TheLastANZAC: one thing still can't apply to the others.<br>
TheLastANZAC: yes the hacking could be done by others true,<br>
TheLastANZAC: but<br>
TheLastANZAC: the keitansolja is too strong with you<br>
RichNYC87: i swear he's not me<br>
TheLastANZAC: as I said he knew BEFORE making the room all the necessary SNs<br>
TheLastANZAC: he invited Tim which could have been a slip of the hand<br>
TheLastANZAC: and tim's only connection to all of it is you<br>
RichNYC87: and even if it was me, that doesnt mean anything<br>
TheLastANZAC: that's the keitansolja connection<br>
TheLastANZAC: well, it could have served something<br>
TheLastANZAC: I don't know<br>
TheLastANZAC: I'm still putting the pieces together<br>
RichNYC87: that's a far-fetched accusation to make<br>
TheLastANZAC: but I am guessing this was well thought out<br>
TheLastANZAC: around 10, I'm usually away or not on<br>
TheLastANZAC: if I had not been here, the person could have had free reign with Devan<br>
TheLastANZAC: or anyone else they wanted to fuck around with<br>
TheLastANZAC: and <br>
TheLastANZAC: as I talked with Devan<br>
RichNYC87: did you get a chat log of what they said<br>
TheLastANZAC: the guy went straight to her<br>
TheLastANZAC: because she got the IM<br>
RichNYC87: is she at the top of your buddy list?<br>
TheLastANZAC: and then thelastanzac went on and offline<br>
TheLastANZAC: near<br>
TheLastANZAC: and her name is associated with her SN<br>
TheLastANZAC: but<br>
RichNYC87: maybe they immed her at random cause she was at or near the top?<br>
TheLastANZAC: her SN could be procured<br>
TheLastANZAC: no<br>
TheLastANZAC: her SN cold be found out easlily enough<br>
TheLastANZAC: even if he just looked &quot;Devan&quot; he could find it<br>
TheLastANZAC: but if I were not here, he would have done more<br>
TheLastANZAC: he went straight for devan<br>
TheLastANZAC: someone tipped him off<br>
TheLastANZAC: that I was online <br>
RichNYC87: its possible too that the person Immed other people on the list <br>
TheLastANZAC: and that the shock would wear off<br>
TheLastANZAC: yes<br>
TheLastANZAC: I need to find if they have<br>
TheLastANZAC: but so far, nothing els<br>
TheLastANZAC: e<br>
RichNYC87: but that maybe she was the only one who got the message<br>
TheLastANZAC: you see<br>
TheLastANZAC: he struck at her fast and quick<br>
TheLastANZAC: because he knew I didn't have time<br>
TheLastANZAC: here's what he said to me when I confronted him with letombeurdefemme:<br>
TheLastANZAC: LeTombeurdeFemme (10:56:42 PM): why are you on my sn?<br>
LeTombeurdeFemme (10:57:21 PM): WHY ARE YOU ON MY SN????????<br>
LeTombeurdeFemme (10:58:02 PM): this is jared<br>
LeTombeurdeFemme (10:58:07 PM): you have my sn<br>
LeTombeurdeFemme (10:58:11 PM): return it back to me<br>
TheLastANZAC (10:58:30 PM): alright<br>
LeTombeurdeFemme (10:58:36 PM): who is it?<br>
TheLastANZAC (10:58:36 PM): ive had my fun<br>
LeTombeurdeFemme (10:58:41 PM): hwo the hell?<br>
LeTombeurdeFemme (10:58:47 PM): how do you have my icon&gt;<br>
TheLastANZAC signed off at 10:58:54 PM<br>
TheLastANZAC: then I signed on right afterwards<br>
RichNYC87: hmm<br>
RichNYC87: odd<br>
TheLastANZAC: I think I might post this &quot;little&quot; IM on NMU<br>
TheLastANZAC: all of it<br>
RichNYC87: thats all they said?<br>
TheLastANZAC: yes<br>
TheLastANZAC: that is to me<br>
TheLastANZAC: he said to ted something about<br>
RichNYC87: thats weird<br>
TheLastANZAC: &quot;not changing Jared's password&quot;<br>
TheLastANZAC: yes<br>

whatever you say, you can't fake that, even cable people can't sign off and on within 1 second.  someone was booting him off by signing him in on his own comp<br>

and to post further evidence, i was one of the few that had a chat with anti-Jared, and here's what he has to say to everybody:<br>

<br>
1. Admins at DA ONLY have the ability to CHANGE User passwords. We cannot see them or copy them. What we see in the password field is a bunch of black dots (length varying depending on the length of your password). Those &quot;dots&quot; cannot be copied. As far as I know, having dealt with ezboard/phpbb software as well, those same rules apply to these NMU Forums. Now, the only conceivable way someone could get a DA Forums User's PW is by looking it up in the actual files which store a user's password and various other information. Someone with FTP access at Digital Alley could have conceivably opened the .dat file on Jared in the Members Folder (.dat files contain all information about a user, including their passwords, as I found out when I opened up mine). But in order to do that, they would have to know exactly where to look, because the Members directory is buried under three folders. (/cgi-bin/yabb/Members). You cannot access that folder from HTTP. It, along with the cgi-bin and yabb folders, are chmodded at owner only permissions. You will get a 403/Forbidden Error if you try to visit http://www.digitalalley.net/cgi-bin/yabb/Members with your web browser. In order for someone without FTP Access to get at that folder, it would require someone hacking into my server and finding that folder, which I almost certainly would have noticed, seeing as how I regularly review the access logs. That's an extremely unlikely scenario. <br>
<br>
The only people with legitimate FTP access to DA are myself and Emmet. You will have to trust me when I say that I have never opened any .dat files, and that I have never given out anyone's passwords to a 3rd Party. Honestly, I have no reason to. Why the hell would I do such a thing? That would be a total violation of peoples' trust. The only time I would open up someone's .dat file to get a password is if they themselves wanted it because they had forgotten it...in which case, just giving them a new password would be easier. I can vouch for Emmet as well. He would never do such a thing either. For one of us to do such a thing would be totally uncalled for and it'd be completely out of character for both of us to do such a thing, and you all know that. I will try and see if there is a way for me to encrypt passwords in those .dat files, just as a measure of precaution in the slim chance someone actually managed to gain access to my server illegally. <br>
<br>
If you don't believe me about Forum Admins not being able to see/copy passwords, I will be more than happy to temporarily make any DA Forum user an admin so they can see it for themselves. But, I assure you, and swear to God, that as long as it's just me and Emmet with FTP Access, that nobody will be snooping at your passwords on DA, and that nobody has snooped at them in the past. So throw that whole &quot;Forums PW&quot; theory out the window. (And for the record, the ONLY .dat file I looked at was my own....Java.dat) Emmet and I would never ever do such a thing, and the odds are damn near impossible that someone gained access to our server just to look up one person's .dat file.  <br>
<br>
2. Someone found out Jared's password at one time or another and happened to try it out on his AIM Account. Jared admitted that he uses the same pasword for virtually all things, so it is probable that someone could have gotten ahold of his password to a web-based email account or maybe even his Forums password at other forums that he visits. I do not think it was a coordinated, group of people who logged into Jared's account. I think it was a lone individual who had his password for quite some time and IMmed people. Why is this scenario probable? Because, if you review all the possible things you use passwords for on the Internet, it is very possible that at some point he gave his password to someone either knowingly or unknowingly, and that someone took a chance with his AIM account. Cookies get logged all the time by various websites. It's possible someone one looked in one of the cookies a website which required a login and password, if they had access to his computer. There's at least a dozen ways I can think of that his password could've been obtained. <br>
<br>
3. Someone hacked his SN. I know that there are programs out there that can do this. It could be possible that it was a random person, or even someone he knew, who downloaded said program(s) and used them to hack his SN. <br>
<br>
There are my theories. I will add more as I think of them.<br>
<br>
Once again, let me just reiterate that I had nothing to do with this. I'M INNOCENT. I just want to get that out there before people start accusing me of doing something I didn't do. I have no reason to do such a thing; it would be completely out of my character to do something like that.<br>
<br>
I will be happy to provide you all with chat logs, access logs, server logs, and anything else you want from me to back up my alibi. <p>~Rich</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bnukesmutateus.showUserPublicProfile?gid=footitch>Footitch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>King of Naked</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#333333>(2/22/03 12:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> To Ted</span><hr size=1> Ted, you're wrong.<br>

I was signing off and on at 1 and 2 second intervals.  Jared has a much faster connection than mine.  He can easily get 1 second consistantly.<br>
<br>
That, and the other part of this thing is that he is the only suspect that has motive.  Occam's razor, anyone? (you knew that was coming)<br>
<br>
Actually, I really don't think Jared did this, because he's my friend and I believe him, but also, this is completely out of character for him.<br>
<br>
Then again, who did this?  I haven't read rich's last post yet... hold on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bnukesmutateus.showUserPublicProfile?gid=downpoison75>DownPoison75</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ass God</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#333333>(2/22/03 12:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> No  need rich</span><hr size=1> Rich...there's no need at all to do that.

Look Rich, I don't have any true belief it is you and I don't think 100% that anyone here did it. But I still don't have 100% proof that no one is involved, so I have to take everythin with a grain of salt.<br>

If you did do this, come forward and I'll let by-gones be by-gones. It'll stop here and I'll forget about this happening. If you don't come forward and I find out myself, it won't be as nice to rap up as what I just said before. <p>---------------<br>
You know the rain man's comin' ta town<br>
Change the weather, change your luck<br>
And then he'll teach ya how ta...find yourself<br>

Secondly, how do you plan on finding out. There doesnt seem to be a way to do so, and if you do find out, how will you react? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :blood --><img src=http://members.home.nl/dstructor/smilies/schuss.gif ALT=":blood"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://members.home.nl/dstructor/smilies/redface2.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Yankees rule and Texans drool!</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=39.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=39.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=39.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=39.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.threadControl?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="nukesmutateusfrm1">Barnyard Fun<option value="nukesmutateusfrm2">The Electronics Dept.<option value="nukesmutateusfrm4">The Agora v2<option value="nukesmutateusfrm5">The Admin Loveshack</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bnukesmutateus>Nukes Mutate Us!</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnukesmutateusfrm1>Barnyard Fun</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
