<br>
It was still quantifiable and disprovable before it was actually disproven just like the geocentric views of the early xian church. Just because someone hasn't proven a theory true or false yet does not mean it cannot be one way or the other.<br>
This is a key to separating atheists and many theists. You believe you have the whole and final truth--we do not. Perhaps someday we will, perhaps we will not, but it is still worth pursuing and I would leave behind any theory (yes even evolution) if it were proven to be false. Perhaps someday aliens will land and prove they genetically engineered us. I don't think it's likely and there's no current proof of it, but I would be open to the possibility of it happening and do not dismiss it out of hand because of a book, mythological deity or &quot;feeling&quot; &lt;&lt;spooky, surreal music here&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Why do you struggle so with the word theory dag? Surely you encountered this in high school? Let's refer to Merrian-Webster though just to put this to rest.<br>
<br>
Main Entry: the·o·ry <br>
Pronunciation: 'thE-&amp;-rE, 'thi(-&amp;)r-E<br>
Function: noun<br>
Inflected Form(s): plural -ries<br>
Etymology: Late Latin theoria, from Greek theOria, from theOrein<br>
Date: 1592<br>
1 : the analysis of a set of facts in their relation to one another<br>
2 : abstract thought : SPECULATION<br>
3 : the general or abstract principles of a body of fact, a science, or an art &lt;music theory&gt;<br>
4 a : a belief, policy, or procedure proposed or followed as the basis of action &lt;her method is based on the theory that all children want to learn&gt; b : an ideal or hypothetical set of facts, principles, or circumstances -- often used in the phrase in theory &lt;in theory, we have always advocated freedom for all&gt;<br>
5 : a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena &lt;wave theory of light&gt;<br>
6 a : a hypothesis assumed for the sake of argument or investigation b : an unproved assumption : CONJECTURE c : a body of theorems presenting a concise systematic view of a subject &lt;theory of equations&gt;<br>
<br>
Of course, any theory proven once and for all ceases to be theory and is now pretty indisputable like spontaneous generation and geocentricity being false. There are plenty of scientific theories theists are just fine living with and basing many actions and careers off of. It's where god and the origins of life come in that this becomes so unacceptable and that's okay, like I said if you want to reject reason and live instead a faith based life....just don't try to operate on my kids or sit on my jury.<br>

<br>
&quot;i still haven't heard why this statement doesn't constitute a theory:&quot;there is no god&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
We started with discussing whether being an atheist required faith then you asked about theories. You are asking if asserting there is no god is a theory because you are confusing admission that something may be a theory with faith (an unsubstantiated claim based on no evidence or fact, rather &quot;feeling&quot; as you defined it earlier). This was never argued nor is it the case. You may believe in the theory of evolution without having faith or believing anything that is not backed up by evidence (from the fossil record etc.). <br>
<br>
&quot;is this statement not speculation? why or why not?&quot;<br>
Again, it can be both. A statement can be a speculation as well, though I dare say most atheists would not describe not believing in god as &quot;speculation&quot;. <br>
<br>
dag---would you describe your lack of belief in Santa Claus or Isis to be &quot;speculation&quot;? Me neither, that's why I'm not asking you to prove they don't exist. Please address this in your next post.<br>
<br>
&quot;do you yourself make this claim?&quot;<br>
You know I do. Of course, like all my beliefs I would change it with new evidence or factual findings (as I have said repeatedly). Got any?<br>
<br>
&quot;as soon as you do i'm afraid it will be one of those statements that must start with &quot;i believe...&quot;&quot;<br>
If it makes you feel better I am happy to state that I, Stacy, do not believe in god and furthermore believe there are not gods or fairies or any supernatural beings. This does not mean I have faith...beliefs based on data are different from unsubstantiated claims (faith). <br>
<br>
&quot;if not then nothing is true until it is proven but we already figured out that's not the case with the whole spontaneous generation thing.&quot;<br>
Well certainly nothing is absolutely true without proof. We finally agree!!! I have proof maggots are baby flies and that these are laid on meat sitting out. Do you have physical proof of spontaneous generation? Then what we have is as knowable as it gets....now moving into epistomology...exciting.<br>
<br>
&quot;please don't get mad at me for keeping this going&quot;<br>
I'm not mad, it is clearly new territory for you and you are trying your best to keep the terms and argument straight and I appreciate that. I actually see progress here. I am a bit befuddled at theists wanting atheists to say we have faith when you are supposed to value that so highly and not think as we do based only on reason and proof...but if you need a clear argument why we don't, I think we've pretty much covered all the ground.<br>
<br>
Belief based on proof and evidence is deductive reasoning and does not equal faith.<br>
<br>
Belief based on feeling and without or contrary to evidence, reason or logic is faith. <br>
<br>
What you value is personal, but whether atheists have faith is an issue we have now settled. We do not. You may think that's too bad, you may feel sorry for us, you may think it's great...doesn't change it.<br>

<br>
that was the best explanation i've heard yet.  but i still fail to see how my unsubstantiated claim that god lives without proof differs from your claim the god does not live equally without proof.<br>
<br>
i guess we are down to they are both personal beliefs mine based on feeling and yours based on data...(please insert data here so that I may be enlightened)<br>
<br>
why is your belief based on data and mine is not?<br>
<br>
to answer your questions about faith in santa and the easter bunny i simply say it's not important to me to say they do or do not exist.  i consider that to be a factual statement.  i don't believe hubert exists because that doesn't feel right to me.  i will even put my foot down and say, &quot;hubert, the purple carp in your backyard, doesn't exist&quot; i offer no proof and accept this based solely on personal feelings.<br>
<br>
i see myself as a better me for my belief that god lives just as you may see yourself as a better you for believing that he doesn't.  yet the clear distinction why one belief is faith and the other is not still hasn't been made.<br>
<br>
one last thing i think i should clear up, i make many many decisions based solely on factual data.  in fact very very few choices do i make solely on faith.  your doctor example was a good one.  i see the clear advantages to using both and usually end up using a combination of feelings and data to make certain conclusions.  it isn't very often that my personal feelings completely win over the facts.<br>
<br>
with that being said i can give you the name of some harvard med students that are lds along with the name of at least one of the current 12 apostles that is a surgeon so you may steer clear of them in the future.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67@religiousdebate60574>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/5/03 4:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  A theory is...</span><hr size=1> Ok, chiming in here.  There is a linguistic disparity between relaxed and comfortable english usage and the scientific meanings of words.  Theory is used as pasted above in english conversations to mean conjecture and such.  This is not, however, the way it is used in science.<br>
<br>
In science it is used to mean a set of explanations or models that accurately predict the results of a given set of facts.  What DAG is presenting for creationism/intelligent design is called (in science) an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hypothesis</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  The first step in developing a theory is to formulate an hypothesis, for which to develop tests to validate or disprove.  Once you have this hypothesis, you make <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>observations</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and recocile your predicted results with your actual ones and refine the hypothesis until it becomes a working predictor of results.  (There are those who would argue that you make your observations first in order to develop the hypothesis, then again when testing it, but it really is irrelevant for this discussion.)  The refining process could even be as sweeping as tossing out the original hypothesis entirely and starting fresh from scratch.  Once you have a working model that explains or predicts accurately the results of your tests, you publish them for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>peer review</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  This is where the testing leaves your control and the whole world opens fire on your fledgling theory.  The tests you devise must be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>reproducable</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> by the larger scientific community.  They will come up with their own as well, but rest assured, it will get kicked around all over the globe.  If you were not dilligent or honest in your work, they will find it, and ridicule you.<br>
<br>
Now, if your theory manages to survive this scrutiny, and it is a valid predictor of results, it gets hung on the wall among the other theories and waits for the day that someone disproves it and knocks it off.  It will never become a law.  Everything in science is open to question (try subjecting your dogma to that!)  Theories that have been around a long time with substantial bodies of evidence behind them frequently get called laws, but this is not a scientific demarkation.  The cellular theory of organisms, the gravitational theory of attraction, the theory of quantum relativity, the heliocentric theory of our solarsystem, the techtonic plate theory of the earth.  All of which are open for replacement if you prove them wrong.  Now this is where science has it all over religion.  Science actively LOOKS for the flaws.  As a scientist you WANT to be the guy that replaces evolution with a better theory.  It garners you fame, notoriety, and glory.  No where do you see that in religion.  Science admits when it is wrong, practitioners seek the errors and raise a great noise when they find them.  It has a vested interest in seeking the truth and uncovering objective reality.  I have deep respect for that.<br>

thanks for reminding us of the much more clear definition of scientific theory.<br>
<br>
are you saying that 1000 years before we knew or even concieved that the earth was round it was flat?  of course that's absurd but if one guy had the power to sail around the world before anyone else even thought of the notion that the earth was limited and definable then what should he need to do to prove it to you?  take him with you on his next adventure?<br>
<br>
after i went to bed last night i was also thinking that faith implies action.  so if a person claims there is no god or there is no santa then it really isn't faith until they start doing something about it like actively seeking to free the yoke of religious oppression or christmas cheer in the case of santa.<br>
<br>
is this definition of faith more fair?  going strictly by the dictionary it is &quot;something&quot; that can't be proven.  if that's the case then only an idea or thought or statement needs to be proven to be something. imo <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dag@religiousdebate60574>dag</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/5/03 8:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: A theory is...</span><hr size=1> i just read my last post and i am starting to see why atheists see theists as arrogant.  not my true intentions but if a man claimed to know the earth was round far before the rest of the world could even concieve of the notion then would he not be considered arrogant and probably stoned or something at least exiled...<br>

Not so much arrogant as evil or crazy--we see this from history. Just ask Galileo about theories that go against the church. Nowadays you'd be okay, but you'd still have to get the financial backing to test your theory if you could get it to meet the above criteria.<br>
<br>
&quot;if i know something based solely on personal experience and it isn't possible to show it to you then am i to denounce what i know and experienced so that we may all discover the origins of the universe together?&quot;<br>
<br>
Not necessarily. You are to call it faith and not scientific theory and you are not to expect it to be seen as anything otherwise by anyone else. This is what we've been talking about for a few days now.<br>
<br>
&quot;this implies that i know more than you and one day you'll understand. total arrogance.&quot;<br>
<br>
And this is what xianity is all about. We know everything, our god is omniscient, omnipotent and will make us gods and your silly science is insufficient to know the &quot;celestial law&quot; as created by none other than our god and US...nanny, nanny boo boo. Yes, it is pretty arrogant, but this point has been made before and continues to be in Atheist/Theist debates.<br>
<br>
&quot;i can't denounce personal experience though only try to forget about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Noone is asking you to denounce personal experience. Visions and talking to spirits might be treated with some of the excellent psychotropic drugs available through a licensed psychiatrist, but having experiences in life that help us learn and grow are okay and noone has said otherwise.<br>

No.  That is exactly the opposite of what I am saying.  I am saying there is an objective reality and that no matter how many people you line up to say otherwise, if it was round, then it was always round.  Our understanding of the world is what has changed, not the world itself.  The car was purple, it was always purple and the witnesses are wrong when they say it is red (harking back to a previous thread.)<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>so it isn't possible to have visions or recieve personal revelation because you never have?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, extrordinary claims require extrordinary evidence.  You want to say a supernatural being with limitless power has decided to jump up on a hickory stump and tell you, just you, that he exists, but not leave you with a calling card or shiney golden disc to show someone else.  Roll out a friend to corroberaste your story, it will still take more.  Tell me you saw a squirrel steal a nut, I will likely believe you on just your word.  Tell me that squirrel did quantum math equations and I'll want to see his work.<br>
<br>
Which is more likely, that you saw god revealed to you, or had a bad bit of tuna for lunch or may have a loose wire somewhere?  Son of Sam spoke to god....<br>
<br>
Allow me to recommend a book call &quot;The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot; by Carl Sagan.  It goes into detail about why visions happen and what they are and mean.  After that, try &quot;Why we believe&quot; by Michale Shermer for an exploration of faith in our society.<br>

i think i get what you are saying now from your default position quote.  finally.  (correct me if i'm wrong)<br>
<br>
we both believe that there exists an absolute truth that cannot be changed no matter how many people believe one way or another. (according to DBC's post and i agree)<br>
<br>
earth always round, spontaneous generation doesn't occur, evolution does occur etc. etc.  and what people believe or think is irrelevant to what the truth really is.<br>
<br>
the part i'm not sure about, and is more for mamag since DBC doesn't claim to cross god out of the equation, is why you feel comfortable classifying as part of this absolute truth the belief &quot;there is no god&quot; simply based on the fact that it hasn't been proven yet.<br>

The belief that 'there is no god' is not a belief as you are using the term.  In order to believe that 'there is a god' then someone would have to introduce proof, at wich point, I convert and start to 'believe&quot;.  I do not postulate that 'there is no tooth fairy' then proceed to prove it.  You can't.  That goes back to the proving a negative thing. We necessarily have to believe based upon what we know.  Our knowledge is limited and imperfect and increasing all the time.  We cannot believe on what we don't know, that simply is not possible.  Even so, it is still different from believing what we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wish</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> were so, which is what religion does.  Again, I think you are confusing believing in something with faith.  I believe the sun will rise tomorrow, that is based on past experience, reasonable expectation and substantiative evidence.  I believe there is no god.  That is similarly based on reason, fact and supportive evidence.  May there be a god?  Possibly.  Is it the biblical one?  Absolutely not.  Sure this could all have been started by a divine entitity, but he hasn't come around since he destablized our initial singularity and started this mess.  There is no measurable difference between him not existing and not being involved.  Deism and atheism are compatible, theism is not.<br>

<br>
You think &quot;facts and feelings&quot; are both required for reason- wrong. That's why they are separate. Reason must be separate from feelings- and deal with the objective facts of a situation, not feelings.<br>
<br>
Once you see and clarify that difference- logical arguments are a lot easier. You can't get reason from a feeling- reason, as applied to logic and science, doesn't involve feelings. A scientist may feel an experiment will come out one way or the other, but that feeling has absolutely no bearing on the outcome.<br>
<br>
I agree wholeheartedly with D's suggestion to read Carl Sagan's &quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot;. It explains very clearly what you are struggling with- and the role that science plays, in reason, in understanding the world as it truly is, not as we may &quot;feel&quot; it might be.<br>
