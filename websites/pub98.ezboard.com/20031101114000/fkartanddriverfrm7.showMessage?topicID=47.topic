I was watching from the stands, but my goodness, I thought someone was going to get killed. As i wasnt on the track and cant see every kart 100% of the time, i did see a #21 kart start it all. I'm not sure who it was, I have seen him there before in medium and he has won some and he drives the same way every week. He is an absolute maniac. If i raced that class, i would refuse to run against him. Like that saying in the Days of Thunder movie, He hit everyone but the pace car. From the drop of the green flag, he was on the outside and immediatly turned left when someone was right beside him, he forced that guy off the trac just 2 seconds into the race. He proceeded to hit everyone in front of him and beside him. Looks like you all would get tired of that. I did see a few people take a stab back at him and one kart took him up to the top of the track 2 times thru the race as to teach him a lesson but he stopped short of taking him completely out, but he didnt learn, he came right back down and hit everyone else, alot of guys starting pushing him back. Then the #21 had the outragousness to get mad and ram a stopped kart that was waiting to get on the scales. Then he gets mad off the track at someone else and i guess his dad did to. They need to bar #21 from the trac completely before he hurts someone. He is not a good racer, even if he wins one every now and then. He dont know how to drive with finness. I wish that kart that took him up to the top of the track to teach him a lesson would have dumped him off the other side. I've been racing for 4 years and have never seen anything like that. I heard they barred him from the track, but i don't know if that was for the night, a few weeks or indefinitly. I vote for the latter. I don't know who that is nor do i want to because it might then become personnal. Just a view from a spectator and racer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> speedracer</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(7/6/03 9:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> quite a hefty letter</span><hr size=1> I dont know who that #21 kart was either, but he is exactly what you said.

There is nothing to back up that claim.  If you would open the two eyes God gave you, you would see that he is SECOND IN POINTS!!!!!!! Hello, I don't know but I would say that the guy at the bottom of the points is the worst driver at Richmond, not the guy 2nd in points.  He was not the one that instigated the Richmond Medium race, I was there.  It was that number 9 in the mediumm class.  All the stuff written in the first post by rubbins racin sounds an awful lot like that driver. Whine, Whine, Whine.  That is all go kart drivers seem to do.  I think some of the young drivers that race in the restricted classes are more mature.  Also, the moderator of the website and message board should stay neutral and not put comments on the site like she has done.  That is unprofessional.  Leave the #21 driver alone and start minding your own business and quit whining.  There is no room in racing for whining. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> AngryRacer</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(7/29/03 8:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bull</span><hr size=1> <br>

    If you would open your eyes you could see that the only reason he is second in points is because when hes on the track no one else gets a chance to finish a race.  Multiple times this year I have seen him take out many good karts.  For example this past Friday night.  The #29 kart and #4 kart were having a good clean battle and in came #21 which booted one of them and caused both of them to crash hard.  Thats a shame because the #4 kart was the fastest on the track and the only one on my stop watch that had anything for the leader IF he had a chance to get to him and that was cut short due to stupidity.  The track needs to pick up the black flag and use it.   I was just in the stands watching and seen all this so I know the track workers had to see it.  I just think its a shame that week after week they let him come in there and do this.  Something needs to be done before he hurts someone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkartanddriver.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kartndriver>kartndriver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF9300>(8/11/03 3:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: medium class</span><hr size=1> One of the post on this page was just a little out of bounds and was removed by me.
