<br>
Well...that's almost enough to say!  It has been SO lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ong since I've had good excuse to shamelessly gush over Tyr...<br>
<br>
And - I am thrilled to do so for a MattJoe episode!  Is this their swan  song?  If so (and also if not!), gentlemen - WELL DONE!<br>
<br>
I have always loved Neitzscheans.  I liked Rhade, and I loved Tyr.  I liked Cuchulan.  I loved Guderian.  I liked Freya.  I loved Charlemagne.  I liked (but didn't love) Elsbett.  Heck - I liked Erin (HATED Desiree).  But in all things - I loved Nietzscheans.  I loved all that they could be, all they were striving to be, even in their failed moments (which were many) I liked their essence.  And for this reason - I have always loved MattJoe's take on Tyr.  I've loved them for their take, because they seem to inherently respect, and like, the possibility of Nietzscheans.  <br>
<br>
It will take <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Cardie</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to explain just how different the writers takes on Nietzscheans really were. I can only say that MattJoe have given us the best glimpse of Nietzscheans on Nietzschean terms - and in most cases - they have shown us the heart of a noble people.<br>
<br>
Tyr in Deep Midnight's Voice is simply magnificent... it was wonderful to see the Dragonia Vine in bloom (and my favorite colors!  WOW!!!), and it was equally wonderful to see Tyr initiating/reintroducing Gaiton to the way of the True Nietzschean.  <br>
<br>
Like others - I fail to see what was so profoundly powerful about this probe - I imagine that it gives a tactical advantage in some cases - but not all - or even most!  But I could appreciate with profound empathy when Tyr says &quot;If our ancestors could do this - we can reshape the universe if we will it!&quot;  YES!  The will to power has always been what Neitzscheans are about - with the gift of genetic superiority to facilitate but not replace that will... and in a line, movingly delivered - we could feel, no resonate with the full spirituality of that one idea.  It was fitting then, to see the Nietzscheans, newly awakened to their brotherhood, take on the spiritual task of burying the fallen warriors.  AND... LOL!  I LOVED when they sniffed out the human soldiers encroaching on their position!  And the ensuing bloodbath....<br>
<br>
Hmmmmmmmmmm.  Most might be shocked at a female loving a bloodbath - but for me, this scene could have been prelabelled as rated &quot;R&quot; and shown in all it's bloody, gory glory.  The shocking violence, the pleasure of the kill - this was all so right for Nietzscheans, and especially the Kodiak - I really would have loved to see it for what it was.  I was simply in awe of BOTH of them, Tyr and Gaiton, seeing in them all of the superiority we were ever meant to see in Nietzscheans - and of them, the true superiority of one Mr. Tyr Anasazi, by Barbarossa, out of Victoria!  In that moment, I would have gladly born children for either of them, but of course my choice is clear... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
O.k. one caveat - I watched most of this on mute while my son played a computer game at a volume that suggests a trip to the ear doctor might be in order for him - the screen said that there was a &quot;Nietzschean Battlecry&quot; or some such after the fight scene.  When I played it back with sound - only Gaiton issued a battlecry - Tyr did his patented growl.  Of the two - I liked Tyr's growl better - finding the battlecry someone less than impressive - although it was certainly heartfelt.  And I could have done without some of the stilted vocal phrasing of Gaiton...he was at times brilliant, but at times, only a shade better than the snivelling, sorry Dimitri.<br>
<br>
I must admit to feeling profoundly sad for Tyr when he killed Gaiton.  That it was necessary is beyond doubt.  Gaiton saw in Tamerlaine someone he could use - rather than seeing for Tamerlaine something greater - the possibility that he might grow to full stature and lead - and if Tamerlaine was not to be used according to Gaiton's will - Gaiton would turn against him in a heartbeat.  And that's just ONE scenario of what could reasonably be expected to go wrong with the alliance Gaiton proposed.  But beyond the necessity of Gaiton's death was the profound sadness of Tyr's aloneness... which has now become even more pronounced - because he is the guardian of Tamerlaine's welfare. <br>
<br>
Others may complain about the &quot;Trekkieness&quot; of this episode.  The complaints are all valid I'm sure.  But I saw none of this - everything ELSE about this episode was window dressing around the nuts and bolts of this story - which fulfilled something that I've wanted for so long - more about the Nietzscheans.<br>
 <br>
And for this - I now conclude like so many others - I must be overcome with grief...because in a glimpse - we saw the Nietzschean brotherhood - their heart, their greatness - which if I had the inclination, I could find within that some juicy tidbit for the matriarchy puzzle - and yet - in this very moment - I know that I am bidding a slow and painful adieu to my beloved Nietzscheans, and their favored outcast son, Tyr.  Coming, as it does, at the end of the season, at the end of Keith's contract, at the end of Matt &amp; Joe's contracts - it can only be bittersweet to realize that what we were given in this episode may never appear onscreen again.<br>
<br>
In the final moments we see Dylan getting ready to confront Tyr.  Throughout the episode Dylan had been raising his eyebrows at his weapons officer - and now he's come for a reckoning. I wish that we could see this confrontation - that we could know what each man is thinking.  Perhaps we will, as the ensuing episodes speed us toward what we know is coming - namely Tyr's departure from the crew.  No matter how it turns out, I remain deeply grateful to Matt Kiene and Joe Reinemeyker for their representation of the Nietzschean people as a people inherently worthy.<br>
<br>

<br>
This points to the disgust many Andromeda viewers have with this season. We don't ask a lot, even average scripts would be appreciated, but we can't even get that most of the time. Look at the difference between the two new episodes. In one, Tyr is so stupid he works on high power cables without putting on gloves. In the next, he's written with at least a bit of wit and intelligence. It makes a great difference, but it's still an average episode.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And - I am thrilled to do so for a MattJoe episode! Is this their swan song? If so (and also if not!), gentlemen - WELL DONE!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Let's hope so. I want to get back to kittens and Tunnel aliens as soon as possible. (kidding)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I have always loved Neitzscheans. I liked Rhade, and I loved Tyr. I liked Cuchulan. I loved Guderian. I liked Freya. I loved Charlemagne. I liked (but didn't love) Elsbett. Heck - I liked Erin (HATED Desiree).</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I'll have to agree with you there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And for this reason - I have always loved MattJoe's take on Tyr. I've loved them for their take, because they seem to inherently respect, and like, the possibility of Nietzscheans. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And that's key, because if the writers don't respect an adversary, an entire race, then why should the viewer? It's like the Ogami assassins, they're spoken of as awesome foes feared through the galaxies. Yet they are portrayed as blundering morons stumbling around with battle axes and shields. They didn't live up to their reputation as a foe. Just as the Nietzcheans have been so badly mistreated on this show. A race that ws created exclusively as a backdrop for Keith Hamilton Cobb's character, and they wasted every opportunity to build them up. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It will take Cardie to explain just how different the writers takes on Nietzscheans really were. I can only say that MattJoe have given us the best glimpse of Nietzscheans on Nietzschean terms - and in most cases - they have shown us the heart of a noble people.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Get a good look, cause this might be the last you see of such nobility. (chuckle)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Like others - I fail to see what was so profoundly powerful about this probe - I imagine that it gives a tactical advantage in some cases - but not all - or even most!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This is quite true. Every time we've seen the issue come up, Andromeda manages to find several slippoints within a matter of seconds. It wouldn't seem to be that urgent for navigation, and mapping all the points wouldn't even assist for vessels that are lost. Being lost, away from any slippoints, you wouldn't be able to go to this map and find your way, because that probe would have never mapped places that don't have such slippoints. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But I could appreciate with profound empathy when Tyr says &quot;If our ancestors could do this - we can reshape the universe if we will it!&quot; YES!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I can think of a historical parallel. About a thousand years ago, the kingdom of Ghana was a great empire controlling trade throughout its region, its weapons feared and its cities booming. In time, the ruins of those cities became buried in the jungle, and were dug out only in the last century by archeologists. The archeologists astonished the locals by showing them the great monuments their ancestors had erected, the works they had achieved. The people couldn't believe they had done these things, and many of them still insist it was the work of foreigners. A people's greatness can be forgotten, given enough time. Precisely as Tyr finds his own people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I must admit to feeling profoundly sad for Tyr when he killed Gaiton.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Not me, but then I've always sympathized more with Harper's view of Nietzcheans.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Others may complain about the &quot;Trekkieness&quot; of this episode. The complaints are all valid I'm sure. But I saw none of this - everything ELSE about this episode was window dressing around the nuts and bolts of this story - which fulfilled something that I've wanted for so long - more about the Nietzscheans.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
If only this show had the barest resemblance to the quality one sees on Star Trek, even on average shows like Enterprise. Andromeda has more in common with Mutant X than in anything Gene Roddenberry inspired. And that is a shift from the purpose and clarity (and fun!) of the first season.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>In the final moments we see Dylan getting ready to confront Tyr. Throughout the episode Dylan had been raising his eyebrows at his weapons officer - and now he's come for a reckoning. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That's assuming they remember to continue this scene next week. I will be astonished if they do. It will be a first, as the ad indicates next week's episode is not related to this one. Actual continuity, will wonders never cease?<br>
