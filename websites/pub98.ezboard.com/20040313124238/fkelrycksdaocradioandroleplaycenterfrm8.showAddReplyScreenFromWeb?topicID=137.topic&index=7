<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Keeley sat upon the washed up log on Connla’s sandy shore and peered sadly at the makeshift prison hut.  The flames of the evening bonfire cast an orange glow on the celtling’s tear streaked cheeks.  One of the men guarding the hut shifted uneasily under the celt girl’s watchful eye until his superior barked sharply at him.  However Keeley was not looking at the hut; her gaze focused well beyond the drab structure and its wardens deep into the forest beyond in sad reverie.  Outside another building a young man kept watch over the celtling.  A frustrated sigh erupted behind the sandy-haired celt and he turned to greet its source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “She’s still there?”  Ilisa asked rhetorically.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aye.”  Liam replied.  The ranger propped himself up on the steps of the village’s only stone structure and fiddled with his bow.  Ilisa turned from her student to the ranger.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Has she said anything?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No.” he replied almost indignantly.  “She won’t speak to me!  Honestly, Ilisa, what has gotten into her?”  The blademistress hushed the ranger with a wave of hand.  Even though he was several seasons older than Keeley, Liam had been her closest friend while they were growing up.  Often referring to each other as 'brother’ and 'sister,’ the two of them were nearly inseparable for many years and Keeley’s behavior had begun to worry the ranger.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’d better try to talk to her again.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Keeley did not acknowledge her teacher’s presence as she approached.  Ilisa stood beside the log for a moment contemplating the young guardian.  The celtling kept her gaze towards the prison that held the invader, her knees clutched firmly to her chin.  The veteran blademistress did not miss the moisture under the girl’s eyes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s been over a week now.”  Keeley’s words startled Ilisa.  “I would like to see him - make sure he’s still even alive.”  The girl’s words were emotionless and almost mechanical; her gaze never shifting from the hut.  Ilisa sighed again and stroked the girl’s hair.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m sorry, Keeley, but the council hasn’t decided what to do with him yet.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Isn’t there anything you can do?” Keeley nearly yelled finally turning to her teacher.  “You’re on the council, after all!”  The older woman was taken aback by the girl’s outburst but realized her emotional state was the cause of her disrespectful words.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m very sorry, child.  I know this is hard for you.”  Ilisa paused for a moment and sat down next to the celtling.  “Actually I have no idea how you are feeling, Keeley.”  Ilisa looked down at the ground.  “This is not the sort of thing that happens every day, you know.  Neither myself nor the council has any idea what the two of you have?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I already told you, mistress,” the girl sniffled, “he saved me...twice.  And because of it he is an exile; a man with no home.”  She buried her face in her knees and began sobbing.  “Because of me!”  Putting an arm around her shoulder, Ilisa tried to console the girl.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I know.” she said softly.  “So you have told me.”  Ilisa eyed her student cautiously and was about to speak before deciding against pursuing the subject any deeper.  Keeley leaned against her but continued to stare at the prison hut which had held her attention for so long.  The elder blademistress held her pupil until the tears ran dry then gently brought her to her feet.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Keeley, we need to talk.”  Ilisa looked the girl in the eyes.  “Lady Eileen wishes to hear the story from you.  Personally.”  Keeley’s eyes widened.  “Aye.  You know this is important, don’t you?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Y-yes.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “This is your chance to help him.”  Ilisa’s stern visage faded as quickly as it had appeared when she saw how frightened the celtling had become.  “Don’t worry, child.  A little advice, though:  be honest with her.”  Keeley tried to compose herself with little success.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “When does she want to see me?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now.”  Ilisa replied.  Keeley nodded soberly as Ilisa led her away.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The celtling entered Lady Eileen’s private hut to find the elderly druid fussing over a potted plant.  The doors closed behind the girl with a light thud but the council elder did not turn from her activities to acknowledge her.  Keeley fidgeted and looked about at the interior of the hut while she waited.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lady Eileen had a habit of collecting items of all sort and it showed in her home’s decor.  The hut was not spartan, in fact it was the furthest thing from it.  Totems, some familiar to the young blademistress and others most exotic, littered the floor.  Most had been pushed aside to make a path through the cluttered hut.  A large collection of somewhat lewd tribal objects were piled together against the far wall.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The druid’s desk was another epic of disorder.  Where there was not a pile of scrolls, there would be found a pile rocks.  Some of the rocks were being used to hold open several scroll, but all Keeley could see on them were scribbles that had been crossed out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The celtling’s eyes were drawn to the fire beside where Lady Eileen stood.  In front of the hearth had been placed two cushions.  Above the hearth on the mantel lay a sleeping kitten.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ah!  Better.”  The old woman’s words startled the girl.  When she finally turned around, Keeley was greeted with a warm smile.  “What do you think, my dear?  Homey, is it not?” she said with a grand motion of her arms.  Keeley could not find any words in her throat.  “Oh, dear.  Where are my manners?  Please, child, come sit.”  Lady Eileen gestured to the cushions before the fire.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Th-thank you, m’lady.”  The celtling sat, afraid to look the council elder in the eye.  She was joined by her hostess who had mysteriously acquired two cups of steaming liquid.  Keeley took the one she was offered and held it up to her nose.  Its earthy aroma filled her nostrils and the girl began to relax under its influence.  After a few sips the old woman broke the calculated silence.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So, Keeley, I understand you’ve had quite an adventure.”  Keeley looked up from her cup.  Lady Eileen peered over her own cup, her bright, blue eyes had a mischievous twinkle in them.  “Won’t you tell me about it?” the elder asked with a wry smile.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I-I don’t know where to begin, m’lady.”  Nervous, the girl looked at the old woman.  Lady Eileen had been the village’s figurehead for as long as Keeley could remember.  Even though her wrinkled features spoke of a long career in the defense of Hibernia, the druid’s bright eyes betrayed a youthful exuberance that Keeley had never seen in one so old.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, you could start at the beginning, my dear.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I thought everyone knew about that.  How much do you know?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Pretend I know nothing, dear.” she replied as she set down her cup and propped her elbows up on her knees giving Keeley her full attention.  The celtling began relating the story of how she went exploring the new dungeon alone against the advice of her teacher, her unfortunate encounter with a naburite drinker, and how the highlander found her near death by the imps.  When she had finished the first part of her story, Keeley’s hostess was grinning broadly at her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So you went back there to look for him.” Eileen stated rather than asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “A-aye, yes.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And what happened?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I found him,”  Keeley fidgeted,  “but I was in over my head again.  He and his companions became engaged with the same monsters we were fighting when they approached us.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You mean 'attacked you’?” the elder asked.  Keeley was silent for a moment then stared at the floor and nodded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But he didn’t attack us!  He actually came to my aid.  If he hadn’t I would surely be dead.  We escaped through a magic portal but I ended up at the Albion keep in Emain along with him.  I think he saved me again from his own guards this time.”  Keeley shivered despite the warm fire.  The thought of how many times she had come close to death had only just begun to dawn on her.  She wondered if she would have been better as a craftsman’s apprentice; spending all her time in Tir na Nog where it was safe.  Lady Eileen noticed her discomfort and handed her cup to her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So you and your new friend escaped into our frontier and then what?”  The druid’s expression was no longer as jovial as it was when they had started.  “I don’t imagine the two of you discussed sewing.”  Keeley blushed heavily.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We,” she paused, “we 'joined’.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I see.  Willingly?”  Keeley nodded.  Lady Eileen gave the celtling a moment to relax and waited for her to take another sip.  “How was it?”  The girl coughed and sputtered from nearly inhaling her entire drink.  The druid produced a piece of cloth for the celtling and patted her on the back.  “That good, aye?”  Keeley looked up to see her hostess trying to hold back a fit of laughter.  “I am sorry, my dear.” she laughed.  “You just seemed so tense.  Had I known you would forget how to drink, I would not have done that.”  When Keeley’s coughing fit had ended the druid continued.  “So why bring him here, Keeley?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The celtling looked dumbstruck for a moment.  “Eirik had nowhere to go.  H-he had forsaken his own people by helping me; he couldn’t go back to Albion, and I would never let him try!  I know he could live here; it wouldn't be the first time.  What about Kaylee and her family who came to live...”  Keeley cut her words short and the druid looked at her sternly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That tale does not have a happy ending, child.”  The celtling nodded solemnly<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I know it will work.  I just know it.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I understand dear.  That’s enough for now.” the druid hushed her then thought silently.  Keeley wondered what was going to happen next.  For what seemed like an eternity the council elder sat and stared off into the distance.  “Several things still puzzle me, Keeley.”  The celtling nearly jumped.  “One thing:  why you refer to your companion as 'Highlander’.”  Keeley became confused.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, I realize that a kilt was found in his belongings when he was captured, you said yourself he was seen with other Albions, and for all we know he speaks only the Albion language,” the druid continued, “but you strip all that away and the fellow is most assuredly Norse in heritage.  After all, dear, 'Eirik’ is a Norse name.”  Keeley sat dumbfounded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t understand...”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m sorry.”  The druid stood up.  “I think there is more to your friend than you know.  You must realize that things in Albion are much different than they are here.  Just because he carries two weapons does not mean he follows the same teachings as guardians who choose the Path of Harmony.”  The celtling’s questioning look gave the druid reason to continue.  “I can only assume he is a member of the guild of shadows, Keeley.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No.  No, no.  That’s not possible.” the girl had stood up but her legs were beginning to fail her.  “He’s no assassin!  I won’t believe it!”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Steady, child.” the woman chided.  Keeley tried to back up and nearly fell over a pile of books but the druid caught here with uncanny reflexes.  The celtling sat on the floor stunned by the new revelations.  “I’m sorry, dear, but there is too much in doubt about your friend.  His fate will have to be decided by the town.  Tomorrow we will hold a discussion.”  Keeley looked up at the old woman, her eyes filling with tears.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “M’lady, I must see him.  I beg you.  Please let me see him.”  Lady Eileen studied the young blademistress for a moment and nodded.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Keeley raced towards the prison hut.  The guards immediately barred her entrance but Liam, who was catching up to his friend, waved them off.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s alright.  We have the council’s permission.” he said showing them their authorization.  The senior guard studied the papers for a moment then motioned to his subordinate to open the door.  Keeley was ill-prepared for what she saw.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The dingy hut was bisected by a set of iron bars which included a small door.  The highlander lay curled up on the dirt floor on the other side of the bars wearing only tattered rags.  An awful smell assaulted the celtling’s nostrils.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Eirik!” she cried grabbing the bars.  The highlander leapt to his feet upon hearing his name.  Seeing Keeley lifted his heart tremendously.  He had begun to wonder if she had been executed for treason or at least imprisoned.  The two embraced through the bars and the celtling began to cry with a mixture of joy and heartache.  Eirik looked at his love.  Apart from red, puffy eyes she seemed physically sound so he assumed she had faired the better for their ordeal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, Keeley I’m so glad you’re alright.”  Eirik kissed the weeping girl soundly on the forehead.  She responded in her own tongue and the highlander hushed her.  “It’s alright, Keeley.  I’m so sorry to have put you through this.” he soothed.  It was then he noticed the same ranger who had taken a shot at him standing beside the door.  The ranger stared back stoically.  Eirik turned his attention back to his love.  The celtling pressed herself against the bars in an effort to get as close to him as possible.  “I pray this isn’t our last time together but if it is I wish I could let you know that I would not trade this time for anything.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After several minutes of watching his friend cry in the arms of the barbarian, Liam approached the two lovers.  “I think we had better go, Keeley.  You have a big day tomorrow and it would be best if you got some sleep before hand.”  The celtling reluctantly disengaged from Eirik giving him one last kiss.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oíche mhaith, rún mo chroí.” she whispered in his ear before following Liam out the door.  The highlander watched her leave and then it became his turn to cry.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lady Eileen scratched Critter’s ears eliciting a delighted purr from the kitten.  He had been given to her by a group of adventurers who had found him while on a mission to the Pennine Mountains.  The elderly woman never did ask exactly how they came across the furry thing; she felt discretion in the matter would be wise.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She sat in her chair letting Critter curl up in her lap and it was not long before the kitten was fast asleep.  She contemplated the kitten’s blissful life when a knock at her door interrupted her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Enter.”  The druid did not look up from her pet to greet her guest.  “What did you learn?” she asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Not much I’m afraid.  But it’s obvious he returns her affections.” Liam answered.  The woman looked the ranger straight in the eyes and considered his answer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Close the door and tell me as much as you can then.”<br>

        Dawn broke and, through the small crack in his prison, the highlander watched the sunrise for what he feared would be the last time.  Eirik was sure that his meeting with Keeley the night before was a gift before his execution, and the unusually grand meal he had just been brought served only to reinforced this conclusion.  His usual daily meal consisted of moldy bread and turbid water, however this morning he had been given fresh bread, clean water, and (to his utter amazement) a slice of the richest cheese he had ever tasted.<br>
<br>
        The firbolg that brought him his meal left without making eye contact with the highlander.  Eirik finished his meal and sat back against the hut‘s walls.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Die here, or die at home</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought.  The sun shone though the crack and projected a long shaft of light across the dirt floor.  The highlander heaved a sigh and tried in vain to relax.  The sliver of light now crossed his lap and he held out his hand in an attempt to catch the sun one last time.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I wonder how long I have.  Oh, Keeley, I’m so sorry.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  “I’m sorry I came so far only to fail,” he whispered to himself.<br>
<br>
        Time drew out like a knife for Eirik and when the sun hit its apex his thoughts were interrupted by two guards at his hut.  The highlander recognized them as the man and woman he had fought when he first arrived in the village.  The woman barked something at him.  Not knowing exactly what to do Eirik stood up; the chains binding his ankles and wrists clanged noisily.  The sentinel’s companion unlocked his cell and motioned for him to come out.<br>
<br>
        <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This is it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he though solemnly.  Eirik got out of the cell and stood before them.  Glynnis barked something else at him and the highlander stood there confused.  She repeated herself this time motioning for him to turn around.  Eirik was still confused but complied.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What’s going</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->…his thought was cut short when he felt ice-cold water hit his naked back.  He let out a yelp but was ordered to turn around again.  This time he was greeted with another bucket of cold water in the face.  The guardian put down the second bucket and handed Eirik a rag with which to dry and (as much as possible) clean himself.<br>
<br>
        The highlander looked up after drying his face.  He could not read the guardian’s expression but the young woman glared at him.  Her eyes, still red from the highlanders dirty fighting technique, only made her look angrier.  Eirik managed a weak smile.  “Sorry about that.”  Glynnis flung a semi-clean tunic at him in response.  Once he had managed to don the garment Eirik was led out of his hut.<br>
<br>
        Once outside the highlander noticed that the entire village seemed empty save for two guards outside the village’s central hut.  It was many times larger than the rest of the structures and Eirik thought that it could probably hold the entire village.  He was not altogether wrong and the highlander’s escorts led him there to find out first-hand.<br>
<br>
        When the doors were opened everyone in the hut turned to stare at the highlander.  Eirik began to wonder if this was going to be a public execution, and indoors at that.  As he was led down the isle between two sets of filled benches, Eirik tried to find Keeley in the crowd but Glynnis pushed him forward.  The highlander found himself standing before two elderly men flanking an equally elderly woman.  The three were dressed in majestic attire and were sitting behind a high table which forced Eirik to look up at them.  Standing next to the table was the same Celt ranger Eirik had seen with Keeley when she visited him the night before.<br>
<br>
        Sentinel Glynnis spoke to Eirik and pointed at a spot on the ground.  When the highlander had stepped up to the spot, Glynnis and the guardian disappeared into the crowd.  Eirik turned back to the trio before him.  The woman motioned to one of the guards nearby and spoke.  The guard removed the highlander’s shackles.  Once again the Eirik furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
        <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This is becoming intolerably confusing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought.  When the highlander thought that his situation could not get any stranger, the sandy-haired Celt stepped up and began speaking to him in nearly perfect Welsh.  <br>
<br>
        “Albian, this hearing is for the purpose of deciding your fate in our land.  I will act as translator for you and the council.  Before you are councilman Nevan, council elder Eileen, and council elder Eachann.  When you answer their questions you will address them and not me.  Answer truthfully.  Do you understand?”<br>
<br>
        Astonished, Eirik stared at the Celt for a moment before he found his voice.  “A-aye, yes.  I understand.”  It had been a long time since he had to speak Welsh and he hoped that he had enough phlegm in his throat to get through the evening.<br>
<br>
        “Very well.”  Liam nodded to the council members.  The one that Eirik remembered as councilman Nevan spoke and the ranger translated.<br>
<br>
        “Tell us first off, young man, tell us you name.”<br>
<br>
        “My name is Eirik, sir.” the young fighter stammered not sure how to address the old man.<br>
<br>
        “And your family name?”<br>
<br>
        Eirik paused.  “Westlake.”  <br>
<br>
        “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Westlake?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  That is a Briton name, is it not?”<br>
<br>
        Eirik frowned.  “Aye, it is.”<br>
<br>
        “You will have to excuse us, Eirik.” Lady Eileen chimed in.  “You have us at a disadvantage.  You have a Briton surname, you were found with highland clothing, however I can tell that you are obviously neither.  It would be best if you were to clear up this confusion.”  Eirik was visibly agitated.<br>
<br>
        “Answer the councilwoman.” Liam ordered evenly.  Eirik straightened up and gazed at the elderly woman; his expression marked with a slight sadness.<br>
<br>
        “My father was from the Cotswolds.  My mother was a Norse.”  When Liam finished translating a murmur ran through the hut.  Eileen held up her right hand to silence the crowd.  “I guess it’s easier to tell from without Albion than within.  My heritage, that is.”  Eirik smiled weakly.  “However I gather that your wisdom also gave you insight.”<br>
<br>
        “Ah, my friend, this is interesting indeed!  I imagine there is a fascinating story behind this.  Would you enlighten us, please?”  Her two associates were about to protest, but Eileen  held them back.<br>
<br>
        “I-I’m not sure what there is to tell.”  Eirik began to get flustered.  “My mother was a healer who gave up her gift from Eir after she save…um, met my father.  My father decided the best place for them to live would be in the highland village of Humberton.  He knew they would be more…receptive to my mother, and failing that, she could blend in better.  It was there that I was born.  I had my mother’s Norse physique so it was only fitting that I be raised as a Highlander: a heritage I more-or-less embraced.”  <br>
<br>
“Where are your parents now?” councilman Nevan asked.<br>
<br>
        Eirik closed his eyes for a moment and sighed.  “They are no longer with us.  My father passed away when I was ten.  My mother...didn‘t seem to have the will to live without him.  S-she...she died shortly after.&quot;  Eileen could tell that he was uncomfortable and decided to spare the young man any more anguish over his family.  She cleared her throat and continued.<br>
<br>
        “So tell us about your profession, Eirik.  After your initial training as a fighter you joined the guild of shadows?”<br>
<br>
        “No.  No, I joined the Defenders.  I requested stationing in Snowdonia as one of the defenders of Myrddin.”  Eirik managed a slight smile.  “I guess I had an unusual affinity for the land.  I preferred to defend what I had come to know as my homeland rather than getting involved in conquering others.”<br>
<br>
        “But you are a mercenary, are you not?” queried Eachann.  <br>
<br>
        “I,” Eirik paused, “I was court marshaled; I had to leave the Defenders.”<br>
<br>
        “Why was this?”<br>
<br>
        “One time when my company was retaking Caer Hurbury from Hibernia we had cleared the keep of defenders to find a young Celt boy cowering in the tower.  He was too young to defend himself and had probably been dragged there by friends.  Some members of my company began tormenting him - torturing the poor lad.  What they were doing was not...honorable.” Eirik closed his eyes in memory of the incidents.  “Anyway, my commanding officer was not pleased with my actions that followed.”<br>
<br>
        “Which were?”<br>
<br>
        Eirik coughed.  “Let’s just say that a couple of them will never forget that day.”  The highlander sighed and continued.  “My commanding officer, Captain Rhodri, intervened and stopped my execution.  I was sent to the Guild of Shadows since they were the only ones who would accept me, and I was trained as Rhodri’s hired help.”  Eirik sneered at the thought of his old master.  “I was allowed to live and remain more-or-less free, but I was always in that man’s debt and the threat of execution still loomed over my head.  All this happened a long time ago.”<br>
<br>
        “And what happened to the young boy?” Eileen finally asked.<br>
<br>
        “They killed him.  I’m sorry.”  Eirik wiped his eyes before looking up after Liam finished translating.  He saw no accusation in Eileen’s face, but her companions did not seem so forgiving.  Once again he heard the village murmur behind him.<br>
<br>
        “It is not your fault.  What’s past is past.”  Eileen tried to comfort the visibly disturbed fighter.  “Let us concentrate on the present now.  Tell us why you were in Hibernia’s corridors of Darkness Falls and how you came upon a certain young Celt <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>girl</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.”  Eirik started to shake with fear.<br>
<br>
        “Y-you have to believe me that is was not my intention to go there!”  He calmed down before continuing.  “I went there to collect daemon seals to trade with the imps.  I had joined a group of strangers and before I knew it, our group leader had led us there to slaughter any Hibernians remaining once their entrance had closed.  I was not prepared for such a fight and before I knew it we encountered a single group of your people.”  Eirik stared off into the distance for a moment before focusing on Lady Eileen.  “I’m still not sure how I managed to survive but I was the only one left standing when the battle was finished.  That’s when I found Keeley in the imp shrine.”<br>
<br>
        The highlander paused to see if he had to continue.  When no one spoke he resigned himself to finishing the story.  “Keeley was badly hurt but I could not find a way to help her.  When the dungeon changed hands I thought the best thing to do would be to put her where someone who could help her would find her.”<br>
<br>
        “Why did you not kill her?” came the dreaded question from Eachann.<br>
<br>
        “I know no one will believe me, but I saw no point in killing someone so close to death.”<br>
<br>
        “You thought it would be better to let the daemons finish the job they started?  Or perhaps just let her die slowly due to her wounds?”<br>
<br>
        “No!  I told you that I didn’t know how to help her.  I wasn’t going to kill her quickly just to end her misery.  She still had a chance.”<br>
<br>
        “Enough, Eachann.” Eileen commanded while trying to bring some order to the room.  When the crowd had quieted down again the elder turned back to the young fighter.  “Tell us about your second encounter, Eirik.”  The highlander turned from Eachann to answer the lady’s question.<br>
<br>
        “I had joined with a few old friends to go back to the dungeon to farm more seals for the imps.  It was near the crossroads that we encountered Keeley and her friends.  She was a little out of her league, to say the least.”  Eirik tried again to find Keeley in the crowd before turning back to Lady Eileen.  “I still wonder why she went back there after her last experience, but now that I think about it...”  Eirik stopped short of finishing his musings.  “My group was going to attack, but we got caught up in the same group of daemons.  When I saw that Keeley was in trouble I just acted without thinking.  Like I said: she should not have been there.”  The fighter tried to weather the looks of disbelief from the council elders.<br>
<br>
        “I just got her out of there as fast as I could,” Eirik continued.  “Unfortunately we ended up in the Albion keep in your frontier.  Probably for the best since once I got her out of there she was safe and closer to her home.”<br>
<br>
        “Albian, do you know what happened to your friends after you abandoned them?” Nevan asked.  The question surprised Eirik.<br>
<br>
        “I imagine they got out alright.  They are good people and experienced fighters.”  The highlander frowned at the question.<br>
<br>
        “I’m afraid not, Nevan.” Eachann answered, turning to his comrade.  “We were told that only the female Briton escaped.  The rest of your friends died, Eirik.”  Eirik detected a hint of smugness in the councilman’s voice.  The news hit the highlander hard.  He seemed to waver a bit before lowering his head and whispering a prayer.<br>
<br>
        “They knew and accepted the risks.  That’s the life we lead.”  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Oh, God, Isabella.  Please forgive me.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
        After giving the pseudo-highlander a moment, Eileen continued.  “I’m sorry for your loss, Eirik.  May I ask why didn’t you go back to Albion?” she asked.<br>
<br>
        “Isn’t it obvious?  Word had already reached my former commanding officer of our first encounter in Darkness falls.  I doubt I would be allowed to live after saving a member of the enemy twice especially since most of my companions died,” Eirik explained keeping his eyes on the ground for a moment longer.<br>
<br>
        “And…” Eirik thought hard for a moment, not knowing how to explain his feelings, “for Keeley.  There is a bond between us, that I cannot deny.  I don’t know if this was destiny or an act of God that brought us together, but I do know that I would do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for her.  Even if it meant risking death in coming here.  I came here...because I love her.”<br>
<br>
        Liam stopped translating abruptly.  Eirik looked at him and the ranger’s eyes narrowed at the highlander.  When Lady Eileen became impatient and prodded the man for the translation, Liam gave a defeated look and reluctantly told the council what Eirik had said.  <br>
<br>
        The intensity of the commotion at the back of the hut surprised everyone including Eirik who turned to see Keeley standing at the end of the isle with Ilisa trying to pull her back to her seat.  The celtling managed to shrug off her mistress’ attempts to pull her back into the crowd.  With tear-filled eyes, the young girl rushed to tightly embraced her lover despite his rank aroma.  Eachann tried to call the guards on the celtling but Lady Eileen intervened.<br>
<br>
        “Do you see?”  Keeley spoke, turning to the council.  “He’s not a threat.  Not to us.”<br>
<br>
        “Mind your manners, Keeley.  We’re all aware of your bias.”  Eileen grinned as she spoke.  “I think we’ve heard enough.  I think the council shall recess.”<br>
<br>
        When the guards came to take Eirik back to his cell, Liam informed him of his situation.  “You could be in luck, ‘highlander.’  You may live through this yet.”  Eirik just stood there dumbfounded.<br>
<br>
        “What is your name, sir?” he asked.<br>
<br>
        “Liam.”<br>
<br>
        “Thank you, Liam.  Thank you.”  And with that, the highlander was led away.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
        Keeley waited pensively outside the village’s civic hut.  Only the council elders and the other members of the village council (trainers, tradesmen and women, and other important members of the village) were present at the final discussion; the rest of the village’s citizens had been removed.  However as the evening drew late, none of them retired for everyone was curious as to the fate of the invader.<br>
<br>
        Keeley remained removed from the main crowd as she stood in wait by herself.  There were mutters in the gathering behind her as her people gossiped about her relationship with the half-Albion, half-Norse that had come to their land, but Keeley did not hear a word.  Her focus remained on the hut which held her lover’s fate within.  Keeley did not even notice when Liam stood beside her.  The ranger looked at his ‘sister’ for a moment waiting for her to acknowledge his presence until he finally got her attention with a comforting hand on her shoulder.  Startled, the celtling jumped.  When she saw her friend beside her she relaxed a little and tried to smile at him.<br>
<br>
        “I didn’t know you could speak the Albion tongue, Liam.” Keeley said as she leaned against the ranger putting her head on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
        “I can‘t.” he joked.  “We’re lucky he knew Welsh.  It‘s not one if his land‘s more prominent languages.”  Keeley looked up to her friend.<br>
<br>
        “He’s full of surprises, isn’t he?”  Keeley chuckled softly.  “A Norse-Briton.” she mused softly to no one in particular.  “He proves it can work, Liam.  If his mother could find a home in a foreign land, then so should he.”  Keeley returned her head to Liam’s shoulder and stifled a Yawn.<br>
<br>
        “You’re tired, Keeley.  You haven’t slept well in days; they could be in there all night.”<br>
<br>
        “No.  I’ll be fine.”<br>
<br>
        Just then the door opened and Ilisa exited the hut alone.  Keeley immediately perked up and her teacher, upon seeing the pair, approached them.  Keeley held her breath.<br>
<br>
        “Well, Keeley.  He can stay.” the blademistress stayed the girl’s enthusiasm quickly.  “But there are some conditions which we shall go over later.  It looks like you’ve won.  We should release him.”  Ilisa did not get a chance to finish her last sentence before Keeley bolted for the prison hut.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
        Eirik had begun to nod off when his sleep was interrupted by someone calling his name off in the distance.  He shook off the fog of drowsiness and heard the yelling get louder until the door to his hut flung open and the happiest woman in Hibernia burst through.<br>
<br>
        “Keeley!  What’s going on?!”  Eirik could only assume it was good news.  The young woman pressed her face up against the bars and tried to give the man a hug, but made way for the guard behind her to unlock his cell.  Eirik was elated and embraced his love upon receiving his freedom, but he was still unsure whether or not to celebrate.  When Liam entered the hut, Eirik knew he would find out what was happening.<br>
<br>
        “Congratulations, Eirik, and welcome to Connla.” Liam said with a genuine smile.  Eirik could hardly believe his ears.  He looked down at Keeley who held him tightly and returned his gaze with glee.  “But there are some conditions.”<br>
<br>
        “Aye?  What conditions?” he asked.<br>
<br>
        “You are not to arm yourself.”  Eirik was surprised at first but he quickly realized the reasoning behind the condition.  “Second:  It would probably be best if you remained here in Connla for a while until you get settled in.  There are others but we will go over the minor details later.  Let’s get you cleaned up first.”  Liam smiled and gestured to the doorway.<br>
<br>
        The trio headed out into the village where they were met by quite a few onlookers.  Most wore bewildered looks, but a few furrowed their brows in disagreement.  However all of them could see the happiness the decision had brought their prodigal daughter.  Liam led Eirik and Keeley to a small hut.<br>
<br>
        “Here you are.  It’s a small hut, but I’m sure you will find it more comfortable than your previous accommodations.” Liam quipped.  “You should have a warm bath ready for you plus anything else you may need to get cleaned up.  When you’re finished we will show you around.”  Liam looked at the setting sun.  “Before it gets too late.”<br>
<br>
        “Thank you again, Liam.” Eirik smiled then reached over to give the ranger a rib-cracking hug.  Liam let out a groan.<br>
<br>
        “Don’t mention it!” he cried breathlessly.  Eirik entered his hut and Keeley was about to follow when Liam grabbed her wrist.  “I think he can bathe himself, Keeley.” the ranger chided.  The celtling thrust out her lower lip in a pout but Liam did not relent.  Keeley gave a contemptuous sigh and waited outside with her old friend.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
        When Eirik emerged from his hut, Keeley beheld an almost new man.  Bathed, shaved of nearly two-week’s growth, and dressed in clean Celt attire he could almost pass as one of Hibernia’s own.  Keeley grabbed her man and played with his long, dark hair which was still wet.  The celtling nuzzled Eirik’s chest and could still smell his unique scent under the fragrant oils he had used in his bathing.<br>
<br>
        <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Almost</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she thought.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hurray for difference</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she sighed and gave Eirik a long hug.  He chuckled at her.<br>
<br>
        “'Hello' to you, too.”  Eirik turned from Keeley to Liam who stood nearby.  “Shall we get started?” he asked in Welsh.<br>
<br>
        Liam and Keeley showed Eirik the entire village and some of the surrounding countryside in order to help him familiarize himself with the area.  Throughout the tour, Eirik and Keeley remained physically joined, never releasing hands for more than a moment.  In the middle of the tour, Ilisa joined the three and aided in explaining more of the conditions of Eirik’s existence in Hibernia.<br>
<br>
        “You’ll have to cut your hair, perhaps even lighten the color a little.” Ilisa explained as Liam translated.  This requirement displeased Keeley more than it did Eirik.  “It will help you blend in.  Also, we will be working out a way to break the news to Tir na Nog about your presence.  We will try to broach the subject hypothetically at first.”  Ilisa thought for a moment.  “Perhaps your family’s own experiences will help us in this matter.  But you must realize that we may never be able to reveal you to the rest of Hibernia.  Connla is an isolated village where all kinds live in harmony.  The same can not always be said for the rest of our lands.”<br>
<br>
        “I understand.” Eirik agreed.  “It would be a small price to pay.”<br>
<br>
        &quot;And perhaps most importantly you will need to learn our language.  I can't spend all my time with you.&quot; Liam chuckled.<br>
<br>
        By this time darkness had fallen and the four of them returned to Eirik’s hut.  Beside the door a guard waited and Eirik looked worried.  Liam saw the man’s concern and answered his question preemptively.<br>
<br>
        “For your temporary safety, my friend.  You understand?”<br>
<br>
        “Aye.”  Eirik nodded and turned to a bleary-eyed Keeley.  “How do I say ‘goodnight’ in your language?” he asked Liam<br>
<br>
        “Oíche mhaith.” Liam chuckled.<br>
<br>
        “Oíche mhaith, love.” Eirik tried to pronounce.  Keeley giggled at his thick accent and kissed him.<br>
<br>
        “Slán go fóill, a chiste!” she replied.  <br>
<br>
        Keeley staggered off sleepily and when she was out of earshot, Ilisa approached Eirik and spoke to him.  Her words were punctuated with a slashing gesture in front of his groin.  The elder blademistress looked the man straight in the eye for several moments then walked off to her own hut.  Eirik was puzzled and looked to Liam for a translation.<br>
<br>
        “What did she say?” he asked.  Liam sucked in his breath and thought for a moment.<br>
<br>
        “Let’s just say that until we figure things out, it would be best if you kept ‘it’ under your kilt for the time being -- if you understand my meaning.”  Eirik blanched and the ranger left him to mull it over.  “Now try to get some sleep.” he called out with a wry smile.  The female guard at Eirik’s modest hut chuckled at him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
        <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sleep?  How the hell am I supposed to sleep?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Eirik tossed and turned in his small cot.  As if the day’s excitement was not enough, Ilisa’s words had left him in a state of near panic.  Eirik continued to consider the consequences of his actions when he heard something at his door.  The voices subsided then a figure crept into his hut and through the gloom.<br>
<br>
        “Keeley?” the fighter called out.  Eirik lit the lamp beside his cot and the orange glow illuminated Keeley’s smiling face.  He blew out a relieved sigh.  “Thank goodness you’re not an assassin.” he whispered.  Keeley rushed over and leaped onto his cot straddling the surprised half-Norse.  Eirik laughed.<br>
<br>
        “You couldn’t sleep either, eh?” he asked.  Keeley bent down to give her lover a long, deep kiss during which she began fumbling with the belt on Eirik’s trousers.  When he realized what she was doing, Eirik grabbed her hands.<br>
<br>
        “Whoa there, lass.  I don’t think that would be a good idea.”  Keeley was a little perturbed but ignored him and continued trying to undress both of them.  “Keeley!” he hissed a little louder.  “We can’t.  Ilisa was very clear on the subject.”  Eirik gestured towards the door.<br>
<br>
        With the mention of her trainer, Keeley stopped.  When she realized what was going on, she began grumbling in her own tongue.  “What?  What did Ilisa say to you?”  Keeley let out a growl.  “Dammit, she is not my mother and I am not a child!”  Eirik tried to hush her before the guard returned, heard the two of them, or reversed her stance on the subject of Keeley’s presence in his hut.<br>
<br>
        Keeley remained straddling him with fists on her hips, and Eirik tried to sooth her by stroking her light hair.  He pulled the lamp a little closer and saw the hurt look on her face.  He sighed and pulled her down.  Turning her around, Eirik snuggled up against her back as the pair lay together on the cot.<br>
<br>
        “Perhaps there is a way I calm you down and still retain my ‘claymore’.” he chuckled as he blew out the lamp.  Keeley’s anger began to melt away as she realized where Eirik's hands were heading. <br>
<br>
        Outside the hut, the guard heard a giggle from within and sighed to herself.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cathymarie>Cathymarie</A> at: 8/18/03 5:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cathymarie>Cathymarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#3333ff>(8/18/03 3:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=137.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Highlander and the Celt, Part 10</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Part 10</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Day began to break in Connla. The morning sun was obscured by clouds which had brought with them chilly air off the cool waters of Shannon Estuary. The cold permeated Eirik’s hut and Keeley, though still fully clothed, felt the chill. The young woman began to wake and tried to stave off the cold by snuggling closer to Eirik who lay beside her. The young highlander, too, began to stir and instinctively clutched his cot-mate tighter. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eirik soon shook off the night’s sleep entirely and remembered Ilisa’s threat, but when he looked down to see Keeley’s sleeping form in his arms he decided that he really did not care. Eirik sighed and buried his face in Keeley’s hair to inhale the most intoxicating musk he had ever known. She began to moan in response to the disruption of her extra nap. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Wake up, sleepy-head.” he whispered in her ear. Eirik stroked her cheek softly and Keeley tried to reach behind her to smack him but all she could manage was to grab his thigh and give it a weak squeeze. Reluctantly she began to get up. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The salt air from the shore came blowing gently into the hut. Keeley sat up on the cot, took a deep breath, and promptly dashed out of the hut holding her hand over her mouth. Eirik lay on the cot dumbfounded for a moment before he pursued his lover. Eirik exited the hut but found neither Keeley nor anyone else about.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Keeley?” he called trying not to disturb the whole village. Behind the hut came a retching sound and upon investigation Eirik found Keeley bent over next to a tree; the female guard was holding the girl’s hair back while she vomited. “Keeley?! What’s wrong?!” Eirik approached the pair but the guard quickly produced a blade with her left hand, all the while holding Keeley’s hair back with the right. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Focáil leat!” the guard yelled, waving her sword menacingly. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Alright! Alright! Alright!” Eirik threw up his hands in defeat and backed away. “I’m hardly responsible for her condition, you know.” The guard glared at him for a moment before turning to Keeley who was wiping her mouth on her sleeve. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What’s wrong? What did that barbarian do to you?” the young woman asked. Keeley felt dazed by the peculiar and sudden onset of nausea she had experience. The celtling blinked and looked up at Romana. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I-I don’t know.” Keeley sniffed the air and tried to repress another wave of nausea. “Gads! Something must have died on the beach.” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Romana took a deep breath. “I smell nothing out of the ordinary. Are you sure you’re alright?” The guard cocked her brow at Keeley. Suddenly, memories of the plague that had swept through Connla years ago came back to the celtling. Keeley’s eyes grew wide. She looked at Eirik who stood a few yards away waiting for her. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I think I’d better go see Keagan.” <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eirik stood in the center of his hut and listened as the door was secured behind him by a new guard: a giant firbolg who did not seem as jovial (or feminine) as Eirik’s previous ward. The wind had begun to pick up even more over the last few minutes which was evidence of a storm brewing over the ocean Eirik sighed and sat down in an attempt to relax. Not knowing what was going on in his life was beginning to take its toll on his sanity. The young warrior stood up again and began pacing the hut. It was then that he noticed his pack at the foot of the cot. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eirik opened it and began searching frantically. Most of his belonging, less his weapons and armor, had been returned along with his pack. Eirik flung most of the contents across the room and eventually dumped the rest rather unceremoniously on the cot. Sorting through the pile the young man eventually found the object of his search: a silver ring. Eirik turned the band around in his hand and inspected it closely. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Thank God.&quot; he whispered and clutched the ring tightly in his fist. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Liam the ranger entered the healer's home to find its owner, Keagan, feeling Keeley's neck. Her friend, Romana sat beside the celtling holding her hand. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ah, Liam.&quot; The healer smiled. &quot;Trying to catch a glimpse of my patients again?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The ranger frowned in confusion. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asked turning to Keeley. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I don't know.&quot; Romana answered for her. &quot;She ran out of his hut this morning and...&quot; Keeley poked her friend and glared at her. Liam's eyes went wide. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You were with him last night?!&quot; he asked sounding exasperated. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Please don't tell Ilisa, Liam! Please!&quot; Keeley pleaded. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Your teacher has a way of finding things out, Keeley.&quot; Liam sighed realizing his protests too late and unproductive. &quot;But I won't tell her, be assured. Now what happened?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I was sick. I-I thought it might be...you know.&quot; the celtling's voice trailed off. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'm glad you're both here, actually,&quot; Keagan interrupted returning to the trio from his table. &quot;No, my dear, it's not the plague,&quot; the healer turned to Liam, &quot;Keeley is pregnant.&quot; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The highlander’s thoughts were interrupted by voices at his hut’s entrance. When Liam walked in, Eirik leaped to his feet in anticipation. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Where’s Keeley? What’s wrong with her? Why have I been locked in here?” Eirik’s barrage of questions in his native tongue left the ranger at a loss before Eirik realized his mistake and repeated them in Welsh. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hold on, Eirik. Let me explain.” Liam paused for a moment. “Actually, that would take too long. Let me summarize: Keeley is with child.” Liam tried to stifle a grin upon seeing the highlander’s expression. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Whoa.” was the only response Eirik could manage. Liam quirked his brow. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes. It looks like Ilisa’s warning came a little too late, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>daddy</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eirik sat down and considered his new situation. He looked up at the ranger suddenly. “How is she? Is there anything wrong?” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No, no. Just a touch of morning sickness. It’s perfectly normal. She and, as far as we know, her -- um, your -- child are fine.” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, when can I see her?”. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Liam sighed before answering. “Not just now. Things are progressing a little faster than we expected, Eirik.” Liam placed a comforting hand on the highlander’s shoulder then turned to leave. “You can wait here. I’ll come retrieve you soon.” The door closed behind the ranger but the guard did not lock it. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ilisa strode menacingly through the village towards Keeley’s hut without taking noticed of some of the frightened glances or the people she nearly walked over. At nearly six feet, the Celt Bladesong was an impressive and imposing figure: a fact not lost on Ilisa and a fact that she wished had not been lost on the foreigner who had invaded her homeland. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ilisa burst through the door without even a courtesy knock to find Keeley and her friend together. The two of them jumped and Romana abruptly stopped talking. The blademistress narrowed her eyes at Keeley’s hutmate before turning to her pupil. Keeley sat on her bed with her arms folded over he stomach and her eyes darting to the floor. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An uncomfortable silence hung in the air before the elder blademistress spoke. “I would speak with you alone, Keeley” Ilisa did her best to control her anger. Keeley nervously looked to her friend beside her. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Please don’t be angry with her, mis…” Romana began. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And you! You were supposed to be guarding his hut!” Ilisa spat angrily. The young guardian shrunk back. “Glynnis will be informed of your actions. Now leave us.” The elder blademistress watched as Romana gave Keeley’s hand a quick squeeze and slipped out the door. Ilisa turned her attention back to Keeley who now stood before her teacher. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You couldn’t wait, could you?” Ilisa asked softly. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I love him, mistress.” Keeley’s tone was defiant but her lip trembled slightly. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ilisa grinned despite her anger. “That’s your excuse for everything, Keeley.” The celtling chuckled a bit but Ilisa’s expression quelled her mirth. “Keeley. This is serious. You are carrying his child.” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And what’s wrong with that? It’s not like he has brought the plague to the village.” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And he’s very lucky for that! One word from Keagan and I would have been the first to put his hut to the torch with him locked in it.” Keeley fought back the anger that welled up after her teacher’s threat. Seeing her hurt expression, Ilisa calmed down. “I’m sorry, child. When I had heard you were with the healer I feared the worst. But we have a different problem now. We can’t have this child entering the world as a páiste ceo.” Keeley held her hands over her belly and stared at the floor. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I know.” the celtling said almost inaudibly. Ilisa gave her a comforting squeeze. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How are you feeling?” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “A little scared.” Keeley rested her head on her teacher’s shoulder “I need to tell Eirik. I need him with me right now, Ilisa.” <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Liam approached the guardian on the shore and spoke. The firbolg turned to the ranger then pointed to Eirik who was sitting on a large boulder several yards away and staring off into the horizon. Liam watched the man for a few moments. The highlander did not move but continued to stare off over the water as the waves crashed loudly on the shore and around his rocky perch. The guardian began to follow Liam down to the water as the ranger approached the highlander, but was held back with a wave from the Celt. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Eirik did not respond to the ranger’s presence, Liam thought hard before addressing him. “Nice day, no?” the ranger asked trying to be heard over the gusting wind. Liam immediately chided himself for such a poor greeting. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s alright, I guess.” Eirik’s response was devoid of emotion. Liam came up beside the man and watched the water with him. The clouds were beginning to darken further and Liam could see the rain approach the village. The ranger looked at the highlander and noticed he was fidgeting with a ring. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Look, Eirik. I’m sorry I had to leave you in such a hurry. There were --” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I never thought my life would turn out quite this way.” Eirik interjected still staring at the water. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m sorry, what?” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed. That’s all.” The young man turned his attention from the water for the first time. Liam put on the kindest expression he could in an attempt to comfort his new friend. Eirik stared silently at the ranger for a moment as a light sprinkle began to blow in from the ocean. “Some of my friends are dead, Liam. The rest I’ll never get to see again. I’m stranded in a land whose customs and language I know nothing of. I’m a stranger in a strange land, and now I’m going to be a father. That is if I live through the night.” Eirik turned from his friend then climbed off the boulder. Motioning to the ocean he spoke again, “I feel like...I fee like I’ve been tossed out to sea and I’m drowning.” The waves became louder as the rain increased from a mist to a drizzle. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sounds like you need something to cling to, Eirik. A 'rock' of some sort, aye?” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eirik cracked a weak smile. “Aye.” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Keeley. Keeley is your rock, brother.&quot; Liam paused for a moment to think. &quot;Eirik, you haven't been dropped in the ocean. For us here in Hibernia life is akin to a river. From your story of how you came to be here I gather that you have simply been letting this river take you where it likes. You been through some rough moments in your life before so why the sudden desire to fight it? Ag snámh in aghaidh easa?” The highlander barely suppressed the smile in response to the ranger using his own analogy against him. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And where does this river lead, Liam?” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That I can’t tell you. Only fate knows that. But may I make a suggestion? Stop fighting it and see where it takes the two of you. You won’t be alone. This is a journey for both you and Keeley.” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eirik thought about his mother’s own journey. “And what if I lose Keeley?” he thought. “Will I suffer the same fate?” The highlander squeezed the ring in his hand until it hurt. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Eirik?” came a small voice. Liam turned around to see Keeley looking pensively at the two men. Pushing her wind-blown hair from her face, Keeley asked Liam a question. The ranger did not answer but instead turned to Eirik. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I think you had better talk to her.” Liam began walking back towards the village. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What? But I --” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You two have been speaking the same language since you met. She’ll understand you.” With the guardian in tow, the ranger left Eirik and Keeley alone on the beach. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nervously, Eirik turned to the woman who had captured his heart. The increasing rain began to soak Keeley's clothes and hair but the celtling remained standing a few feet away staring back at the father of her child. She wondered if Liam had told him. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;A páiste?&quot; the highlander asked. Keeley nodded slowly, unsure of how he felt about their new situation. Finally Eirik held out his hand for her and Keeley rushed into his arms and buried her face in his warm chest. Eirik cradled her head close and breathed a relieved sigh. The celtling felt somewhat relieved that her lover had not rejected her, but she remained nervous. Eirik's mind was whirling in the fear and uncertainty of his new life -- and the painful memories of his previous life -- when he felt Keeley moan into his chest. It was then that Eirik made his decision. Releasing his lady, Eirik held Keeley at arm's length for a moment before brushing her wet hair from her face. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Keeley?&quot; was all he asked as he opened his hand and showed her the ring. The celtling's eyes grew wide. The silvery ring gave off a blue glow for an instant as Keeley watched it shrink ever so slightly. &quot;Take it.&quot; Eirik said with a grin. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Confused, Keeley reached for the ring hesitantly. The celtling held the ring gingerly between her fingers and marveled at it for many moments. Keeley did not know what the symbols carved into the untarnished material meant, but she recognized that they were Norse in origin. Inside the ring she noticed an inscription in the Nordic language. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What does it say?” Keeley tried in vain to ask. When she finally tore her gaze from the ring she saw Eirik kneeling in front of her. “What are you doing?&quot; Eirik only smiled back in response to her words. Taking both the ring and Keeley's left hand, Eirik slipped the ring on his love's finger. The celtling forgot about the rain for a moment and stared at her husband-to-be. Looking back at the ring on her finger, Keeley fell to her knees in front her Eirik and embraced him. &quot;Pósfaidh mé tú!&quot; she whispered in his ear. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;She's too young, Eileen.&quot; Ilisa stood next to the village elder and watched her student and the highlander spar playfully in the field. Eileen smiled and uttered an amused chuckle. News of Keeley's condition and her lover's proposal had spread quickly throughout the village and had been met with near universal approval. Eileen returned her attention to the couple in question. Although still not allowed to arm himself, Eirik was engaged in a mock battle with his love; both of them were using wooden swords. Ilisa opposed the idea vehemently, but Keeley was not to be denied. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As per Ilisa's recommendations, Eirik had his hair cut quite short and allowed a traveling dye merchant to work her herbal magic on his new short tresses (Liam slipped the woman an extra gold to ensure &quot;no questions asked.&quot;). The young man's mixed heritage was almost completely hidden by the light-brown hair color. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You know what happens to most of our students when they wed?&quot; Ilisa asked rhetorically. &quot;She'll never finish her training. I just know it.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Don't worry about Keeley, Ilisa.&quot; Eileen soothed. &quot;You said yourself that there is little more you can teach her.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ilisa sighed. &quot;She has an unusual gift -- I will grant you that -- but it needs to be refined through her studies.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well her young man seems willing to help her there.&quot; Eileen quipped. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp lisa frowned and watched as Keeley performed a fluid combination of moves to evade her betrothed's latest offensive. The young blademistress's swords moved in perfect harmony with the rest of her body as the two of them not so much as fought against each other, but danced together. Ilisa was stunned when Eirik performed a vicious attack in a style she had never seen before, but her jaw nearly dropped when Keeley instinctively countered it. Eileen noticed the veteran blademistress's astonishment. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye, she is good, Ilisa. As is our new friend. Uncommonly good for one of his age.&quot; Eileen turned to her friend and smiled. Ilisa simply stared at the two combatants. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What was that? And where did she learn...?&quot; Ilisa turned to Eileen, but the druid had already disappeared. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hail, Ilisa!&quot; came a voice behind her. Ilisa turned to see Liam. &quot;Are they at it again?&quot; the ranger queried pointing to Eirik and Keeley. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye. Again.&quot; Ilisa sighed. The frustration in her voice worried the ranger. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Give it time, m'lady. I know you have your doubts but you should trust Eirik,&quot; Liam paused to let his words sink in, &quot;and Keeley.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You’re much less cynical than I.&quot; Ilisa smiled at the ranger. The woman turned and walked a little further away from Keeley and her sparring partner to a nearby tree and motioned to Liam to follow. &quot;And how about you, Liam? How are you holding up?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What do you mean?&quot; The sandy-haired Celt frowned. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh come now, Liam.&quot; Ilisa cracked a warm smile. &quot;I know how long you and Keeley have been friends and I also how deep your feelings for her run.&quot; The ranger leaned up against the tree along side Ilisa and watched Keeley for a moment before responding. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I've never seen her so happy, Ilisa. It seemed that all these years that I had known her there had been something missing from her life and now this man has filled the void. Keeley is happy and that's all that matters to me.&quot; Liam sighed. &quot;I'm just glad I could be instrumental in bringing them together even in some small way.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh so you're the one I should thank?&quot; Ilisa replied with mock anger. Liam chuckled. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'm fine, Ilisa. Really, I am.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;As you wish.&quot; The older woman sat down at the base of the tree with the ranger. &quot;You don't think he's too old?&quot; she asked looking somber. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;He's barely older than I.&quot; Liam winked at Ilisa before giving her a reassuring hug. The elder blademistress responded by ruffling the man's hair and laughing in a way she had not done so in a long time. Keeley stopped to look at the pair and smiled before continuing with her battle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cathymarie>Cathymarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#3333ff>(8/18/03 3:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=137.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Highlander and the Celt, Part 11</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Part 11</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Run, Keeley!&quot; Eirik yelled. The pair sprinted over the hill and across the field until they nearly ran out of breath. Finally tumbling to a stop in a patch of thick grass they watched behind them carefully. Over the hill a solitary spraggon made a beeline for their hiding spot. &quot;Look out, he's found us!&quot; Keeley laughed at him hysterically and Eirik immediately joined in. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When the tiny, brown creature caught up with them, Eirik stood up to avoid its meager attacks. With each swipe of its claws, the spraggon barked angrily at Eirik who managed to avoid or parry each attack. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I don't think he liked you kicking him.&quot; Keeley was now laughing so hard she could barely breathe and her face was turning red. Eirik continued his dance with the furious spraggon and just to be sure the fun continued he gave it a playful thump on the head with one of his swords. &quot;Stop it! I'm going to wet myself!&quot; the celtling managed in between fits of laughter. When she started to hiccup uncontrollably Eirik decided the game was over. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After a few more moments the spraggon realized it was never going to win and ceased its aggression. With one last bark the little fellow turned and ran off, leaving Eirik to tend to his mistress. Keeley sat up and waited for her hiccups to pass and Eirik lay down beside her with his head in her lap. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We should do that again.&quot; Keeley tried to ignore her betrothed. Her hiccups still jostling Eirik's head, Keeley tried holding her breath. &quot;Yes. Maybe a bigger one next time. One that can put up a real fight!&quot; Eirik raked the air with his hands like a pair of claws and snarled. Keeley burst into laughter again aggravating her condition. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Stop that! I will pee on you if you don't stop!&quot; Keeley thumped her lover lightly on the head to reinforce her point. Eirik smiled and got up to cradle his love from behind in hopes of expediting her recovery. As Keeley's hiccups subsided, Eirik surveyed the countryside. Since the time of his release, the former Albian had gotten to see a great deal more of Keeley's homeland and its beauty never ceased to amaze him. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Where are we now?&quot; Eirik asked. Keeley looked around for a minute and hummed. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;North of Ardagh. Just a little.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ah.&quot; Eirik continued to stare at the fields bordering patches of thin woods. &quot;God, this place is wonderful.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Didn't you have anything like it back home?&quot; Keeley immediately regretted bringing up her love's homeland. &quot;I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It's alright, mhuirnín.&quot; Eirik kissed the back of her head. &quot;No. Well, actually the Salisbury Plains are a little like this, but you wouldn't go there to relax, that is for sure.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why is that?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh...giants, wild pigs the size of giants, nymphs with giant tempers. You know: the usual fair.&quot; Keeley turned around. Her shocked expression caused Eirik to grin broadly. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No!&quot; Keeley said in shocked disbelief. &quot;You're teasing me again, aren't you?&quot; Eirik tried to keep a straight face. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No! Really! I swear I'm not making this up. Don't you have giants here?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;None that I have met,&quot; the celtling said turning around to lean back against Eirik's chest. Keeley sighed and grabbed her love's arms to wrap them tightly around her chest. The morning's clouds began to break up revealing the noon-day sun which brought with it an unusually warm late Spring afternoon. Keeley groaned as she got up. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Shall we continue?&quot; the lady blademistress asked. Eirik sat on the ground below her for a few moments then winked. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye. Let's go.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The day grew hotter as Keeley and Eirik traveled north towards Tir na Nog. By late day both were sweaty and tired. Eirik began to wonder when Keeley was planning on stopping for a break. Suddenly, the celtling gasped. Forgetting the heat, Eirik leaped in front of her and grabbed his swords. Keeley fought back another fit of laughter. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You plan on defending your lady with wooden swords?&quot; she asked. Eirik frowned. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asked. Keeley turned him around and pointed to the lake. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'm hot, and I wanna swim, silly.&quot; Eirik sheathed his useless weapon and considered his lover. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Would you please stop doing that. You're going to give me a complex. Remember that time you shrieked when you saw that pixie and I thought it was heading straight for us?&quot; the fighter scolded. Keeley giggled at the memory. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Mmmmm...she was cute, wasn't she. Now c'mon. Into the water!&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well...I'm not much of a swimmer actually.&quot; Eirik replied sheepishly. The celtling frowned then thought a moment. Facing her betrothed, Keeley slowly walked backwards towards the lake, a mischievous smile curled her lips. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I think I can make one of ye.&quot; Eirik was about to disagree but was silenced as Keeley began undressing. The celtling kicked off her boots then seductively unlaced her blouse. Panicking, Eirik looked around for any hostile beasts, or worse: patrolling sentinels. When he turned around he found Keeley at the water's edge. The young woman hooked her thumbs into the waistline of leggings and began to shimmy her hips. Nearly naked, the celtling stepped into the shallow water and let her blouse fall open revealing the faintest hint of a bulge in her tummy. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Coming?&quot; Keeley asked as she backed further into the water. Eirik approached the water and placed his hands on his hips. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You're hankerin' for a spankerin', young lady.&quot; Eirik threatened in his native tongue. Keeley simply smiled at him and let her blouse fall off completely. Grabbing it before it hit the water, the celtling tossed the blouse at Eirik. The young man caught the garment and dropped it next to the rest of her clothes then began frantically disrobing. Keeley laughed as her man fell over trying to take off his leggings. Finally free of his clothes Eirik stood on the shore. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Keeley stood in the water up to her waist and eyed her love's naked form for a moment. He was tall, but not a giant like the firbolgs she had known. She always felt he was just the right height for snuggling in his chest. The celtling's own breathing grew ragged and she motioned for him with one finger. Eirik waded slowly into the water. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ack! Cold.&quot; The naked Albian shivered slightly. Keeley gave a look of mock concern. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Mmmmm...not too cold, I hope.&quot; she said reaching for hips. &quot;Nope, not too cold at all.&quot; Keeley moaned as she pulled his head down for a deep kiss. Eirik began to repay her attentions and his hands wandered down her back to her buttocks to give them a strong squeeze. Keeley nearly yelped as his fingers tickled her sides, but Eirik silenced her with another long kiss. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Mmmph! Shore!&quot; she spoke between muffled moans into her lover's mouth. The strong man released his prize and Keeley immediately splashed to shore towing him by the hand. Once out of the water, Keeley released her love and made a dash for the trees. Eirik quickly followed and found the celtling leaning up against the moss-covered trunk of a large oak. Stopping a few yards away, the young man stood and marveled at Keeley's beauty. Her wet, blond hair was pushed back from her face and her normally pink lips were turning a deep red. Eirik approached as Keeley grabbed a low branch with one hand and thrust out her chest slightly. Her breathing was becoming almost labored and her mouth hung open slightly. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Is dócha nach bhfuil seans ar bith ann.&quot; Eirik quipped as he pulled her left knee up to his hip. Keeley shivered slightly as her love ran his hand up her outer thigh and over her navel. For the next several minutes, Eirik felt an intensity emanating from Keeley that he had never before experienced. It had been several weeks since they had an opportunity to spend some time alone and this trip to Tir na Nog had been the perfect opportunity. Keeley’s passions were animalistic but eventually the pair collapsed in a heap at the base of the tree. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What brought that on?&quot; Eirik asked as he rolled the two of them onto a soft patch of grass. The celtling did not hear him and simply cradled herself on his chest letting her senses slowly return. Eirik brushed the green moss stains off Keeley's back with a chuckle. When she finally returned to the real world, Keeley simply smiled and heaved a deep sigh. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I needed that,&quot; she said turning her head to the other side to look her love in the eye. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I’m glad I could help.&quot; The pair laughed together and rested. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Eirik?&quot; the young woman asked as she played with her ring. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Mmmm?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I've always wanted to ask you this and now you seem to know enough Gaelic...&quot; Keeley paused for a moment, not sure if she should continue. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What is it?&quot; Still naked, Eirik look up at his wife-to-be who was staring at the ring he had given her. Keeley looked nervous. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What does this say here?&quot; The celtling pointed to the inscription on the inside of the ring. Eirik sat up and hugged her close. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, to be honest, I don't know.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You don't know?&quot; Keeley sounded astonished. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No. I've never found anyone who could translate it for me. It's a very old, archaic Norse language.&quot; Eirik took the ring for a moment and inspected it. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Where did you get it.&quot; Eirik did not respond immediately to Keeley’s question and became distant. &quot;I'm sorry, Eirik. Shite! I really...&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No, Keeley, it's alright, honestly. I think you should know.&quot; Eirik sighed. &quot;My mother gave it to me.&quot; Keeley stroked the back of her love's head. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What happened to her?&quot; Eirik smiled weakly in response to the foreseen question and stared at the ground for a moment. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This was a month to the day after my father had died from his illness. My mother had been grief-stricken the entire time. I was ten summers old and didn't know what do to. That night she came into my room just before I fell asleep and kissed me. Then she just slipped the ring onto my finger and left.&quot; Eirik's tears betrayed the sadness behind his stoic demeanor and Keeley's eyes began to well up in sympathy. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The next morning some of our friends came to wake me up to tell me my mother's body had been found in the Sauvage forest. She had been killed by her former countrymen.&quot; Eirik looked up at Keeley finally. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Eirik, I'm so sorry.&quot; Keeley tried to comfort her love and hugged him close. Eirik sighed into her naked bosom. &quot;Was she trying to go home?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No. She wanted to die. My mother didn't want to live without my father. He was the whole world to her. The guards remember her walking blindly out into the forest. They said they tried to warn her but she didn't seem to hear them.&quot; Keeley had no words for Eirik and just held him close and stroked his hair. Eirik tried to break away. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It's alright, Keeley.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No it isn't, Eirik. It's a terrible thing to happen. But I'm here to share your grief, aye?&quot; Eirik smiled at his love which lifted Keeley's spirits slightly. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye. Thank you.&quot; The two embraced for a long time before speaking. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So why did she give you her ring?&quot; Keeley finally asked. &quot;Was is significant to her in some way? <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I’m not sure why she gave it to me, but yes, it was very significant to her. She used to tell me the story of how the ring had been passed from mother to daughter for more generations than anyone could remember. But my mother had no daughter.&quot; Eirik stopped telling his story for a moment to reflect on the statement. &quot;Only me.&quot; The young man wiped his eyes. &quot;When I learned more about the Norse gods I began to wonder if Eir had punished my mother in this way for leaving her order.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eirik faced Keeley and tried to smile. The celtling did her best to console her love. &quot;So the line was broken?&quot; she asked. Eirik brightened up a little. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;But now I give you the ring. Perhaps we can begin a new tradition.&quot; Keeley gave Eirik a kiss. &quot;I have a feeling she would have loved you as a daughter.&quot; Keeley blushed and tears began to leak from her eyes again. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Keeley?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;May I ask you about your parents?&quot; Keeley wiped her eyes and smiled. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I suppose it's only fair.&quot; she chuckled lightly. &quot;There was a plague in the land many years ago. Not many people survived. They died when the sickness swept across Connla.&quot; Eirik was stunned by his love’s bluntness. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I-I don’t know what to say to that. What do you remember?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Images mostly. I was only two. They were a very happy couple…and young. Ilisa told me that my mother was not yet seventeen seasons when I was born. She was the daughter of a fisherman and my father was actually from Caille, or so they tell me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Eirik queried. Keeley stopped stroking his hair and let her hand fall from his head to his chest. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well...the village was wiped out almost entirely by the plaque. Very few people remained. I was one of them. Not many people remember much about my father, or my mother for that matter. Connla used to be a very transient village.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Keeley smiled genuinely at Eirik. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It's fine, Eirik. I'm glad I can finally tell you, though. There is no need to dwell on the past. What I want is right here in the present, anyway,&quot; she said giving him a squeeze. Eirik chuckled at her and pulled her on top of him for a long hug. &quot;I love you, Eirik!&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I know.&quot; he replied. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Can I ask you something else?&quot; the celtling asked sitting up on top of her love. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You're going to use up your questions fast if you keep this up!&quot; he laughed. Keeley frowned at him. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey! I’ve barely been able to ask you anything since we met, and you haven't been able to answer me anything either!&quot; she scolded mockingly. &quot;I don't care what the answer is; I just want to know.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ask away, mhuirnín.&quot; Eirik ran his hands down her shoulders and held Keeley's hands as she looked down at him. The celtling bit her lip nervously. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Am I your first?&quot; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;That man is up to something, mark my words.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye, sir.&quot; replied Rhodri's lieutenant. Captain Rhodri climbed the steps of Snowdonia Fortress followed closely by a second man shrouded in a dark cloak. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This plan of his makes very little sense. It will eat up resources and men needed to defend the borderlands. And the fact that J'nar has asked me to be in charge reeks of some treachery.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;But did the council not decide that, captain?&quot; Rhodri sneered before answering. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;J'nar has a hold on them. I have no proof, but I am sure of that. Never trust a mage; especially one from the Guild of Shadows. In fact: never trust anyone from the Guild of Shadows. Do you understand? They have only their self interest in their thoughts and plans.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye, sir. What shall we do now.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We have no choice.&quot; Rhodri replied. &quot;I cannot go against the council without proof of treason. We must follow their orders and begin the build up.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye, sir.&quot; At the door to his barracks, Rhodri turned around and spoke in hushed tones to man. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Speak nothing of this. You understand? You're the only one I trust, Cresil. Keep your eyes open at all times. Don't fail me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;As you wish, sir.&quot; replied the lieutenant. Once Rhodri closed the door, Cresil quickly disappeared down the steps and into the night. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'm nervous. Very, very nervous.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You'll do fine.&quot; Liam whispered to Eirik. The pair stood next to a fountain that radiated a soft light that cast a beautiful golden glow throughout Druid's Grove. &quot;All you have to do is be here.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'm just worried that someone is going to notice me for what I am!&quot; Eirik hissed back. &quot;Oh God, why did she have to have the wedding in Tir na Nog?&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Recognize you as what? A nervous groom?&quot; Liam grinned. &quot;Anyway trust me. You are not going to be the focus of attention here.&quot; Eirik gave a contemptuous huff and straightened up. Despite his nervousness he still managed to notice the grand beauty of Hibernia's capital city. So intrigued by the city’s buildings and markets that Eirik had almost forgotten why he was there, and when the time came Liam had to pry the incognito fighter away from a puppet bard and her entourage. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eirik looked around the grove. It was late evening and the sun had just set. Several bards were playing music as guests sat themselves. Eirik recognized most as being from the village, but there were quite a few folk stumbling in, obviously looking for a celebration with which to begin their night’s festivities. In front of Eirik and Liam stood Lady Eileen who had insisted on performing the wedding: a ceremony that Eirik did not fully understand in his own land let alone Hibernia. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Tell me again what I do when Keeley arrives.&quot; Eirik whispered to Liam. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You shut up and try to look handsome for a change,&quot; Liam laughed. Eirik thought about the translation for a moment then jabbed the ranger in the ribs. Liam responded with a smack to the back of Eirik’s head and the pair began a small scuffle. Eileen had to restrain the two before Keeley arrived. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The bards suddenly stopped their music and a single bard took up a new song on her lute. Eirik straightened up when he saw Keeley enter the grove and walk slowly towards them. The Albian could hardly believe his eyes. Keeley wore a sheer white dress that was only draped over her body and when she passed before a torch Eirik could see the outline of her naked body beneath. Liam grinned and leaned over to Eirik. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You lucky little scamp.&quot; he said. Eileen hushed the ranger before Keeley could hear any more. Eirik just stared open-mouthed. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;She’s beautiful,&quot; was the only thought in his head. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the couple together, Eileen bound their hands together with a leafy vine and began the ceremony. Eirik remembered very little and, before he knew it, the two of them were wed on the summer solstice and the celebration had begun. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;They’re drunk and having fun. Even if they knew who you were I don’t think they would care,&quot; Keeley laughed. Eirik had become nervous throughout the night. Some of the female patrons even insisted on dancing with him and Keeley would not let her husband refuse. Eirk could only oblige a large, furry dancing companion. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Let’s not test your theory, shall we?&quot; Eirik replied. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By early morning The reception had moved to a large tavern on the edge of the city and Eirik was confronted on all sides by elves, lurikeen, filbolgs, as well as celts. Some of the guest were armed which added to Eirik’s discomfort. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;How much longer are we staying?&quot; Eirik asked. Keeley had grown tired herself, but sidled up to her husband and began to sway. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Mmmmm…not long. Just give me one more dance.&quot; Eirik could tell his bride was not going to be denied and accepted his fate. The dance was a fast-paced, happy jig and Eirik had trouble keeping up, but in the end he found himself having more fun than he could remember. Once the dance was finished and the crowd finished its drunken applause, the bride and groom snuck out of the tavern to their inn. With a wink the innkeeper showed the couple to their room and left. Eirik grabbed his wife from behind and gave her a squeeze. <br>
<br>
&quot;I’m going to wash up, Keeley. Are you going to wait for me?&quot; Eirik winked at his bride. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I’ll be right here, my sweet.&quot; As he disengaged, the celtling tugged on his sleeve for a quick kiss. When Eirik returned Keeley was not in the room. Looking around, Eirik found a balcony beyond some curtains and stared up at the moon. However his celestial observations was interrupted by a light snore. Looking down, Eirik saw his sleeping bride curled up in a very large cushioned chair at the end of the balcony. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Poor girl.&quot; He whispered. Eirik gathered a light blanket. Soon the highlander and the celt were curled up together on the chair and sleeping peacefully under the stars.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cathymarie>Cathymarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#3333ff>(8/18/03 3:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=137.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Highlander and the Celt, Part 12</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Part 12</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
        “Are you sure you want to head back tomorrow?” Keeley looked up from her writing. Eirik, her husband, stood in the doorway. Their room at the small inn in Caille had been their home for the last three weeks but had been decorated by the couple as though it was meant to be permanent. Keeley had replaced the curtains over the windows with ones she had found at the local market and Eirik had placed the skins of two large beasts on the floor and the bed to stave off the cold of the Autumn. The innkeeper had protested loudly when Keeley's husband wanted to mount the heads on the wall, but Eirik placated his anger by promising to donate them when they left. <br>
<br>
        Keeley stared in silence at her husband for a moment. Against her initial wishes Eirik had grown a beard to keep his face warm against the cold weather, but the young woman had quickly grown accustomed to prickly feeling on her lips and cheek and even enjoyed the scratchy growth rubbing her thighs. Keeley smiled at the memory then turned back to her quill and paper to finish her thoughts. <br>
<br>
        “Aye, I would like our child to be born in my home. Besides, our business here is finished and I think we can make it back to Connla safely before any winter storms.” Keeley finished her work and closed the book. Tucking the skillfully bound tome in her pack, the Celt woman tried to stand up. Seeing her struggle, Eirik rushed to his wife's aid. Keeley smiled up at him as he guided her to the bed. The oil lamps on the bed stands illuminated a sexy silhouette of her bloated form through her thin nightgown. <br>
<br>
        At nearly full term, Keeley's pregnancy made even the most mundane tasks difficult. She had always enjoyed her journal but lately she could not sit at her desk for more than a short while before the aches began. Keeley lay on her back in the large bed and Eirik tried to cover her with the warm blankets and furs before she stopped him. <br>
<br>
        “I'm too warm,” she protested. Eirik smiled and snuggled up beside her. Lifting her gown to expose her body, the young man ran his hands over her firm belly then down over her legs to give his wife her nightly massage. Eirik worked on Keeley's feet before moving up to her calves and thighs. The Celt moaned and closed her eyes. She had always loved the selfless attention her husband would show her constantly due to her pregnancy, however this time she suspected he had ulterior motives. <br>
<br>
        As hard as it was for Keeley to believe him, Eirik never failed to make her feel sexy. Her husband's libido seemed to thrive off her pregnancy and in fact both of their passions had grown over the last few months. However tonight Keeley felt too tired and sore to perform her wifely duties. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I don't want to hurt his feelings</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she thought to herself. Keeley opened her eyes to see her love's concentration fixed on her rounded tummy. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mmmm...perhaps not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
        The young woman pulled her husband up the bed for a long, luxurious kiss then, with a twinkle in her eye, shuffled down the bed. As best she could, Keeley began a massage of her own. Her dexterous fingers worked their way up Eirik's leg to his groin. There Keeley found that her original assumptions as to her husband's intentions to be incorrect, however her actions quickly brought life to the previously dormant area. Keeley grinned at her mistake. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Oh how I LOVE this man. Oh well. No sense in letting this go to waste. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
        “Come here, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>daddy!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” <br>
<br>

<br>
        “Keeley?” <br>
<br>
        “Mmmm?” the Celt woman answered. <br>
<br>
        “I was thinking about names for our child. I was thinking 'Peter' would be a grand name. Or, if by some chance it is a girl: 'Avie.' It's getting awful close. We don't want our child born without a name, do we?” Eirik grinned. By this time Keeley had propped herself up on her elbows and was giving her husband a queer look. The two stared at each other for a moment before Keeley's giggling broke the silence. Seeing the hurt look on Eirik's face, she quickly stopped. <br>
<br>
        “Oh. You were serious.” Eirik began to panic. His confusion indicated to Keeley that she needed to explain. “I'm sorry, dear. I thought you knew. We don't name a newborn child...” <br>
<br>
        “What?!” Eirik was even more confused. Thoughts of pagan ritual infanticide crept into his head and his confusion turned to panic. <br>
<br>
        “Wait, let me finish.” Keeley laid back down and pulled her husband closer to feel the entire length of his naked body against hers. “We don't name a newborn child. It's...” Keeley paused trying to search for a simple way to explain, “it's more the child tells you their name.” Eirik still looked confused. Keeley sighed. “It's probably hard for you to understand because you haven't been so close to her all these months. When she's born you'll understand; it will be like magic to you...and to me.” Keeley nuzzled Eirik's bristly face and brought his arm to the base of her swollen belly to cradle their unborn child. Eirik stroked the underside of his wife's belly and felt a small pang of sadness. But a realization suddenly hit him. <br>
<br>
        “What do you mean 'she'?” he asked, sitting up abruptly. Keeley, her eye's closed, grinned. <br>
<br>
        “Did I say 'she'?” <br>
<br>
        “What do you mean 'she'?” he asked again. Keeley opened her eyes and bit her lower lip. <br>
<br>
        “I wanted it to be a surprise. Yes, sweetheart: we're going to have a daughter.” Eirik was dumbfounded. <br>
<br>
        “How...how long have you known?” <br>
<br>
        “A couple months now. You're not mad are you?” Keeley looked worried. <br>
<br>
        “No. No, of course not.” Eirik nearly laughed. The joy on his face was immeasurable. “How do you know?” The young Celt woman smiled and looked thoughtful. <br>
<br>
        “Oh, different mothers-to-be find out in different ways. Me? I'm certain we're having a girl because I saw her in a dream.” Keeley eyes seemed to focus beyond the ceiling. “She was beautiful, Eirik. And strong. But most important she was full of love.” Eirik stared at his wife who seemed to be in a trance as she continued to describe their daughter while rubbing her own belly absentmindedly. Keeley suddenly broke from her reverie and looked at Eirik to gage his reaction. The father of her child was staring intently at her belly, his face a mixture of concentration and confusion. “What is it?” <br>
<br>
        “What? Oh. It's...it's nothing.” Eirik snapped out of his own trance and curled back up against his wife. “My God.” he thought out loud. “You know so much. Is there anything else I'm missing out on?” <br>
<br>
        “Oh just the agonizing pain of childbirth. Would you like a taste of that, too?” Keeley laughed. Eirik could not help but groan at falling into her trap. <br>
<br>
        The next morning the pair departed from Caille. Eirik insisted on purchasing a horse and cart so his wife could travel in some semblance of comfort and the inn-keeper was only too happy to sell them what they desired. The air was cold that morning but the warming sun had begun to creep over the hills. <br>
<br>
        “Up ye go, lass.” Eirik helped his pregnant wife into the cart then finished loading the rest of their supplies into the back. <br>
<br>
        “Are ye sure ye won't be needin' anything else?” the innkeeper asked. <br>
<br>
        “No, that should be all.” Eirik climbed onto the cart next to his wife. The innkeeper finished checking their horse's bindings. <br>
<br>
        “Well, safe travels to ye, and blessings to the baby.” <br>
<br>
        “Fare thee well, sir!” Keeley called out as they departed. The innkeeper watched for several minutes until the cart had disapeared down the road then turned around in time to see several arrows flying towards him. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
        “It has begun, my lord.” J'nar turned to the speaker. <br>
<br>
        “Excellent. How far ahead are they?” <br>
<br>
        “About half a day.” Cresil replied. <br>
<br>
        “We shall leave at once. You know the plan?” <br>
<br>
        “Aye, m'lord.” J'nar smiled at his subordinate and turned back to the window. <br>
<br>
        “This will be a great day indeed, Cresil. You don't know how long I've waited to be rid of that man. And to think he will be the instrument of his own destruction.” The ancient avalonian began to cackle. The infiltrator simply stood quietly. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
        “What's that?” Keeley asked. <br>
<br>
        “I don't know.” Eirik, too, heard the rumbling off in the distance. Eirik and Keeley had made good time and were nearing the halfway point of their journey. But before they reached Mag Mell, the noise had begun. It sounded like thunder but the sky was almost clear. Suddenly another rumbling shook the ground. “That's odd.” <br>
<br>
        “No, it's from behind us this time. Look!” Eirik turned to look at what his wife had seen. Behind them a dozen or so of Hibernia's defenders were charging on horseback towards their cart. Keeley tried to catch their attention as they passed. “What's going on?” she yelled over the din. And elf maiden slowed down beside them. Eirik tried to understand the hasty explanation, but all he heard was “Albion” and “attack.” Keeley's face turned white. <br>
<br>
        “Keeley! What's going on?!” Eirik's wife looked frantic. <br>
<br>
        “No! Eirik, we have to get to Tir na Nog!” <br>
<br>
        “Why? What's happening?” <br>
<br>
        “Just go! Quickly!” Keeley was nearly in tears. Eirik whipped their horse into a gallop. The riders had passed the cart and were far ahead when the pair round the hill and the city came into view. Eirik could not believe what he saw. Tir na Nog was in flames. Several orange fireballs erupted from the woods north of the city and streamed towards the towers. A group of Hibernia fighters charged the area but were met by plated soldiers, some bearing the crests of Eirik's old company. Keeley jumped from the cart and tried to run to the city, but Eirik grabbed her when he saw more Albion soldiers filing in from the north. “No! Let me go!” Keeley screamed. <br>
<br>
        “Keeley, wait!” Eirik grabbed her and pulled her back. Keeley struggled to break from his grasp but Eirik held his wife up against the side of the cart. <br>
<br>
        “We have to help them!” Eirik turned her around and showed her the soldiers not two hundred yards away who were setting up ballistas. <br>
<br>
        “We can't! There's too many of them!” Eirik watched as three more groups were swallowed up in the Albion zerg. “There's nothing we can do here. We must get word to the south.” Keeley's eyes pleaded to her husband. Before she could say another word the ground beside the cart was ripped apart by a wizard's fireball. Eirik shielded Keeley as best he could but the horse was spooked and broke free of the cart. Eirik check his wife for injuries. “Keeley! Are you alright?” All Keeley did was wince in pain and suddenly Eirik found his boots drenched by her water. <br>
<br>
        “Páiste!” she cried. No! Not the baby, Eirik's mind screamed <br>
<br>
        “Keeley! Is the baby hurt?” Keeley just shook her head and clenched her eyes shut. <br>
<br>
        “The baby...she's coming.” <br>
<br>
        “What? How...?” <br>
<br>
        “It doesn't matter. She's coming now!” Keeley finally opened her eyes. “Look out!” Eirik ducked in time to miss being decapitated by a paladin's sword. Taking advantage of the soldier' s fumbled attack, Eirik flipped his attacker's visor open and sent his fist through the opening. Stunned, the armored warrior staggered backwards a few steps allowing Eirik to knock the sword from his hands. A muffled scream emanated from the paladin's helmet as the ex-mercenary shoved the blade through the tough breast plate. <br>
<br>
        Keeley watched in horror as her husband yanked the crimson blade out of the paladin's chest. Finally shaking off her fear, Keeley pulled herself up to retrieve her own blades from the cart as the paladin's companions drew closer. Eirik cursed his lack of proper armor or weapons but before he had time to think an assassin sprung out from behind a bush. Eirik barely managed to deflect the initial blows. The Saracen Warder quickly switched weapons and spun around with his new blade leading the way. Eirik parried the first attack but the assassin's second blade nicked his forearm. Even though he could feel the burning, Eirik knew the wound was not deep enough to give the poison a chance to work its way further. The two men continued to duel but before Keeley could come to Eirik's aid another soldier charged on her. <br>
<br>
        Keeley steadied herself and stood poised for a counter attack with her twin short swords at the ready. The kilted fighter wore no helmet and the Celtling could see the cruel glee in his eyes as he bore down on her with his pike aimed straight for her heart. As the invader neared her position, Keeley's womb contracted sharply causing her to scream. All three combatants in the area paused for a moment. The armsman who was about to attack the Celt woman hesitated in confusion since he had yet to touch her and Eirik seized upon the opportunity. Before the infiltrator could turn his attention back to him, he felt Eirik's booted foot plant itself squarely in his groin. Th diminutive man's eyes rolled back into his head as he dropped to the ground. Running the Saracen through and taking one of his stilettos Eirik turned his attention to Keeley's attacker. <br>
<br>
        With two weapons, Eirik was now more in his element. The armsman stood little chance as the dual-wielding fighter worked his blades between the gaps in his armor. Just as Eirik felled the armsman, the final member of the group arrived and dismounted from her horse. Eirik was taken aback when this new chain-armored fighter produced a whip. <br>
<br>
        “Arawanite!” he growled. The woman merely smirked and lashed her weapon across Eirik's chest. Eirik winced in response to the wound but quickly recovered and flew into a furious attack. The ex-mercenary put on a mighty display of two-bladed skill but the reaver held him at bay with her shield. Stepping back to rethink his strategy, Eirik dodged the woman's whip once more before attempting a head-on charge. This time he managed to grab her weapon hand but the reaver slid her shield between them before he could bring the stiletto home to her mid section. Eirik used the momentum of his attack to force the woman backwards against a tree. The two struggled against each other in vain and, throughout it all, the woman continued to grin at Eirik almost maniacally. Casually the reaver leaned her head in close and ran her tongue up Eirik's cheek obscenely. Horrified, Eirik broke off his attack and checked himself for poison. The woman responded with mocking laughter after licking her lips in satisfaction. <br>
<br>
        “Damn you, woman!” Eirik's flawless curse in the woman's own language erased her smile. The fighter charged in taking advantage of the reaver's confusion, but her skill with her shield proved a difficult obstacle. Eirik was getting nowhere until suddenly the woman stiffened. Opening her mouth in a silent scream the reaver fell to the ground revealing Keeley standing behind her holding two bloody swords. <br>
<br>
        “Just die.” the Celt whispered to the dying woman. Keeley dropped her weapons and turned around. Tir na Nog's defenders were losing the battle. More of Hibernia's finest were arriving from the south but their numbers were too small to make a difference. Both of them watched as another one of the city's grand spires crumpled under the onslaught of fireballs. “How did this happen?” Keeley spoke softly then held her stomach and winced. Eirik rushed to hold her. <br>
<br>
        “We must leave.” Keeley simply nodded stoically and grabbed a bag of her belongings off the cart. Eirik wrangled the dead reaver's horse and hefted his wife up into its saddle. <br>
<br>
        “To Hy Brasil, then. We'll be safe there.” <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
        “Almost there, Keeley” The pair had abandoned their mount when it became clear it was not going to make it all the way to the portal. It was dusk by the time they had reached the edge of Shannon Estuary and a light snow had begun falling. On foot, they could hear the Albion forces closing in and Keeley's frequent contractions made travel even slower. “There's the bridge! We've made it!” Breathless, Eirik and Keeley ran for the crossing but not before a fireball hit the ground beside them. <br>
<br>
        Eirik was thrown back as Keeley was thrust forward onto the bridge. Dazed, Eirik managed to get up. Keeley tried to run to him but another orange ball of flame ripped across the bridge setting it aflame. Eirik saw they were cut off from one another. “Keeley! Run!” <br>
<br>
        “Eirik!” The Celt woman did not run from her husband. <br>
<br>
        “Go!” Eirik pleaded for his wife to get to the portal but it was too late. Another bolt of flame hit the bridge blasting most of it into the water. Eirik stood and stared. Keeley was nowhere in sight. “No.” His lament was almost inaudible. <br>
<br>
        “You!” Eirik spun around to face the source of the accusation. Before him, having witnessed everything, stood Ilisa brandishing her crescent swords. The blademistress stood out starkly against the snow-covered ground; the flames from the burning bridge illuminating her dark blue armor. “You did this! I don't know how you led them here, but I’ll see to it you die for this!” <br>
<br>
        “Ilisa, no! Wait!” But Eirik's protests were in vain. The outer signs of her rage disappeared as the Bladesong poised herself for attack then leaped at Eirik with both blades flying. Eirik ducked and repositioned himself away from the bank as Ilisa recovered from her initial attack. Turning around, the elder blademistress was met by a puff of dirt which she had come to expect after years in the defense of Hibernia. Ducking the dirty fighting technique easily, Ilisa dove into the fight with a ferocity Eirik had never witnessed before in an oppenent. Eirik continued to plead with her to stop but she paid no attention; giving herself over fully to her training. <br>
<br>
        Eirik tried hard to ward off her blows, but her superior skill and experience proved more than a match. Unaccustomed to his current weapons Eirik was pushed further and further back until he realized the futility of his defensive strategy. Slapping away a twin-bladed attack, Eirik slipped in closer and swiped at Ilisa's belly. The woman leapt out of the way as Eirik expected and brought his stiletto to pierce her flank. But Ilisa had seen this move before. Seeing her opening, Ilisa flipped her right blade around and slashed upwards across Eirik's face catching him in his left eye. The young man dropped his stolen stiletto crying out in pain and clutching his eye. The blademistress closed in for the kill just as yet another fireball landed between the combatants. <br>
<br>
        Eirik bore the full brunt of the explosion which sent him flying several yards away and landing hard on the ground. Slightly dazed and missing one of her blades, Ilisa brushed the dirt from her face and picked herself up off the ground. She saw her opponent lying unmoving on the ground a short distance in front of her. <br>
<br>
        “D'anam don diabhal,” she cursed and spat in his direction. Ilisa sheathed her remaining sword and turned around to cross the water only to step right into an assassin's blades. The attack pierced the arteries in her neck and Ilisa grabbed at her throat in an attempt to stem the flow of blood. The Briton female stepped back and prepared for her next attack, but Ilisa staggered backwards a couple of steps before slumping to the ground as the poisons stole the life from her body. The infiltrator cautiously poked at the woman to be sure she was dead. Satisfied, she made the signal. <br>
<br>
        “All clear, sir!” Out of the trees, a soldier in officer's plate approached the spot where Eirik lay. The soldier examined the man for a moment then prodded him with his boot. Eirik was slipping in and out of consciousness and could only groan softly in response. Looking up with his one good eye he saw the armsman staring down at him through the slit in his helmet. After a moment of silence, the soldier removed his helmet and tossed it to the infiltrator. <br>
<br>
        “Mercenary. Surprised to see me?” All Eirik could do was lay beneath the captain in pain. He brought his hand back up to hold his wounded eye and Rhodri laughed. “Once again, mercenary, I've found you in a rather difficult position. Only this time,” he paused, “I don't think I can save you.” Eirik clenched his eye shut and felt the pain of his loss and exile as well as the physical pain from his wounds. In the blink of an eye he grabbed Rhodri's ankle and flung his foot out from beneath him. Unbalanced in his plate armor, Rhodri fell to the ground beside his captive. Eirik found Ilisa's second sword with his right hand and swung it down onto his former captain. The blade cut through his armor like butter, piercing the man's heart. Before Rhodri's life ended, Eirik leaned over him and last thing he saw was the one-eye, bloodied face of his former servant. <br>
<br>
        “Then I'll have to save myself, you son of a bitch.” Eirik gave the blade in his chest an extra push, sending Rhodri to his death. The infiltrator that had witnessed everything was stunned by the ferocity of the attack but she soon recovered from the shock and drew her weapons. <br>
<br>
        “Hold, assassin!” came a voice from the shadows. The infiltrator paused. Before her approached an elderly mage flanked by two cloaked figures. Ignoring them she advanced on the prone fighter preparing to avenge the death of her captain. “I said 'hold', Katherine!” Startled, the woman examined her caller more closely before recognizing him as the leader of the guild of shadows. J'nar smirked waiting for her next move. Torn between loyalties, the rogue stood in fear for a moment before standing down and sheathing her weapons. “Very good.” J'nar spoke. <br>
<br>
        “We will take care of this, if you please, lieutenant” Cresil spoke and watched the young infiltrator hesitate before slinking off into the shadows. Cresil motioned to his companion to followed her. When both he and the girl were gone, Cresil took up a guarding position while his liege approached Eirik. <br>
<br>
        “Well, my boy, it looks as though I have even more for which to thank you. You have just taken care of a big problem of mine and in a way I could not have done better.” J'nar looked over Rhodri's corpse. “Looks to me that our fine Captain was killed in battle with the forces of Hibernia. Wouldn't you say so, Cresil?” The assassin only stood silently beside his lord. J'nar chuckled at him before turning back to Eirik. “You have worked so hard all these years and without even knowing it. So here is you reward, boy.” The ancient cabalist raised his staff over Eirik's head. Eirik tried to shield himself from the blinding light that followed. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
        In the Grove of Domnann the peaceful air was pierced by the sounds of a woman in labor. In the hollow trunk of one of the great trees, several Sylvans tended to the wounded, pregnant woman brought to them by the ranger. Liam held Keeley's hand tightly as another contraction approached. The young woman screamed in pain. <br>
<br>
        “She is badly injured,” one of the natives told the ranger. <br>
<br>
        “Tell me something I don't know, dammit! Help her!” The Sylvan woman sighed and placed a reassuring hand on Liam's shoulder. <br>
<br>
        “We are doing everything we can,” she spoke in soothing tones. Liam heard someone call his name and looked up to see Romana running up the stairs. <br>
<br>
        “Liam! What happened?” Romana grabbed Keeley's other hand opposite the ranger. Liam looked into Keeley's eyes which were wide with terror. <br>
<br>
        “She was thrown into the water. I managed to get her out and through the portal.” <br>
<br>
        “And Eirik?” the young guardian asked. Keeley's gaze switched from Romana back to Liam. Liam did not answer. <br>
<br>
        “Eirik! Where's Eirik?” Keeley screamed as she felt another contraction. When Keeley was not looking Liam shook his head at Romana sadly. <br>
<br>
        “Eirik!” Keeley cried out again. “Where's Eirik?” <br>
<br>
        “Eirik will be here soon,” Liam told her despite his lack of hope for her husband's safe return. The Sylvan woman held Keeley's head and tried to calm her. <br>
<br>
        “Keeley, your baby needs you now.” The Sylvan's words played on Keeley's ears like a lullaby. Keeley let out another shriek as her child began to crown. “Good. Good. Now another push, Keeley. You can do it.” Liam and Romana both felt Keeley squeeze their hands tightly to the point of pain. Keeley released her breath and gasped for air. A few seconds later an infant's cry was heard and a tall Sylvan woman placed Keeley's newborn on her chest. Keeley's face grew calm and she released her companions' hands to hold her child. The world around her seemed to stop as the baby girl opened her eyes and looked up at her mother. The Celt woman's face shone pure bliss. <br>
<br>
        “H-hello,” Keeley paused for breath, “Abaigeal.” Liam stole a glance at Romana who could barely hold back her tears. <br>
<br>
        Keeley took the towel handed her and swaddled her newborn. The red light that emanated from the room's magical sconces was gentle on Abaigeal's brown eyes allowing her to survey her mother's face. Keeley held her child close to her skin and mother and child delighted in each other's touch. Quickly, Abaigeal latched on to her mother's nipple and savored her first taste of her mother's milk. <br>
<br>
        “Liam,” Keeley whispered to the ranger. Liam listened close as his friend's words trailed off. <br>
<br>
        “Keeley?” Liam urged the young woman back into consciousness but it was no use. Abaigeal began to cry just as Lady Eileen entered the room. <br>
<br>
        “M'lady! You must help her!” the ranger pleaded with the elderly druid. Eileen crouched next to Keeley and placed her hands on both her and her child and closed her eyes. After a few deathly silent moments, Eileen opened her eyes and shook her head. <br>
<br>
        “I am sorry, Liam. I cannot. Her spirit has traveled too far from this world and does not seem to wish to return. Perhaps for what she is looking is not here.” Romana came to Liam's side and held him as his tears broke. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
        Keeley's body was interred in secret in Hy Brasil. An ancient Sylvan shaman cast several wards around the site as Eileen performed the ceremony. “These spells will keep the fauna at bay.” The old tree-man spoke in a gravely voice. “They will keep her earthly vessel safe for as long as needed.” A dark mood permeated the unremarkable ring of trees. Liam and Romana watched the ceremony in silence. The young woman carried Abaigeal who slept peacefully in the guardian's arms. Back at the Grove, Eileen spoke. <br>
<br>
        “Any sign of the others, Seril?” The portal guardian shook her head. “Then we can only assume Ilisa and Eirik did not survive.” Eileen paused for several moments in contemplation before she heaved a heavy sigh. “Close it,” she commanded evenly. Liam protested but Eileen silenced him and addressed the guardian again. With a solemn wave of her hand, the portal's energies dissipated and only the sounds of bird chirping in the early morning dawn could be heard. Liam and Romana followed Eileen back into the settlement. <br>
<br>
        “What happened, Eileen?” The elderly druid knew this question to be on everyone's mind. She motioned for them to follow. <br>
<br>
        “We do not know for sure, Liam. Albion's forces found a weakness in our frontier gates. Druim Ligen was the first to fall. Only Glasny survived and she has yet to shed any light on the subject. The Albion army is sweeping down the land killing all those who resist.” <br>
<br>
        “Then we are safe here in the Sylvan's home,” Romana tried to assure herself as much as others. She looked down and gently rocked the sleeping Abaigeal. “Safe, but trapped,” she told the child. Eileen turned to the fair-haired woman. <br>
<br>
        “We are neither safe nor trapped. It will only be a matter of time before Albion learns the secrets of the portal. Once they do this place will be flooded with their kind and all of the defenders who made it here to supposed safety will be wiped out.” Eileen sighed and continued walking. “We must speak with Glasny. There is only one place we can go.” <br>
