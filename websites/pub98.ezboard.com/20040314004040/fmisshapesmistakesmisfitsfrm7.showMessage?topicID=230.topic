<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">freaking craziest day today:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
wake up semi-late<br>
<br>
waking up superass hungry and nearly droping to a bad blood sugar level<br>
<br>
mom talks to me about laundry and saying sorry and stuff<br>
<br>
last week she’d thrown clothes on my bed and I'd assumed they were merely unfolded, but ive really been wearing dirty clothes for the last week. They didn’t smell…<br>
<br>
trying to get audiograbber for mark and crazyness there with some downloading program<br>
<br>
having to turn off washer to take shower then having to come back after picking up kristy  to turn it back on b/c i forgot even though I'd made a specific point to turn it back on before I left.<br>
<br>
i nearly died going down the stairs when i slipped on this slick rug thing the family put down so the dog doesnt dirty up the newly cleaned carpet. i held onto the very pointy post at the bottom of the stairs and really raked my arm. it hurt a lot.<br>
<br>
having to go freaking slow all day to conserve gas<br>
<br>
kristy holding this bananna peel for the whole ride there<br>
<br>
sitting in the vending area and her being addicted to games, the obnoxious guy at another table and a hilarious black dude<br>
<br>
obnoxious dude not coming to class. awesome!<br>
<br>
talking to the math teacher a little more personally about his blocks and stuff. nice guy, but really weird.<br>
<br>
not being able to find kristy in the library and the ladies there being bitches about telling me if she came though. as if it were some huge secret as to who was in the library. i didnt even have to see the list, just tell me if she did or didnt come though. but NOOOO! guess whos getting the evil eye everytime i come through!!!<br>
<br>
finding kristy &quot;reading her driver's manual,&quot; but she was sitting in front of the tv in the vending area even though i'd already looked in there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     'nudge nudge' just kidding. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
eating sandwich in the car while driving trying to figure out where the IMA was<br>
<br>
kristy wanting to go get pizza before going to the museum. im sure it had something to do with some traumatic experience with nearly starving to death in a museum or whatever...hah.<br>
<br>
getting lost and going back to ivy tech for directions<br>
<br>
not being able to find any security guards anywhere but this one that i &quot;interrupted a business transaction&quot; of his<br>
<br>
him repeating the directions a million times. it nice to get decent directions (which these werent), but i dont need them a million times over.<br>
<br>
eventually finding the IMA, but going past it and then going back to find somewhere to eat lunch<br>
<br>
finding a burger king, turning left to go back over to the right, but once in the intersection realizeing that the other side of the street turned into a one way after it was too late to do anything about it. thank GOD no one was turning left b/c i'd have been really screwed.<br>
<br>
getting into burger king and her paying for my whopper because i have literally no money. i'll get everyone back as soon as my job starts up again. which is SOON!<br>
<br>
i got a cup of ice for my dr pepper i brought with me<br>
<br>
some lady coming up to me asking if i &quot;could do her a favor&quot; &quot;um...if by that you mean money, i havnt got any....really.&quot; &quot;no, do you have a cigarette?&quot; &quot;.......no&quot; &quot;okay&quot; then the lady walked outside and asked someone in the drive through for one but with no luck. she was supposed to be handing out fliers or something but didnt want i guess.<br>
<br>
seeing a puppy/dog nearly get hit by a mini-van just outside<br>
<br>
kristy did this insane dance thing that was completely out of the blue. mid freaking sentence she does this weird little dance and i die laughing. so i immitate it and then she dies laughing.<br>
<br>
driving around the crazy IMA parking lot<br>
<br>
wandering around the IMA trying to find our group and starting a trend by sitting in the lobby area when we really should have been somewhere else.<br>
<br>
getting stuck with siamese chairs i had to figure out how to seperate. then figure out how to set them up.<br>
<br>
princess valium giving the most sleepy/monotone discussion on two paintings which really didnt tell us anything. she was like a freaking robot that just took whatever we said and repeated it back to us, but not really getting what we were saying, so she just kept repeating things incorrectly.<br>
<br>
kristy decided at one point that not only jesus, but all of his diciples looked just like alec guinness.<br>
<br>
walking around the african exibit and talking to the teacher's wife, who ended up being a lot cooler than him.<br>
<br>
learning some stuff about african tribes and masks and stuff.<br>
<br>
walking around for a bit trying to find this asian drawing section<br>
<br>
following kristy thinking she wanted to look some more, but was actually lost trying to find the exit.<br>
<br>
we wander around the gift shop for a while...and kristy finds a beaver puppet to play with. i havnt the faintest idea why someone would think &quot;i think i'll make a..............beaver puppet!&quot; and there was a rabbit that popped out of a watering can for some reason. i guess thats what you'd get for buying puppets at an art museum.<br>
<br>
leaving the IMA in the dark and getting over to the circle area and sort of getting lost a bit<br>
<br>
parking in a parking lot we werent sure was all right to park in and walking to get to this pizza place<br>
<br>
while walking around, we were both looking in the empty Yat's window and kristy went AH! and turned around real fast. Something was touching her leg and she thought it was a rodent of some sort. it ended up just being some small dog.<br>
<br>
kristy opening the doors with the &quot;use other door&quot; sign on it so the people at the table next to it were like &quot;ugh...wtf&quot;<br>
<br>
i laughed some, but would have done the same thing. i said to her, &quot;watch them seat us next to them&quot;<br>
<br>
and they did! i laughed really really hard. &quot;laugh it up...go ahead. laugh it up&quot;<br>
<br>
we had cherry jones soda and a 12&quot; pepperoni.<br>
<br>
we get kinda lost getting back up, we tried to get over to meridian from illinois and ended up on a little alley next to construction so i turned around and it was a one way afterall. despite the stop sign facing me.<br>
<br>
turning fast into IHOP to check hours. they're 24/7<br>
<br>
leaving and finding 465<br>
<br>
kristy put in Hefner and it like took over my brain<br>
<br>
kristy thinking this &quot;Get Better&quot; billboard said &quot;Get Beaver&quot;<br>
<br>
getting on 465 and like 20 minutes later i realize OH FUCK!!! FUCKFUCKFUCK!!! IM GOING THE WRONG WAY!!! i had gone west instead of east and i had to somehow get back.<br>
<br>
the first turn off happened to be 65 north so i nearly drove to purdue! i ended up on west 86th street. really west...<br>
<br>
eventually finding an easterm entrance to 465 and getting on the right track after driving 86th for a long time.<br>
<br>
wasting a lot of gas in the process<br>
<br>
we eventually get to 69/37 and i turn hoping that its the right turn. i kinda knew it was, but by this time i wasnt sure of much at all.<br>
<br>
it was right. we get off at 116th and try to get into wendys<br>
<br>
they had a special little entrance for wendys so we go in there and b/c the turn is kinda sharp i took it too hard and hit the curb. hard. the whole car moves up and down twice and instead of exploding like she thought i BURST out laughing<br>
i laugh so hard i have trouble seeing and im clapping really really loudly as i drive past the second window<br>
the guy in the window is giving me the funniest look on earth and its already 11:20 so we'll have to go through the drive through<br>
<br>
we get a frosty to split and im still kinda laughing into the speaker thing. she needed somewhere to put the messy lid to the frosty, so i suggested to put it in the pizza box where the remaining slice was. i believe its now in her fridge with the frosty lid...<br>
<br>
several times i'd done that weird OH...OH..OHOHOHOHOH laugh thing that i do when ive done something crazy or scared myself somehow<br>
<br>
she has me come over to try and help split the frosty and this trans am is running really loudly and hes reving his engine and stuff. being weird<br>
<br>
trying to leave wendys, i had to make sure i didnt take the BAD way and nearly run into the median again. but i took the same way i came in, and apparently, the sensor isnt installed yet, so we sat there for a good three minutes before the light even changed, and even then we got freaking skipped so i just went left when there was no one around.<br>
<br>
my nervous system took a beating tonight<br>
<br>
i dropped her off and she made me come in to look at this wonderous picture of jim i'd been hearing about all day :P apparently she just doesnt &quot;know what to dooo???&quot;. i kept saying not to worry about it.<br>
<br>
then went home to sit down to write this all down before i forget it all. which i did, so im editing as i remember.<br>
<br>
and then posting this all and it dissapearing, only to fix it again.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmisshapesmistakesmisfits.showUserPublicProfile?gid=westwardcloud@misshapesmistakesmisfits>westwardcloud</A> at: 2/21/04 1:50 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmisshapesmistakesmisfits.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oceanblue52>oceanblue52</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>underground classic</span><br>  Posts: 327<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/21/04 4:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmisshapesmistakesmisfitsfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=230.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.digitalpose.com/mbr/1/4999/p/382605_147455950747476031_vl.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wowza</span><hr size=1> Thats a pretty adventurous day you guys had there.
