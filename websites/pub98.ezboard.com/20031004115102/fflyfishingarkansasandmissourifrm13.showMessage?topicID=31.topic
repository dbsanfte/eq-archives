It's no accident that what makes a good distance cast also makes for a good standard cast. Proper loading, straight line path, haul timing, and everything else is all fine and good, but from what I've seen what makes the difference between a good caster and a great caster are tracking and casting plane.<br>
<br>
By tracking I mean the path that the rod takes horizontally not up and down. The up and down path is what causes tailing and open loops. Tracking causes the &quot;Bloody L&quot;, curves, bends, and even horizontal tails. I'd define tracking a the fly and fly line being in 180 degree opposition to the target prior to starting the forward cast. You might as well say that anything other than that will rob you of the ability to properly load the rod. I see tons of casters, even very advanced ones, that send their back cast off to one side prior to making a forward cast. They will have considerable difficulty making distance casts as long as they continue to do that.<br>
<br>
Tracking is of utmost importance while accuracy casting. While we were in the OLN games we had a terrible wind off the right shoulder. It was &quot;very&quot; difficult to properly time a back cast that allowed for wind enough to get it to track. On the 70 foot cast I found myself allowing for a couple of feet of left drift due to wind in the back cast. If the wind changed at all it totally blew my forward cast. My scores on Sunday reflected the wind difficulty, as did everyone elses.<br>
<br>
Casting plane is simple enough. Again the fly needs to be in 180 degree opposition before starting the forward cast. If your fly line is low in the back cast and you try making a high forward cast (no wind), your fly will stop high and then flutter backwards. Casting high in the forward cast is &quot;NOT&quot; the proper way to gain additional distance. The most effective means for distance is to have the leader unroll at the precise moment that it touches the water. Rajeff is the master at this manuver. I've seen his fly touch at the precise moment his line runs out of energy. <br>
<br>
The next time you're out in the yard casting your rod make not of your tracking and casting plane. If you have a curve in your cast at all you are out of track. If your fly line does not unroll or pops, you are out of plane for the amount of power.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just a couple of thoughts. I wouldn't say they are the &quot;facts&quot; just my personal observations. <br>

After a few years of fishing, I've started trying to improve my casting.  I do tend to do the things you've mentioned.  My tracking suffers because of my poor false casting, so I fail to correct the direction of the backcast.  Those &quot;bloody L's&quot; can be put to good use, if you need some kind of curve cast.  It's only a bad cast if you don't want those results.  Casting plane well, I need improvement there also.<br>

The Gammel tape  has just been the beginning.  After just a few minutes throwing a 15 ft cast I was amazed at the improvement I saw.

 This is the biggest problem of many casters. They have all the right speeds. Timing and power. Some even enough to over come problems of the back cast. But think of how much better they could be if the line was STRAIGHT behind the rod on the way to the target.<br>
 Up, down, sideways, all steal from the cast.<br>
  I thought that was what Troy was missing in another post. We got that straight...<br>
  The Kinetic energy of the line is the greatest if the line is moving in the same direction, not around a curve.<br>

 the 'Bloody L' is a Spey Casting&quot; Term for the hook you get when casting. The line will form a right angle turn and set the fly UP Stream letting the line go first and spook the fish. <br>
  This can happen with a side arm cast if over powered. but if you want to cast behind a tree, rock or stump it is a great cast. <br>

<br>
The next time you practice make your back cast terribly out of plane with your forward cast. Maybe even as much as 30 degrees or so. If you load the rod with the casts out of 180 opposition with each other you will get an &quot;L&quot; shape in your forward cast. The more line you get out the worse it gets. I see guys that are trying to make the transition from 70 feet to 100 feet getting it all the time. The basic cause of the Bloody &quot;L&quot; is the back cast being out of plane with the forward cast and is generally considered a casting fault. <br>
<br>
Please note that the term I use is just what I call it. It may or may not be the same thing is spey casting.<br>

There are a lot of nifty things we can do with a flyline by using centrifugal momentum in a controlled manner.  It could be considered exceedingly difficult (if not impossible) to make an overhead curve cast with a perfectly SLP of the rod tip, especially if the backcast is 180 degrees from the target.  Linear energy tends to stay linear, and angular energy makes curves.<br>
<br>
If you want maximum distance and accuracy at the same time, then gaining your speed in a perfectly straight line toward the target is paramount.  If you need something else to have a fishable cast, then it's up to you to figure out what, and how to achieve it.  You're the field general out there -- you make it all happen.  Ideally, you'd like your casting to enhance your ability to present the fly and catch more fish.  Having only one cast severly hampers your flexibility on the water.  Practice it, play with it, experiment all the time.  That's how you establish the cause and effect relationships.  <br>

<br>
You speak the truth oh wise one.....<br>
<br>
I do attempt to maintain SLP regardless of the cast though. The Bloody L does make a neat curve cast but it's dang difficult to control. Sunday we were casting in a 25 mph cross wind. Trying to get a strike indicator, shot, and 6 feet of tippet, to properly turn over was a bummer if I didn't maintain SLP though. As I brought my back cast high the wind would carry it off to the side. If I didn't allow for some &quot;side drift&quot; my cast would wrap over itself in the forward cast. <br>
<br>
A wind actually is a candidate for those &quot;wind knots&quot;. In lieu of casting a tail in the verticle plane, you have to be careful not to throw a tail in the horizontal plane.<br>
