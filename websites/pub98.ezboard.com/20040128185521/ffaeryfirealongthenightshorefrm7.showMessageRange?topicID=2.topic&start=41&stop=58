He turned to the metal on stone sound...or one of Tehn's daggers hitting the wall.  If Tehn was awake,  then what happened to Sparrow!?  Glenn felt an immeadiate urge to charge down the ally to rescue his comrades.  However, he realized that the element of surprise was his best chance, so he wiped a tear from the child's face, and with a swish of his dark cloak, he zoomed off stealthly into the darkness.  Like a wraith , Glenn silently stalked the shadows towards the encampent,  so intent was Glenn on his task ahead, that it was to late when he heard the rushing footsteps behind him.  Glenn was tackled as rough calloused hands encircled his legs. As Glenn and the assualtent impacted on the pavement,  Glenn cursed himself for believing that the child was alone.  Glenn reached for his scabbard to draw his blade,  but the man who attacked him had predicted this move and grabbed Glenn's wrist mid-way.  Then with a streak of silver,  the man drew his own weapon and stabbed at Glenn.  With a desperate heave,  Glenn managed to roll to the right, and the man's dagger caught naught but Glenn's cape.  The roll caused the man to let go of Glenn's hand in order to prevent from being lunged forward.  The man made another stab at Glenn,  but, Glenn had by then had enough time to regain his senses from the impact,  grabbed the man's own wrist, and then it became a battle of raw strength.  Glenn realised this would be a battle he would lose,  so he let go of the mans hand while simultaneosly dodging with his head to the right.  The dagger once again hit cloak,  but this time, before the man could pull back again,  Glenn quickly struck the man's ulnar nerve at the back of his elbow with a dextrous chop with his fingers,  this momentarily caused the man to realise his grip on the dagger,  and Glenn used the opurtunity to wrestle the dagger for his own.  The man realising that he was now losing this scuffle,  launched himself backwards of Glenn,  but through the roll on the floor, he had lost his sense of direction,  and with the desperate luanch backwards, hit his head on the wall.  He then crumpled to the floor out cold.  Glenn, took a moment to catch his breath,  but, as reality came back to him, he remembered Sparrow and the others, and once again took off in their direction.   The sight Glenn saw when he reached the encampent filled him with anger and a sense of revenge.  The theifs were taking full advantage of Glenn's wounded comrades.  With a second glance,  however, Glenn noticed among the sprawled human forms on the floor,  than many of them were not his comrades.  Glenn noted how the slime in the wounded affected their fighting.  In Athena,  who was exposed the least, surprisingly ignoring her pain, faught with an extreme  bloodlust that seemded alien to her.  Tehn also,  the more he faught,  the more he seemed to ignore the pain.  And, then there was Murm, he was exposed to slime the most,  plus,  he had previously faught the bugs with demonic stregth and speed,  and now ,he thrashed around in some momentous inner battle.  Finally, it hit Glenn,  the slime  was none other than the rare subtance that one of his old mentors mentioned in one of his lectures.  By now Glenn had forgoten the name,  but he knew its properties.  It caused the the infected to fight in a blood lust till he wore his own body to death through shere exaustion.  Murm had previously faught with all he had,  and was now fighting the last stages in his dreams,  Athena,  who hadnt faught as much before,  was in a rage,  hacking a dead theifs body into pieces,  and Tehn, his own wound was more physical,  which in its own exausted him, affecting his ability to fight, was soon on the path to join Murm in the final stages of unconsienceness.  Glenn now knew what he had to do.  Glenn pulled out a vile from the recesses of his cloak,  it contained a subtance that would cut of the slime's access to the brain,  allowing the infected to take control of their body again.  Glenn silently stalked his way to Murm's side,  and gave him a quick dose by spreading it on some exposed flesh.  He then pondered how he was going to give the dose to Athena in her blood rage, when he saw her give him an opening with her love for her fellow mankind and her moment of sympathy for Sparrow.  After he gave her the dose,  startling her he could tell,  Glenn melted back into the shadows when he realized their was another stranger in the party fighting for them,  Glenn wanted to see if this man would aide Tehn.  However,  Glenn realized that his own curiousty was enough inaction that the last thief had Tehn and Sparrow at sword point.  Glenn was momentarily stunned with knowing this was his friends's end when the huge form of Murm flew ,  stunning the theif in shock and surprise moments before he was tackled and pummeled to the floor.  Glenn, though relieved to see Murm consious and in full command of his senses,  was in complete shock,  &quot;How could he have made such a complete recovery so fast!!!!!  In the state he was in it should of taken at least 3 hours or so...wow...there is something strange about Murm...&quot;  Glenn set those thoughts aside for later and rushed to the more immeadiate needs.  He kneeled and gave a dose to the downed Tehn. As he took care of Tehn he asked the stranger &quot;Your help is greatly appreciated kind sir,  however,  my friends here are greatly injured and I'm afraid I need more help,  mind lending me your aide?  My name is Glenn Tyreson...and yours is...?&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sagecoqui>SageCoqui</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.dragid.com/newbuddy.php?id=1874" BORDER=0> at: 10/7/03 8:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=orlindurgenhart>OrlinDurgenhart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(10/7/03 10:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> the new Face</span><hr size=1> &quot;I am Orlin,  the Pleasure is all mine.&quot; Orlin replies with a short bow.  &quot;I am a traveling Bard and heard the fighting to and came to see if I could help.&quot;  Orlin then turns to the rest of the party and begins binding their wounds.

I think all of us could use the rest.  There are many forces working in the world right now, but they shall have to wait a few hours, now won't they?&quot;  As he settled back into a sitting position, he grimaced in pain, but thankful that the rage was leaving his blood.  &quot;We will... we need our rest right now...&quot;' <br>
As the remainder of the night slowly passed, Tehn kept fitfully waking up, casting distrustful glances through the camp.  His hunt had been calm for at least three months, and now three major events in the course of one night.  Could one of these men somehow be a spy?  Both Sparrow and Glenn had 'luckily' avoided the slime.  Had they aided him just to enter his circle?  Had the giant realized who he was, and seeing his first approach fail miserably, attempted a different approach?  Perhaps his fears were unfounded, he had been far too careless with his tongue, and many others besides these had heard things that should not have been heard.  Tehn was careful to make sure Glenn, the one still on watch, noticed not his gazes.  Others seemed to be sleeping fitfully as well, perhaps just a side effect of Glenn's medecine.  But then again, Glenn arrived just after the battle had already been decided.  And this newcomer, what of him?  Who prowls the streets besides the bloodied thieves that had been hidden?  Had he somehow been stalking them all along, waiting for his chance to become the hero these wanderers needed, or just seeing an opportunity to follow them in a much easier way.  While the strength of numbers could help greatly, and surely they could all benefit from reaching the library, but what then?  How could he have been so stupid, thinking they could be trusted?  They knew nothing of his suffering, nothing of loss, nothing of betrayal, except of betraying.  He thought briefly of trying to steal away, but Glenn was far too vigilent to miss that, and far too strong resolve to fall asleep...  <br>
The night slowly lessened, without further event, and as dawn finally broke, Tehn woke up and began to make preparations for the day.  Glenn gave him a smile, and promptly fell asleep for a quick nap as the others continued sleeping.  Tehn thought, &quot;I could leave now... but... it doesn't seem as necessary now... perhaps the poison and dark were still clouding my mind... no one can see all ends, we may need each other yet.&quot;  His back was feeling incredibly better, another proof that it may be worth giving them his trust.  <br>
Slowly the others woke up, and as Murm finally broke out of his deep slumber, they made ready to leave.  As they left the town, Tehn said, &quot;We head this way,&quot; setting a tough pace for the amount of sleep they had and all the excitement through the night. <p>______________________________<br>

Wearing many rings, he pets his white and brown tabby cat pondering and reading. When he rises from his chair a large staff comes to his aide and he walks with only a slight hobble. He laughs to himself with a quiet &quot;hohohoo&quot; and wonders if his inn will have any visitors soon, since the air smells like change, and change usually means youthful trouble...<br>

She tried to open her eyes again, but they felt like 100 pond weights attatched to her head.  In a world of swirling colors she found herself back at the tavern, alone with the same bug like creatures encircling her.  She drew her wepon but knew it wasn't going to be enough, for she was doomed.  She raised her sword and slashed, fought, clawed, kicked screamed with a glow in her eyes as she fought in circles to somehow make an effect to the mass amount of bugs.  She looked around seeing about 1/3 of the bugs dead sparsed over the room yet something had grabbed her leg and she fell flat on the ground.  The bugs began to take a more human shape, almost like humans in an insect-like armor.  They began grabbing at her limbs.  One thing had her hand, another her foot and she was lifted and carried off by a mass of bugs.  Down the stairs and to the back of the tavern they went with her until they very back was a series of cages, all empty suprisingly.  At the very end of the path there was a door, a heavy iron.  It was opened and she could see nothing but darkness...  The next thing she knew she was bound to a wall by chains and surronded by bugs or humans, whatever they were.  The exchanged a signal throughout the crowd and suddenly the bugs began turning into the awful blue ooze.  The room was at a slant and the goo traveled down to where Athena was bound.  So clawed and scratched and tried to flip or anything to avoid the goo, but it was too late the goo grew on her, burning skin and she bean to take the form of one of the human bugs slowly.  Emersed feet in the ooze became long stick bug legs and so on and so forth until it reached her waist.  Higher and higher it traveled until she screamed.  She opened her eyes and she was in the arms of the giant, Murm.  Sweating and shaking she was at the door of a hostel in the arms of the kind giant.  With a sigh of relieve she spoke, &quot; Thank you Murm&quot; as the giant gave a slight bow of his head.  They was all her newly made friends, Glenn, Tehn, Sparrow, Murm, and an odd new commer she had never seen before.  She called out Glenn's name, recalling that she thought the robbers of the night had given her some kind of drug and she rolled up her sleeve and saw a large rash of some kind, very purple and odd.  She gashped at the sight of her own arm, and fell faint.  <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

The six made their way through the impressive maze of the city, somehow more convoluted in the pale morn light than it seemed in the obscuring blackness of night.  They ascended a steep cobblestone roadway, both sides filled with a collection of houses which seemed smashed together.  Just as they began to feel uneasy about the locale, Murm, carrying the dazed form of Athena spotted a sign with the name Orlin had mentioned, the Jack of Diamonds.  It was affixed to a building which seemed an impossibly high four stories for how thin it was, almost seeming to loom over the street, but still blending into the surrounding structures.  As they entered into the building, the wizened old man set down his book with a chuckle, beckoning them in with a gnarled hand. <p>______________________________<br>

&quot;Ohohohoo, that's my daughter Simone, isn't it? Pretty from what I hear, but she's mute as a mule! Hohohoo! I guess she's my eyes and I'm her tongue, just try thinking about THAT when you kiss her! ohohohoo! So! How can we help you!?&quot;<br>

Who the hell WAS that old man? And why does this room give me the creeps?&quot; he wondered to himself.  Granted, on certain occasions riddles had intrigued Murm with their strange twisting nature, but this time he had other things to concern him, and the idea of solving puzzles upset him slightly.  As the evening slowly crept into night, the tired, battle-weary giant decided to find some answers for himself.  Removing his mace from his belt(for he intended to find honest answers to his simple questions, not force his will upon his unknown rescuers), the very large figure set it beside his bed and crept as sneakily as a giant can toward the doorway of the ever-so-strange room of the oddly disquiting inn.  As he crept downstairs, he knew what he must do.  He turned the corner to the room where they had originally met the man, intent on finding that strange old man and giving him a piece of his mind. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sagecoqui>SageCoqui</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.dragid.com/newbuddy.php?id=1874" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(10/27/03 11:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>  ... ?</span><hr size=1> Glenn welcomed the much needed rest and lay down with full intention of sleeping straight through the night.

Cords of pathways surged around him, like so many threads that create a tapestry.  As they wove, the patterns only created more chaos, and each degree of organization that seemed to be forming only added to the murky obsidion of endless night and confusion.  As he stood there, a mighty stone highway cleaved through his walkway, sundering it in front of him, leaving no way to progress, and somehow, no way behind either.  As the darkness twined, a ray of non-darkness shot out from in front of him, and seemed to reel in a feeble dirt trail, merely dust scattered haphazardly, floating in the nothingness and winding through others that seemed much safer, yet unavailable.  He began the trail as something began to follow.  Tehn knew he couldn't look and stay aright, but as he continued along the path which followed no rules of physics or euclidian existence, they seemed to grow in number.  The path went on endlessly, and endlessly they grew in number behind him.  As the path looped around a particularly astounding causeway, Tehn saw thousands of small orbs tailing behind, all colors and beyond.  He turned around, and one drifted into his hand, a small world of blues and oranges, beautiful yet somehow desolate.  As he turned around, the mighty doors of the library were before him, part of the causeway.  As he walked through, he became horrified as behind him all the paths of existence burst into silent pale violet flames, and the murky ashes began to soar towards him, and coalesce on his skin, hardening, stiffening his joints.  The orbs were gone, and as the armor formed around him, he tried to flee the ash which was continuing to group, yet it was paralyzing him.... <p>______________________________<br>

They set out of the city, Tehn leading.  They quickly made their way to the outskirts without incident, and were soon in open territory.  The gently rolling hills gave a sense of calm, while occasional trees and small groves of trees still presented an aura of protection and peace.  As they made good time towards their destination, Tehn pulled out a small intricate cylinder, and quickly fingering several places, deftly twisting the various segments and gildings.  He then pulled out what seemed to be a small map and quickly looked at the sun and surrounding environ.  With a contented expression of determination, replaced the map, followed with just as many swift movements to relock the cylinder, and replaced it within his garments.  As they continued onwards, the landscape seemed to grow more desolate, and as the tree cover gradually gave way to barrenness, turned to Sparrow and muttered, &quot;I think we've picked up a tail, something is following us, 5 o clock.

He had walked down the hallway untill he heard voices behind a door.  There he recognized Murm's voice and that of the innkeepers.  He heard the innkeeper say something about him and his daughter &quot;asking&quot; some shady people some questions who came in after we did.  These people apparently asked questions about our group, and the innkeeper had dealt with them, how he did, he wouldn't reveal to Murm,  but Glenn suspected some method of torture.  Murm wanted to see these people but the innkeeper said that would not be possible, Glenn heard Murm begin to press the issue then stop himself as he had second thoughts. Then they began to whisper and Glenn decided it was time to hurry off...eave's dropping didn't become him anyways.  Now Glenn wondered why neither Murm or the innkeeper said anything about that second group.  That was when Glenn heard Tehn mentioning a group following us.  Glenn barked a laugh as if Sparrow had just made a funny joke and chanced a glance backwards...Glenn wasn't sure, but in that breif glance....he thought he noticed a sleek female figure among the approaching figures.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=piratekingatamis>PirateKingAtamis</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.dragid.com/newbuddy.php?id=2009" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(11/20/03 11:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> This might be a bad thing....</span><hr size=1> Sparrow had been unaware of the approaching group as he was still groggy from the effects of his medicine. Over the night Sparrow's potion had healed his wounded arm to a point where all that was left was a scar and some muscle pain. In an effort to check the steangth of the following group, Sparrow headed back to the pack mules on his newly &quot;borrowed&quot; horse. As he rode back to the animals he brought out a small tube with a flick of his wrist and looked through it. With another quick motion concealed by rubbing the ear of his horse Sparrow concealed his spy glass and returned to the front of the group near Tehn. Under his breath Sparrow told what he saw &quot;It looks like a regular bunch of mercenaries, there are about twelve of them. But their leader worries me. I can't be sure, but I think I know her.&quot; Responding to the quizical look on Tehn's face Sparrow explained &quot;Well, it was about three years ago that I was helmsman on the &quot;Azure Falcon&quot;, our... business had been a bit scare lately because the ships of the tempest sea are outfitted with ballista now. To remedy this, our captain hired a witch to destroy the weaponry of our opposing force. Her name is Mordala, and she is very good at what she does.&quot; Scratching the back of his head ruefully Sparrow suggested &quot;Maybe Glenn or you could put an arrow or dagger in her before she can start her gibberish to curse us? Otherwise we're in for a rather interesting fight, especially since I don't know how to combat magic.&quot; Concluding his idea Sparrow looked at the faces of his party in hope that someone had an idea or at least some knowledge of how to counter the magical power thay where soon to be up against.<br>
