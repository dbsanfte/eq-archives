Someone Else’s Shoes (1/5)<br>
<br>
<br>
“What a pit!”  She proclaimed, glancing over the contents of the sty-like storage unit.  She turned to her partner, who was already taking off his jacket and tossing it aside, getting ready for the work ahead of them.  She sighed.  “What are we supposed to be looking for again?”  He grinned as he was rolling up his sleeves, then he loosened his tie.<br>
<br>
“Anything that Mulder may have stashed here that should have been turned in as evidence for any x-file case, because he thought somebody in the bureau would try and cover it up,” John Doggett smiled again and chuckled.  “So, we should probably just bring everything in and save ourselves time right?”<br>
<br>
Monica Reyes smiled and shook her head.  “You’d think they had enough with just the stuff he did turn in, that office was almost as bad as this when I moved in.”  She knelt down and started to sift through a box that contained a small stack of papers.  Doggett was looking through a box that contained what appeared to be childhood memorabilia.  <br>
<br>
“You have no idea Monica, you only came in after Scully and I cleaned the place up.”  Doggett swept off some dust with his hand to see the picture in the frame he was holding.  Then, he sneezed.<br>
<br>
“God bless you,” Reyes replied, and flashed a sympathetic grin at him.  “How did they find out about this place anyway?”  She quickly examined some papers and put them in a separate pile.<br>
<br>
“Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was right and they did have his place bugged… that, or they just looked at his checking statement and saw the storage facility on there.”<br>
<br>
Reyes rolled her eyes, “That would do it.  But, I still don’t see why they think he was withholding evidence to keep himself.  It’s not like he was ever very secretive about his views on the x-files or anything.  He was a good agent.”  Doggett stared at her with a ‘you know what’s really going on’ look.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think they really believe there’s anything here.  Call it speculation, but I think your ex is just trying to be a jerk, assigning us crap work like this.”  Reyes laughed.  She looked at Doggett and smiled.<br>
<br>
“Brad doesn’t have to try to be a jerk, he’s a natural.”  They both started chuckling.  Doggett tossed some stuff aside and rifled through some more papers to get to a box below.  In the box was a small safe.  <br>
<br>
“Huh, what’s this?”  He asked.  She looked over from what she was doing and smirked.<br>
<br>
“Most people call it a safe John.”  He glared at her with an exasperated look.  “Okay, okay, just kidding.  Is there a key?”  He looked around the rest of the box and then shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Think we should shoot it open?”  He raised his eyebrows and smiled in a hopeful fashion.<br>
<br>
“Could be fun, but I bet I can pick it faster,” Reyes walked over to where Doggett was standing.  He looked at her questioning gleam in his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Where’d you learn how to pick a lock?”  He asked suspiciously.  She grinned as she pulled a paperclip off of a stack of papers and straightened it out with her fingers.  She shook her head at his question.<br>
<br>
“Just give me the safe,” she replied.  His eyebrow still arched up a little, but he handed her the small safe.  She set it down on top of a stack of boxes, right about eye level, so she could see what she was doing.  She quickly maneuvered the metal clip back and forth and the safe’s lock made a clicking noise as the top popped open ever so slightly.  “Voila!”  She proclaimed, with obvious pride in her voice.  “I’m a genius.”  Doggett cocked his head to look at her at an angle, his eyebrow still upturned.<br>
<br>
“Or a thief,” he answered back.  He motioned to her with his hand to give her the safe, and she complied, resisting the temptation to throw it at him for his comment.  He looked inside.  The only thing inside the small safe was a small, padded manila envelope with a date on it.  He took the envelope in his hands, tossing the safe aside.  “Well, it’s not from his childhood, and the date could coincide with and x-file, we’ll have to check his records I guess.”  He started to walk over to put the envelope in a separate box, one they had designated for any possible evidence retrieval, but Reyes grabbed his arm to stop him.<br>
<br>
“Aren’t we going to see what’s in it?”  Doggett looked at her, knowing full well what she was up to, she was just curious and wanted to immediately satisfy her curiosity.  He grinned slightly and looked down at the envelope in his hands.  He tore the sealant edge off, and then shook the envelope upside down to empty the contents into his hand.  It was a dime and penny fused together.<br>
<br>
“What the hell?”<br>

They were both becoming increasingly frustrated with their lack of progress.  With the exception of some research notes and newspaper clippings, their search of the storage unit had only come up with one thing they would possibly consider x-file evidence, and so far they didn’t have anything to link it to.  Neither one of them was looking forward to their morning meeting with Folmer and Kirsch, not that they would have been looking forward to it even if they had made progress.  Reyes flopped her forehead onto the desk.  <br>
<br>
“We need to go home,” she sighed, obviously exhausted.  Doggett’s face rose up from looking at the computer screen with a strange look on his face.<br>
<br>
“We?”  He asked, raising his eyebrow in a suggestive manner.  Reyes lifted her head off the desk slightly to look at his expression, and then rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“You know what I meant,” she said.  He smiled.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I think all we can do at this point is just hand them this thing,” he paused as he rolled the strange fused coins in between his fingers, “and the envelope, and tell them that the date doesn’t correspond with any case we could find on record.”  He paused again and looked at her.  She was already starting to pick up her jacket to put it on.  “Besides, it’s not like this assignment was important anyway, just something to make us jump through hoops, to try and show us who the boss is.”  Reyes sighed and nodded, she looked discouraged and sad.  Doggett knew what she was thinking, wondering why she had ever gone out with Brad Folmer in the first place, why she couldn’t seem to make him understand that she was trying to move on, but he decided to keep his commentary to himself and got up to leave as well.  “Go home, we have a long day tomorrow.”<br>
<br>
That night provided no rest for Reyes, who tossed in her bed with insomnia.  Any time she did manage to get a few minutes of sleep, she would see Folmer’s face mouthing the words, “It will always be me.”  She shuddered.  She got up for water several times, each time wanting to grab her hidden pack of cigarettes and smoke them all, but she managed to resist, barely.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Doggett and Reyes met outside of Kirsch’s office.  His secretary told them that he was in a private meeting with Folmer and that they would need to wait until they were called in.  Doggett rolled his eyes.  Reyes grinned sympathetically.  Then she raised her eyebrows at him.<br>
<br>
“You have it with you?” She questioned.  He patted his upper left jacket pocket, indicating that the fused coins and envelope were in the inside pocket.  She nodded and grinned again.  Then, she realized that the secretary was trying to get their attention.  She hadn’t even heard the woman calling their names for the last minute.  They turned their heads to look at her.<br>
<br>
“They’re ready for you now,” she indicated, motioning to the door with her index finger.  She seemed to be implying that she was much to busy to get up and open the door for them, and they took the hint right away.  After all, it wasn’t the first time they had to deal with her.<br>
<br>
The meeting was mercifully shorter than Reyes thought it was going to be.  It went pretty much the way she thought, sans all the yelling and accusatory statements, although Folmer did seem to steam a little every time she and Doggett shared a look.  ‘He used to be a good guy, didn’t he?’ Kept going through her head.  She couldn’t believe that she would intentionally go out with someone for so long that was such a jerk.<br>
<br>
When the meeting ended, Folmer left Kirsch’s office with Doggett and Reyes.  He continued down the hallway with them, past a couple of offices, then stopped when the elevator doors opened, putting his hand on Reyes’s shoulder to stop her as well.  Doggett turned around to see what was going on.  Folmer gave his best ‘nothing’s wrong’ smile, but it turned out kind of creepy.<br>
<br>
“You go ahead Agent Doggett, I just need to speak with Mon… with Agent Reyes for a minute,” he said.  Doggett didn’t want to leave her to handle this guy alone, but nodded and left when Reyes spoke to him.<br>
<br>
“It’s alright, I’ll catch up to you,” she said, not really meaning that it was alright, but knowing there would be a big, unnecessary scene if she didn’t acquiesce.  She turned around to face Folmer, who already looked angry with jealousy.  “What did you want to talk to me about?”  She asked, trying to remain as collected as possible.<br>
<br>
“You know what,” he fumed.  She rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“I certainly hope this isn’t about John Doggett and I being romantically involved, because as I’ve told you about a million times before, we’re not,” she stated matter-of- factly, trying to ignore the voice in her head that told her that they would be romantically involved in a second if he would show any interest in having that kind of relationship.  Folmer shook his head and gave her an evil grin.<br>
<br>
“You never were a good liar Monica,” he said in a husky voice as he leaned in, his arm pushing off against the wall.  She stepped back.<br>
<br>
“And you always were Brad,” she said.  “Did you ever think that might be the problem?”  She shook her head a little and turned around to push the button for the elevator.  He grabbed her arm forcefully to swing her back around to face him.  “What?!”  She spat at him.  She was so sick of his ‘need for dominance’ complex.<br>
<br>
“You don’t belong to him Monica!”  He snapped, keeping his grip on her arm.  She took her other hand and released his grip.<br>
<br>
“I don’t belong to anyone Brad, I’m a human being, not property,” she replied, turning her attention back to waiting for the elevator, which seemed to be taking forever.<br>
<br>
“You shouldn’t lie to me Monica, you know I’ll find out the truth,” he said in an accusing fashion, then turned and began to walk away.  The elevator doors opened and Reyes stepped on.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah, well, the truth is out there,” she mumbled, not loud enough for him to hear.  Then she smiled and started chuckling to herself.<br>

He rolled the coins between his fingers, looking at it, but thinking of her.  Wondering where he had gone wrong, assuring himself that he hadn’t gone wrong, that Doggett had just gotten in the way.  Then came the inevitable ‘I’m better off without her’ thoughts.  Which, he knew wasn’t true.  Without her, he was just a corrupt agent who had aligned himself with the most powerful factions in the bureau, not knowing their true intent or crimes they had committed, and not caring.  Power was the key, and his lust for dominance always won out.<br>
<br>
“Why would he decide to keep this one thing?”  He asked himself, turning his attention back to the fused coins.  “It’s not like it does anything,” he said.  Immediately after making that statement, he wished he hadn’t.  The metal in his hands suddenly became unbearably hot.  There was a knock at the door, and Doggett let himself in, despite the fact that there was no answer.  <br>
<br>
“You wanted to see…” Doggett started to ask, then caught the fused coin that was hurling through the air at him.  He dropped it almost as soon as he had caught it.  “Aaagh!”  He proclaimed at the coins burning his skin.  “You call me up here so you could burn me?”  He asked Folmer, half kidding, half accusing.<br>
<br>
“Of course not,” Folmer stated, blowing on his own wound, like that would help the pain go away.  Then, the coins started to glow a little.  They both seemed to notice it around the same time.<br>
<br>
“What the hell?”  Doggett questioned.  Seconds later, he was staring at himself from the inside of Folmer’s body.  “Oh, crap.”  Folmer’s voice was the one that came out.  Folmer stared back at him from his body.<br>
<br>
“If you have a way to contact former Agent Mulder, I suggest you do it now,” he said angrily.  Folmer saw his own head nod and Doggett got up to leave.  He didn’t know how to get in touch with Mulder, but he knew someone that would.<br>
<br>
After Doggett left the office, Folmer went over to the desk and grabbed a small mirror out of the second drawer.  ‘This isn’t happening.’  He tried to tell himself.  Then, he realized the implications of what had just happened.  He could find out the real answers to what he had cornered Reyes about earlier, he could find out the truth.<br>
<br>
Doggett went to Folmer’s car and began driving to Scully’s apartment.  He told her on the cell phone that it was important and not to be disturbed when Assistant Deputy Director Folmer showed up at her door.  He would have just gone down to his office to make the phone call, but he realized that Reyes probably wouldn’t believe that they had actually switched bodies.  She believed a lot of stuff that was kind of out there, but he couldn’t ask her to try and believe that, especially after she told him what happened after he left her by the elevators with the guy.  ‘Geez, shouldn’t have done that,’ he thought to himself as he pulled up to Scully’s apartment building in a car that was much nicer than his own.  His thoughts quickly shifted to wondering how much Folmer actually got paid, or if he was on the take.<br>
<br>
‘Too bad I don’t know how to forge his signature, I could do some damage to his bank account.’  He smiled at the thought as he walked into the building.  When he got up to her apartment, a very Folmer-esque thought crossed his mind.  ‘Then again, there’s always the internet.’  He smiled again and knocked on the door.  ‘Payment for being stuck in this @#%$’s body.’  Scully opened the door, an untrusting look on her face.<br>
<br>
“Hey Scully, we’ve got a problem,” he said.  She furrowed her brow at him, and he walked past her into the apartment.  She turned around to shut the door, and then focused her attention on him.<br>
<br>
“Since when do you call me Scully and not Agent Scully?”  She asked, still wondering what was going on.  He sighed and proceeded to tell her the whole story.  At first, she didn’t believe him, but there was something off about him, his mannerisms weren’t those of Folmer.  They weren’t as polished or as sly, and he didn’t have that aura of sneakiness that he usually had around him.  She asked him some questions that she felt only Doggett would know and he answered them.  She decided to believe him, for now.<br>
<br>
“I’ll see what I can do, but right now, you’d better get back to Monica,” she said, still not entirely believing that they were on a first name basis.  He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think she’s going to want to see me like this, considering how she feels about the guy,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Well, considering the fact that he thinks you two are romantically involved, what do you think he’s doing right now?”  She gave him a somewhat questioning look, like don’t be an idiot.  Reality struck him with her words and he felt a knot tie in his stomach.<br>
<br>
“Oh, @#%$!”  Doggett ran out the door.  The entire drive back to the FBI building, he kept thinking ‘She’s never gonna forgive me.’<br>

She raised her head and smiled at him, though it was more of a sympathetic smile than a ‘glad to see you’ smile.<br>
<br>
“What did Folmer want?”  She asked.  He cringed a little.  Hearing her refer to him by his last name was a little unnerving.<br>
<br>
“Nothin’, just a little man to man talk,” he smiled.  The voice and body were going to take some getting used to, as well as his mannerisms.  But, he didn’t know Doggett that well, so he hoped that he was pulling the impression off.  She gave him a look.<br>
<br>
“Yeah right.  Listen, John, I’m sorry you got involved in this,” she apologized.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”  He asked, as he walked over to her.  She got out of her seat so they were both standing.<br>
<br>
“My relationship with him was over a long time ago, I don’t know why he’s acting like this,” she said, raising her brown eyes to meet his hazel ones.<br>
<br>
“Maybe he’s just having a hard time seeing you with somebody else,” he tried to explain, without getting angry.  He gave her a little grin to try and be comforting.<br>
<br>
“I guess,” she said shaking her head.  “But it’s not like you and I are involved like that, I mean, we’re friends, and partners, but…” she paused between the thoughts.  She wasn’t comfortable having this conversation with him, knowing that he didn’t feel the same way about her as she felt about him.  ‘Leave the past in the past.’<br>
<br>
Folmer leaned down a little, and brought her chin up with his finger so she had to look him in the eye.  She was a little scared; she hadn’t seen that look in his eyes before and couldn’t put her finger on what was different.  Then he dipped his head and kissed her.  Her eyes grew wide from complete shock.  ‘This isn’t happening, this isn’t happening; I’m asleep at my desk.  Damn it!  Wake up Monica!’  But he only drew her closer, bringing his arm around her back and pulling her firmly to him.  She closed her eyes and began to reciprocate.  Seconds later, the office door flew open and they parted.  She saw Folmer in the doorway.<br>
<br>
“You son of a bitch!”  He yelled, and practically leapt at Folmer, punching him square in the eye.  Folmer laughed, rubbing the sore eye.  Reyes just stared at both of them like they were crazy.<br>
<br>
“I imagine the shiner’s really going to hurt once you get back in your own body,” Folmer chuckled.  Doggett seethed; so upset he couldn’t come up with a rational thought.  Reyes’s eyes grew wide as she started to comprehend the situation.<br>
<br>
“Oh, God.”  Was all she managed to get out.  Folmer started to leave, only pausing for a second.<br>
<br>
“Tell Mulder to put a rush on it, I really would like to be back in my own body before this eye starts hurting.”  With that, he walked away, a cocky grin on his face.  He always found out the truth.<br>
<br>
Reyes turned her back to Doggett, not wanting to face him after what happened, even if he was in Folmer’s body.  He reached out, putting his hand on her shoulder.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry Monica, I’m sorry I didn’t get here in time to stop him,” he apologized.  She still didn’t turn around.  She didn’t think she could face him, as the red color her face had turned would surely give away her embarrassment at the situation.  “Scully’s trying to figure out what happened and how to reverse it, we think it has something to do with the fused coins,” he explained, all the time thinking, ‘She’s never gonna forgive me.’  Reyes turned around to face him.<br>
<br>
“I’m so sorry John, I’m so sorry.”  He wrinkled his brow, wondering why she was apologizing.<br>
<br>
“I knew there was something wrong, but I didn’t go with my instinct, because…” she trailed off and turned away again.  She really didn’t want to have some big discussion about how she wanted it to be him, because that would mean that he returned her feelings, feelings she had been trying to hide for so long.  His eyebrows rose as he understood what was going on, or what he thought was going on.<br>
<br>
“Geez Monica, I hope you know that I would never force myself on you like that,” he said.  She bowed her head, then shook it, and looked back at him.<br>
<br>
“He didn’t force himself,” she said, barely audible.<br>
<br>
“What?”  He asked, surely not having heard what he thought he heard.  They looked each other in the eye.<br>
<br>
“He didn’t force himself,” she said again, at her normal volume.  Doggett’s jaw dropped and he had to force himself to shut it.  <br>
<br>
“Oh.”  He paused for what seemed like forever.  “I, I didn’t know that…”<br>
<br>
“I know, I know,” she rambled, trying to come up with the words that would make the whole situation go away, or at least make it bearable.  Then he grinned a grin, almost reminiscent of one of Folmer’s own sly grins.  “What?”  She asked, weary of what he was thinking.<br>
<br>
“I just thought of a way good old Brad could make this up to us, after all he owes me for taking our first kiss,” he smiled.  She couldn’t believe what she was hearing, but she smiled too, and nodded.<br>

The effects reversed themselves within 24 hours, along with leaving a hole in the floor where they had left the fused burning coins, which was never to be seen again.<br>
<br>
Reyes came into the office, with her car keys in hand.<br>
<br>
“You ready?”  She asked.  Doggett smiled back at her, standing up.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, just finished the last of the paperwork.”  He grabbed his jacket as they headed out the door.  “I still can’t believe they approved our taking vacation time at the same time.”  She smiled.  <br>
<br>
“Well, I think it probably helped that I signed the forms when you were still in his body,” she answered.  He stopped and looked at her.<br>
<br>
“You didn’t?”  It was more of a statement than a question.  She shrugged and smiled.  “Well, if I had known you knew how to forge his signature…” She laughed.<br>
<br>
“I think the fact that we bought our vacation package using his credit cards is enough, don’t you?”  They both smiled and left the building to start their vacation, together.<br>
