Passion DeMarse was not impressed. In her young life she had already seen excess done in such a garish style it was almost consider art. Well, at least Madonna thought it was art. Madonna was a fine pop music icon, but sometimes her taste and style in clothing and interior decoration did not leave much to be desired. And looking around the lobby of The Donald's apartment complex, Passion thought that the two of them, Madonna and Donald Trump, would get along fabulously. Passion was met by Mr. Lofton's aid, Sean Latvitson, who personally led her to the bank of elevators. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm very glad that you are prompt, Ms. Marse. The boss loves those who are on time.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss DeMarse,&quot; Passion corrected the aid. &quot;I am very well aware that my 'host' is very important. I just wish I knew who my host was.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
When she returned Lofton's call, he insisted that they meet in Trump Tower, but for some reason he didn't state the identity of the mysterious person who wanted to meet her. He/she had to be big because the meeting was taking place on private ground. If the meeting were to take place at Justin's restaurant and the person in question was Jermaine DuPree, Madonna would be reading about it in Richard Johnson's page 6 column in the New York Post the following morning. &quot;Hmmm, pity that it wasn't on neutral ground,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;It wouldn't hurt to shake those fools at Maverick up!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The elevator deposited its occupants to the 83 floor, almost to the penthouse. For some unknown reason, Passion's heart started to beat a little faster. She didn't understand why. It was like her mind was trying to remember something, something important. She felt excited for some reason. After all, she had met almost everyone in the industry, so she was somewhat jaded at the prospect of meeting yet another bigwig, why did she feel almost apprehensive? &quot;Here we are,&quot; stated the aid. He fished out the key and opened the door and gestured her inside. &quot;This was one of Mr. Trump's personal suites. When the boss moved in, he made some changes.&quot; Passion had never seen such tasteful opulence in her life. It was hard to describe the contents of the massive entryway and the main room, suffice it to say that some of the world's finest artwork graced the walls, furniture that had to be museum pieces graced highly polished marble floors, and overhead a massive crystal chandelier, obviously imported from Austria, hung proudly in its majesty. Passion started to unconsciously pull at her Versace black miniskirt. She was dressed in the height of fashion: black mock turtle neck, black double breasted leather VS blazer with miniskirt, 4 and a half inch stiletto heels, again by Versace, but something told her that she was in the presence of someone really, really important and she felt suddenly nervous about her outfit and hair. She let it cascade down her back, was it professional? Did she look like a hoogie from Melrose Place? It seemed suddenly important. &quot;Please sit down,&quot; the aid said. &quot;They will be with you in a minute. May I get you something to drink? Coffee or tea?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;No, nothing. Thank you,&quot; said Passion. She fought to regain some control of herself. She tried to think. There was something familiar about these surroundings. She could almost figure out who lived here, but for the life of her she couldn't. . . . <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Ms. DeMarse,&quot; said a soft voice from behind her.<br>
<br>
<br>
Passion's heart stopped. She said simply, almost in a whisper, &quot;Michael Jackson.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Michael smiled and gently grabbed her hand. He noticed how absolutely beautiful she was. His eyes traveled up and down her perfect figure. He studied every line, every curve of her shapely body. It seemed as if time stopped for that moment. Nothing was said between the two. Passion was in disbelief of who was standing in front of her. The last time she saw him was on the cover of a tabloid, with his face covered with a mask, and he was in the presence of his first wife, Lisa Marie. Michael's jet black hair was straight, and pulled back in a ponytail. He had on black jeans and a white t-shirt. Passion said to herself, &quot;Damn, this man is absolutely fine!&quot; Terrence Lofton walked in and noticed the electricity between them. &quot;Oh boy, here we go again!&quot; he mumbled to himself. &quot;HARUMPH, AHEM! Hello, Miss DeMarse&quot; he said, holding out his hand with the hopes that Michael would finally let go of hers. Michael dropped her hand, looked down slightly embarrassed, and cleared his throat, while Passion shook Terrence's hand. Michael snapped back into the attitude of a business man.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Take a seat Miss DeMarse and let's get down to business.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;What can I do for you Mr. Jackson?&quot; Passion said while gaining her composure.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be blunt. I have started a new label, which will be directed towards the dance community. I just completed the funding for this new venture. I want you to be the president. I want you to pick your own staff, ect.. Name your salary,&quot; Michael pulled some documents out of his brief case. He was about to say something, but Passion interrupted him.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;No offense Mr. Jackson, but what makes you think that I would just jump ship like that?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Michael smirked, &quot;I know the Fonk Brothers... I know about your current disappointment...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you know about my current disappointment? What do you know about the Fonk Brothers?&quot; Passion spat out.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Madonna told me that you almost signed them a month ago. Freddy shot it down, but she looked at them again and she thought it would be a good idea after all. She just had a meeting with them the other day to pitch that previous offer, you know, the one you crafted?&quot; Passion was apparently steamed and unable to hide it well.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Madonna knew that I was trying to sign them?&quot; she said to herself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Michael moved in for the kill and twisted the knife. &quot;You weren't informed? I see that you weren't. Madonna is a wonderful person, but she tends to take credit for other people's hard work. You know how it is in this industry. Now about my offer...&quot; Michael said with a smile.<br>
<br>
<br>
Passion sat there in utter disbelief and disgust. She didn't like the sheer arrogance that Michael just displayed. It was highhanded. Of course what Madonna did was highhanded also. After Madonna balled her out in front of the staff, Madonna would then go and sign the Fonk Brothers herself with all due media attention and respect from the industry making Passion in turn, look incompetent in front of all of Maverick's employees. She stabbed her in the throat. It was sheer, unmitigated arrogance! No doubt arrogance and highhanded behavior was the main reason both of these two people (Jackson and Madonna) were rich, famous, and powerful. But she still did not have to like it. She would have to leave Madonna's label for this. Jackson wanted her badly. But she wasn't going to make herself look too easy, at least not yet. So she clamped down on her anger and confusion and asked a seemingly strange question to Mr. Jackson in light of what she just found out. &quot;Again, Mr. Jackson ... why should I jump ship?&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
<br>
Michael looked surprised. &quot;I am giving you the power to run my new label. Like Freddy LeMann, you will be able to pick and choose your own talent. This is an opportunity most would kill for. Are you turning me down?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Passion smiled calmly and looked Jackson dead in the eyes. &quot;You see, in spite of all the drama at Maverick, I am still in a position of influence. I do not wish to brag, but I am responsible for much of the current success at that label and though it may be ignored by the president and CEO, I wager it doesn't go unnoticed by the parent company. A very important juncture is coming soon. I could find myself sitting very pretty, or standing around without a place to sit down. Your offer comes at a very interesting time, Mr. Jackson. I need some time to think carefully about ALL of my options. One other thing, do you know if Maverick signed the Fonk Brothers yet?&quot; Michael smiled for he knew that his bait had worked. He knew that he had signed Miss DeMarse despite her cool demeanor. &quot;Not to my knowledge, Passion.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That's Ms. DeMarse, Mr. Jackson,&quot; Passion said with more than a little anger. &quot;I'll leave now. Thank you for your very generous offer. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.&quot; She rose and gave Jackson a very firm hand shake.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me show you out,&quot; said Lofton. He walked Passion out of the penthouse leaving Michael alone. She's stunning, he thought to himself and intelligent. A very dangerous package for a man like him, a man who likes the chase and the hunt. If he were a single man, he winced and corrected himself, an unencumbered man, he would definitely go after her. But he was not a single man.<br>
<br>
<br>
The phone rang. &quot;Hello babe. It's me.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhhhhhh, who is this?&quot; Michael asked. It was unfortunate but his wife and ex-wife sounded very similar on the phone.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This is the woman who gave you the best b--- j-- of your life!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This doesn't sound like Brooke,&quot; Michael smirked. He knew who it was now.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You bastard!&quot; the woman giggled over the phone. &quot;Just for that, I'm not going to come over. It's a pity too because I'm so f---ing wet...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh are you? What have you been doing? Where are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm in the limo...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;And you're dripping wet, in the limo coming over here. You aren't masturbating in front of the driver are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;What kind of woman do you take me for?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The type of woman that would record a simulated phone sex session with my baby sister!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You're not going to let me live that down are you Mike? Why don't you let it go? Haven't you punished me long enough for my little lapse in judgment?&quot; There was silence on the other end of the phone. &quot;Mike ... are you still there?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just thinking about the word punishment... hmmm, if you do come over tonight you'll have to tell me what you were doing to make you so excited.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you want me to tell you over the phone? Maybe I should! If I tell you in person you might get mad...&quot; Lisa Marie trailed off, and then preceded to tell Michael every little detail about how and why she was in the state she was in.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; Michael smiled. &quot;It looks like some discipline will be in order ... c'mon over, I can't wait!&quot; He hung up the phone. Teddy Lofton reentered the room. &quot;I don't know how well that went, Mike. She seemed put out.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Its called divide and conquer, Teddy. DeMarse was stabbed in the back at Maverick. I simply let her know about it,&quot; Michael smiled as he looked out at the fabulous view from his windows of all of lower Manhattan. &quot;Well,&quot; said Lofton, &quot;I think the fact that YOU back stabbed Madonna might have a little bit to do with her 'discomfort.'&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ted, I may have an estate named Neverland, but I have never lived in a fantasy land!! If you don't think that she'll leave Maverick now after the Fonk Brothers fiasco, think again. They haven't been signed yet, Phantasy Records have placed a deal before them. If Demarse approaches them again, they might forgo Phantasy and come to me. They were prepared to sign a deal with Warner before LeMann shot them down.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Lofton said. &quot;You want a two for one deal, the Fonk Brothers and DeMarse?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, it's a three for one. The Fonk Brothers are the main producers for the group, The Edge for IL Records in Britain.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;They're the hottest trip hop band in Europe,&quot; Teddy said. &quot;You are hoping that DeMarse's signing those producers will bring you...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The big prize in the crackerjack box!! She'll back stab Madonna all right. Hell, why do you think Madonna was trying to sign them now? She is in a power struggle with LeMann for ownership and control of Maverick. Years ago, when Warner Brothers offered her her own label, she couldn't be bothered to actually run it herself, so she let LeMann, her manager do it. He only wanted a &quot;mere&quot; 25 percent ownership of the joint venture. Like a fool, Madonna gave him operational control of the label AND 25 percent. Remember, Warner's GAVE Madonna 50%! She only owns 25% of her own business! Soon Madonna will have a shot at complete ownership and control because she, LeMann and Warner have an option to buy each other out. She needs as much raw capital as she can get. Signing the hottest act in Europe to a North American deal could give her a big media boost, the prestige and clout would give her an 'edge' over her president especially at the bank where she will need to go if she wants to get rid of LeMann once and for all. Its a pity she's gonna lose. I've got it all calculated, I know every move Madonna and LeMann have made, and I've checkmated them. They forgot the first rule of chess: protect your queen! I believe I've captured DeMarse!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Teddy looked at Michael. He sometimes marveled at the man's utter brilliance when it came to business. He was like a cold, unfeeling machine at times, calculating variables, contemplating moves. &quot;What about Madonna? Didn't she tell you some of this in confidence?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't help it if she talks too much. Besides, she won't take it personal. She'll take it as a learning experience. I've told her time and time again to become more level headed when involved in business. I can't help it if she doesn't listen to me. After all, its only business!&quot; Michael said to Teddy. He glanced nervously at his watch for a second. He wondered what was keeping his next guest. He was about to pardon himself and make a quick phone call but he was interrupted by the door bell. &quot;Um, Ted,&quot; began Michael, &quot;I'm expecting a guest...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Teddy knew the score. Mike was expecting one of the women in his life. Probably Lisa. If his fans only knew what a consummate player Michael truly was instead of the Peter Pan man-child image that he allowed to perpetuate. &quot;It's cool, Mike. Should I leave out the back door?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course not, why don't you stay and say hello?&quot; Michael said as he went to answer the door. He opened the door to reveal Lisa in a black full length mink coat. &quot;Hello my honey,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Lisa!! It's eighty degrees outside! How can you wear that hot thing? And you know how I feel about cruelty to animals! How can you wear that thing?&quot; Michael asked aghast.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lisa Marie gave Michael that little half smile her father made so famous. &quot;I'm sorry to offend. Here, let me ... take it off.&quot; She took off her fur to reveal 4 inch Gucci stiletto heels, and NOTHING ELSE. She strolled through the Manhattan apartment where she once lived, naked, clicking her heels against the marble entryway trailing her fur along behind her. What she didn't know was that Ted Lofton was in the living room looking as shocked as he could be. Lisa Marie blushed red all over. Michael was surprised that she could in fact, still blush over things. &quot;Teddy, you remember my first wife, Lisa Marie?&quot; Michael said with a smirk as Lisa covered herself as best she could with her fur coat and shook Mr. Lofton's hand....<br>
<br>
