Chapter 1<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mother! Father!” Serena screamed as the monster from her dreams haunted her.<br>
Michael and Angelina rushed to her room.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sweetheart wake up!” Michael said holding her so she couldn’t kick him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Michael?” Angelina asked, “What’s wrong with her?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “She is in a deep sleep.” Michael said, “Fetch the nurse, woman.”<br>
She started but hesitated, Michael has a habit of calling her that, and she is trying to break him of that. The nurse, Andrea, came in with some warm water and a towel. She wet the towel and put it on Serena’s head.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I must away to the other children.” Angelina said as she went into the hallway. She went to Matthew and Donna’s room. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mother?” Donna asked, “What is wrong with Serena?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “A bad dream, darling. Go back to sleep.” She said comforting her middle child.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Matthew is sound sleep.” Michael said coming in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Goodnight, Father, Mother.” Donna said closing her eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Goodnight, love.” Angelina said kissing her head.<br>
Michael and Angelina walked back to Serena’s room. She was sitting up drinking chamomile.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Are you alright?” Angelina asked, “You gave us a fright.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m fine, Mother.” She said looking at her father position himself over by the harp. He wanted to play for her, sort of like playing a lullaby.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Father!” she said, “Matthew is asleep.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I always played the harp for you.” He said dismayed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I know, but tis late and we have to venture to Alexandria tomorrow.” She said taking a sip.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Not if you don’t get enough sleep.” Angelina said tucking her in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mother would you sing? To ease me?” she asked with a slight smile.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If your father can accompany me.” She said looking at Michael. <br>
Serena nodded. Michael gave Angelina the key, and they began the lullaby. Serena went to sleep in a matter of minutes. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While Angelina was singing, her voice echoed throughout the castle and over <br>
Musica to a little island, Thaylia. Adriana, an evil witch lived there. She wasn’t ugly, she was enchanting. The only thing about her was her bitterness. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, Angelina, that voice so pretty.” He cackled hovering over a caldron. <br>
Her hunch back of a servant was next to her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Get the vial, Snubbie.” She ordered, “On the eve of Queen Angelina’s birthday I will slip this in her cake and she will fall into a sleep, then I will steal her voice so I can have the most beautiful voice. Ever!”<br>
Snubbie brought the vial over to her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And then I get to keep her, after we kill King Michael?” he asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Kill? We can’t kill King Michael, he is too fine.” She laughed to herself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What about the prince and princess’?” he asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We will drown them. Once I am impregnated with the Michael’s child Musica will be mine!” she laughed her evil voice filling the cave.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I can keep her right?” he asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If I want you to have her.” She answered, “I have some plans for her. Queen Angelina, former princess of Tunisia. Ha Ha Ha.” <br>
She continued to laugh as the cave echoed her laugh. Snubbie joined in and she put a toadstool in his mouth to shut him up.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Back on Musica, Angelina was combing her long brownish red hair. Her soft cocoa skin seemed to glow against the candle light. Michael wrapped his arms around her waist.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Dearest love.” She started, “Our children-”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Are asleep. I know.” He said kissing her neck.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh. Michael, do we have to go to Alexandria?”  she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We have to establish a trade, and negotiate peace.” Michael said laying next to her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh okay. I just fear Thaylia.” She said closing her eyes. Michael wrapped his arms around her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the morning Donna,6, came into her parents room.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mother, Father!” she shouted jumping on the bed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Donna, away.” Michael said helping her off the bed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But Father, tis time we venture for Alexandria, Serena and Matt are ready.” She said pleading with him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Okay, wake thy mother.” Michael said sitting up. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mother.” She said shaking her.<br>
She stirred, then opened her eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Good morning Mother!” she said happily.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Morning sweet child.” She said getting up.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Wake the nurse and fetch the butler.” Michael said sending Donna away.<br>
She left<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why dost thou send her away?” Angelina asked walking over to him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So we can be alone….” Michael purred in her ear, pulling her into the bathroom with him.<br>
