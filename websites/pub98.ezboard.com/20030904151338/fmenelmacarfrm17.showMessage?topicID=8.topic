<br>
After Drundam's rise to the power Jarasmine was quick to help him establish control.  The Dark Elves ignored Jarasmine for the most part.  His pale white human skin was acceptable since it showed he wasn't a partaker of the sun.  Jarasmine setup a magical barrier once again preventing Archetype from using his scrying methods to see them.<br>
<br>
Soon after those measures where built, the flayers slowly flocked into their caverns.  The Drow hated all things and did not want to tolerate these monsters.  Drundam made them tolerate them like he did with Jarasmine.  The Mind Flayers respected there territory never feeding on the productive citizens.  They did however free the colony of those who where not willing to work.  The prisons became empty quickly because of the new inhabitants.<br>
<br>
Jarasmine moved in and out of the colony coordinating with Drundam.  Drundam listened but he had an air of pride about him now.  He would kill Jarasmine but he had adopted Jarasmines goals and needed him.  To unite Teir'Dal under one leadership.  Drundam knew that one of them would eventually have to die.  It was a matter of time, however he too was planning in his head and he knew Jarasmine was not perfect in his calculations.<br>
<br>
Drundam had the hole in the ceiling repaired.  All that remained of the wound that forced him to return to his Moon Drow body was a muddy scar.  The female drow despised him it was their nature.  A single mind flayer sat beside his throne.  It was his gaurd and scryed all incoming minds before they spoke to him to prevent assasination attempts.<br>
<br>
The Queen was chained to the base of the silver steps leading up to the throne.  Every night male guards escorted her to her private chambers and chained her their as well.  This prevented her from associating with the other females and plotting a revolt.<br>
<br>
The colony began to thrive beneath the ground of Teir'Dal.  They dug deeper into the vast under dark.  They where a careful race and only ventured as far as the highest deep dwarf colony.<br>

They had been raided the night before by large magical beasts.  He was all that remained, their bodies where gone.  Their blood still stained the dirt.. flies landed upon it.  The sun was rising.. and it would burn.  He had to hurry home he stood and felt faint he braced himself on a near by tree almost falling into it.<br>
<br>
He had dreamt he had met a black drow, with dark black skin.  He dreamt that it stole the life from him he didn't know he was a creation.  That what he dreamt had really occured and the memories in his magically programmed brain where real.<br>
<br>
He knew this land well he walked as fast as he could stumbling along the way.  He had to hurry home before the sun damaged his skin, he had never been exposed to it and all Drow feared it.<br>
<br>
The sky became a blazing orange and his heart raced.  In the distance he could now see his mountain and it's large opening and stone sculptured over hang.  It was only a few miles away now.  <br>
<br>
The sky was now a yellow and it began to glare over the mountain in front of him. The sun's giant orb began to peer over the mountain thrusting the mountains shadow on him.  If only he was in better condition he would already be there.  The creatures must of really harmed him as he could barely keep upright let alone jog.<br>
<br>
The drow doors will still open he could barely make them out now.  They kept them open until the shadow watcher announced the shadows had passed their mark and sound the horns to close them.  They where kept open to allow air to circulate into the drow cavern.  They did a lot of metal works and the horns marked the end of the work day because the air would no longer circulate.<br>
<br>
He had to hurry and it was only another mile but he couldn't hardly move.  Prince Jan Dahai waved his arms high above his head.  He looked over his attire his weapons where missing.  However the silver buttons that held together his trouser where still in tact.<br>
<br>
He could feel the suns glares on his skin now as the shadow had retreated closer to the mountain.  He swore the sun rose to fast in these parts.  It burned and blinded him, he could no longer see the mountain infront of him.  He flailed his hands wildly.  He tried to yell but his throat was dry and all that came out was a dry coarse sound. <br>
<br>
He removed his trousers and used the silver buttons to reflect the sun's glares at the entrance.  He swung them wildly in a fan motion back and forth.  He blacked out minutes later as he heard the horn sounding in the distance. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.thebananamovement.tk" target="top">Jekh dilo kerel but dile hai but dile keren dilimata</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://collectiveunconscious.port5.com/Animations/Roma.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elenaran<br>

Jan Dahai couldn't see a thing he was blind he could here the people about him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Barely&quot; Spoke a harsher male voice.  The words comforted him as he faded in and out of consciousness.  He had spent an entire day in the sun and his skin was badly burnt.  Using the silver on his trousers as a beacon backfired.  Nobody noticed instead his legs too where burnt.  He didn't look Drow, he looked like a twisted monster.<br>
<br>
The Drow did not have many healers, their diety icons where over all did not tend to revolve around healing.  However one of the lesser gods Andrama a male god who is represented as a chained slave to the higher gods was a healer.<br>
<br>
The Drow clerics who pursued Adrama as their main focus where always male, as the female driven Heirachy would never worship a male Diety.  One such cleric Eronis tended to Jan Dahai day and night mending his tormented flesh.<br>
<br>
Jan Dahai sat up he didn't talk anymore.  He was a prince amongst his people and now a vile disruption of their beautiful race.  They should of just killed him, why hadn't they he thought.  Why waste the efforts of Eronis one of the few Clarics of Adrama which would be better spent tending to winners of the pit fights.  Jan Dahai wondered but that is all he could do, he was to proud to speak to anyone in his state so he simply sat in his room as Eronis took care of him. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.thebananamovement.tk" target="top">Jekh dilo kerel but dile hai but dile keren dilimata</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://collectiveunconscious.port5.com/Animations/Roma.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Scrolls<br>

His wounds skin once again began to glisten like that of his dark species.  He could make out shapes and images but not distinguish one drow from the other.  The damage was immense and the healer had spent too much time on him already.  Eronis would not heal Jan Dahai anymore; he had been called to return to the pit fights. <br>
<br>
The healer Eronis assured Jan Dahai that his voice had been healed.  He was however to pride to find out and was now content not to speak.  He simply would listen, and he listened very well.  He had gathered through the many rumors that circulated in the caverns as random information flowed through it pumping itself like blood through the veins of an enormous giant.<br>
<br>
The rumors spoke of scouts seeing a lot of activity in the Moon Drow, a change in leadership to a new King.  This was an abomination of the highest order amongst the drow.  The Cleric said the gods would intervene and remove him for his bold revolt.  <br>
<br>
The Queen made a great effort to instill fear into her society that the gods would punish the Moon drow for this transaction, and that she had been ordered to help them correct it.  This was a requirement; other drow encampments and colonies that heard would too strike out.  <br>
<br>
Any drow with any intelligence knew that females must crush any chance of a male being in a high position less they corrupt neighboring communities and begin a revolution of equality.  Their strict society would destroy itself if this hardcore female rule was broken.<br>
<br>
Jan Dahai had heard the manufactures produce weapons at an insane rate.  He knew then that war was imminent; the Queen would not wait for another society to make the necessary correction.  She planned for her colony to eradicate them herself. <br>
<br>
Jan Dahai thought this was foolish, had the scouts not determined how this male over took an entire society.  What if they had a secret weapon that would destroy his colony too?  He wanted to inform her of this, but he was too proud to speak.<br>
