<br>
Well I'm trading places with Chiron on this one but hopefully I can get the job done.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
First of all:<br>
<br>
The Gene-ite Mission Statement: The Mission of the Gene-ite Faction is to raise public awareness of the ideals represented by the brand name Gene Roddenberry, as they relate to Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda. <br>
<br>
Now on to the Gene-ite categories:<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Intelligent Science Fiction</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Well at first I was thinking that this episode completely deconstructed the rules set out in ADDB.  However, after multiple viewings I feel that it was consistent with ADDB and the reason for that is that the Rhade that ends up in that coffin is the Rhade that sacrificed himself to allow Dylan to proceed.<br>
<br>
My Score for intelligent science fiction: 17 of 20<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Complex heroes and villains</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This episode epitomizes what I want in terms of complexity.  There were no clear lines between good and evil.  It was more a case of &quot;who's the right person for the job at the right time&quot;.  I love that kind of ambiguity and so too would Gene I think.  I think that every character in this episode exibited some complexity.  Right down to holo Dylan.  Rhade is a man who uses the wrong means to try and achieve what he believes to be a noble goal and he not only fails but gets to wake up centuries later and face the consequences of that failure head on.<br>
<br>
Moreover, he makes the very mistakes he accuses his people of by underestimating both Bolivar's worth as an ally but also his danger as an adversary.<br>
<br>
He is both a villain AND a hero because in the end he sees that the means (giving the future a chance) DO justify his means (self sacrifice).  I have compared this episode to City on the Edge of Forever and Yesterday's Enterprise and I stand by that comparison.<br>
<br>
19.5 of 20<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Social Commentary</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The idea of the right person in the wrong place at the wrong time is not new in genre television.  I've already pointed out City on the Edge of Forever and Yesterday's Enterprise as examples.<br>
<br>
But to me this one had a unique kick to it because it was so multi layered.  It was not just about one man being unable to win because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but because his own nature wouldn't allow it.  The commentary on the Nietzscheans and what has gone wrong with them is to me very powerful in this one.  That Rhade accepts what he has to do to make things right and at the same time impose his will on the universe is one of the most tragic moments (and most brilliant) in the ep.<br>
<br>
 Score for social commentary-19.5 of 20<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Evolution of the Human potential: </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This one gets a lower score than some might think.  On the one hand, Rhade's decision that he must sacrifice himself for the greater good shows the acknowledgment of the long game that has so been missing in recent portrayals of Nietzscheans.<br>
<br>
However, Rhade wouldn't have HAD to sacrifice himself had he not been shortsighted enough not to see the value in allying with Bolivar and the risks of not doing so.<br>
<br>
And, Beka is unable to realize her potential as a hero with Rhade.  Dylan is the one that makes this possible.<br>
<br>
Thus, my score for Evoloution of the human potential is a 16 of 20<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Action that is part of the story</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This episode was supposed to be a clip show.  Ash and Zack and the editors did a great job not only of NOT letting it seem like a clip show but also of getting into some real insight into the Nietzschean psyche.<br>
<br>
Score for Action that is part of the story: 18 of 20<br>

The reason it is too high is because it focuses almost completely on Rhade's role in the ep.  The review ignores the way the episode rapes the character of Andromeda.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I agree that most of the characters demonstrated complexity.  But I think that what they did to Andromeda in the episode should account for more than -.5 in the scoring.  The character is worth more than that and deserves to be written more respectfully and intelligently than she was in this episode.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I had stopped watching Drom.  Ignored all the reruns and such... but then the announcement came that Zack &amp; Ash were leaving the show, and out of loyalty, I decided to watch (at least) their episodes...<br>
<br>
I'm really glad that I watched The Unconquerable Man.  It was not without its disappointments, but in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable, DROM-like episode!  <br>

<br>
I really didn't have much trouble with the science, since it was no more insane than the insanity of Oroborus, which  it tied into.  But as always, we have to remember that the category is not just about intelligent science - its about intelligent fiction as well... and there were a few weird spots here and there.  For instance, the need to have a holo-Dylan was just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>painful</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, necessary plot contrivance though it was, it totally undermined the entire premise of the ep.  Having Rhade consulting with holo-Dylan made Dylan The Unconquerable Man, in my opinion, and that really rubbed me the wrong way.  I also felt that it was inconsistent for Rommie to accept Rhade's leadership (while in the same episode cheerfully holding Tyr captive for assassination...), and I felt that the dynamic between Tyr and Rhade started out positively, and then got shot in the foot.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I still thought the episode was well written, and give it 15 out of 20 points in this category.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Complex heroes and villains</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I agree that Rhade was shown to be very complex in this episode.  As Nietzscheans should always be.  As Tyr used to be...  But I'm terribly disappointed that Rhade shining as a Nietzschean in terms of complexity and depth meant that other characters had to be pidgeonholed into caricatures of themselves.  Tyr bore no resemblance to anyone I've ever cared about on this show - proving himself stupid beyond measure when finding himself with his feet glued to the floor sending out a shurikan, knowing that he's a sitting duck.  THIS was the time for glib conversation, but instead we have brain deadness...<br>
<br>
Rommie's snippiness isn't out of character, her failure to execute Rhade is.  Having gotten back online somehow, why would she tolerate Rhade, knowing that he killed in cold blood?  AND, since he was supposed to be confined to quarters, why do his orders stand?  He was almost a prisoner - and then proved to be a traitor!  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, others have said it, and I'll repeat it - Beka is great in this episode.  She is VERY BEKA, right down to leaving Rhade when she knew she had to.  AND, Trance's gold incarnation makes actual sense here... she's got superpowers, and that's icky for Drom, but at least it's written into the story in a way that makes it &quot;work.&quot;<br>
<br>
For Complex Heros and Villians, I give the ep 13 out of 20.<br>
<br>

<br>
To me, the social commentary here was about character - doing the right thing to the best of your ability, including understanding that sometimes you aren't the right man for the job.  What WAS unconquerable in Rhade was his character... he acted principly throughout (o.k.  Tyr execution excepted).  I honor that in him, and thank ZackAsh for giving us this look at the heroism of integrity.<br>
<br>
My score for social commentary: 16 of 20.<br>

<br>
I don't know if I agree with your interpretation of the category.  To me, evolution of the human potential isn't just that people evolve or don't, its that the episode shows that it is possible - this is the hope of the Gene-ite ideal.  Rhade isn't evolved - he is as principled as he ever was, and perhaps is devolved, having developed a prejudicial hatred of his own kind, Tyr isn't evolved, he's just a dumb Niet, Beka <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be evolved, since she recognizes that she isn't able to simply accept the ruthlessness of her own actions, even though it was a question of survival.  None of the other characters had opportunities to be shown as evolved or unevolved.  Looking then at the characters that did have such an opportunity, I have to conclude that the view of the writers was not hopeful at all - but rather pessimistic.  For this category then, I have to score fairly low: 12 of 20 - 6 points being Beka's willingness to look square at the consequences of her actions, and 6 points for Rhade doing the Un-Niet thing of self-sacrifice.<br>

Except for the final fight clip which, in context of the story made no sense, I thought the action in this ep was subdued, as was fitting.<br>

I gave the ep 16 of 20 points. <br>

SO overall, my total for the ep was 72 of 100.<br>

One of my least fave eps.<br>
<br>
consubstantial well yeah Im giving high marks for Rhade despite the fact that it's abundantly apparent that his very presence is what helps Tyr to fail and Beka to run.

<br>
Just watched it a fourth time (TUM not Menagerie...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
It certainly stands up to multiple viewings.<br>

Personally, I would be bleeding from the ears and nose if I viewed Unconquerable 4 times. Well, at least it didn't have Naz and Desiree. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=14.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.showNextMessage?topicID=14.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.emailToFriend?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.threadControl?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="slipstreambbs12353frm17">Announcements<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm24">The Underground Wire<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm18">General Discussion<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm7">Episodes<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm8">Andromeda Universe<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm13">Fan Fiction<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm25">Challenge Forum<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm15">Filk<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm12">Roleplaying<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm14">Web Sites<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm11">The Observation Deck<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm22">The Abyss<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm10">Science Fiction & Fantasy<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm19">Chat Room<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm20">Questions, Suggestions, and Feedback<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm9">Tech Questions<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm16">Officer's Quarters<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm21">The Black Hole</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#EFD68C>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353>Slipstream Underground</a><font color=#EFD68C> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7>Episodes</a> <font color=#EFD68C> - </font><a href="http://www.slipstreamunderground.com">Slipstream Underground</a><font color=#EFD68C> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
