However, each time I hear the song, I can't but help to think of them in a spiritual light.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My Father's Eyes - Eric Clapton<br>
<br>
Sailing down behind the sun, <br>
Waiting for my prince to come. <br>
Praying for the healing rain <br>
To restore my soul again. <br>
<br>
Just a toerag on the run. <br>
How did I get here? <br>
What have I done? <br>
When will all my hopes arise? <br>
How will I know him? <br>
When I look in my father's eyes. <br>
My father's eyes. <br>
When I look in my father's eyes. <br>
My father's eyes. <br>
<br>
Then the light begins to shine <br>
And I hear those ancient lullabys. <br>
And as I watch this seedling grow, <br>
Feel my heart start to overflow. <br>
<br>
Where do I find the words to say? <br>
How do I teach him? <br>
What do we play? <br>
Bit by bit, I've realized <br>
That's when I need them, <br>
That's when I need my father's eyes. <br>
My father's eyes. <br>
That's when I need my father's eyes. <br>
My father's eyes. <br>
<br>
Then the jagged edge appears <br>
Through the distant clouds of tears. <br>
I'm like a bridge that was washed away; <br>
My foundations were made of clay. <br>
<br>
As my soul slides down to die. <br>
How could I lose him? <br>
What did I try? <br>
Bit by bit, I've realized <br>
That he was here with me; <br>
I looked into my father's eyes. <br>
My father's eyes. <br>
I looked into my father's eyes. <br>
My father's eyes. <br>
<br>
My father's eyes. <br>
My father's eyes. <br>
I looked into my father's eyes. <br>
My father's eyes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That song was actually about his real father, whom Clapton never met.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Everything You Want - Vertical Horizon<br>
<br>
Somewhere they're speaking its already coming in <br>
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind <br>
You never could get it unless you were fed it <br>
And now your here and you don't know why <br>
But under skinned knees and the skid marks <br>
Past the places where you use to learn <br>
You howl and listen, listen and wait for the <br>
Echoes of angels that won't return <br>
<br>
[Chorus] <br>
He's everything you want <br>
He's everything you need <br>
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be <br>
He says all the right things at exactly the right time <br>
But he means nothing to you <br>
And you don't know why <br>
<br>
You're waiting for someone to put you together <br>
You're waiting for someone to push you away <br>
There's always another wound to discover <br>
There's always something more you wish he'd say <br>
[Chorus] <br>
<br>
But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind <br>
It's only what you're asking for <br>
And you'll be just fine with all of your time <br>
It's only what you're waiting for <br>
<br>
Out of the island into the highway <br>
Past the places where you might have turned <br>
You never did notice <br>
But you still hide away the angle of angels who won't return <br>
[Chorus] <br>
<br>
I am everything you want <br>
I am everything you need <br>
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be <br>
I say all the right things at exactly the right time <br>
But I mean nothing to you <br>
And I don't know why <br>
<br>
Don't know why, why <br>
Don't know<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I always think of this one as someone rejecting Christ - and they don't know why.  A sad song, but I like thinking of Christ as everything I want, need and everything inside of me that I wish I could be.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My Own Prison - Creed<br>
<br>
A court is in session, a verdict is in<br>
No appeal on the docket today<br>
Just my own sin<br>
The walls are cold and pale<br>
The cage made of steel<br>
Screams fill the room<br>
Alone I drop and kneel<br>
Silence now the sound<br>
My breath the only motion around<br>
Demons cluttering around<br>
My face showing no emotion<br>
Shackled by my sentence<br>
Expecting no return<br>
Here there is no penance<br>
My skin begins to burn<br>
So I held my head up high<br>
Hiding hate that burns inside<br>
Which only fuels their selfish pride<br>
We're all held captive<br>
Out from the sun<br>
A sun that shines on only some<br>
We the meek are all in one<br>
I hear a thunder in the distance<br>
See a vision of a cross<br>
I feel the pain that was given<br>
On that sad day of loss<br>
A lion roars in the darkness<br>
Only he holds the key<br>
A light to free me from my burden<br>
And grant me life eternally<br>
Should have been dead<br>
On a Sunday morning<br>
Banging my head<br>
No time for mourning<br>
Ain't got no time<br>
So I held my head up high<br>
Hiding hate that burns inside<br>
Which only fuels their selfish pride<br>
We're all held captive<br>
Out from the sun<br>
A sun that shines on only some<br>
We the meek are all in one<br>
I cry out to God<br>
Seeking only his decision<br>
Gabriel stands and confirms<br>
I've created my own prison<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
On of the most disturbing, yet powerful songs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Unforgiven - Creed<br>
<br>
I kept up<br>
With the prophecy you spoke<br>
I kept up with the message inside<br>
Lost sight of the irony<br>
Of twisted faith<br>
Lost sight of my soul and its void<br>
Think I'm unforgiven to this world<br>
Took a chance at deceiving myself<br>
To share in the consequence of lies<br>
Childish with my<br>
Reasoning and pride<br>
Godless to the extent that I died<br>
Think I'm unforgiven to this world<br>
Think I'm unforgiven<br>
Step inside the light and see the fear<br>
Of God burn inside of me<br>
The gold was put to flame<br>
To kill, to burn, to mold its purity<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Another negative angle, but it forces me to think.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Faceless Man - Creed<br>
<br>
I spent a day by the river<br>
It was quiet and the wind stood still<br>
I spent some time with nature<br>
To remind me of all that's real<br>
It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone<br>
And remember that you feel<br>
Again I stand against the Faceless Man<br>
Now I saw a face on the water<br>
It looked humble but willing to fight<br>
I saw the will of a warrior<br>
His yoke is easy and His burden is light<br>
He looked me right in the eyes<br>
Direct and concise to remind me<br>
To always do what's right<br>
Again I stand against the Faceless Man<br>
'Cause if the face inside can't see the light<br>
I know I'll have to walk alone<br>
And if I walk alone to the other side<br>
I know I might not make it home<br>
Again I stand against the Faceless Man<br>
Next time I see this face<br>
I'll say I choose to live for always<br>
So won't you come inside And never go away<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This one is practically in your face.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Higher - Creed<br>
<br>
When dreaming I'm guided through another world<br>
Time and time again<br>
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep<br>
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place<br>
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape<br>
From the life I live when I'm awake<br>
So let's go there<br>
Let's make our escape<br>
Come on, let's go there<br>
Let's ask can we stay?<br>
Can you take me higher?<br>
To the place where blind men see<br>
Can you take me higher?<br>
To the place with golden streets<br>
Although I would like our world to change<br>
It helps me to appreciate<br>
Those nights and those dreams<br>
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights<br>
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same<br>
The only difference is<br>
To let love replace all our hate<br>
So let's go there<br>
Let's make our escape<br>
Come on, let's go there<br>
Let's ask can we stay?<br>
Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time<br>
Up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams<br>
And make them mine<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I always liked this one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My Sacrifice - Creed<br>
<br>
Hello my friend we meet again<br>
It’s been a while where should <br>
we begin…feels like forever<br>
Within my heart are memories<br>
Of perfect love that you gave to me<br>
I remember<br>
<br>
When you are with me<br>
I’m free…I’m careless…I believe<br>
Above all the others we’ll fly<br>
This brings tears to my eyes<br>
My sacrifice<br>
<br>
We’ve seen our share of ups and downs<br>
Oh how quickly life can turn around in <br>
an instant<br>
It feels so good to reunite<br>
Within yourself and within your mind<br>
Let’s find peace there<br>
<br>
When you are with me<br>
I’m free…I’m careless…I believe<br>
Above all the others we’ll fly<br>

You always reached out to me and<br>

All those memories we share<br>
I will cherish every one of them<br>
The truth of it is there’s a right way to live<br>
And you showed me<br>
So now you live on in the words of a song<br>
You’re a melody<br>
<br>
You stand here with me now<br>
<br>
Just when fear blinded me <br>
you taught me to dream<br>
I’ll give you everything I am <br>
and still fall short of <br>
What you’ve done for me<br>
In this life that I live <br>
I hope I can give love unselfishly<br>

You’re my daily dose of reality<br>

Hey you're now thirsty <br>
Walking in the desert all alone <br>
Hey you're now searching <br>
Lost in isolation from your soul <br>
The bullets you bite <br>
From the pain you request <br>
You're finding harder to digest <br>
And the answers you seek <br>
Are the ones you destroy <br>
Your anger's well deployed <br>
<br>
Hey why can't you listen <br>
Hey why can't you hear <br>
Hey why can't you listen <br>
As love screams everywhere <br>
<br>
Hey you now hunger <br>
Feeding your mind with selfishness <br>
Hey you now wander <br>
Aimlessly around your consciousness <br>
Your prophecies fail <br>
And your thoughts become weak <br>
Silence creates necessity <br>
You're clothing yourself <br>
In the shields of despair <br>
Your courage now impaired <br>
<br>
You crucify all honesty <br>
No signs you see do you believe <br>
And all your words just twist and turn <br>
Reviving just to crash and burn <br>
You're fighting till the bitter end <br>
If only your heart could open up <br>
And listen<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

You pushed me down <br>
For all the world to see <br>
I guess that's your price <br>
For my loyalty <br>
So while you're tasting sin <br>
And swallowing pain <br>
Don't look at me <br>
To take your blame <br>
<br>
When you're willing to render <br>
To the guilt you concede <br>
When truth is your reason <br>
Then lay that blame on me <br>
When you unveil a conscience <br>
And with peace you agree <br>
When love is your constant <br>
Then lay that blame on me <br>
<br>
You lay me out <br>
In hopes that I'd wilt away <br>
But strength rained down <br>
And love provided shade <br>
So while the pageant of lies <br>
Still glow from your tongue <br>
Don't blame me for <br>
Your Kingdom Come <br>

Question your answers <br>
Truth has no anger <br>

Seeking again.<br>
<br>
I know a lot of the songs here are those which seem to be seeking God.  I don't know how many of the people in these groups are actually Christians, but from some of their lyrics, it looks like they are trying to get there. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man.<br>

Wondrous Stories<br>

I awoke this morning<br>
love laid me down by a river.<br>
Drifting I turned on upstream<br>
Bound for my forgiver.<br>
In the giving of my eyes to see your face.<br>
Sound did silence me<br>
leaving no trace.<br>
I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories.<br>
Beg to hear your wonderous stories.<br>

He spoke of lands not far<br>
or lands they were in his mind.<br>
Of fusion captured high<br>
where reason captured his time.<br>
In no time at all he took me to the gate.<br>
In haste I quickly checked the time.<br>
if I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories.<br>
Had to hear your wonderous stories.<br>

You're close<br>
and were you there to stand<br>
so cautiously at first and then so high.<br>
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky.<br>
I bid it to return<br>
to hear your wonderous stories.<br>
Return to hear your wonderous stories.<br>

<br>
I Won't Back Down by Tom Petty<br>
--------<br>
Well I won't back down, no I won't back down<br>
You can stand me up at the gates of hell<br>
But I won't back down<br>
<br>
Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around<br>
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down<br>
Gonna stand my ground and I won't back down<br>
<br>
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out<br>
Hey I will stand my ground<br>
And I won't back down.<br>
<br>
Well I know what's right, I got just on life<br>
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around<br>
But I'll stand my ground and I won't back down<br>
<br>
Hey baby there ain't no easy way out<br>
Hey I will stand my ground<br>
And I won't back down<br>
No, I won't back down <br>
------<br>
<br>
And another that makes me think about how God views us as His children and that we're here to do His work and depends on us as well:<br>
<br>
Depending On You<br>
-----<br>
I ain't never gonna let you down<br>
All you gotta do is trust me<br>
I would never make you some clown<br>
Baby why won't you trust me<br>
<br>
You give up so easily I don't know why you can't see<br>
I'm depending on you, don't let me down<br>
I'm depending on you<br>
<br>
Baby if you can't change the world<br>
Maybe you should just change yourself<br>
You u sed to be such a sweet young girl<br>
Why you wanna be someone else?<br>
<br>
You give up so easily<br>
I don't know why you can't see<br>
I'm depending on you<br>
Is it to late now<br>
I'm depending on you <br>

I have a hard time listening to it without crying.<br>
<br>
Solsbury Hill - Peter Gabriel<br>
<br>
Climbing up on Solsbury Hill<br>
I could see the city lights<br>
Wind was blowing, time stood still<br>
Eagle flew out of the night<br>
He was something to observe<br>
Came in close, I heard a voice<br>
Standing, stretching every nerve<br>
I had to listen had no choice<br>
I did not believe the information<br>
Just had to trust imagination<br>
My heart going boom boom boom<br>
Son, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home<br>
<br>
To keep in silence I resigned<br>
My friends would think I was a nut<br>
Turning water into wine<br>
Open doors would soon be shut<br>
So I went from day to day<br>
Though my life was in a rut<br>
Till I thought of what I'd say<br>
And which connection I should cut<br>
I was feeling part of the scenery<br>
I walked right out of the machinery<br>
My heart going boom boom boom<br>
Son, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home<br>
<br>
yeaah, back home<br>
<br>
When illusion spin her net<br>
I'm never where I want to be<br>
And liberty she pirouette<br>
When I think that I am free<br>
Watched by empty silhouettes<br>
Who close their eyes but still can see<br>
No one taught them etiquette<br>
So I will show another me<br>
Today I don't need a replacement<br>
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant<br>
My heart going boom boom boom<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nothing but a Child - Steve Earle<br>
<br>
Once upon a time in a far off land<br>
Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand<br>
Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night<br>
Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light<br>
<br>
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west<br>
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest<br>
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles<br>
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child<br>
<br>
Nothing but a child could wash these tears away<br>
Or guide a weary world into the light of day<br>
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles<br>
So once again we all can be children for awhile<br>
<br>
Now all around the world, in every Iittle town<br>
Everyday is heard a precious little sound<br>
And every mother kind and every father proud<br>
Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed<br>
<br>
And nothing but a child could wash these tears away<br>
Or guide a weary world into the light of day<br>
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles<br>
So once again we all can be children for awhile<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

by  Peter Gabriel</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Love I get so lost , sometimes <br>
days pass and this emptiness fills my heart <br>
when I want to run away <br>
I drive off in my car<br>
but whichever way I go<br>
I come back to the place you are<br>
All my instincts , they return <br>
and the grand facade , so soon will burn <br>
without a noise , without my pride <br>
I reach out from the inside <br>
In your eyes <br>
the light the heat <br>
in your eyes <br>
I am complete <br>
in your eyes <br>
I see the doorway to a thousand churches <br>
in your eyes <br>
the resolution of all the fruitless searches <br>
in your eyes <br>
I see the light and the heat <br>
in your eyes <br>
oh, I want to be that complete <br>
I want to touch the light <br>
the heat I see in your eyes <br>
Love , I don't like to see so much pain <br>
so much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away <br>
I get so tired of working so hard for out survival <br>
I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive <br>
And all my instincts , they return <br>
and the grand facade , so soon will burn <br>
without a noise , without my pride <br>
I reach out from the inside <br>
In your eyes <br>
the light the heat <br>
in your eyes <br>
I am complete <br>
in your eyes <br>
I see the doorway to a thousand churches <br>
in your eyes <br>
the resolution of all the fruitless searches <br>

I see the light and the heat <br>
in your eyes <br>
oh, I want to be that complete <br>
I want to touch the light ,<br>
the heat I see in your eyes <br>
in your eyes <br>
in your eyes <br>
in your eyes <br>
in your eyes <br>

<br>
I woke up and the world outside was dark<br>
All so quiet before the dawn<br>
Opened up the door and walked outside<br>
The ground was cold<br>
<br>
I walked until i couldn't walk anymore<br>
To a place i'd never been<br>
There was something stirring in the air<br>
In front of me, i could see<br>
<br>
More than this<br>
More than this<br>
So much more than this<br>
There is something else there<br>
When all that you had has all gone<br>
And more than this<br>
I stand<br>
Feeling so connected<br>
And i'm all there<br>
Right next to you<br>
<br>
It started when i saw the ship go down<br>
I saw them struggle in the sea<br>
And suddenly the picture disappears<br>
In front of me<br>
<br>
Now we're busy making all our busy plans<br>
On foundations built to last<br>
But nothing fades as fast as the future<br>
And nothing clings like the past, until we can see<br>
<br>
More than this<br>
More than this<br>
So much more than this<br>
There is something out there<br>
More than this<br>
It's coming through<br>
And more than this<br>
I stand alone and so connected<br>
And I'm all there<br>
Right next to you<br>
<br>
Oh then it's alright<br>
When with every day another bit falls away<br>
Oh but it's still alright, alright, alright<br>
And like words together we can make some sense<br>
<br>
Much more than this<br>
Way beyond imagination<br>
Much more than this<br>
Beyond the stars<br>
With my head so full<br>
So full of fractured pictures<br>
And i'm all there<br>
Right next to you<br>
So much more than this<br>
There is something else there<br>
When all that you had has all gone<br>

U2<br>
<br>
We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill <br>
As the day begs the night for mercy love <br>
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows <br>
Only scars carved into stone <br>
On the face of earth <br>
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill <br>
We see the sun go down in your eyes <br>
<br>
<br>
You run like river, on like a sea <br>
You run like a river runs to the sea <br>
<br>
<br>
And in the world a heart of darkness <br>
A fire zone <br>
Where poets speak their heart <br>
Then bleed for it <br>
Jara sang, his song a weapon <br>
In the hands of love <br>
You know his blood still cries <br>
From the ground <br>
<br>
<br>
It runs like a river runs to the sea <br>
It runs like a river to the sea <br>
<br>
<br>
I don't believe in painted roses <br>
Or bleeding hearts <br>
While bullets rape the night of the merciful <br>
I'll see you again <br>
When the stars fall from the sky <br>
And the moon has turned red <br>
Over One Tree Hill <br>
<br>
<br>
We run like a river <br>
Run to the sea <br>
We run like a river to the sea <br>
And when it's raining <br>
Raining hard <br>
That's when the rain will <br>
Break my heart <br>
<br>
<br>
Raining...raining in the heart <br>
Raining in your heart <br>
Raining...raining to your heart <br>
Raining, raining...raining <br>
Raining to your heart <br>
Raining...raining in your heart <br>
Raining in your heart.. <br>
To the sea <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh great ocean <br>
Oh great sea <br>
Run to the ocean <br>
Run to the sea <br>

Apparently, the latin phrases are actually the beginnings of certain Psalms and therefore don't quite translate effectively into english.  Litterally, it is almost &quot;Glorius, in you Lord - Glorius, exulted.  Like I said, it doesn't quite work.<br>
<br>
Actually, many of the songs on &quot;October&quot; have Christian undertones.  Some are really &quot;in your face&quot;.<br>

This one from &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; written by the English poet William Blake:<br>
<br>
Jerusalem <br>
<br>
And did those feet in ancient time<br>
Walk upon England's mountains green?<br>
And was the holy Lamb of God<br>
On England's pleasant pastures seen?<br>
<br>
And did the Countenance Divine<br>
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?<br>
And was Jerusalem builded here<br>
Among these dark Satanic mills?<br>
<br>
Bring me my bow of burning gold!<br>
Bring me my arrows of desire!<br>
Bring me my spear! O clouds unfold!<br>
Bring me my chariot of fire!<br>
<br>
I will not cease from mental fight,<br>
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand<br>
Till we have built Jerusalem<br>
In England's green and pleasant land.<br>
