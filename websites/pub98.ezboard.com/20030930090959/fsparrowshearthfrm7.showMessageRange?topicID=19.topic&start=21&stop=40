I was expecting maybe 2 or 3 replies. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  BTW, hey Eugene! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When I was starting to delve into this issue, I too used the &quot;metaphor&quot; argument. But two problems with that were quickly presented to me:<br>
<br>
1. many disciples left him over this: if it were merely a metaphor, then we are left with the conclusion that Christ let his own disciples leave him, when all he had to do is tell them he was using a metaphor. In other words, if he was using a metaphor, he knew *his own disciples* took it literally, denied them the truth, and parted company with them. Why would he not simply correct their misunderstanding or explain himself further, as he did with every other metaphor he uses in the Gospels? Instead, he repeated himself, then asked the Apostles if they were going to leave him over this hard saying as well. They replied &quot;Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.&quot; Hard words, yes, but they realized they would accept his words simply because of who he is. Powerful stuff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2. Eating flesh and drinking blood *is* a metaphor already in scripture - but in a completely *negative* sense. Someone recently pointed out to me: &quot;The phrase &quot;to eat the flesh and drink the blood,&quot; when used figuratively among the Jews, as among the Arabs of today, meant to inflict upon a person some serious injury, especially by calumny or by false accusation. To interpret the phrase figuratively then would be to make our Lord promise life everlasting to the culprit for slandering and hating him, which would reduce the whole passage to utter nonsense. For an examples of this use, refer to Micah 3:3; 2 Samuel 23:15-17; Revelation 17:6; Isaiah 49:26, 9:18-20.&quot;<br>
<br>
In other words, even though the metaphor view makes more sense when we have our Protestant glasses on, it actually creates more problems than it &quot;fixes&quot;, does it not?<br>
<br>
About John 6:55, what I meant is that Christ, who had the opportunity of saying &quot;For my flesh is symbolic meat, and my blood is symbolic drink&quot;, instead said &quot;For my flesh is REAL meat, and my blood is REAL drink.&quot; He knows how his listeners are understanding his words up to this point, and instead of saying &quot;I'm just being symbolic&quot;, he hammers the literalness of his words home. The Greek word here is for the sole purpose of emphasizing something is literal, and NOT symbolic.<br>
<br>
Besides the scriptural issues, I am also bothered by the fact that by taking the &quot;symbolic&quot; view, I am on the opposite side of the fence on this issue from all of church history, all the way back and including the early church fathers, some of who had direct communication with the apostles. Now, like Eugene, I'm not ready to put them on the same level of authority as scripture, but it sure puts some perspective on the issue. Especially since I trust the &quot;authority&quot; of these same men to determine canonicity for us, etc, which I think was Jeff's earlier point.<br>
<br>
Esdras, your comments early in this thread about Christ being metaphorical only at the last supper (because he hadn't made the sacrifice on the cross yet) is very interesting - is this the common Catholic view, or just your personal view? Jeff, does the Orthodox church have the same view of this instance?<br>

<br>
Actually, I'm not sure what the &quot;official&quot; view is regarding those scripture passages.  My thought on that came about while discussing the topic with my wife.<br>
<br>
We looked up the passages in Strong's and it was pretty clear that Christ was saying (to paraphrase) &quot;this is, as it were, my body...&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course, my wife said that Christ was speaking metaphorically, and I had to agree, but that is when I said that it made logical sense since He hadn't been crucified yet.  Admittedly, it would have been easier had He said something like, this will transform and/or be instilled with my body when you gather after I have been put to death, or something like that.<br>
<br>
So, I had to look at the scripture for what it said.  Although I firmly avow God being all powerful, and without getting too far off topic here, outside of our concept of linear time (there is some scripture to support this), Jesus was MAN while on earth and therefore - I believe - subject to linear time.  Christ's physical, bodily sacrifice had not yet taken place, therefore the bread and wine at the last supper could not contain the presense of His sacrifice.  While I don't think that this is outside of God's ability, I feel that it is logically consistent.<br>
<br>
So I guess I can say that it is my personal view, but one that I think makes sense when you consider the words spoken at the last supper.  It is also why I feel you must take those verses in conjunction with the verses from John 6 to get a real understanding of the Eucharistic sacrament.<br>
<br>
By the way, I liked your post above.  I'll have to remember what you said the next time my wife and I discuss this topic.  Who knows, she might take that next step to where you are at the moment.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
God bless,<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Here's a true miraculous story: A couple of years ago, a devout Roman Catholic visited an Orthodox Church in Santa Barbara. She wanted to receive Holy Communion. She imitated the other communicants and approached the Holy Chalice. As she did so, suddenly fire leaped out of the chalice and she jumped backwards. The priest saw the fear in her eyes and asked her if she were Orthodox. She said &quot;no&quot;. She was only allowed to kiss the chalice, which to her surprise was cool. Afterward, she told the priest about the fire which he didn't see. He told her that God is a Consuming Fire, instructed her for about 6 months and then chrismated her into the Orthodox Church. Miracles do happen in the Orthodox Church.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Yes, sometimes God is simple, but there is also much about Him that is mysterious and miraculous.<br>
<br>
The presence of Christ in the Eucharist, for those who believe that, is a Holy Mystery of Faith.<br>
<br>
Similar to when we say, Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ will come again, this is also a miraculous mystery, and one we proclaim willingly in faith.<br>
<br>
I know that it doesn't seem to make logical sense that the wine still tastes like wine, or the bread like bread, but I still believe that the core substance is the body and blood of our Lord.<br>

is there anything in the OT about drinking blood? anything in any of the prophecy of jesus? so much of jesus is foretold in the OT. I dont know of anything about drinking his blood. <br>

<br>
Me either.. sorry guys.. that other idea seems ghoulish to me.<br>
<br>
&lt;we are talking about a sacrament, a way in which we receive God's grace towards Christian growth/sanctification (for lack of a better more thought-out definition)...and in this view, I have always considered that I am 'communing' with Jesus Christ when I partake of the Lord's Supper. Even in my view of this service as a 'remembering' our Lord's sacrifice, I still yet believe in a living God that continually fills us with his spirit. &lt;snip&gt;I think the bottom line is that the Lord's Supper is a very personal, very private, very intimate communication between ourselves and God.&gt;<br>
<br>
With you here..<br>
<br>
I just can't think when Jesus said &quot;I am the Bread of Life&quot; He was saying he's a walking loaf of bread.. I think it was representational.

Church councils simply recognized what was already witnessed by the Spirit.  And so, the fact that an early church father is a witness to canonicity does not render his interpretations binding.<br>

perhaps the problem in viewing Christ within the elements is that we are not emphasizing the nature of the divine?  Just a thought...I don't think for a minute that Jesus was aluding to 'cannibalism', but rather to a 'consuming' of Himself, His Spirit.<br>

To me this doesn't sound all that different from some Christains who firmly believe in the Genesis account including the chronological time line making the earth a few thousand years old.  Even though everything scientifically points to the earth being millions of years old, many say it's only thousands because &quot;God made it so&quot;.<br>
<br>
Scientifically analyze or taste the communion elements and you will surely come out with bread and wine.  However, many beleive that is really IS the body and blood of Christ, simply because &quot;God made it so&quot;.  And like the Genesis account, if scripture (John 6) is taken literally, it fits. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

We must remember that the Cross itself is ghoulish, it is like a modern person putting a hangman's noose around his neck, it is a symbol of execution.  And cursed, &quot;Cursed is any man that hangs from a tree.&quot;  Yet that has become our Salvation.  Our Lord is the creator, He is the Word of the Old Testament, and He said Drink my Blood.  That is good enough for me.  <br>
Part of the problem is the flesh.  As Christians we confess that God became flesh, that Jesus's flesh was and is God.  Peter tells us to become partakers of the Divine Nature, and that is just not spirit but flesh as well.<br>

The true Host at the Eucharist is Christ Himself, and He offers his Flesh and Blood.  He became known to them in the Breaking of the Bread.  How did people get sick and die from mere symbols?<br>

Something in the last post reminded me about this: there was small church i was at and someone told me that week before they did communion with these small pre packaged cranberry juice. but it was old...some people couldnt take it because it was all sour and some people didnt feel so good after they drank it. so this made think...can Jesus's blood be sour enough to make people not want it or to make people not feel good after drinking it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oneandonlyfemme>One and Only Femme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://pages.prodigy.net/indianahawkeye/newpage24/15.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keymaster of Disneyland</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#B87333>(6/28/03 3:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://64.38.119.228/animgall/people/women/heads/victlady.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eucharist</span><hr size=1> &lt;We must remember that the Cross itself is ghoulish&gt;<br>

Not in the same way at all. <br>

The idea that the communion actually becomes a physical body and blood really... just... I can't even think about that. <br>

I'm not saying that my way is the only right way either.. I think this is one of those things that different folks will see in different ways.<br>

Reading your post just gave me a flashback to my teenage years. I brought my boyfriend to church with me one Sunday, which also happened to be a Sunday we were receiving communion, and I will never forget his reaction to the Lord's Supper.  This was a guy who had no previous church experience, let alone witnessing the communion service.<br>
<br>
As we held our pieces of bread and little cups of grape juice and the pastor said [paraphrase] 'Jesus said, this is my body, broken for you, take and eat....and likewise with the cup, this is my blood, shed for you, take and drink'   ..my boyfriend bolted upright in the pew and looked with bewilderment at the entire church..turning around in his seat to do so.  I think he would have run for the door if he had known where it was!<br>
<br>
So, even though I come from a similar background, and have viewed communion in 'remembrance' and as symbolic, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>to others</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, just knowing that this symbolism of bread...is Christ's body and we are asked to eat it, and likewise with the wine/grape juice as Christ's blood...I wonder why THAT never seemed just as ghoulish?  then again..it's tough I think to gain a broader perspective of how we might have viewed it before becoming a Christian. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oneandonlyfemme>One and Only Femme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://pages.prodigy.net/indianahawkeye/newpage24/15.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keymaster of Disneyland</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#B87333>(6/28/03 8:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://64.38.119.228/animgall/people/women/heads/victlady.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eucharist</span><hr size=1> &lt;So, even though I come from a similar background, and have viewed communion in 'remembrance' and as symbolic, to others, just knowing that this symbolism of bread...is Christ's body and we are asked to eat it, and likewise with the wine/grape juice as Christ's blood...I wonder why THAT never seemed just as ghoulish?&gt;<br>
<br>
Hm... I think I see what you mean... but those of us that were brought up in a church know the symbolism all throughout.. Maybe that's why I see it representatonal.. I remember the &quot;cover you with my wings&quot; and the  &quot;I'm the Lamb of God&quot; etc, etc.. so I didn't have any trouble thinking that the bread and juice were representing how I take Jesus into myself as my savior. I do it remembering Him.

I could offer the official answer of the Roman Catholic church and say it happens during the Mass when the priest calls upon God during the consecration of the Eucharist.  Also, it is said that it must be a priest and not a layman who does this.  Basically, only someone who can say a Mass.  It is God who actually does the action though.<br>
<br>
This is where I'm not exactly sure what I beleive.  I really do believe in the Eucharist being the body and blood, but I'm not sure that I agree that only a priest can call upon God for the action to take place.  I have wondered when partaking of communion in a church that considers it symbolic only that if I believe that God can transform the element...  would He do so?<br>
<br>
There's a thought that can keep me awake at nights. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>
