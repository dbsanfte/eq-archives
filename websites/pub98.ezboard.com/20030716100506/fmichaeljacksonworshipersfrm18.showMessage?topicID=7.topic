Chapter 4 part 2<br>
Nice To Meet You..Not!<br>
<br>
I slept most of the day because of this darn flu. At 2:30pm I got out of bed and put my robe on. Danny and I put a whoopee cushion on the chair that Vicky was going to be sitting in. I put nails on the ground so when she drives up she’ll get flat tires. I lay on the sofa while Dad was getting things ready. The balloons we’re going to throw at her if I can convince Dad to let me come outside. Nancy was in the kitchen making dinner. Dad came into the living room.<br>
“What are you doing downstairs honey?” he asked me. He was wearing black jeans and a red shirt.<br>
“I didn’t want to be upstairs by myself.” I said covering up in the blanket on the sofa.<br>
“Hmm..okay.” he said feeling my head, “You still feel hot. Did you take Tylenol like I told you to?”<br>
“Yes, I did.” I said, “I took them.”<br>
I laid there and turned on the TV. I turned it on and watched SpongeBob Squarepants. Danny loves it. Thank goodness he wasn’t there when the music came on. He must have been getting the hot glue together. I nodded off to sleep, and I woke up when I heard the door bell. Dad was the first one there. I stood next to him, Danny stood next to me. He opened the door. This white woman was at the door. White! Not that I have a problem with it but come on, y’all. <br>
“Hi Vicky.” Dad said sharing a short but sweet kiss with her, “This is Rachel, and Danny.”<br>
She looked at us and extended her hand. I took her hand and shook it hard. Danny was falling in love with her I think. He had this “she’s pretty” look on his face. He shook her hand and then ran into the kitchen.<br>
“Sorry, he is shy” Dad said, “Please come in.”<br>
She came in and Dad took her coat. She sat down on the sofa in my spot. I sat down on the other sofa next to Dad.<br>
“You know, the funniest thing happened, as I was driving up I ran over something and I have flat tires.” She said, “I don’t have my triple a card with me.”<br>
“That’s okay you can spend the night if you want to.” Dad said.<br>
I was taken back by this, “Spend the night?” he can’t be serious. Nancy came in and introduced herself.<br>
“So Rachel, tell me about yourself.” Vicky said looking at me.<br>
“I’m not into talking that much Vicky.” I said rolling my eyes at her.<br>
“Oh. That’s fine.” She said sounding a little offended. Dad smacked my arm and told me to be nice. I looked at her and smiled. She has short black hair, with green eyes. Her skin was like crème. She looked alright from where I was sitting but I didn’t want to be near her. I went into the kitchen. Danny was looking at Nancy finish cooking dinner. Danny was raving on and on about Vicky. What is so special about her? I don’t know what it is.<br>
Nancy brought dinner into the dinning room and placed it on the table. I sat down on the other side of the table next to Danny. Dad and Vicky sat on the same side. As soon as she sat down you heard the whoopee cushion. I laughed so hard I thought I was going to pee myself. Vicky turned several shades of red and flashed an embarrassed smile. <br>
Dad came over to her chair and showed me the whoopee cushion. I stopped laughing and sat quietly smirking to myself. She sat down very embarrassed. I took a roll and passed the bread basket down. What y’all don’t know is that I put motor oil inside on of the rolls. She took the biggest one, it had the motor oil in it. She took a bite, and all the oil smeared on her. She stood up and started crying. I was on the floor laughing my butt off. It was so funny. Dad was furious, he took her to the bathroom and helped her get cleaned up. <br>
“Rachel, why are you doing these things?” Nancy asked me, “It’s not like you at all:”<br>
“I don’t want her to replace our mother. Dad doesn’t know that. I don’t want him and her to be together.” I said looking into her face, “It’s you, me, Danny and, Dad. No one else.”<br>
“Why don’t you tell him how you feel?” she asked.<br>
“You remember what happened last time? He yelled at me.” I said looking at her.<br>
“You have to approach him in a nice way.” She said <br>
“Well I’m not going to tell him.” I said going back to eating my food.<br>
When Dad and Vicky came back I was eating. I tried to hide the laughter that was written all over my face.<br>
“Dad, can we show Vicky around?” I asked as I sniffled.<br>
“How do you feel?” he asked sitting down, “Do you feel good enough to go outside?”<br>
“I feel fine.” I said drinking some tea. I wanted to hit her with a balloon.<br>
“Sure after dinner we will take a tour, before it gets dark.” He said sitting close to Vicky looking at her. It made me sick that lovey dovey stuff. I wanted to puke. I sat biding my time. I got the mini glue gun and put it in my pocket. After dinner we started walking down the path toward the water fortress. I ran ahead with Danny and reached for a pistol. We squirted each other and then turned on Dad and Vicky. They shrieked. I grabbed a balloon and hurled it at Vicky, it popped on her back and splattered all over her. <br>
“Hey!” she said with a laugh and cry.<br>
“What?” I said picking one up and hurling it at Dad.<br>
I missed.<br>
Dad took me to a different area.<br>
“What is the matter with you Rachel?” he asked angered, “Why are you doing this?”<br>
“I’m just having fun.” I said, “Fun, Dad.”<br>
“Fun? Motor Oil is fun?” Dad asked me, “I don’t know what is going on with you nut you need to stop before you end up hurting some one.”<br>
“Okay, I’ll stop.” I lied.<br>
We came back and Vicky was trying to clean herself up. I just watched; she is so ugly. God! I don’t like her. I got the glue gun out my pocket and put some on her shoulder. She didn’t feel it at first but it was burning through her clothes.<br>
“Ow!” she screamed as she felt the hot glue.<br>
“What is it?” Dad asked coming over to her.<br>
“It burns!” She said pointing to her shoulder, she was feeling it burn her skin.<br>
Dad saw the glue and peeled it off along with her dead skin. She cried and the burn stated to blister over while bleeding. Dad put a band aid on it til we got back to the house. I was laughing so hard. Danny was in love with her. He told on me.<br>
“Rachel put hot glue on her shoulder.” He said looking at Dad.<br>
“You what?!” Dad said as his voice got louder, “I can’t believe you.”<br>
“I can’t believe you.” I said, “Dating!”<br>
“Rachel we talked about this. I have to move on.” Dad started projecting more.<br>
“So what?” I said yelling back crying, “I hate you.”<br>
Vicky looked at me with tears in her eyes.<br>
“You B!tch!” I said, “If you think you can replace our mother, you have another thing coming.” <br>
“Rachel that’s enough!” Dad said, “No graduation party! Go to you room.”<br>
I ran into the house and up to my room. I locked my dor. Vicky was speechless and she cried in my Dad’s arms. Who the freak does she think she is? Danny was told not to come in my room so I was alone. I cried myself to sleep. I just don’t think that this will work out.<br>
“I don’t understand her.” Dad said, “She is stuck on her mother’s death.”<br>
Vicky shook her head as she drank some iced tea.<br>
“I can understand. I lost my mother when I was 14,” she said, “I was devastated when my father remarried.”<br>
“I just want a mother figure for her. I raised her and she turns into a tom boy.” Dad said, “I love her and I only want what’s best.”<br>
“I can tell. I have a 4 year old girl and I would like her to have a father figure in her life.” She said stretching. There was an eerie silence. They just stared into each others eyes. Dad hugged her and she kissed his cheek. <br>
“I love you Mike.” She said kissing him.<br>
“Let’s watch a movie.” He said breaking the kiss. He turned away from her.<br>
“You always do that.” She said.<br>
“Do what?” he asked.<br>
“You don’t say ‘I love you’ to me.” She said, “Don’t you love me?”<br>
“I do, but the last time I said ‘I love you’ I lost my wife.” He said, “I don’t want to loose you too.”<br>
“You won’t, not even after Rachel.” She said, “I really love you.”<br>
They looked into each others eyes longer this time, and kissed. Her tongue parted his lips and made itself at home. Michael placed his hands on her inviting body. She broke the kiss and nibbled on his ears. Michael closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He slowly pushed her back. He reached into the end table drawer and pulled out a little black box.<br>
“Vicky…will you…” he started, he had to find his courage, “Will you marry me?” <br>
