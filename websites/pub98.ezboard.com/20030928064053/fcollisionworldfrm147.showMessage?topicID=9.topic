Wispy branches whipped at her face as she ran, unseeing, throuhg the dark, misty forest.  Tears blinded her eyes.  She ran through the thorny brambles, but she was numb to the blood that laced her shins.  Her only thought was getting far, far away, luring the danger she attracted away from Aeli, away from Kain.  That was what mattered.<br>
<br>
As she ran through a clearing, she was suddenly knocked to the ground by figures jumping from the trees, with whom they broke their fall and pinned to the ground.  She shrieked as a length if rope was wrapped tightly around her wings, keeping them closed. She struggled, but humans had more physical strength than sirens.<br>
<br>
Human laughs echoed above her as they shoved her deeper into the mud.  &quot;Ah, we got a pretty one here!&quot; one laughed.  &quot;She'll sell for a good hundred gold on the market, I'll bet!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;More than that...but what's say we have fun with her first?&quot; another said slyly, grabbing her head of hair in a rough human hand and yanking her head back.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Good idea,&quot; the other said gruffly, tracing the quivering muscles of her neck in a rough caress.  Laurena shivered in revulsion and whimpered, tears running down her face.  She felt very faint...<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't sleep yet, little birdie,&quot; one cackled harshly in her ear, breath smelling of liquor.  &quot;We wanna hear you sing...&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena struggled against her attackers, but they held her put easily.  &quot;No! Let me go!!!&quot; she shrieked.  &quot;Help!!! No!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 508<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/26/03 9:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Forest </span><hr size=1> One of the men screamed in pain. Blood trickled from his mouth as he fell to the ground, revealing the short figure of Kaed behind him, holding a daggar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Selling a Siren into slavery? THat's shameful.&quot; He grinned slyly at the others that were left, his vampire teeth catching a quick ray of light. Quickly, he stabbed into in the neck of the next man, then vanished and reappeared behind another. He took the daggar and ran it down the man's neck, slowly. The man was cringing in pain but somehow unable to move. Kaed licked the man's neck, getting the trickling blood off.<br>
Then, he bit into his neck, and the man yelped in pain shortly. Slowly, the man died.<br>
<br>
The ones holding Laurena let go and ran off into the forests in fear.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah! Why is the siren here at a time like this?&quot; He smiled seductivly at Laurena. &quot;I thought you were snuggly tucked into your little cottage. Or was it too snugg for you. It's hard to stretch those enchanting wings of yours in such a small space.&quot; He walked up next to her and carressed her face gently. <br>

The look in his eyes terrified her, the numbing pain coursing through her limbs racked her body, and the mere horror of the situation caused her to be unable to breathe.

Laurena heard voices above her, swimming, muffled and wispy in her head.  She felt warmth trickling form her neck, and the more warmth that trickled, the colder her body became.  She forced her eyes open, and she stared up into a blurry oblivion, and the one thing that remained clear and intensely sharp in the blur was Aeli's beautiful silver eyes, looking down at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...&quot; she rasped, tears thickening the foggy blur between them.  &quot;I'm so sorry...please forgive me...&quot;  She trembled as the darkness threatened to overwhelm her again.  She grasped his hand tightly, trying to keep him there, so that the darkness did not take him away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 511<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/27/03 12:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Forest </span><hr size=1> Aeli felt a sigh of  releif when she started talking.

Such undescribable warmth.  It swarmed around her and she saw darkness, but it was a welcome darkness, for it was his shadow against her eyes.  She wrapped her free arm around him, holding as tightly as she could, but still so weak.  She cried softly, feeling wretched and unworthy of such comfort.<br>

Don't cry, Aeli...please...don't cry because of me.  I'm sorry...it was my fault.  I shouldn't have gone.  But I couldn't help it...I couldn't stand...being so alone,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;I was selfish...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She's hunting me down,&quot; she coninued.  &quot;She'll never stop until I'm dead.  I have no where else to hide.  She'll kill me, and whomever...stands...stands in her way.  Aeli, you'll be killed!  Don't stand in her way.  As long as I am hunted, I am a danger to those around me...you, Kain, Leon...she's so powerful,&quot; she rambled on, losing all sense of knowing, thoughts frantic and sporadic, her voice fading every second.  &quot;She is so powerful, and merciless, a Dark Siren...and you have to let me g...&quot;<br>
<br>
Her lips moved, but to her own shock and sorrow, nothing came except heavy air.  Shaking immensely, she wept soundlessly, the darkness numbing her pain.  But the cold remained, and she held to him tighter, needing to feel...something.  <br>

<br>
At that, he leaned his head back up and placed his hands on either side of her head. She was so soft, but so cold now. such a sorrowful look imbedded in her eyes.<br>
<br>
Now was the time... he closed his eyes and focused all his energy on his hands, and going to her. It worked! He could something flowing out of him. Hopefully, it would be effective. Slowly, he started loosing his strength, feeling weaker and weaker.<br>
<br>
Kain stared with horror. he knew what aeli was doing. <br>
&quot;Stop you idiot!&quot; He yelled, but his suggestion fell on deaf ears. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

What was he doing?<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry so much. i'll protect you,&quot; he had said.<br>
<br>
Suddenly she was blinded by light.  Pure, divine light.  his soul, his energy, pouring into her as the water of a burst dam.  He gave his power to her, and she felt him weakening in her grasp...<br>
<br>
Aeli...no!<br>
<br>
She struggled against it, but his grip was far too strong.  She felt herself being snatched from the darkness, but the darkness was escaping into his eyes, intense in the light.  She wanted to shriek, to scream at him to stop before he hurt himself.<br>
<br>
No!!!<br>
<br>
She reached for her chest.  Her hand gripped around a golden ankh that had hung around her neck unnoticed until then.  She gripped it firmly and pressed it into his chest, shooting as much energy as she could back into him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli!&quot; she cried with what was left of her voice. &quot;No...&quot;  She looked up at him, finding confusion in his intense eyes.  She tried to smile and placed a hand on his cheek.  She gazed at him, pain and weariness relfecting in hers.  She would live now, since some of Aeli's power had merged with her own before she could stop it, but she was very tired, and another darkness invaded her senses, a welcome, warm darkness...one that promised that she would see Aeli again.<br>
<br>
Her went slowly limp against him, her arms draped around him, her head resting on his chest.  Later, she would try and explain to him everything.  Later, she would go on being hunted.  Later, she would be strong.<br>
<br>
But right now, she was silent.  Now, she was immobile.  And now, the darkness overwhelmed her, and she fell alseep peacefully in his arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't leave,&quot; she whispered subconsciously, unaware of what she said.<br>
<br>

It was a peaceful sleep, however. Aeli could feel her breathing against his chest.<br>
&quot;I'll never go.&quot;<br>
He wrapped his arms around her in one last embrace. <br>
<br>
Kain's jaw was wide open... he was waiting to see what Aeli said or did... and when Aeli looked back at him with his old thoughtful epxression, he knew everyone was alright.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli, will you able to carry her back?&quot; He asked, voice a little wary.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, her wings are in the way.&quot; He said, looking a little lovingly at her wings, kain walked over towards them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here.&quot; Kain slipped a ring from his pockets onto one of her fingers. <br>
a bright light engulfed her shorly, her body changing to making a human's exactly, but only until the ring was taken off. &quot;There ya go, you should be able to move her now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanx Kain.&quot;Aeli smiled as he scooped Laurena up in his arms. <br>
<br>
Thank the gods she was alright.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli, there is something you might want to know.&quot; Kain said, shuffling his feet.<br>

But she took no notice of it, for she absent mindedly decideed whatever happened was alright, because Aeli was still there.  She held to him, her grip tightening a bit as she felt herself move off of the ground.  She nuzzled into his warmth a bit and sighed.  &quot;Aeli...&quot; she mumbled peacefully, her hands...her four fingered, non webbed hands...clutching at the folds of his shirt and keeping him near. Her dreams pulsed with the steady sound of his heartbeat in her normal, rounded human ear.<br>

'aw...umm...heh.&quot; Kain blushed and kept moving. <br>

<br>
What a horrible, terrible dream.  She had been locked, in a cage no less, with huge iron bars and no door.  Around her, Humans gawked, leering, cackling at her helplessness and stupidity.  <br>
<br>
And Aeli had been there, laughing at her mercilessly.<br>
<br>
She looked up at his face, looking at his relaxed features.  How beautiful...she reached up, lightly touching his cheek with a light fingertip.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...&quot; said Laurena inaudibly.  &quot;You saved me...hm?&quot; She looked at her hand and nearly yelped in shock.  <br>
<br>
She had four fingers, a human hand, with no web, <br>
