<br>
One artist that comes to mind is Michael W. Smith.  Songs like &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; where he sings, &quot;You don't have to be picture perfect to be in my world.&quot;  Songs that if the singer was not labeled a Christian music artist, that you would not think the songs had anything to do with Christianity.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have a bit of a problem with it.  It's one reason I've tired of so much CCM today.  With songs like MWS's &quot;Picture Perfect,&quot; I'll never be in his world so that song seems really shallow to me.  And maybe it's just me, but I think the song would have been better if he had sung, &quot;You don't have to be picture perfect to be in God's world.&quot;  Something that minor to take the focus off the singer where it doesn't belong and onto God where it does belong.<br>
<br>
I think I've become un-hip.  Whereas I use to think CCM was all cool as it was contemporary and had all the modern beats and all that, I find myself tuning out of those kinds of stations more.  I don't care if I pick a station that just sings old hymns.  There's something in me that cries out for more of Jesus and less of this world the longer I live in it.<br>
<br>
I love &quot;the Jesus record&quot; which was the project Rich Mullins was working on when he died.  Inside the cover of the album it says this...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>On September 10, 1997, Rich Mullins sat down in an old, abandoned church and played nin songs that were to be part of a record he had affectionately termed &quot;Ten Songs About Jesus.&quot;  This was a new project Rich was just starting called &quot;The Jesus Record,&quot; a project Rich said was &quot;needed&quot; - for himself and his friends.  Just nine short days later, Rich left this world and went to meet Jesus, His savior and Lord.  Recorded only on a cassette with a cheap, battery-operated recorder, the nine songs were, to say the least, rough.  But the cassette was salvaged and cleaned up so that these nine demos could be put onto a cd.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I read that and I can't help but think God was sending such a powerful message.  Rich's heart seemed burden by the secularism in the CCM industry to the point he wanted to make an album all about Jesus.  Such a simple theme and thought.  And just nine days after sitting down to play those songs, the Lord took him home.  And somehow in the wreckage, that little tape survived as though God was saying - this is what I want.  Though the tape was battered and the quality of sound probably diminished some in the wreckage - perhaps that too is a sign.<br>
<br>
I remember another singer who tragically lost his life, Keith Green forbid them putting a price tag on his albums for awhile because he was tired of the commercialization of the gospel.  Though he finally allowed the price to be put back on because there were lots of people who needed food and shelter and needed the money to pay for it.<br>
<br>
Why does it seem that the Christian music artists who really get it lose their lives tragically?<br>
<br>
But what are your thoughts on the subject? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

My thought process went something like this though after I got done chuckling - Well maybe they don't need to be overt in every song and mention the word God or Jesus, after all in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Peaches</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> form of the Book of Esther there is no mention of God.

I could just see Jesus saying to someone, &quot;Hey, let's go for a swim.&quot;  Once they were in the water, Jesus grabs them and pushes them under.  When the come back up spitting out water and asking, &quot;What'd you do that for?!&quot;  Jesus would reply, &quot;Sorry, just had to save your soul.

<br>
I guess I have to say that Relient K writing about relationships and things not directly related to faith gives almost a stronger witness than the Newsboys, because you hear their songs together and it helps dispell the misconception that every person of faith is some sort of perfect pure goody-two-shoes who's in a completely separate universe.<br>
<br>
It makes you feel so much closer to Relient K when they're singing about cell phone minutes and not understanding their girlfriends and bad college experiences, and then you hear them singing to God about how he's the only one who understands them, and how they keep screwing up and turning away from him... &quot;It's my... my trademark move, to turn my back on You.  It's my... my trademark move, to realize I should improve.  And sometime, soon after that, You'll see me come crawling back.&quot;  And it really makes you think, hey, there are normal people with normal problems and feelings who are totally into God...  God isn't an alien thing, it's part of real life... I can be normal and still be Christian... wow!<br>
<br>
But the Newsboys are awesome too, if you want the completely Christian-themed music experience... they're a lot better for worship music than Relient K.  But I daresay probably a lot more teens have been introduced to God by Relient K than Newsboys, because they can't relate as well to Newsboys.  But again, I love both for their unique styles, so *shrug* who knows?  Creed does not consider themselves a Christian band but they definitely write some religious themes in their songs... I guess a Christian band is defined by what the artists want to be defined as, how much they're willing to be termed &quot;Christian&quot; and worship and sing about God in their music.  You wouldn't know Relient K was Christian by listening to a couple of their songs, but then you hear their other songs that are very heavily Christian-themed, just like you don't know if somebody's Christian by knowing them for a couple days, but then you get to talking about God and you realize they have a lot of faith.<br>
<br>
Know what?  I think I've babbled!  Y'all have heard quite enough from me on this.  Hmm... so as parting statements I'll say, Relient K ROCKS listen to them if you like punk rock and awesome music, and Newsboys ROCK listen to them if you like techno-pop blends and awesome awesome lyrics!<br>

But &quot;not 'of' the world&quot; where we have the focus in our lives on Jesus Christ and learning and growing as we live daily?<br>
<br>
I can take both and enjoy both.  Part of 'living life more abundantly' I think.  And honestly so much of the pop/rap stuff is so horrible now, an alternative to the blaring, cursing, 'it's my way or the highway' mentality is needed.  I won't even go into the sexuality that is presented.  CCM may not be 'the best' but it's better than what's out there now, and I think it shows a distinction.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess I have to say that Relient K writing about relationships and things not directly related to faith gives almost a stronger witness than the Newsboys, because you hear their songs together and it helps dispell the misconception that every person of faith is some sort of perfect pure goody-two-shoes who's in a completely separate universe.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I have never had that impression of people who write about their faith directly.  And I don't know, but that one song (and I have no idea who sings it because we've just sung it in church) where the singer sings, &quot;Sometimes at night when I am afraid.  I cover my eyes, cover my shame.  'Cause here in the dark, I'm torn apart.  So come with Your light and fill up my heart.  Oh great light of the world, fill up my soul.  I'm half a man here, so come make me whole.&quot;  (Or as we sing in church, &quot;I'll never mend here.&quot;)  The song is relational - talking about the relationship between the singer and God and you can't say the guy sounds like he's a perfect goody-two-shoes.  His words make it clear that he's not.<br>
<br>
Or like Wayne Watson's song when he sings, &quot;You know me, I'm just a man, I've unclean lips and unclean hands, some of the thoughts I've had make me want to run and hide.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here's a question - would you stay at a church if you never once heard the pastor say the name of Jesus or God or Bible?  I've heard plenty of sermons in my life that sound very humanist - how to live a more wholesome better life with no emphasis whatsoever on God or Jesus.  I'm not comfortable with those churches and pastors who preach on how to be better people and never or rarely say the name of God or Jesus.  There is power in the name of Jesus and I can't explain the power I've seen the Lord exhibit when I say the name of Jesus.  It's how we know who truly is a Christian.  It's why I say Jesus more than God - because whenever you recognize Jesus, you recognize God as well, but not everyone who says the name God recognizes Jesus and if they don't recognize Jesus, they are recognizing a false god.  How do I know if you are my brother or sister in Christ?  If you recognize Jesus for who He is.  There are some Christian music artists who I wonder about.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I don't understand why someone that has made a profession of Christianity is required to make all their music sacred. We, all of us, spend time on other projects. We don't make every topic of discussion, art project, friendship, book we read, etc, etc, etc Christian. So, why should they be put in that box either? Does writing/singing a song that is not sacred lessen their relationship with God? I wouldn't think so.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Let me say I don't mind there being a song on an album that makes no mention of God or Jesus or the Bible or any direct matter of faith.  They do have a place.  What bothers me is when a Christian artist produces an album and there is no direct mention in any of the songs.  When none of them do.  They've got 10 songs (generally) on an album.  As Christian music artists, I would expect at least one song (if not more) to make some direct mention.  It's not a requirement by any means.  It makes me question - where's their heart and what are their goals?  Is their goal to sell as many albums as they can or is their goal to fulfill the great commission?<br>
<br>
It makes me wonder - why would they not want to sing about God?  Now I enjoy a nice fast-paced fun song, I'll tune to an oldies station often enough.  But I can only have so much of it before my soul longs to sing out to the Lord or about the Lord.  He puts that desire in us, so when a Christian artist shows no desire for that, it makes me wonder.  And I say wonder because I'm certainly not going to go judging people I don't know and say I know why they do what they do and yadda, yadda, yadda.  That's not at all it.<br>
<br>
So my question is why would an album of 10 or so songs by a Christian artist never have any indication in any of their songs that makes a clear implication on what they believe?<br>
<br>
This world is full of ungodliness and here are Christians who seem hesitant to speak openly about Christianity.  I don't know, it's making my heart ache thinking about it, so I'm going to end my post and go on to happier posts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

&lt;would you stay at a church if you never once heard the pastor say the name of Jesus or God or Bible?&gt;<br>
<br>
Not the same thing at all.. a better analogy would be, &quot;Would you maintain a relationship with a Christian friend that didn't talk about Jesus all the time?&quot; I do, there are even times when we don't talk about Jesus in a conversation.. AMAZING but TRUE.<br>
<br>
Peaches, is every story, poem you write about your faith in Jesus? Do you never write about any other topic?

As for an answer to your question, most of my poetry I don't show people and it very much is focused on God.  Most of the stories I write are 7th Heaven fan fiction and I keep looking for ways to write in faith to the stories, which isn't hard since it's a Christian family, or is suppose to be at least. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>
