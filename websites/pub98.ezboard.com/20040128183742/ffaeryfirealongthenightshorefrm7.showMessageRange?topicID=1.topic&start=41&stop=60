Though much less pressing than saving the man, you can't help but feel that something guarded so well would be anything less than very important.<br>

When someone asks you a direct question or when you see fit, you may respond out of turn order. In this case, Toric may respond to Sapphire prior to Gheant taking his turn, just so that the issue at hand is resolved. Do not post excessively and just ignore other players' turns, but do post out of order when there is a logical reason to. (someone asked you a question, a strong reaction to an event, a preemptive warning, shouting out the answer to a riddle, etc.).<br>
Hope this clears things up and makes the game go smoother.<br>

Toric(tim)struggles to pull himself off of the ground.  He tries to stand but fails to raise his body up from the ice-cold stone. Soon he discovers himself too weak to lift himself AND his armor off of , so he does his best to unfasten his breastplate armor.  After much prying and pulling and grunting, he succeeds in loosening it enough so that he can crawl out.  The thing that stands out as he makes his way to his knees is his skin. And the burns that run all along his arms and back.  The human then attempts to kneel, but only succeeds in collapsing.  After more struggle and much physical strain, he manages to crawl back onto his hands and knees, at which point he raises his head and his tangled mane of fiery red hair. His face is slick with sweat and blood.  His slate-grey eyes are bulging with a mix of panic, relief, and emotional pain.  On the surface he appears calm and focused.  His eyes, however, tell a different story.  They belie an entirely different person buried within..They seem to have a dull glow to them, as if there's a torch burning hehind them. At first he can barely utter a sound.  But he soon struggles to whet his tongue and opens his mouth and begins to speak in response to the paladin's inquiry.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gheantturtake@faeryfirealongthenightshore>Gheant Turtake</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The ultimate in Dwarven Defense.</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(2/19/03 6:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the horror...</span><hr size=1> Gheant seizes the box from Sapphire, squinting as he holds it up to torchlight to examine it. &quot;Hmm... this doesn't seem to be very valuable, but I value a good puzzle.

That box is the reason I was pulled from battle.  I had been given explicit instructions to come directly here to guard the object I was to find here.  And that's it.  ..And even if that doesn't convince you.....these monks...GAVE THEIR LIVES... Suttox and his brethren valued whatever it is in this room enough to face utter destruction in order to save this.... So let me ASSURE you that this box is NOT a cheap toy.&quot;<br>
The unusually red-tinted human cleric struggles again to get out of his stricken position on the floor.  He decides that it's not worth it at this time, and is content with the cool stone.  He rolls onto his back so as to better address his interrogator.<br>
&quot; 'What are these things' you ask? I am not able to completely fulfill your question, but i do know that they appeared out of nowhere. Literally..OUT OF NOWHERE. One minute the monestary is a place of quiet contemplation, a place of safety, and...the next...its infested with beings the likes of which I have never seen.  I...they...it was horrible. Claws..and gaping mouths.  And..and burning red eyes.  But it wasn't the eyes that bothered me. It was the darkness behind them.  The empty void of darkness that lit their demonic faces.  I am certain that they are abominations...nothing like those...things..could be created through the power and the grace of Obad-Hai.......nothing....and they destroyed it. They destroyed all of them....I swear by the quarterstaff of Obad-Hai that I will find these monsters and exact due revenge....oh Suttox......&quot;<br>
The emotionaly drainedl human rolls back onto his stomach and exhales.  It's obvious that he is struggling to deal with so much death in such a short time.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sovbeos>sovbeos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk Man Monster-killa</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(2/19/03 7:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/sovbeos/stance.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Comfort</span><hr size=1> Serin quickly moves over to Toric to provide him some support, and a friendly hand he can touch.<br>

Although initially intending to simply thank him for his compassion and understanding, the cleric finds himself staring deeply into the yellow eyes of his benefactor.  It's as if he's drawn there.  And with one quick glance, he realizes that he's found someone who could very well understand the turmoil burning inside of his heart.  Toric soon realizes what he is doing and quickly blinks his eyes so as to clear the fog that had settled through his long ordeal, and separates his gaze in order to focus on the question.  &quot;Any other information?? Yes, I think I might...although, I must say before I go on, that I was trapped in here from near the beginning, so my experience might not help you as much as you might like.  Anyway, you already know about the battle, and my task to guard this room.  Now let..me..seee...The battle had lasted only a few minutes..or maybe it was hours, i can't remember..when that invisible wall you found me locked behind appeared.  It don't know what its purpose was, but I think it might have been some sort of protective measure for the box, but I was unaware of this.  I was standing back there :<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> oints toward pedestal:: when it happened.  If it really was meant as protection, it was definitely triggered as a means of a last resort.  By that time, the battle would have been a lost cause.  However, the sound of combat still raged on, even with me trapped.  However, at some point, I began to hear a strangely eerie, soothing melody.  It seemed almost like a lament, or a farewell melody exchanged between lovers.  It was very enchanting.  Then I heard the grating of stone on stone in front of me.  Finally, there was a huge blast.  It shook the ground I stood on.  Then...silence.  Except that it wasn't silent, because i could hear a faint clicking...and a sound that reminded me of the clicking of my own breastplate armor as I am running.  Then there was nothing.  Nothing until you arrived.  Thank you once more.  You rescued me from a certainly long and painful death.  I am endebted to you.  All of you.  Now...about the box.  I have no grasp of what could possibly be contained, and what the monks were protecting, but I DO know that they went to a lot of trouble to protect it.  As far as actually opening it goes, I see no reason why you shouldn't let your own heart decide that.  I personally have no reason to look further.  Although it may contain some potent magic or even some clue as to why this place of solitude was disturbed by such evil forces.  No, I am through with the box.  I have protected it. And at the loss of my new friends.  These people who supported me in my time of chaos.  And now it's over. I've protected the box. My promise is fulfilled.&quot;<br>
With that, Toric takes the back of his hand to his forehead to wipe the sweat that has beaded there.
