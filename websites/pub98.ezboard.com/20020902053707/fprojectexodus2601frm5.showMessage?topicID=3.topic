She knocked hard on the brick wall, hard enough that it would have bruised her knuckles if it was actually brick. &quot;Damnit Rake! I know your in there!&quot; Nikki yelled with her lightly husky voice, &quot;I told you that you weren't allowed in there anymore!&quot;<br>
<br>
The makeshift door creaked open and a large, monster of a man crept out with a big white bag. &quot;I just needed some parts and I knew you had some to spare. I'll take it out of your payment for rent.&quot; His voice was surprisingly soft for such a big man.<br>
<br>
Nikki pushed him out of the way and Rake let himself be pushed. &quot;Fine, just stay out of my cellar.&quot; She stomped down the stairs, slamming the door behind her, and turned on another light. The room was lit with a false yellow light and the opening of another room could be made out.<br>
<br>
Nikki walked inside the other room and pulled on a bookcase, that was covering the entrance to another room, until it was enough for her to slip through. Her last assignment had been worth a lot of credits, enough to finish the repairs on her cellar. Nikki felt along the cold, brick wall for the lightswitch and turned the light on to find that a lot of her guns were missing. &quot;Aagh! I knew it!&quot; Nikki yelled in frustration and spun around, charging across the room and up the stairs. &quot;Rake! Rake, get your ass over here now!&quot; She screamed, not caring who heard. Realizing that he wasn't coming, and that she wouldn't be able to find him anytime soon, she stopped. &quot;I need a drink,&quot; she mumbled, walking out of the building, &quot;I'll kick his ass later.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ubrokenseraph.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BrokenSeraph</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#0000FF>(8/5/02 11:47:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fprojectexodus2601frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nikki's Cellar</span><hr size=1> Nikki was pissed, definitely, absolutely, pissed. Not only had she not been able to get a drink because some idiots had to decide to start a big commotion, she also couldn't find Rake. That had put her in a tight situation with her money. Those guns were a few credits that she couldn't lose. Nikki lit up a cigarette and seated herself in front of her computer. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Time to search for a quick little money maker.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Stopping at the Nets, Nikki found a kidnapping job, paying just enough so that would cover her gun expenses. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I don't usually take these kind of jobs, but I guess I can't be choosy at the moment.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Nikki smirked as she read further, liking the job even more as she found out who it was for. &quot;So, the girl has an admirer. The guy from the bar had to have offered this kidnapping job.&quot; Nikki took a final drag of her cigarette before putting it out. &quot;Hmm...Sounds perfect.&quot; She grabbed some equipment before heading out. <p>
