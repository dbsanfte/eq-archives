<br>
Some of it is strange but overall seems probable. <br>
<br>
Nomar is borderline crazy. He is paranoid to the point where he believes they intentionally doctor the field so he will make errors. Nomar did not celebrate after the awesome game5 victory over the A's, in fact he broke chairs in the clubhouse because he thought they unfairly scored an error on him. Nomar had only 3 friends at his wedding - Mia Hamm had 200. Nomar hates A-Rod now for trying to come here. Nomar has the worst double play mechanics of any shortstop<br>
                                              <br>
Selig jammed Lucchino on Red Sox owners with a $6MIL price tag. Joe O'Donnell was told by Selig that if he wanted to own the Sox he would have to take Lucchino at 6 Mil / yr and Lucchino would not have to answer to  <br>
anyone. O'Donnell was outraged and hated Lucchino. Lucchino is a bad guy and he personally ruined the A-Rod deal.                                 <br>
   <br>
Viratek will likely bolt the Sox for a bigger offer. <br>
<br>
Lowe is very insecure and will settle for more years at lesser $ to stay with Sox.             <br>
<br>
Nixon will be signed.<br>
                                                    <br>
Pedro's tear in the rotator cuff is over 90% and he truly thinks every outing will be his last. Sox are trying to get Pedro to take an NFL type contract that is big $, but not guaranteed. If he gets healthy, he gets paid, if he blows it out, no $.                                          <br>
<br>
The Yanks are in turmoil. Steinbrenner listens to no one and defied Torre, Cashman and the baseball brain trust on all deals. They wanted Pettitte resigned, to move Soriano to center, Guerrero in right, Kaz Matsui at second. Steinbrenner went out and got Lofton and still has not spoken to  Bernie because he is pissed. <br>
<br>
Yanks have a rift between the Puerto Rican  players and the Dominicans. This is a rift throughout baseball, but Yanks had it bad last year, with Mondesi leading the Dominicans and brought    <br>
   Soriano into his camp.                                                   <br>
   Jeter does not like this team; he misses the O'Neill, Tino M Yanks.      <br>
   Jeter                                                                    <br>
   can not believe Pedro and Manny get away with not talking to the media;  <br>
   he                                                                       <br>
   thinks it is awful and bad for baseball.                                 <br>
   Javier Vasquez is bright, competitive, and should thrive with Puerto     <br>
   Rican                                                                    <br>
   battery mate Posada.                                                     <br>
   Giambi is off the juice and lost 25 lbs and he is embarrassed.           <br>
   Francona will be up to the task in the Red Sox clubhouse - very bright   <br>
   and                                                                      <br>
   personable. Manny is deathly afraid of being hit by a pitch.             <br>
   Kevin Brown is on the roids and may be the most competitive personality  <br>
   in                                                                       <br>
   all the game. He will hate NY, but pitch well. Mussina is an             <br>
   intellectual                                                             <br>
   loner. He graduated Suma from Stanford in 3 years and does not care      <br>
   what                                                                     <br>
   anyone thinks of him. Still coaches in hometown in PA is the             <br>
   off-season.                                                              <br>
   Jeter has the best baseball IQ he has ever seen. Mariano Rivera is the   <br>
   best                                                                     <br>
   human being in the game. Clemens told him Steinbrenner hated Pettitte.   <br>
   Clemens trainer while on the Sox screwed with him with a workout         <br>
   regimen                                                                  <br>
   that caused recurring groin pulls. New trainer in Toronto changed his    <br>
   career. Sox fans fell for Duquette myth that Roger dogged it. Clemens    <br>
   has                                                                      <br>
   always had the greatest work ethic and training in the game. Like the    <br>
   Cubs                                                                     <br>
   in the NL. Astros will be an interesting team to watch. Red Sox will     <br>
   win                                                                      <br>
   the East McCourt is over his head financially in LA.                     <br>
   Contreras suffering from Cuban depression. Castro abuses the family      <br>
   members                                                                  <br>
   back in Cuba and it gets to the players, knowing they are paying a       <br>
   price.                                                                   <br>
   Look for El Duque to come back to keep Contreras happy with a fellow     <br>
   Cuban                                                                    <br>
   who can share his pain .                                                 <br>
