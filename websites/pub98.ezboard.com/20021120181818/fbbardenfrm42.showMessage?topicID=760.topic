I have some issues.  Best if I go through them one by one.  Sorry to number them... but it might be easier for those who can think of a reply.<br>
<br>
Anyway, here are my problems...<br>
<br>
1.  There are very few new members.  That wouldn't be so bad, but... <br>
2.  A lot of people seem to have vanished.  Yes, I've seen quite a few &quot;I'm back&quot; posts too, but there are plenty of people who we haven't heard from in ages - those who never say when they're leaving or coming back.<br>
3.  Free For All is the only forum that actually gets a decent amount of posts.<br>
<br>
Those are the main ones I can think of.  To expand on #3 a bit, here are my comments on the other forums... <br>
<br>
Creativity Corner - I don't want to get rid of it, but does anyone read this unless I send them the link?<br>
Tech Support - this gets used as and when it needs to.  Fine by me.<br>
Videogaming Zone - it's dead.  Before anyone says &quot;you can't get rid of it!!&quot; - well do you use it?  Does anyone?<br>
Debates - ok, so it's new, but very few people seem to venture in there.  Are people uncomfortable with this forum?<br>
<br>
I've tried to think of some reasons for the problems and possible solutions, but I'm struggling... <br>
<br>
1.  Perhaps we shouldn't be MBA.  In addition to me, we have five admins and three mods.  Are we secure enough to lose the MBA (again)?  But honestly, does it really make a difference?<br>
2.  We aren't putting our name about enough.  I used to post a few links on other boards (in the advertising forums) but I wanted to avoid spamming - so I stopped.  Now the opposite has happened - no advertising at all.  Solution: not sure actually.<br>
3.  Maybe people don't like it here?  As I ALWAYS say, I'm willing to work with suggestions to make this a better place for everyone, but I never seem to get them.  Do you talk amongst yourselves, don't I listen, am I unapproachable?  Or is this place totally tip top wonderful?  If it's so great - where is everyone?<br>
<br>
I know we will have quiet periods, but certain areas of the forums (i.e. practically all the forums except for FFA) have been dead for a LONG time.  We do not have too many forums (if you don't include the private / archive forums) - maybe we actually have too few.  Is there anything or anyone else we could cater for, to help the board grow?  Opening new forums is not always the answer though, so let's not use this as the first solution.<br>
<br>
On a final note, please don't take any of this personally.  I know that people have been busy with other things lately.  Fair enough - but where are the new members?<br>
<br>
If you do reply, I'd be very grateful if you could be as honest as possible - what do you like, what don't you like?  What could we start doing that we don't already do?  And so on.  I don't believe that everyone is happy with everything here, so I don't expect people to say &quot;you're doing a great job&quot; - I'm not looking for any praise.  I just want to try and figure out what we need to do to get a bit more interested in the place - current AND new members alike. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

With the VideoGaming Zone forum, I myself don't post there because I really don't play videogames that much.<br>
<br>
And, with the Debates forum, well, I am afraid at times to voice my opinions on things for fear of being chastised. I know I won't be, but, I am just afraid sometimes, it's something I have to overcome (I've been that way for many years). <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCE6FF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/udashofmooo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dash Of Mooo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.users.dialstart.net/~dashland/html/Strobe.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shimmering Ocean<br />Debates Editor<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-5.gif /></span><br> <BR><img src=http://www.users.dialstart.net/~dashland/html/lene1c.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/box.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: A few issues with the forums... </span><br><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 8/6/02 9:45:39 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>    <hr size=1> Oh to hell with the numbers. I'll just ramble a bit.<br>
<br>
FFA - I've found recently that there's been little to comment on. The topics just aren't for me.<br>
Video - I dunno. I'm not playing much games these days..and as a result the forum is a non event for me.<br>
Creative - Again, not particularly for me, but I do occasionally pop in, and do like a lot of the stuff in there.<br>
Debates - Ben said it all. People should try to give it a go, although that may be hard for some.<br>
<br>
With regards to general member populace - Perhaps you do have to start leaving links here and there. It does work, although you may be seen as spamming. *shrug*<br>
<br>
Perhaps you need to think of something specific to draw people in, because at the moment the impression many people may get is that it is just another boring EZforum thats a bit chatty with the odd bit of substance. Removing MBA may be a good start.<br>

<br>
Leuqarte:<br>
* I appreciate the link, thank you.<br>
* MBA is now off.<br>
<br>
Starry:<br>
* You could ask a few people, for sure. Try to think of people who could find this place interesting and fun.<br>
* Debates forum - we are trying to make this a place where people can openly express their opinions and respect other people's viewpoints. It is still very new though, so it will take a little bit of time to get it right.<br>
<br>
Dash:<br>
* FFA - I'm inclined to agree. I have been posting in the private forums (Editorial Team mostly) but when I do post in a public forum other than FFA, I never seem to get a reply. It makes me think that nobody is really looking outside of FFA.<br>
* Videogaming (also replying to Starry) - I'll wait for more comments, but I just don't think it's getting used. Anyway, it's not really a &quot;creative art&quot;, unless you're writing a game.<br>
* Creativity Corner - I guess it's not for everyone but I'm not even sure if people know much about it.<br>
* Debates - See reply to Starry.<br>
* Advertising - See my updated comments below.<br>
* MBA - as per reply to Leuqarte - it's now off.<br>
* Drawing people in - Maybe we need to have some sort of introduction, e.g. &quot;New to the forums? Read this!&quot; - to explain what the forums are about, who the staff are...?<br>
<br>
Confy:<br>
* MBA - yep, the staff should be able to handle non-MBA.<br>
* Spammers not liking it here - my inclination was to say &quot;well, good!!&quot; but I'm going to mention something on that in a moment. See my updated comments below.<br>
<br>
TPausma:<br>
* To be honest, that's one of the things I have been worried about for some time - I think a lot of people feel that way. How to overcome it, though? Tricky. I'd welcome any suggestions.<br>
<br>
Candy:<br>
* Debates - yep, it's new, so will take some time to gel.<br>
* MBA - it's gone now.<br>
* Promoting - let me know what you're currently doing as I don't believe we've had a chance to chat!<br>

Updated comments<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
1. Advertising. (Thanks to Dash for his comments on this BTW)<br>
<br>
A few months ago, I closed the Member Connections (advertising) forum and disallowed all advertising here. That was a hell of a buzz - no more spam! Sure enough, people still dropped links, but we deleted them all.<br>
<br>
However, a lot of members will definitely visit us with the intention of leaving a link - but what we want to do is to get them to like the place, and stay.<br>
<br>
At the moment we are not just unwelcoming but we are very firm with people who drop a link - whether they are blatantly spamming, or genuinely leaving a link to their site. That is not a criticism of the staff - it is the rules.<br>
<br>
Maybe we need to be more welcoming to those who drop by and leave a link. Perhaps we could create a new advertising forum... but at least let them come in. Preventing advertising and acting negatively towards anyone who even breathes a word of dropping hyperlinks will just turn people away... and therefore prevent potential newcomers from jumping into the chat.<br>
<br>
That said, too much advertising is very annoying, and makes the board look unprofessional. We need to maintain a balance.<br>
<br>
As an example, let's say we didn't know Chris (gothhenge). Chris finds our board and posts a link to gothhenge. Our current rules would result in Chris having his link edited and being told that we don't allow advertising. Or possibly the topic would get moved to the staff forum. Chris would be unlikely to come back.<br>
<br>
Wouldn't it be better to have an advertising forum that is openly promoted as a place to leave a link? The catch being that you have to have a site that is somehow related to the theme of the bbarden network. Wrestling boards wouldn't get in, but poetry boards would. (For example.)<br>
<br>
Those are just some ideas I'd like to throw out. We'd need to define the rules pretty clearly.<br>
<br>
2. New members.<br>
<br>
Two ideas for this (so far). As stated above:<br>
<br>
(a) Maybe we need to have some sort of introduction, e.g. &quot;New to the forums? Read this!&quot; - to explain what the forums are about, who the staff are...?<br>
<br>
(b) Create a forums for newbies to say hello in?<br>
<br>
That's all I have for now... <br>

<br>
I've always disallowed and discouraged advertising on my board. Always, always, always. And yes people still find ways to post their link, make a quick plug, etc. But I delete them. Especially if it's pure spam.<br>
<br>
If they you know post their thoughts, say hello, and then leave a link, I'll edit and simply remind them to keep links to their sigs. I think I'm more than generous when it comes to looking at other people's sites and boards. Especially if they talk to me on IM. But I don't need topics advertising them, they just take up space.<br>
<br>
In light of that however, I'm trying to do other things for our new members who need help getting their own board off the ground. I won't provide original ideas and in most cases, provide them with graphics. I 1) don't have the time and 2) believe they should come up with their own ideas. I will provide help with coding and as I like to call 'Community Services'. Things like the board hop and things I have planned in the future. <br>
<br>
Bottom line, Ben, allowing or disallowing advertising is always going to be a tricky choice. It seems there is no middle ground. If you allow it, that's all you get. If you disallow it, you don't get much at all. I still haven't found middle ground and Community Services is yet another attempt to do so.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  My thoughts on a Newbie forum:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Been there, done that. It worked.. while we were in the showcase. And it certainly contained the spam well. But I really don't see a need for it. My advice:<br>
<br>
• Don't let topics drag on. If they get long, ditch em. No one is just going to pop in to a topic that has over 50 replies already<br>
<br>
• Be interesting. If someone says hi, don't respond with a normal &quot;Hi, how are you&quot; in return. Make em feel at home. Offer them a seat, something to eat. First impressions are everything... being normal is not interesting.<br>
<br>
• Be stern, but kind. If someone breaks a rule, gentle reminders are all it takes. No one wants to have everyone jump on them for breaking a simple rule. If one person says something, no one else needs to.<br>
<br>
• Keep em laughing. Humor is one of the greatest things in the world, so share it with your newbies. I'll do most anything for a smile, that's my personality. I'll make fun of myself if I have to. But it works. If I get a smile, I'm happy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
• Make them feel at home. Don't be superficial. Don't act like you've been here forever even if you have. Just be a poster and new members will fit right in. No one wants to start out at the bottom of a social class. Would you?<br>
<br>
That's all for now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Hi there  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I know I am as new as I can possibly be, what with my stunning post count of 4 or 5 or whatever...but Ben &amp; I were chatting and he asked me to come post my thoughts on this thread.  So I hope I don't come off as a know it all, or like I think I can give sage advice to all of you who have actually been here and lived here for months and months.  I do know what has worked for my site over the last year, however, so I hope I can pass off an idea or two that'll help pick things up for you.<br>
<br>
First off, ITA with ditching the MBA.  I never apply for membership anywhere, and I am guessing most people don't, either.  So that's the best thing you can do for your site.  Glad that's taken care of.<br>
<br>
Next, whoever said having a forum for newbies to get their feet wet was right on.  I added a &quot;Guestbook&quot; forum to my site in March, and it has helped immensely.  New folks wander in and see a place where they can say hi and be welcomed, without feeling like they are intruding on someone else's conversation.  <br>
<br>
I have a &quot;rule&quot; (if you want to call it that) with my members that when someone posts in there, that we come and make the welcoming posts with appreciative smilies all around...it really makes then feel noticed and welcomed into the group.  Had I known how well it would work, I would have added it on day 1.  Some members opt for just diving right in on one of the themed forums, but most do start in the Guestbook.  <br>
<br>
You will get spam in there, but my experience is that it's not much.  One a week, if that?  I just delete the whole post and am done with it.  I allow regular members to post links to other sites they like or are ezOps of, but not fresh off the streets people, because I know they just want to annoy me and I'll never see them again.  And, some will post &quot;passing through&quot; posts (Hey, great site, I love the layout!) and they don't come back, either...but I like the kudos, so who cares?<br>
<br>
As for advertising...I have one thread in Just For Fun over in the Showcase that I keep updated and I bump it every AM when I log on.  My site tracker shows a lot of people come from there, so I'd suggest making an ad and sticking with it.  I never thought anyone actually read the ads and surfed those boards (I know I don't), but some people DO, and you can draw traffic that way.  Aside from this, I do NO OTHER ADVERTISING, and I get new members weekly.  So I don't think mad ads is the key.  IMO.<br>
<br>
Lots of forums is NOT an answer.  You have to cultivate the ones that work, shed the ones that don't, and expand from there.  A central theme helps as well, so most of your members have something in common.  Mine is an American soap opera (don't flame me!), so we started off with just that, and if you look at my site (I won't spam, it's in my profile - which is essentially an ad in and of itself) you'll see how much and how well we have expanded.  <br>
<br>
Pay attention to things lots of your members are discussing, and consider a forum for that subject.  Figure out how you can support it (content) and how many ways the forum can be utilized.  Supporting the rooms is the hard part, so....<br>
<br>
...let your members take over forums and make them their own.  Have Hosts on a rotating basis, or assign permanent Mods.  If ferret120 loves movies, and you see lots of posts about movies going on...well, let the ferret have a forum dedicated to movies on a more in depth level and work with them to make it unique and help it thrive.  <br>
<br>
Finally, for generating conversation, there is one sure fire topic that everyone wants to talk about:  themselves.  Ask questions.  Don't just comment, ask something.  This invites replies.  The most popular thread on my site has over 600 replies, and it gets 20 or so new replies a day.  The thread is simple...answer a question, and ask another.  One answer for each question.  People love it.<br>
<br>
All you can do is make a welcoming place where people can discuss anything and everything, and keep things active and interesting.  It requires a lot of work, but once you get the ball rolling, it picks up momentum and goes on it's own power from there.<br>
<br>
If I think of anything else, I'll add it later!  Yes, I can talk a lot...<br>
<br>
Good luck livening things up, Ben!  You're a peach.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
