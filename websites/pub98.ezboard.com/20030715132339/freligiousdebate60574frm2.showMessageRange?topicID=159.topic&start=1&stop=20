Unpatriotic Behavior?  Hollywood Politics?</span><hr size=1> Ok I am personally offended at the number of Hollywood &quot;big wigs&quot;  who have publically trashed Pres. Bush and US politics while performing in Foreign country.  I mean everybody has a right to have an opinion.  But I cant help but feeling like these people are lousy patriots to trash their own country and President to people in a different country.  AND I cant help but thinking that is just the 'IN' thing with liberal Hollywood types and amazingly enough none of these people had a problem with Clinton when he went in and dropped a few bombs while he was in office.  So if a conservative is in office, dont support him no matter waht he does and despite all the evidence that Sadam Hussein is a freaking nut who has been continuing to build up his biological and chemical weapons despite the UN resolution that he disarm as part of the Desert Storm finale, ( BTW, out of his own mouth I heard him say that he wasnt defeated in Desert storm, helloooo did this man go to the same war we did???)<br>
<br>
BUT if a liberal is in the office, It was necessary, OK, whatever.  Its all about political party and nothing to do with what is really going on in the world.  They are just still pissed off that Bush is in office to begin with, so no matter what he does, he is damned before he even does it. (Forget the fact that a private group that hand counted the ballots after the fact STILL had Bush winning)  anyway... this is my tirade for the day.

<br>
As for your comments about people not having a problem when Clinton did it...Kosovo was a totally different problem and a totally different situation.<br>
<br>
Also...people like Martin Sheen, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon etc. have been staunch anti-war protestors for quite some time - it isn't just an &quot;in* thing for them to do.<br>
<br>
I find it very frustrating that an entire country of people* think it is necessary to trash an entire other country - along with renaming food stuffs, talking about digging up corpses etc - simply because they happen to disagree with them.<br>
<br>
USA is *not* the ruler of the world...people and other countries are entitled to their own opinions, even if *gasp* they don't fit in with what shrub and co say...and while I'm sure there are a great many people out there who *are* anti-American (a lot of them are in the middle east) - the sentiments of people like the celebrities mentioned and a good portion of GB subjects etc. are *not* anti-American, they are just in disagreement with a fanatic (and I'm not talking about SH!) - that does not make them anti-American.<br>
<br>
* Obviously, not everybody in a country has the same opinion - most times, not everyone in the same house agrees on a single issue. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.growthspurts.com/drivee/images/434360233606.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaia25>Gaia25</A> at: 3/19/03 11:03:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=monynh>monyNH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/19/03 9:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=159.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Unpatriotic behaviour?</span><hr size=1> Whatever their motives, these artists exemplify what it is that folks from other countries admire MOST about the USA--the right to criticize their own government.

I'm so freaking sick and tired of all the anti-French sentiment also. Point fingers at particular people, not an entire country. <br>

I agree with you too.  This is getting ridiculous--since when is it un-American to express your views?  I find it interesting that the same people who accuse those who don't agree with the current administration of being &quot;unpatriotic&quot; are the same people who openly criticized the former administration--so is it only unpatriotic to express dissent when your guy is in office?  Give me a break--the government is run by people who make mistakes and bad decisions, and it's our right and priviledge to protest what we consider wrong, whether you're a celebrity or anonymous citizen.  If that weren't the case, blacks would still be segregated and women wouldn't have the vote.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kittenpoker>KittenPoker</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.nick.com/music/jukebox/images/juke_fop.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cheese Alloy</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/19/03 1:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=159.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Unpatriotic behaviour?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2003/03/07/notes030703.DTL" target="top">Mark Morford, San Francisco Chronicle</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

ITA with this, but cannot refrain from asking two questions that immediately pop into my mind whenever this subject comes up..<br>
<br>
1. Who the hell actually puts any stock in what celebs say/think about anything? (and if you really care about not buying products from those that violate your beliefs then boy do I have some info for you to review and products to add to your boycotting list) Is it just me or do soap starts, musicians and former ER sitcom actors not seem like experts to consult before making decisions on the environment, economy, family values, weapons, diseases....KWIM? Who gives a flying fuck what celebs do? And as for the oscars...I can't think of a group that would matter less if bombed (and I don't hate actors in particular, but hey if it's disneyland, a national park, the reserve bank of Oscars....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
2. What is patriotic behavior? I hope you don't drive a gas guzzling SUV with your 4 resource consuming western civ kiddies and have and are politically active in human rights and American politics if you're the one pointing the finger? <br>
<br>
And for whomever here thinks they have the definition for patriotic nailed down could you please forward that to Herr Aschcroft before he takes more of our cherished civil liberties and rights away, pissing on our FF's intentions and hard fought strides? <br>
<br>
P.S. I am the most liberal person you'll likely meat now hesitantly supporting military action so let's not make this a left vs. right wing debate since noone party seems to have the monopoly on red, white and blue.<br>

And, Clinton wanted to do more in 98 when he ordered the bombings in Iraq. No one would back him. He decided to quit because he was in the middle of Monicagate and figured everyone would say he was diverting attention from the&quot;Real&quot; issue. <br>
----<br>
As for Sheen and Sarandon, they have police records for protesting other causes. Not a new thing, and besides, they are private citizens. Hell, they're actors! Until the 1930's respectable people didn't even associate with actors! By the 1980's we had one in the Oval Office! <br>
----<br>
I'm disgusted that the Dems weren't more forceful a year ago. They were too worried about losing their offices that they went along with the legistlation that is allowing Bush to do this. <br>
----<br>
And I am tired of hearing 'war protestors must have forgotten Sept 11th&quot;. No, this isn't just about Sept 11th, we already retaliated for that...has everyone forgotten  Afganistan and overthrowing the Taliban, which only Pakistan even recognized as a legitimate govt? No, this goes beyond Sept 11th.<br>
<br>
The Hawks have been pushing for attacking Saddam ever since the first UN agreement was reached in 91. They tried to convince Bush Sr to do it, and Clinton too. They were encouraging W. to do it before Sept 11th. they got him to attack in February 01 and were pissed he didn't take it further.If anything, the tragedy  of Sept 11th gave them an usable exuse, not a reason. <br>
<br>
The reasons were there  in 1990 when Iraq invaided Kuwait. In 1988 when Saddam used gas on the Kurds in his own country. In 1986 when Iraq used gas against Iran. In 1979 when Saddam executed political rivals.  But we didn't try to stop him in 79 and 86 because he was fighting the people who held US citizens hostage---he was fighting our enemy. This is an old, tangled up relationship, and is going to be very messy to fix.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kittenpoker>KittenPoker</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.nick.com/music/jukebox/images/juke_fop.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cheese Alloy</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/19/03 2:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=159.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need to type slower</span><hr size=1> Dixie Chicks!

<br>
And we could start a whole other thread on the total CRAP about everything being just hunk dory under Clinton - you do remember that the Conservatives had control of the House and Senate don't you, THEY were the ones who passed the laws that kept things going well.  If anyone should personally take the credit for the economy it should be Allen Greenspan .<br>
<br>
The economy took a dive after 911, People stopped traveling as much, airlines hit, hotels hit, restaraunts hit, little shops that tourist ususally spend money in hit, laundry supply to sell to those people took a hit (thats what dh does) those people not having as much money to spend on other products, other products took a hit blah blah blah. Not much to do with who was in office.  <br>
<br>
It does matter that under Clinton nothing was done to take the threat of Terrorism a little more seriously.  He was too busy getting off and hiding from reality and the truth that eh could see the world around him -- oh and he gave military /nuclear information to CHINA for heaven's sake.<br>
<br>
There is a scene in A Band of Brothers - where the main charachter salutes this total jerk and then makes the comment that we salute the rank, not the man.  I think the office of the president deserves enough respect that you dont go around disn him to other countries.  Say what you want, but do it at home, to a home town crowd.  _ I am not saying they dont have the right, I just think it is EXTREMLEY POOR TASTE. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ctrlaltdelirious>CtrlAltDelirious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/19/03 11:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=159.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: courage</span><hr size=1> I don't particularly care where anyone says what they think.

(I'm fully with Jon Stewart on that one)<br>
<br>
Most of the celebrities are democrats, so big surprise that they aren't too keen on Dubya to begin with.  So they think a president who got half a million votes <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>less</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> than the other candidate isn't exactly the person to be spear heading bringing democracy to the world.. can't say I blame them.<br>
<br>
A big Dubya campaign promise was no more nation building, we're still in the former Yugoslavia, we're in Afghanistan doing just what he said they wouldn't and about to do it again in another country.  Good thing he never said &quot;Read my lips...&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We blast the French for what they sold to Iraq, but part of the reason we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>know</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that they have VX gas, Anthrax etc. is because the US gave it to them back when Iraq was our friend because they were Iran's enemy.<br>
<br>
I'm wary of this movement to paint people with the brush of &quot;unpatriotic, unAmerican&quot;, because the funny thing when these sort of things happen - the brush gets bigger and bigger and you never know when it's going to include you.<br>
<br>
Am I going to dump out my bottle of wine and toss my Brie because it's from France, hell no.  Our choices of products would get really slim if we included the products from every country that wasn't part of the &quot;Coallition of the Willing&quot; (am I the only one getting sick of these catch phrases for frickin' EVERYTHING).<br>
<br>
So the DC said something in another country, whoop-dee-do.  Is it in poor taste?  Actually I think it's rather sad that Americans feel freer to speak their minds outside this country than inside it.<br>

Why couldn't that be the case?<br>
<br>
Allen Greenspan in my opinion was both responsible for the rise in the economy during the 90s and partly responsible for the fall of the economy. And it happened before 9/11. 9/11 didn't help matters, but the markets were crashing before that time. I remember being pregnant with my first in 2000 and watching the market just slam downward. Something like 500 points down at one point that day even if it didn't end that low. <br>
<br>
I dislike the move to paint people unpatriotic as well. Hell I just bought 6 bottles of french wine this past weekend because the wineseller was on base over here. <br>
<br>
If I was to boycott all countries who do not support the US I would be trapped on base. I wouldn't be able to go off base. I would go nuts. <br>
<br>
While I am disappointed we are going in without support and wish we could have waited. I think France made it very clean they were never going to support the use of force. Bush pushed too hard and france was unwilling to bend. Neither side was willing to work with each other to achieve a working goal. The UN said to disarm and cooperate. It didn't look like france would ever be willing to go through on an ultimatum, and Bush wasn't willing to give the others time at all. Did one push the other? Or did they just happen?<br>
<br>
I'm rambling. We had a bad night here. DS didn't want to be anywhere but pasted to my boob from 10:30 last night onward. <br>

In some ways I think that this administration (with the exception of a few people) lack anything that even resembles diplomacy.<br>
<br>
I think in the aftermath of 9/11 they should have gone to both the UN and NATO and started the process of defining what a terrorist is, what a state who supports terrorism does - and used the backing to proceed.  Instead they sort of jumped into Afghanistan, which everyone sort of overlooked and I think that made for a dangerous precedent.<br>
<br>
Iraq never should have been allowed to fester uninspected as long as it did, I think the Republican congress did a lot of damage back in '98 which would not authorize Clinton to send troops in but use air strikes instead.  He had the UN backing, Iraq had just kicked out the inspectors... it was the right time.<br>
<br>
There was too much strong arming, Clinton showed with Yugoslavia that you can circumvent the UN when he took the issue to NATO and began the bombing campaign with them.  Even NATO wouldn't deal with this administration...<br>
<br>
I don't like the Republicans that much right now, but am seriously pissed at the Democrats for giving them a blank check to go to war back in October without any limitations, or options to take it back to a debate later.<br>

<br>
Its been said that france has said they will join in if chemical weapons are used. Well it was the foreign minister (I believe) who said that. Chirac has come back and has said france won't come in even then. <br>
<br>
The thing between Bush and Chirac would be laughable, IMO, if it didn't have such HUGE consequences. It probably was Bush's lack of tact and deplomacy that pushed Chirac into his hardline position, but really it never looked to me that either was willing to accept the other could possibly be right. Or have a valid point. <br>
<br>
Well it doesn't matter now, does it? We have started this war. It will be interesting to see what the history books tell of this in 50 years. <br>

Ok my children want my attention. I should turn off the computer and immerse myself in childhood right now. And just be thankful that currently my husband is still with me and will be until they get back some of the folks from his shop already down there. Then he goes.<br>
