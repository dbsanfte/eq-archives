Do your own personal religious beliefs factor into your feelings?<br>
<br>
I'm curious, for a few reasons:<br>
<br>
1) Bush is our most overtly-religious president (certainly in recent history), yet seems to have no qualms about initiating a pre-emptive strike against Iraq.  Now, I know that the political climate of the Bush administration has been severely altered by 9-11, but I'm wondering if certain religious populations are more likely to support a war based on the biblical tenet of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;, or because, through religion, they have a sense of moral superiority that makes the issue more black and white.  (I'm thinking of the way in which most of the religious right staunchly supports that death penalty and wondering if any aspect of this mentality crosses over to the idea of war.) <br>
<br>
2) I recently read an article by John Shelby Spong, the Bishop of Newark for the Episcopal church.  While he considers himself a devout Christian, he is a leading advocate for reform in the Church and supports gay marriage (acceptance of homosexuality in general), female clergy, evolution, etc.  If you'll forgive the copyright infringement, here's what he has to say on the matter:<br>
<br>
THE WAR WITH IRAQ: Can we Find Unity in our Humanity?!!<br>
<br>
The feeling is quite surreal. It is like being carried inexorably against your will. It elicits a sense of powerlessness. I search to find the words to utter a protest. They do not come easily. That is what I am experiencing as I watch my nation rush headlong toward war. <br>
<br>
My dis-ease does not arise from a favorable view of Iraq. I am not unaware of the criminal behavior of Saddam Hussein. It comes, rather, from my great love for America and the ideals that I associate with this nation. So I have to state that none of the arguments being put forth today to hype this all but inevitable war are to me compelling. <br>
<br>
Those arguments, as rehearsed daily in our newspapers, TV talk shows, magazines and radio are as follows: <br>
<br>
1. Iraq harbors terrorists. But so do Palestine, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. It is also a fact that Germany, Great Britain and the United States have been home to terrorists groups. <br>
<br>
2. Saddam has murdered his own people. While murdering one's own citizens is tragic, it is not unknown in history. Pakistan, our ally against the Taliban, has done so to to its Hindu citizens. Russia has done it in Chechnya, China has done it in Tiananmen Square, Germany has done it against the Jews, and in the United States, this tactic has been used against Native and African-Americans. <br>
<br>
3. Saddam has chemical and biological weapons and is seeking a nuclear capability. But many nations of the world, including the United States, have chemical and biological weapons. Russia, Great Britain, Pakistan, India, France, and China all have atomic weapons and North Korea is said to be near that breakthrough, while Iran has missiles on the assembly line. <br>
<br>
4. Saddam is evil. But so are or were Mugabe in Zimbabwe, Idi Amin in Uganda, Caeusescu in Rumania, Milosovic in Yugloslavia and Pinochet in Chile. <br>
It is, I believe, because this case for war against Iraq is so weak, that there has been a vigorous attempt at the highest levels of our government to link Saddam with the terrorists of 9/11. But, such a linkage has been denied in every intelligence briefing to Congress, a fact noted by the bipartisan chair and vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. But, then the war hawks shout, 'did not the citizens of Iraq cheer the September 11 attack upon the United States with parades of chanting people in the streets?' Yes, but so did many people in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Egypt and Pakistan. <br>
<br>
America is not universally popular. So what is the real source of this visceral hatred of Iraq that today has created this eagerness for war? I wish I had a clear answer. I do not. All I can do is speculate. You, my readers, must take these comments and questions for what they are - mere speculations. <br>
<br>
So ask yourselves, 'could any one of these possibilities be factors in that combustible mix that is fueling our nation's passion to go to war?' Dismiss them all if you wish, but allow them to be raised. <br>
<br>
Are we motivated by the frustration of our unfinished and apparently unwon war against terrorism? This nation was attacked brutally on September 11th. Despite a massive military effort to defang the terrorists, more than a year has passed and not even Afghanistan can be said to be secure or stable. Neither Osama Bin Laden nor the former head of the Taliban Government has been captured or confirmed as dead. Most of the hunted Al Qaeda operatives, central to the devastation of September 11, simply disappeared into the mountains of Afghanistan. They continue to engage in hit-and-run guerrilla attacks, in which a building is blown up here and a bus there. These attacks, like the Tet Offensive of Viet Nam, remind us that this enemy has neither been destroyed nor rendered harmless. Is it possible, that compared to these secretive and illusive terrorists, Iraq represents a visible enemy that we could crush militarily? Would that ease our haunting sense that the terrorists do not fight in a way that we understand? A successful conventional war might repair the damage our psyches have sustained at the hands of the terrorists. Is that a possibility? <br>
<br>
Are there political reasons for this war talk? This has been suggested by foreign leaders and recently by Vermont's Senator Jeffords, that body's sole official from the Independent Party here in the United States. It is a fearful possibility. Yet there are some political realities that cannot be denied. The economy is in a shambles. The stock market is at a five-year low. Fortunes and retirement accounts across America have been lost. It really doesn't matter what caused this economic depression, the party in power inevitably gets blamed for it. <br>
<br>
The midterm elections here in the U.S. are about a month away. Just a few weeks ago the driving agenda for these elections was the state of this economy and the factors, including corporate corruption, that have fed its collapse. A powerful motive exists for shifting the political debate from these domestic maladies to a foreign threat. It rouses patriotic feelings and diverts the latent hostility to an outside enemy. People rally around the commander-in-chief in a time of peril. The payoff is the control of both houses of Congress. No political party is above trying to set the debate for its own political gain. Of course that will be angrily denied and impugning the patriotism of those who pose this issue is the classic defense. <br>
<br>
Does the defeat of Iraq serve America's interests by making Middle Eastern oil available to our oil thirsty Western world? Iraq has huge oil reserves. If Saddam were defeated, a friendly government in Baghdad that owed its allegiance to our military might, would surely be cooperative. Never again would America be held hostage to Middle Eastern oil. Democracy, once installed in Iraq, so this argument goes, might then have a ripple effect all over that region. Is there at least a germ of truth in this intriguing possibility? <br>
Is there some unfinished family business here? The first Bush administration was a one-term presidency. Among the perceived shortcomings of that administration was the failure to finish the task in Iraq. The first President Bush left Saddam in power when his nation was on the ropes and his army in retreat. Does the son of this president feel a compelling need to write a new ending to this piece of history? I do not know, I simply wonder. <br>
<br>
I raise these questions as one who is grateful for America. But by America, I mean the dreams that are embodied in the Declaration of Independence, the ideals found in the Constitution and even the hopes expressed in the Gettysburg address. These are the things that have made America a beacon of hope to oppressed people everywhere. Yet these are also the very things that I see being tarnished when our nation's leaders speak of preemptive strikes. These dreams, ideals and hopes are bent out of shape by the suggestion that it is our right, in violation of international law, to remove from power any government we do not approve. They are ripped asunder by our willingness to use our enormous military might to impose our will on a nation that does not pose a clear threat to our national existence. <br>
<br>
I believe that American power carries with it a responsibility to set an example of freedom. It gives us the ability to hold before the world a vision of liberty and justice available to all people. What message does the world hear from our rumblings of war? How will we respond when other nations, following our example, do to those they fear what we are now claiming the right to do to one that we fear? By ignoring inconvenient world opinion in order to rush into war, are we not in danger of becoming a nation more loathed than respected in the court of world opinion? Is that what the American dream has become? <br>
<br>
Human beings have always had deep tribal needs. To preserve our particular tribe or nation, human beings have throughout history done dreadful things to one another. These evil deeds are both noticed and long remembered. That is what feeds the current hatred in such places as Ireland and Northern Ireland, Pakistan and India, Israel and the Middle East. If power is used to impose our nation's will on another with little regard for their common humanity, the seeds of an enduring bitterness will be sown and the people of that nation and its secret admirers will find a way to strike back someday, even if it comes generations or even centuries later. Terrorism is one of those ways. <br>
<br>
A free nation, no matter how powerful, cannot finally defend itself against those who are willing to die in order to inflict pain on the ones they think of as their enemies. We may well conquer the world with our power only to discover that we have become vulnerable to decades of terrorist acts which will suck the very life out of the freedom that made America possible. If we do not find some unity in our humanity, then the tribal claims of competing nations will finally destroy civilization itself. <br>
<br>
The very dream that America personifies compels me to cry out against this relentless war frenzy that appears destined to end only in an armed conflict. I want to shout No! No! No! to the path that we now seem to be walking. My great fear is that nobody is listening.<br>
-- Bishop Spong <br>
<br>
His assessment, imo, is dead-on.<br>

We have a huge economic interest in those two countries. Bush has a lot of money in oil over there to.<br>
Ya, I think Saddom is whacked, but there are many other leaders who are to.<br>
As far as a war what has Saddom done that he wasnt always doing?<br>
Why cant they just go in and assinate him queitly?<br>

I've read several of Spong's book and, as a liberal Christian, tend to agree with much of what he has to say.  I had not read this before, but I think he's dead on about this subject as well.  I fail to see the logic of a war with Iraq when so many other countries have the same capabilities with leaders as immoral as Saddam Hussein.  I had no doubt when the UN weapons inspectors started doing their job that there would be no possible outcome which would deter Bush from insisting we need to go to war--that was decided before any reports came in.  I'm sure there is a lot going on here that we don't know, but I believe this whole situation is *compeletely* political.<br>

If only we would recognize the internal strugges for freedom and more democracy WITHIN some of these countries by learning the lessons of India and other nations with large Muslim populations (doesn't India currently have a Muslim president and outspoken female Muslims who openly refused to participate in the war in Afghanistan against the US???) we could sit back and let the people of that country make necessary changes.<br>
<br>
As was pointed out there are other countries with nukes and there are also other Muslim countries that are friendly and have much more democracy. If people are well fed and in a good, open society you don't see so many problems and us continuing to meddle as we are seen to do (did we not learn a lesson from  removing an elected leader in Iran and replacing him with a cruel despot???) will only fuel the fire burning in the hearts of many Muslims who believe we are the enemy. Let countries like Saudi Arabia and others deal with their own dissidents and have open dialogue with the Muslim sects within so they can settle their affairs and soon those governments (like Saddam's)will have to answer for their own transgressions against their own people without having the US as a scapegoat all the time...<br>
<br>
Oh well, off the soapbox now. Used to find Shrub Jr. merely nauseating and irritatingly stupid, but now he just scares the crap out of my the same way I feel when watching footage of Jesse Helms, Pat Robertson, Ted Bundy....<br>

Tony Blair has got his tongue so far up Bush's arse that it is sickening! (sorry..I know that is a crude thing to say...but it's true)...I find the whole &quot;he tried to kill my dad&quot; mentality very silly - laughable if it didn't come from a person who holds all our lives in his hands!<br>

I also believe that he is certainly trying to give everyone something else to focus on..I don't know about USA, but over here, Bin Laden is hardly ever mentioned these days...it seems like they are trying to cover up the fact that esentially they *failed*!<br>
<br>
Edited because I forgot to add something that made me laugh yesterday...there was an article on the BBC news yesterday that stated - <br>
<br>
&quot;US President George W Bush rallied US troops on Friday, telling them that a war in Iraq would be &quot;not to conquer but to liberate&quot;. &quot;<br>
<br>
Seems like he will do anything to try and convince people that he is right and anyone who goes against him is wrong!

<br>
Have the Bush twins signed up for service? Or will they be following Dad's footsteps, and avoiding the whole thing?<br>
<br>
I find it frightening beyond belief that this unelected man is taking us ever closer to war, on the advice of his similiarly unelected advisors. I would say that it's a huge play to distract us from the number he's done on the economy (who's going to vote him out of office amidst a war- that would be unpatriotic, right?).<br>
<br>
On an even gloomier note, I saw that Bush today proposed another round of tax cuts- deeper than the previous ones that got us into this economic mess.<br>

<br>
1. My DH just returned on December 20 with the USS George Washington battlegroup. Yep, I'm a Navy wife. We only have 3.5 yrs left until he retires. GWB has placed the GW battlegroup on alert...if he says, &quot;Hey everybody! We're gonna bomb the crap outta Iraq!&quot; we have 96 hrs until DH leaves...again. So on that front, it's purely selfish. Damnit, he just came home!<br>
<br>
2. My employer, US Coast Guard, has fallen under DOHS (Dept of Homeland {in}Security. This regime has yanked several rights that normal civil service employees take for granted. Not a pretty picture and I believe that DOHS is a knee-jerk response to 9/11/01.<br>
<br>
Just because my DH is active duty Navy and I'm a fed doesn't mean we support this one single bit. I think this whole Iraq thing is to divert our attention away from other, more menacing threats (hello! North Korea called and they have boatloads of nukes! Oh yeah, and OBL is still smarting from Eminem's parody).<br>
<br>
I voted Nader...I knew VA was a lost (republican) cause.  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I'm just goofin' on you, baybee!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Cosmo</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jenterra>jenterra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/4/03 2:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Scary</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I believe that DOHS is a knee-jerk response to 9/11/01.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

ITA, Wen.  Like Spong said, in the end, there's nothing we can do to protect ourselves against some whack-job who's willing to strap on some explosives and kill himself for a cause we'll never understand.  Why not do something about the reason these people became radicals in the first place, rather than start a war that will likely breed thousands of new radicals bent on apparent revenge?<br>
<br>
Homeland Security is really designed to make us all think we're safer.  <br>
<br>
As an aside, my father's former partner recently got a job at the white house as a fairly high-ranking homeland security official.  He emailed my dad to tell him about his new &quot;career&quot; and said he wondered how long he would work there before any one figured out he was a fraud.  Then emailed again a few weeks later to say, not to worry, the department is entirely staffed with frauds!<br>

And the people he's surrounded himself with scare the shit out of me. Personally I think Bush killed off any brain cells he ever had with the drug use and right now he's just doing what he's told to do. THAT is what's scary, IMO. <br>
<br>
I didn't vote last time. It was like picking between sour milk and burnt coffee. Neither was palatable to me. <br>
<br>
I really hope the democrats offer up someone decent this time, but I'm scared it would be Leiberman and he's part of the reason I wouldn't vote for Gore. <br>
<br>
Like KittenPoker, DH and I don't support this current war effort either, even though we too are a military family. Though there are alot of military families out there who blindly agree with Bush just because he's brought in some decent raises for a change. <br>

Try Utah!!!! There are people here naive enough to think that if you are Mormon, you are automatically a republican! Scary if you ask me! That all boils down to moral issues that I believe are not legislatable (is that a word?) anyway.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I thought that the way Bush handled the 9/11 thing was great when it happened... BUT, he went from the appearance of this whiney little back woods boy to this complete and total irrational war-driven idiot.  There has to be a middle ground in there somewhere! Sheesh. Anyway, I started getting scared when he first mentioned the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; which was what, 9/12? And since then I think that he has grown increasingly hell-bent on war. It is amazing to me what the idea of war has done to him... it is like he is possessed. He seems to have absolutely no rationale left.  He gives Iraq and ultimatum... let us in everywhere or else... Like we would let their inspectors ANYWHERE! but even so, we have found nothing and he is still going. Then he says, turn in your documentation and then probably never even touched a copy and procedes to say how sure he is that it is incomplete. Now, I have no doubt that Iraq is a threat to us. I have no doubt that they are capable of causing harm to our country but our country was not built on the divide and conquer premise. We are here for freedom, not to be a world dictator that makes up the rules as we go along. <br>
<br>
The DOHS seems completely ineffective to me. Seems like they are there just to make sure that no one ever enjoys a holiday or public event again... &quot;we have an unsubstatiated threat... not sure when, where, or even if anything is supposed to happen but make sure you are paranoid just in case...&quot; I just don't get it. And yet on the other hand, it wouldn't surprise me to see the terrorists just waiting for us to let our guards down to strike again. I don't trust them but then I don't really trust that we have improved things much since 9/11 either.<br>
<br>
I will add this gripe one more time since it really is a pet peeve for me... when they start talking about who they are going to blame for the 9/11 attacks... did they really need to waste tax dollars to launch that investigation? Just so that they can find a group of Americans to pin this tragedy on? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I just wonder what it is like for Bush's wife... can you just imagine how sick and tired you would be of hearing him go on and on and on about killing Saddam? It seems that is the only thing he thinks about. Which is sad with rising unemployment rates, increase in people needing welfare and govt. assistance, the state of the economy and stock market, the fact that there are still children in this country who can't see a dr. when they are sick because there is no reasonable health insurance out there and the insurance cos. just keep getting richer and richer, and the fact that you have people who have to choose between heating their home, having food to eat or taking life saving prescription drugs. Yeah, Saddam is our biggest priority. I see it! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
