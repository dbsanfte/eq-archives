The crowd seems to settle in after the first match. Then The Rock comes out and the fans give a standing obation. The crowd is going crazy when The Rock walks out. The Rock is posing at the top of the ramp.<br><br><img src=http://www.therock.com/photos/champ/images/02.jpg><br><br><br>The Rock continues to walk down the ramp and then he walks the steps. He poses at all four corners.<br><br><img src=http://www.therock.com/photos/champ/images/115.jpg> <br><br>The Rock's music settles down and then he grabs a mic.<br><br><I><font color=blue>Finally, The Rock has come back to 2 Night. This Sunday, The Rock is going to be an a all out brawl with two of the best in the business. Two people who just like The Rock are in their prime. One of them is just to remind you a weed smokin jackass. And the other one is a man that is stubborn, he built this house, but most importantly he's a bitch. But that's beside the point, The Rock knows that everybody knows who The Rock is facing.  So now RVD, you wanna come out here and tell The Rock that you have respect for me and that you are gonna take me to the limit or whatever the hell you said. Well RVD, The Rock doesn't care because when The Rock is in the ring, The Rock is going to kick anyone's ass that is in The Rock's way. And frankly, RVD your in The Rock's way today so when The Rock gets in that ring RVD, The Rock holds no prisinors. The Rock doesn't go easy on anybody. So RVD get to the ride of your life because when Sunday comes The Rock is gonna take it to you. The Rock is gonna layeth the smack it down on your roody poo candy ass. Now on to Elix Skipper, Primetime, let The Rock get us straight, I don't like you and you don't like The Rock, But Primetime, tonight there will be the special stipulation named for our matchup and The Rock swears Primetime, that if you cheat once, The Rock will lay the smackdown on you. See Primetime, you beat AJ Styles but when it got tough in the second round you had to take that gold painted bronze ring and you had to hit them with it. But see Elix Skipper, The Rock doesn't care, oh no The Rock doesn't care if you pull that thing on The Rock, The Rock will still regardless leave the Undisputed Champion. The Rock will still be the best damn wrestler in eWo. The Rock will always be the best damn wrestler in eWo and The Rock is going to show you why when it comes to Sunday. Now Scott Hall, Hey yo... Scott, The Rock is going to accept your offer. One week and one day after Sprin Stampede, The Rock is going to become the next Undisputed and US Champion because the match will be The Rock vs. Scott Hall and whatever titles are won will be on the line so Scott, you better wash that title and hold it as strong as you can if you win it because after you do, The Rock will take it from you. So RVD, you tell The Great One to just bring it RVD, but see RVD you and Elix Skipper need to know something, The Rock isn't gonna tell you to Just Bring IT. No, just like The Rock's shirt says, You Bring The Ass, I'll Bring The Whoopin. If ya smellllalalalalau what The Rock is cookin.</I><br><br><font color=red>The Rock's music hits as The Rock sniffs the air.<br><br><img src=http://www.therock.com/photos/champ/images/84.jpg><br><br>The Rock then stares into the camera. <br><br><img src=http://www.therock.com/photos/champ/images/120.jpg><br><br>The Rock jumps down the turnbuckle. He walks out of the ring and up his ramp. The fans are still going crazy. The Rock walks up the ramp and walks to the locker room as the camera fades and eWo goes to commercial.</B> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=37.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=37.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.threadControl?topicID=37.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=37.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=37.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ewo80708frm1">eWo RP Board<option value="ewo80708frm2">eWo OOC Board<option value="ewo80708frm3">eWo Nitro<option value="ewo80708frm4">eWo 2 NighT</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bewo80708>eWo</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1>eWo RP Board</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
