<br>
From what I understand, two different views:<br>
1) Satan exists and his is powerful and if worshipped will reward his devotees.<br>
2) Satan doesn't exists - only a symbol of fleshly human desires and appetites.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.churchofsatan.com/home.html" target="top">The Church of Satan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, (as opposed to the link given in another thread) founded by Anton Lavey who made the following statement in the satanic bible -<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence.  Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams.  Satan represent vengeance instead of turning the other cheek.

<br>
Umm...no thanks.<br>
<br>
The Temple of Set (Founded by Dr. Michael Aquino) I believe was an offspring of Lavey's church.  He claimed to have had a revelation from satan informing him to begin afresh with an organization that would worship the true powers of darkness.  <br>
<br>
Hmmm...communication with satan....again, no thanks.<br>
<br>
Whether traditional, non-traditional, public, dabblers, or individuals on their own...Any way I look at it, I'm not seeing a whole lot that I could possibly agree with.<br>
<br>
I also remember DBC knowing something about this, maybe he can shed a little more light?<br>

<br>
I'm not a huge fan of Satanism myself because:<br>
1. If you believe in Satan in a godlike way--whether he's equal to god or you think he's good/evil aside, you're a theist and I am an atheist. There is no more reason to believe in Satan than god, Jesus, spirits, fairies...In this way, Satanists are JUST LIKE xians, Jews, Muslims etc. they just worship a different god--and not necessarily a less violent one. He is certainly invoked in the name of murder, rape, pillaging and war in general FAR less often than Jehovah. <br>
<br>
2. If he's not a god, then choosing to go by the name causes undue confusion and false assumptions, particularly from xians who can be a fairly rabid bunch already against those who don't share their beliefs. Why burden yourself with a xian-based title for a belief system? I guess I can sort of see how they are trying to portray themselves as following the opposite of some of what's in the bible....but again, using Satan..oh well..<br>
<br>
3. While most of the self-gratifying things are harmless (even those that advocate revenge do so only toward adults who have caused you harm--no children or animals which already places them above xians), the absence of a measure for utilitarianism doesn't sit with me. I don't care about praying for better sex---how can THAT be wrong<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , but there is great value in deferred gratification, even if the goal is a greater gratification in the end (saving for retirement, saving for a better toy/car/house so you are happier in long run, eating right to feel better later). <br>
<br>
I am not as familiar with Satanists as DBC, but find them far less threatening than xians and often times indistinguishable in lifestyle. It is simply not a religion that causes people to roam around hurting others, especially when compared to xianity. A mite too hedonistic for my taste? Sure, but this doesn't make it immoral...<br>

I read through their faq's and found it extremely informative.  I particularly found this quote intriguing:<br>
<br>
<br>
Does the Devil really exist? If so, what does he look like?<br>
<br>
Some Satanists view the Devil as the first individual - the first being to acquire consciousness and self-awareness. This lends itself to free will and is the true meaning behind Lucifer's &quot;fall from grace.&quot; We are all inheritors of that gift, so if you are asking me what the devil looks like, I would simply tell you to go look in a mirror.<br>
<br>
<br>
Their ideas about the relationship between man and the duality of god/devil is so interesting.  I obviously disagree, as I don't believe in either a god or devil figure, and I find their devotion to self-service off-putting--but it's a fascinating pov nonetheless.<br>

<br>
Now...  let me begin... *clears throat*<br>
<br>
The Church of Satan is setup more as a moral code than any kind of actual religion per se...  at least initially.  They live more by the concepts of immediate gratification and self-satisfaction than by the denial of the natural human urges that all of us feel.  The reason for the use of the name Satan (in so far as this has been explained to me anyway at various discussion groups) was initally for the shock value.  What better way than to announce a philosophy that was so diametrically opposed to all of the major western religions than to invoke the name of the key figure signifying evil than by using the name of Satan?  <br>
<br>
As time went on, however, La Vey realized that without a little more to work with, his philosophy would not live up to the truly wicked sounding name he had chosen.  With that in mind, he simply delved deep into various religious texts, digging up names of fallen angels and other such demons, which he inevitably mixed in with a healthy dose of pagan ritual.  These &quot;rites&quot; to &quot;summon the very princes of Hell&quot; to aid the satanist were nothing more than meaningless words written down to make people feel that they were receiving the energy to do what they weren't confident enough in themselves to do without them.<br>
<br>
Now...  I understand that this is just a dry history of the creation of the Church of Satan (again, as it was explained to me at various discussion groups [also, it should be noted that it was explained to me by persons who have left the &quot;church&quot; because of the hypocracy inherent in any massed religious group]).  However, what I personally do not understand is how it is that a group of people who simply want to live by the philosophy of &quot;Do as thou will&quot; are so greatly feared and despised by groups that are supposed to pride themselves on acceptance and forgiveness (i.e. Love the sinner, hate the sin).<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>You know what they say...  rub the Tummy and you'll have good luck all day...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mormongirl2>Mormongirl2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/14/03 11:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Satanism</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>However, what I personally do not understand is how it is that a group of people who simply want to live by the philosophy of &quot;Do as thou will&quot; are so greatly feared and despised by groups that are supposed to pride themselves on acceptance and forgiveness (i.e. Love the sinner, hate the sin<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Satan, the person, is a coniving individual, whose whole goal is to lead people away from the gospel of Christ and his doctrines of loving your neighbor, self control over your passions and personal salvation.    <br>
<br>
If he can do that by convincing these people (who invoke his name without actually believing in him) that life is all about self indulgence and seeking after all your lusts with no regard for anyone else, well then he has put chains around those souls and is carefully leading them down to hell.<br>
<br>
Do you really want to have people around you that have no ethical problem with using everyone for their own gain and satisfaction?  <br>
<br>
Besides that Satan's biggest lie is that he doesnt exist.  And if doesnt exist neither does God, which is exactly what he wants people to believe.

What I got from the faqs at the Church of Satan was that Satanist do not see him this way.  Rather, they see him as the first being to exercise free-will and his own conscience as opposed to following the Christian god's orders (quote):<br>

<br>
Just as your faith and, say, JW's differ on biblical interpretations regarding blood transfusions, so do Satanists interpret differently the role of Lucifer in the Bible.  Now, just about everything I know about Lucifer is from the movie &quot;Dogma&quot;, so I'll refrain from offering an opinion on which is more likely.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Of course this could just be the work forcing me to hurry this, or the lack of sleep, but...  *takes two phone calls as he is at work*...  <br>
<br>
I know many satanists that would totally *takes a phone call* agree with that sentiment.  However, I have also heard a few other views that are likewise interesting, although I have a hard time swallowing many of their aspects.  My personal favorite has *takes a call, thinks he can type, than phone rings again...  silly bankers...* got to be one I heard from a friend of mine that I swear sounds like he got it straight from a role playing game (which really wouldn't surprise me knowing this guy).<br>
<br>
He detailed an account written by &quot;mortal prophets&quot; during Lucifer's fall from grace.  It states that the angels that helped God in creation loved their creation as they loved God, and were commanded to do so.  They were also commanded to stay hidden from the creation they labored over and loved so deeply.  Eventually, the angels fell to bickering over which commandment was more important; to love creation equal to God, or to hide themselves from the eyes of creation.  This dispute came to a head when Lucifer, the first Morningstar, decided to *takes a call* lead those angels that felt it unfair to hide themselves from creation in open revolt against the will of God.<br>
<br>
Thought that was kind of an interesting spin on Lucifer.  From the &quot;evil conniving Prince of Darkness&quot; in the Christian standpoint, to a bit of a martyr who loved creation too much.

We beleive were all a big family Heavenly Father, Heavenly Mother and all of us little spirit kids.  As we grew and developed and matured, the time came when the only way we could progress any further was to come to an earth and gain a body.<br>
<br>
Two plans arose.  The first was Heavenly Fathers plan. That a world would be created and we could come down here and be given free agency. The right to choose to follow God and all the eternal laws or not.  But because he knew we would make mistakes, there would be a need for a savior to pay for our sins so that we could overcome evil and return to our Heavenly Family.  Jesus Christ, the eldest son of our Father, volunteered to be the Savior.<br>
<br>
Second plan, arose when Satan didnt like the first plan.  his alternative was to force us to all behave and not have free-will and because all of us would return, he wanted to have all of Gods glory.  That plan was rejected, because the whole purpose of earth was to gain wisdom and understanding from our mistakes.  Satan was mad.  This is the war in heaven spoken about in revelations.  So he did all he could to convince the rest of us to follow him.  One third of HF's children did and they were cast out.  Every one else (those of us born on the earth) chose HF plan.<br>
<br>
Christ and other valiant spirits did create the earth under the direction of HF and Satan and his followers were allowed to come here to tempt us.  So Satan is still peeved that he will never have a body.  His main goal (still) is to get us to use our agency to follow him in rebellion against God.  So in a way the satanist are right in that he was the first to use his agency to rebel against God. But to me that isnt a good thing.<br>
<br>
I have shared this before, but as a missionary we were teaching a woman who had a Satan worshipper boarding in her house (we did not know it at the time)  And during one of our conversations with her. Some&quot;thing&quot; upstairs started banging around and the ladies I was with looked terrified.  Finally it donned on me that we were alone in the house and no live person was upstairs making all the noise.  When I realized what was going on, that evil spirit rushed down the stairs and ran at me with the intent to do me harm.  And although I did not see him physically, it was as tangible as thunder and lightening.  So I know they exist and I know that they are still fighting against HF' plan. - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=iamtummy>IamTummy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/15/03 5:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: LDS view on him</span><hr size=1> Woah...  that's an interesting take on the subject.

I will say however, that that is quite an interesting phenomenon that you witnessed inside the woman's home...  Can't say that it hasn't been documented in the past.  In fact several accounts of homeowners in the area around Sacramento CA are not too far from that same route.  To illustrate that I would like to refer to a personal experience of my own.<br>

A friend of mine had moved from the small town of Ceres California to a larger sub-division of West Sacramento...  As we were moving all of his belongings into the new house, we noticed a really foul smell coming from the crawlspace underneath the building itself.  We also kept hearing a rattling sound coming from crawlspaces in between the walls.  For a few hours, we just chalked it up to rats and maybe a dead cat or something.  This all changed rather quickly when my friend decided to store an old treadmill (didn't know why he bothered to keep it if he was going to just keep it underneath the house) in the crawlspace under the floor.  When he came up, his face was whiter than the text box I'm typing in now, and he kept muttering about seeing body parts under the house.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, this freaked us both out immensely, but me being the brave one (you can reverse the order if you really don't like me and say I came up babbling and my friend went down later), decided to give it a look.  Now...  before I get too into detail here...  when I was about ten years old, my stepfather worked as a mortician at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Burbank CA.  I have seen some of the most disturbing things of my entire life in the mortuary and crematorium of that cemetery.  I know what the smell of rotting human flesh smells like, and I know what happens to a body that has been sitting in the heat (what with the bloating and eventual cracking of the skin).  All of this prepared me for what I was about to see in the crawlspace.<br>
<br>
I wiggled between the boards that held the south wall to the foundation, and the first thing that I noticed when I slid fully into the crawlspace was the unmistakable smell of rotting meat.  Now, when you've been around it for as long as I have, you can tell the difference between cow, cat, and people, believe me.  This didn't really smell too much like any domestic animal, but I didn't think it really smelled human either, so I wasn't really that worried at the time.  I started making my way through the crawlspace, checking every little nook and cranny for anything I could connect the smell to.  There was nothing there.  I could smell it, and I did a little bit of digging around in the dirt covering the foundation itself, but never uncovered anything.  My friend was freaking out at the entrance to the crawlspace, so I finally turned around and went back, long after I had passed the spot where he made his hasty turn around only a few minutes before.  <br>
<br>
Two days later, my friend got a call from the following number (312-999-2581)...  he wasn't home when the call came in, but he did pick it up on his voicemail.  The whole message was seven minutes and six seconds long, mostly it was dead air, with some white noise in the background.  However, every few seconds (my friend estimated it at 15-20 seconds), the white noise was replaced with a deep rumbling, and a sound like a b&amp;d slave wimpering after a harsh beating.  My friend made a phone call to his real estate agent the next day and inquired as to the reason why the previous owners had moved out.  It turned out that the wife and daughter left town without any warning, and the husband (who was a minister recently moved from South Carolina) was put into one of the California State Mental Institutions after running into a local bar naked, screaming that &quot;Satan was walking the earth&quot; and &quot;God was dead&quot;...  it was also learned that the owners before that were members of a satan worshipping cult (very different from the Church of Satan, and most self-styled satansists).<br>
<br>
Now while I personally don't know what was going on in that house, or what drove the previous occupants from the home itself, I'm not entirely sure that the whole thing was anything more than a very elaborate prank.  However, it definitely caused my friend to have a huge religious re-invention, as he was a self-proclaimed satanist up until that point.  My friend is now a devout catholic, and is attending seminary in San Francisco.  He still lives in the same house, and since having two wiccan friends of his and a feng shui expert come into his home to do their thing, he has not had any problems with the smell, or with any sightings of human remains or anythign like that.  However, he does still receive phone calls from time to time the same seven minute, six second long message.<br>

Oh--and I don't agree LDS have the same take that Iamtummy was talking about since they don't see Satanism in any way similar to xians. You are still looking at it from an LDS perspective, which is fine if you don't mind everyone else studying your sect from their perspective and their sources instead of LDS.<br>

<br>
If its inspired by Satan... He is evil and the enemy of my God and therefore HE and his teachings are not welcome in my home.<br>
<br>
If they do not believe in a literal Satan, well then they chose the name out of Spite or &quot;in the face&quot; of Judeo Christian values, again, this does not draw my interestl.<br>
<br>
The name itself invokes negative conotation,which I am sure (now after reading the link) that was completely intended.<br>
<br>
And while I consider myself very open to understanding where others are coming from, this particular line of thinking is just well Offensive and I do not intend to waste any of my valuable time, researching something that either A is inspired of Evil or B chooses to emulate the personification of Evil as their ideal or delightful shock value to people whose values they ridicule. - Shirene<br>

My dear it is obvious to anyone reading your posts that you were done before you started. Your LDS info told you this belief system was evil so you want none of it. <br>
<br>
Now perhaps you can understand why some other xians who are told LDS is of Satan (according to THEIR sources and religion) want nothing to do with learning more about your beliefs. <br>
<br>
And with that, I hope we are done. Finally you understand what it is like to view a belief system as evil and not worthy of further study. How proud I am to not be hindered by such silly mythological prejudices and fears. I hope someday you can walk in the light of reason, unfettered by demonic terrors and paralyzing superstitions, but until you do, rest assured you will live your home life uninterrupted by any of my kind.<br>

Mostly because I haven't seen anyone say what I am thinking exactly (of course, I haven't read every post as closely as I could have if I hadn't been fighting a migraine all day).<br>
<br>
As one of Jehovah's Witnesses I fully beleive in Satan the spirit creature that is the enemy of God.  I do not think (from what I have read and that being very little) that the Church of Satan worships the individual.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BUT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> all that they teach and stand for represents Satan. I don't know if this was intentional or if they are just sick of the self-sacrificing additude of Christians (no all, generalized statement).  The fact that everything they teach is the pretty much the opposite of what the Bible teaches (especially the Greek scriptures) that is how it is Satanic (evil) in nature.  (Man, am I making any sense?)  It is along this same line that we don't celebrate certain holidays and birthdays.  We look at what the Bible says, who is it glorifying and what are the origins.  These things are important and they help to keep your worship to Jehovah pure.  <br>
<br>
I think that on another thread (or this one) someone mentioned that JWs view commonly celebrated holidays as worshipping Satan.  That is true.  If it isn't of Jehovah, it is of Satan.  All false gods were created (not actual creation) so that Satan could pull people away from Jehovah.  So all practices of those false religions are of Satan.  So that is where that reasoning comes from.  I probably should have started a new thread for this last statement.<br>

<br>
TF--This is EXACTLY how I understood the JW sect and reasons behind holidays, view of them and birthdays etc. as explained to me while studying with actual JWs and reading the Watchtower/Awake and your bible.<br>
<br>
My own MIL believes we are worshipping Satan even though we are atheists because of this (in &quot;this system&quot; and &quot;worldy&quot; so to speak), but also that Catholics, LDS and others are of Satan since they participate (knowingly I might add) in pagan rituals and celebrations and are a &quot;false religion&quot;. <br>
<br>
Shirene--I thought you of all people would understand what it's like to be tought evil through the eyes of another belief system. Perhaps you will now change your position on whether it is okay to judge another belief system without praying/studying directly with them and using their literature.<br>

An important distinction is that they are using him as a representation and not claiming he is walking around at cocktail parties with a red ink pen and a contract for you to sign.  What Satanism does as I have witnessed is place accountability on the individual for their actions.  You can indulge in that cake, but you’ll become fat and have no one to blame but yourself.  I can appreciate how many might see this as hedonism, and on the surface it could read that way, yet in actual practice it has not been my experience.  They don’t blow their savings recklessly, they don’t indulge without restriction.  They in fact do indulge, but quite responsibly.  A DUI would be about the worst thing a Satanist could end up with.<br>
<br>
“Satan, the person, is a coniving individual, whose whole goal is to lead people away from the gospel of Christ and his doctrines of loving your neighbor, self control over your passions and personal salvation. “<br>
–MormonGirl2<br>
<br>
Your dogma is showing.  Satanism does not claim the xian worldview.  Their sigil is that of Baphomet, a god that predates xiandom and they use that largely in response to the fallacious ‘morality’ that xians are prone to claiming.  LaVey (the founder) was a calliope player in a circus.  The same tents where the clowns danced on Friday and Saturday nights would host the church services on Sunday mornings.  He played organ music for them and watched all the same people who were drunkenly debauching themselves the previous 2 nights sit upright and pious in their pews and he reacted to that.   Rather than suppress and deny the human nature of our animal side, step forth and take responsibility for your actions and control it instead of repress.  Be in charge of your own life, destiny and works.<br>
<br>
“If its inspired by Satan... He is evil and the enemy of my God and therefore HE and his teachings are not welcome in my home.”<br>

Again, gut reaction to something you have not bothered to investigate.  This is prejudice (pre-judge) and as Stacey has pointed out exactly what you experience from many other xians.  Disappointing to see repeated rather than renounced.<br>

Very true.  Very true indeed.  God is not responsible for your weight problem, you are.  God is also not responsible for your Ph.D. in genetics, you are.  It doesn’t have to be fair that she got great legs and you got your father’ thighs.  You just have to accept your graces with your griefs and overcome everything.  The seven deadly sins are deadly on their own, but collectively they control each other.  You are slothful, then greed will push you to act, you are wrat6hful then sloth will hold you back, you are vain you will overcome gluttony, etc…  The core is meritocracy and personal accountability.  They actually like xianity because it reduces the competition for them.  Keeps the sheep from becoming other wolves.<br>
<br>
The ONLY kook factor I find is the magic system.  They believe in the psychological value of rituals.  They don’t expect you to be able to blind your boss by sticking a pin in a dolls eye, but they do expect you to feel better about the anger at your boss for sticking the doll.  They do love taboo, they love sex, naked human bodies, sensual pleasures, they love good food and the ones I know are some of the best dancers I have met (real ball room stuff!)<br>
<br>
The biggest thing I respect is that they don’t take kids.  Under 18 need not apply.  Too bad the other religions of the world weren’t that respectable.  (I also like that they want churches taxed.)  <p>DBC67<br>

I haven't said anything on this thread because I just haven't read enough nor have been able to pull my thoughts together (sick and sick baby).<br>
<br>
It really wasn't so much the kook factor that turned me off - I know it does help you let go of past greivences against you when you accept that you can hate someone and don't have to forgive what they did to you, giving a curse on it might even be better - but rather the whole need for a worship system. To me that undermines the whole person is accountable concept. You will end up with a peer pressure situation, if nothing else. And given some types of people who would be attacted to this belief system this could be a problem. <br>
<br>
And while I can understand why they choose the name Satan and stuff, because if you look at Satan from a different point of view, he is the first self-willed individual. It makes sense. However, I do think there was an in your face reason for using the name as well. And that sorta turns me off of this as well. <br>

The attraction of those opposed to the traditional dichotomy christianity creates as well as a litmus test to 'weed out' the luke warm converts.  They don't want a satanist who is squeamish over semantics and they are being extremely clear on their position.  Anti-xian.  Why dress up the name as the &quot;Reformed Church of Christyian Martyrs&quot; or some other concoction to gain credibility and converts when that isn't your mission? (This is not to say they are against xinaity, they really don't care what religion asnyone else is, they just are absolutely not xians themselves.)<br>
<br>
Your comment about worship though might need some clarification.  Because satanism is a celebration of the self, their highest holiday is your birthday.  This isn't an organized service in a temple or shrine, it is just making sure, one day a year at least, you focus the day on yourself.  In that I am an accidental satanist.  I never work on my birthday.  Always take that day off and just do 'me' stuff.  Go sailing, sleep in, eat all the food I love and my family may not find nutritively valuable, whatever tickles my fancy.<br>
<br>
Does Satanism teach adultery or lying is okay?  No.  But they don't teach it as wrong either, they only teach that if you commit it, be prepared to face the consequences of your actions.  The same goes for most moral questions.  They teach a following of the law, they are not anarchists.  They do get blamed by most other religions for evil in the world, yet I have yet to see one shred of evidence in support iof it. <p>DBC67<br>

<br>
My thanks in clarifying things for me on this subject. I have (to my knowledge) never met a satanist. And sometimes in just reading about a subject, even straight from the horse's mouth, you tend to misunderstand a lot of it because we can not help but to look at things from our own point of view, which is often the wrong point of view to look at it. While I do not have the preconceived notions that christians would have over this subject, I still came from that back ground, where some of the things I read in the faq (still haven't had time to read more then that) lead me to think collective gather or worship (service). Still it did talk of covens and gatherings which sounded organized to me. And that was off putting. <br>
<br>
I did gather that they teach accountablity in all matters. If you can face and accept the consequences of your actions, then fine do it. At least that is how I gathered it. I do feel this is the better way. You make something taboo, and it beckons you like a siren. And taking care of yourself first does make sense, because if you aren't taken care of, then how can you be in the position to take care of others. I know as a mother, I do tend to get resentful when I  give give give give to my family, with absolutely nothing taken for myself. I've learned that I have to be selfish at times to be a better mother and wife. <br>
<br>
It does seem that Satanism gives a person more encouragement to find their own balance in life then the more conventional religions. It also promots thinking for yourself. <br>
<br>
Funny, it seems a lot of what they teach (talk about? what would be the correct term as there is no moral code?) are things I am trying to teach my children in the long run. That before taking a certain action that you can live with the possible concequences of that action. <br>
<br>
I wish I could take my birthday off. But I still haven't convinced my husband that yes, I do work ever single day and all day at that. Maybe one day I will manage to get that across to him...probably the day the last child moves out for good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>

 <br>
<br>
Main Entry: Sa·tan <br>
Pronunciation: 'sA-t&amp;n<br>
Function: noun<br>
Etymology: Middle English, from Old English, from Late Latin, from Greek, from Hebrew sAtAn adversary<br>
Date: before 12th century<br>
: the adversary of God and lord of evil in Judaism and Christianity <br>
<br>
Apparently, Webster agrees with me.  The name says it all!<br>
<br>
Do any of you honestly believe that this is a good or wholesome philosophy or doctrine?<br>
<br>
Do any of you really think that the name was not created to signify that they oppose basic Judeo Christian values and or doctrine? Was anyones mind changed about the Church of Satan after reading the website information?<br>
<br>
No?, well then common sense should apply that the name itself leads one to a very good assumption on the nature of the belief.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the name of the LDS Church or Church of Jesus Christ should be a strong indicator that it is a Christian faith, and yet people say it is inspired of Satan.  Not so obvious a leap of logic.  If that isnt clear as common sense, then I am wasting my breath.<br>

But then common sense isnt that common anymore.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dynamohumm6>dynamohumm6</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.pro-rock.com/ikonboard/avatars/clutch-elephant1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Rocket Queen</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/18/03 8:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.clipartconnection.com/img/6/WB/zed_non_com/clipconxn/animations/science/0563.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Webster agrees with me!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Do any of you honestly believe that this is a good or wholesome philosophy or doctrine?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Do I believe that taking complete and utter responsibility for your actions is a good or wholesome philosophy?? Hell yes, absolutely.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Do any of you really think that the name was not created to signify that they oppose basic Judeo Christian values and or doctrine? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Um, that's the point. They &quot;oppose&quot; basic Judeo-Christian doctrine because they see it as loaded with hypocrisy. Cheat on your wife? Sinner! It's ok, though, because we're all sinners. Satan got his grip on you. Repent, talk to Jesus, and all is forgiven. Rinse &amp; repeat. So yeah, they're opposing a doctrine that essentially allows you to do whatever the hell you want without really taking responsibility for yourself or your actions. <br>
<br>
Gee, which sounds like the more upstanding doctrine to me....<br>
it's kind of a no brainer, you know?<br>
