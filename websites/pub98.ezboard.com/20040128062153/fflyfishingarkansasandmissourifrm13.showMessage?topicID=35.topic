Had a great time casting at the conclave with everyone, Chuck E., Bill Gammel, John and others.  Got to cast the other day and was doing some distance casts.  I was using the Loomis Max Line Speed 5wt which casts a LOOOOONG way.  I got my front loop tracking correctly, which I am happy with, but I think I need to refign my back cast a bit.  When carrying line my front cast I get a very nice unrolling U loop which carries energy very effectively.  I feel like I am using 75-80% of my front cast due to my backcast.  My back cast is in plane and tracks quite well.  I found a place to cast about a week ago that has a point to aim my front and back casts in order to track properly.  My backcast dosen't seem to be transfering the energy as well as the front cast.  My back cast is the typical burry the rod butt in your arm, which produces a very tight V loop in the back.  When I make my front cast, I feel like it is not unrolling as it should in the back.  I come forward about 2-3 feet on my front cast before I get the entire feel of the line.  I think the line is dying as a result of hitting a taper with a tight loop.  I have a sneeky suspicion that the energy in a tight loop disapates as soon as it hits a large taper.  What are the boards thoughts on this?  I have tried increasing my loop size on the back cast, which is difficult for me with this stroke, and gained some of my front stroke.  I have also tried a backcast higher from the ground using a high stop, but it seems to just &quot;hang around&quot; instead of unrolling properly.  One problem I see in my normal distance backcast is the V loop is flat on the bottom, causing the energy to drive down instead of back.  This is where the problem of the taper dying occurs.  Raising the V loop seems to reduce the energy in my backcast, causing the &quot;hanging around&quot; sensation I mentioned before.  I am carrying between 80-90' depending on the line, but feel the backcast is taking somewhere between 5-8', maybe more, off the amount of line I can carry.  The front cast has a very noticable &quot;jolt&quot; when the line unrolls, where as the backcast dies.  When I slow down and carry 75' of line, I don't seem to throw the loops as tight, and the line errors disappear.  Not sure if the problem is timing, loops or what, just that it it should be possible to do better.<br>

 Not everyone would worry about casting another 6-8 ft if they could hold 80 ft of line in the air. I understand that you can cast and are looking for tweeking.<br>
 I have never got to see you cast so I am shooting in the dark so to say.<br>
  But with the 2-3 ft of travel before you feel the line I think you are 'Creeping&quot;. That is the hardest to see with a good caster so with your casting, it would be almost impossitable.<br>
 So by not seeing you lay out the line I might have an advanatge.<br>
 IF you can add a STAB into the backcast you might find the tweek you are needing. <br>
They other is the grip you are using. Here again I can not see your hand. Are you useing a &quot;West Coast' Style &quot;V&quot; grip? This gives you another 6 inches of reach back.<br>
  But who am I to say, I can not make the line stay aloft for 90 ft. <br>

Just as a note even Noel Perkins and Bruce Richards commented that the backcast was about 5% different from the forward cast. That day that we were out with Chuck you were Carrying around 95 feet with a pick up-lay-down. Can you recall what you wer doing with your backward cast? It seems like it was around 85 -90 feet. It was a while ago so forgive me if the numbers are off a little.<br>

John, I do remember what I was doing, but I don't think that I could work on figuring out which of two styles works best by myself(kinda hard to see the angles).  I was making a pretty standard back cast, with some drift.  The problem with this cast is that it limits my stroke length when I really want to get on a cast.  The back cast I get the most out of is a combination of a Lefty back cast and a stab cast I guess.  It is what I was doing the other night when Chuck E. and Bill Gammel were watching.  Boy talk about pressure<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    When I make this &quot;buried butt&quot; back cast, I need to have more than 75-80' of line out or else a standard back cast feels better.  Unfortunately, true stab casts cost me around $20-30 a &quot;pop&quot;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Al, I will have to look into the creep, although I have a funny feeling that is not the cause, but who knows.  The grip issue is an interesting idea.  Being 6'4&quot; I have always had the drift I wanted, and valued the thumb on top grip for tracking.  Will play around with the ideas and let you fellahs know!

I would like to ask a few questions for clarification.<br>
<br>
Are you shooting line on the last backcast?<br>
<br>
Is what you have described applicable only to the last backcast, if not when do you first notice what you have described?<br>

<br>
Although, I believe that a fair portion of your back cast loss of power is the same reason that Nolan Ryan doesn't throw a basball backwards have you considered the &quot;power snap&quot; that Bill was talking about. Are you directing some portion of the loops energy &quot;down&quot; in your back cast in lieu of at your target. You are &quot;much&quot; more likely to do this in the back cast than you are in the forward cast since the wrist can bend so much easier in the back than it can in the front.<br>

I have been casting with out shooting line on my back cast, and have found that I get a more consistant cast.  I figured out the problem the other day, and have fixed it.  I was seriously dropping my backcast at the last moment while rocking a bit.  This caused the downward v loop that for some reason could not add the rocking motion and the dropping backcast together to form a deceint cast.  Also the problem was a combination of swinging for the fences on my back cast. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Oh well.
