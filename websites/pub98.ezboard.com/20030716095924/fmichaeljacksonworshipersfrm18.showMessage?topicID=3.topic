Chapter 2<br>
Learning to Deal<br>
<br>
I sat in my room in the corner near my t.v. I was inconsolable. Oh Mommy, I love you. I heard knocking on the door.<br>
“Go away!” I shouted, “Leave me alone.”<br>
“Sweetie pie. Open up.” Nancy said to me. “Please honey. You haven’t eaten in a while.”<br>
I opened the door and she brought in a tray of food.<br>
“I thought you would be hungry.” She said placing the tray down.<br>
“Aunt Nancy,” I sighed, “I miss Mommy so much.”<br>
“I know, honey, I know.” She said, “You just have to learn to deal.”<br>
“How? She died when I was 8. Daniel was just born.” I said, “I just can’t deal.”<br>
Nancy gave me a piece of sandwich and some apple juice. Daniel and Daddy were outside waiting to come in.<br>
“Your father is very upset with you,” she said, “And I am too. You don’t treat your brother that way.”<br>
“I know.” I said, “he hates me.”<br>
“No, he doesn’t. He wants to understand why you aren’t excepting Danny.” She said looking at a picture of Mom on my nightstand.<br>
“Mom died because she gave him life.” I said throwing the picture on the floor shattering the glass.<br>
“I understand that.” Nancy said picking it up and placing it where it was.<br>
“I guess I can apologize.” I said drinking some more juice.<br>
Daddy and Daniel came in. Dad sat in my left side and Danny sat on the floor as far away from me as possible.<br>
“I’m sorry Daddy. It’s just can’t get over it.” I said leaning against him.<br>
“It’s okay baby girl.” He said, “I miss her. It’s been five years and two months.”<br>
Danny was over in a corner looking at his fingers.<br>
“Come here, squirt.” I said getting on the floor. HE just sat there not moving.<br>
“Please?” I asked with sincerity in my face.<br>
He looked at Dad and then at me. He slowly inched his way over to me.<br>
He was a few inches away from me before and grabbed and hugged him.<br>
“Why don’t you like me?” he asked me with tears in his brown eyes.<br>
“What makes you think I don’t like you?” I asked reaching for a tissue.<br>
“You kicked me out your room. You don’t play with me or anything.” He said letting little tears fall down his cheeks, “You keep saying I killed Mommy.”<br>
“You didn’t, I just remember,” I started, “At the hospital after she delivered you.”<br>
“I love you Rachel.” Danny said clinging to me sniffling through his little nose.<br>
“I love you too Danny.” I said running my fingers though his curly light brown hair.<br>
So what? I got mushy. I love the little guy. True he is a pest but that’s my little brother. I was slowly dealing with Mom’s death. God I miss her. She baked cookies for me when I was home schooled. Everything was reminding me of her. Dad pulled a surprise trip to the cemetery.<br>
“Dad, what are we doing here?” I asked walking past tombstones.<br>
“We are going to see Mom.” He said, “It will do you some good to see her.”<br>
“I don’t want to see her.” I didn’t with all honesty.<br>
“I know, but you never saw her.” He said looking down at me.<br>
“Okay fine.” I walked past a few more until I saw hers.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nila Jackson devoted wife and mother.” <br>
It was next to Grandmother  Harrison and Big Papa. My Grandparents on my Mother’s side.<br>
Daniel put a flower on it and saw me crying.<br>
“Sissy, don’t cry.” Danny said hugging me.<br>
“I can’t help it.” I said, “I miss her.”<br>
“Nila we are sorry we didn’t come to see you in a while. WE have just been out of it.” Dad said placing roses on her tombstone.<br>
I sat there looking at it for about five minutes before I got up and ran back to the car. Dad and Danny were running after me. I got in the car and cried…I just can’t deal with it. Mommy!!!! I love you! Dad got in, sat next to me, and put his arm around me. He rocked me to sleep.<br>
When we got back home, I took a shower and went to sleep. I was drained. The phone rang, I picked it up. I have a phone in my room, but it’s all connected to the same line.<br>
“Hello, Michael?” she asked.<br>
“This is he. Who is calling?”<br>
“It’s me, Victoria.” She said sounding cheerful.<br>
“Hey Vicky, what’s new?” she asked, “When can I see you?”<br>
“Not yet, Rachel doesn’t know about you yet.” He said<br>
My Dad? Dating again? <br>
“Well when are you going to tell her?” she asked.<br>
“I don’t know. How about a plan a dinner for next Thursday?” he asked, “I’ll cook, you come and you can meet my kids.”<br>
“That sounds great.” She said, “I can’t wait to see you. I love you.”<br>
“Talk to you later, bye.”<br>
Why didn’t Dad say “I love you” back to her? <br>
