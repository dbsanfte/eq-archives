You know the teaser was fine.<br>
<br>
And then act one started.  And Dylan, in the midst of being made to watch one of the most grievous moments of his life (his departure from Sara), comes out with &quot;This is weird.&quot;   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
And that's how it went.  One liners abound from Dylan.  Holes appear in the ship and now the super bat weapon...erm...force lance can close them.<br>
<br>
The premise?  Suddenly the derivas are tapping power sources from random ships?  Why not just target, oh I don't know, the FLEET-or its strongest ship.  It's not like they need an excuse, having been twice foiled by the Andromeda.  That drivel about sudden magog and Nietzschean attacks?  Well, that's what it was. Drivel.  Turns out they need a power focuser for a generator on some planet that is going to open a tunnel for another invasion....I guess.  Still not sure what happened there.  And I don't like this &quot;bubbles&quot; of time in the universe stuff.  What IS that?  And what test?  What was up with the final scene with the knife.<br>
<br>
Aaaaaaack.<br>
<br>
What is this, Twin Peaks?<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I forgot ....it IS.  *sigh*<br>
<br>
<br>
The dialogue was aces and spaces and a few <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> : moments.<br>
<br>
Tyr: I don't know which is worse, being kidnapped by those creatures or asking you for help.<br>
<br>
Dylan:  You're joking.<br>
<br>
Tyr: Am I.<br>
<br>
Dylan:  I didn't help you Tyr, I saved your ass.<br>
<br>
*You know what Dylan:  SCREW YOU.*  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Dylan:  Hey Tyr, why don't you go first, age before beauty.<br>
<br>
Tyr:  Thank you so much.<br>
<br>
What the hell kind of dialogue is THAT!!!!<br>
<br>
And sorry Kevin but Keith's got you on both scores so there.<br>
<br>
OTOH, Tyr's interraction with Harper over whether to go for Rommie was amusing.  Clearly Keith was into it when he said &quot;I would like to kill them all.&quot;  :devil: <br>
<br>
And Tyr's &quot;DH&quot; like dogging of Dylan in the cave.  That was freaking priceless.  How much you wanna bet it was an ad lib.<br>
<br>
And Tyr teasing him about being out of shape made me grin.<br>
<br>
Beka's &quot;Oh this sucks...literally...&quot; worked.<br>
<br>
In fact, as usual this season, Beka was the bright light.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Nice try creeps&quot;  when the Derivas tried to gaslight her with the image of her kissing Tyr was um.....well I loved it.<br>
<br>
Other Tyr/Dylan stuff:<br>
<br>
Dylan:  It's a bridge.<br>
<br>
Tyr:  It's a bridge.<br>
<br>
Dylan:  It's a long way down.<br>
<br>
Tyr:  It *is* a long way down.<br>
<br>
Dylan:  Looks like we have to cross the bridge.<br>
<br>
Tyr:  It would seem so.  *Pause*  Well, after you captain.<br>
<br>
Dylan:  Now I'm the captain.<br>
<br>
Okay so at least it wasn't more Tyr put downs but um...people.  I feel like I'm reading Dick and Jane.  See Dylan Run.  See Tyr run.  Watch them run together.  It's almost funny.  It WOULD be funny, if I hadn't been spoiled by REAL dialogue like DMinus Zero...just for example.  Or ADDB.<br>
<br>
Or IP for chrissakes.<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> : <br>
<br>
YAY for Tyr's &quot;Who saved whose ass!&quot; <br>
<br>
And another yay for the Beka/Tyr dialogue about children's tales.<br>
<br>
But the Yay moments were few and far between the ones that made me groan (&quot;egg cooker&quot;   &quot;what can you build me with this&quot;???----WHAT!!!!) and the fact that I was BORED so much of the time  (which I suppose is a vast improvement over how certain other eps this season have made me feel).<br>
<br>
Anyways the story and script is just....I don't even know what to make of it as a whole.  And we won't talk about the technobabble that passes for science unless Ash and Zack are involved.  It's so far removed from stuff like TUM that its' not even the same show.  Same for the faceless and completely ineffectual Ogam....I mean Kalder.....I mean Derivas.  <br>
<br>
  Castwise, I think Keith and Lisa try.  I'm not quite sure about Rommie.  Lexa seemed...bored. Trance was sorta not in it much but at least she didn't do anything insulting.  Same with Harper.  The kitten was cute. Kevin frustrated the hell out of me, as usual.  If the man would simply ACT instead of acting like a smartass he'd be ever so much more effective.<br>
<br>
So how do I rate it?<br>
<br>
Um...well as it's not the Andromeda I signed on for I guess I WON'T rate it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadowkat83@slipstreambbs12353>shadowkat83</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#0000FF, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='user title'>Harper's chainmail addiction</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/2/03 2:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Delenda:  An almost funny MESS.  Spoilers</span><hr size=1> I agree with all of that. The episode didn't even light a candle to TUM. The plot was good...just the execution was bad and they left us asking to many questions. I was confused about the whole &quot;jaws of life thing&quot; and how it was used and it bothered me a little that harper just ran and assembled it again like it was a kids puzzle. I didn't quite find the episode boring though...in fact most of the time I was laughing. I enjoyed the tit-for-tat dialouge Tyr and Dylan had. I will admit that this episode was alot better then most this season but was still lacking some chemistry between the characters and harpers lines have been way better. Tyr seemed like a totally different person....*sigh* what happened to first season Try? some say he grew...I'm not sure if I believe that and for a minute there i thought that maybe Tyr was still being effected by the derivas.  <br>
<br>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Tyr: Where is he<br>

Harper: I'm sorry captain Hunt has stepped away from his desk.

I feel like sending him a condolence card for the long, painful death of his character.<br>
<br>
Bits I liked:<br>
<br>
Dylan being given a hard time about being out of shape.<br>
<br>
The kitten!<br>
<br>
Lexa makes wire work look <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>good</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
The expression on Beka's face when the image of her and Tyr kissing came on screen.<br>
<br>
Harper hugging Rommie. Awwwwwwwwww.<br>
<br>
The way that black leather flight suit fit Tyr. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The little scene where Tyr faked out Dylan, then laughed. Hehehe. Nice glimpse of the real Tyr, for just a nanosecond there.<br>
<br>
What I hated:<br>
<br>
Tunnelers again, suddenly, no build-up, no drama, no suspense.<br>
<br>
Could these aliens have been any more stupid? Talk about cannon fodder. Especially when they'd been such a big bad threat in previous episodes. Good grief. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The banter felt like it was taken out of a &quot;Comic Quips For Dummies&quot; book.<br>
<br>
The timer at the end. It jumped from 40 seconds to 10 in the space of about 5. LOL.<br>
<br>
When Tyr came running onto the bridge in that first group scene, is it just me, or was he running like a girl? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Dylan's shallow reaction to the farewell scene with Sara being played over and over again.<br>
<br>
Trance babbling senseless conjectures about the tunnelers. What the F? She's much better when she's mysteriously silent. Which reminds me...<br>
<br>
The scene where Trance and Harper backed into each other in the hall. Are we stealing from Scooby Doo now?<br>
<br>
What the hell was that ending scene? Wait - I think I've got it - The tunnelers are the descendents of the Knights of the Round Table, and Dylan has the strength of ten because his heart is pure, so they gave him Excalibur's little brother, Eggstimier.<br>
<br>
I rate this one a 3.<br>

Spoilers</span><hr size=1> Ok, you guys made me feel better.  I missed the first 15 minutes. (Thanks mom. grrrr) and the whole episode made absolutly no sence to me.  I thought it was from missing the start, but apperantly, it just sucked.<br>
<br>
If they threw in any more one linners I was gonna scream.  I was actully saying the lines before the characters said it.  Talk about pretictable.  <br>
<br>
The only characters that can get away with saying that many one-liners is Harper and sometimes Beka.  Tyr, maybe once in a blue moon.  Dylan-never.  He has to be the straight man, hell someone has to be.  And the new gold Trance-rarely.  And Romie sometimes.<br>
<br>
There was one line Rommie said after her &quot;I&quot;m just hanging around&quot; line.  Had something to do with trying to break the tension.  Well, sorry to say, with everyone breaking the tension with all the quips, there was no more tension to be broken.  One liners should only be used rarely and should just bearly break the tension.  This was just overkill.<br>
<br>
It's such a shame to see such good characters and settings going to waste.  I want my RHWolfey!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anastashia>Anastashia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Human</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/2/03 6:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Delenda: An almost funny MESS. Spoilers</span><hr size=1> This was supposed to be a comedy right? Tell me this was supposed to be a comedy. I did enjoy some of the oneliners in the first half and I loved Keith's delivery. Lisa's unfortunately fell to the level of the lines. <br>
<br>
There was IMHO a better plot overall than the one in Wheel. It's just that the lines supporting the plot didn't make a coherent whole. They were a series of unrelated one liners. <br>
<br>
The only part of the plot that confuzzed me was the use of the jaws, but that had the same effect as in wheel. <br>
<br>
**<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>MusicMan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> RE the talking about children, I think it was in response to Tyr's &quot;I saw my child&quot; line more than anything else. Remember that Beka is not aware that Tyr has a child.<br>
<br>
What in ths divine's name was Trance talking about? <br>
<br>
They blew the dagger presentation with the music. That IMHO had the barest of opportunities to become a mythical moment.<br>

Sheesh shadowkat, we must have been in each other's heads as we were writing these. <p>____________________<br>
&quot;I wouldn't crack open any epic novels.&quot; - Tyr<br>
In the current Andromeda environment I think Tyr is right.<br>
Social Climbers - They will quite cunningly take whatever Alpha prerogatives you stupidly give them.<br>
I think I'm right too!<br>

<br>
There's an interesting discussion in the science/tech part of ex isle (started by yours truly) to discuss the use of time travel/alternate worlds in the drom universe.<br>
<br>
I agree that TUM cannot really be reconciled with ADDB. But Drom changed the rules in Ouroboros and TUM *is* imho consistent with at least that.<br>
<br>
And HF, unlike the Twin Peaks crew?  At least Ash and Zack try and at least their dialogue is like real DIALOGUE and not empty one liners.<br>

Spoilers</span><hr size=1> I don't think either of them saw the thread (they've been flat out on the new show).  Frankly, were I them, I would find it difficult to talk about too much.  I think they maybe more in mourning about the show than any of us because they really *did* give it their best and it wasn't enough to save the show (though it at least saved their eps this season).  So I wouldn't say a lack of explanation has any bearing on whether they're decent.<br>

I'd assumed that Ash and Zack would be all over the thread.<br>

I thought the choice would be a bullshit story or an actual plausible explaination.<br>

I challenged Ash on this on the old SS and he said it didn't conflict...<br>
