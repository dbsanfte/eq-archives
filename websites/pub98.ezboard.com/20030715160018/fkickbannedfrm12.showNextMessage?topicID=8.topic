By Archangel<br>
<br>
There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this subject as of late, regarding hacking<br>
challenges, personalities, even whether I am the &quot;real&quot; Archangel. I assure you, dear reader,<br>
that I am, and I do not intend to address any other subject in this text, other than my experiences with the Tell-Me system.<br>
<br>
What is the Tell-Me system?<br>
TellMe is a high-tech voice activated phone site with internet connectivity, and even a voice activated browser. It is the ultimate goal of TellMe to have the whole of the internet voice <br>
activated. The system is quite sophisticated by today's standards, though I'm sure that<br>
tomorrow's readers will find the efforts to be quite primative to say the least. A free phone<br>
call gives the listener access to news, sports, weather, etc. Even movie listings. Other areas<br>
provide for private announcements, or even voice activated web-sites. In other words, it is now<br>
possible, through TellMe, to dial a phone number, and listen to a website. A quick look at the website will show that  the TellMe system is available in North America, Europe, <br>
(AND AUSTRALIA!!!)  heheheheh! <br>
<br>
Any *ENGLISH* speaking country.<br>
Tell me is a subsidiary of CNET, a giant (at the time of this writing) on the internet.<br>
<br>
Why did I decide to hack Tell-Me?<br>
I first became interested in TellMe about a year ago, because at that time TellMe offered free<br>
long distance phone calls to anywhere in the world. TellMe had a lot of services which any hacker<br>
worth his salt would fall over himself, just to drool at, such as anonymous internet. As I began<br>
learning my way around the system, I wanted to know more. As I began to explore, I noticed<br>
various security holes, did not exploit them, but DID take note of them. Eventually, after about<br>
a year, I had a decent list of possible security holes, and decided one day to see If there were any unforseen roadblocks to checking out and examining one small part of the system.<br>
<br>
How was the first hack of TellMe performed?<br>
It was very easy. It was so safe that I did it from my house. I opened an account and had<br>
The Baron Harkonnen type in a password to see if I could hack in. Nobody would bust me for<br>
hacking into my own account, and if there was trouble, I could say that I forgot my password.<br>
<br>
What security flaws were exploited?<br>
Well, I guess it's nut-cutting time. TellMe has a VERY SERIOUS security flaw which can allow<br>
unauthorized access to the system within a matter of hours. As I tried to hack into my own account, I realized that TellMe announcements only have a 4 digit numeric password.<br>
<br>
In other words:<br>
You are using your telephone keypad.<br>
<br>
Here's what you do:<br>
You dial 1-800-555-tell (or similar free number available in *ANY* english speaking country)<br>
You will get an automated banner-ad followed by a menu discribing various TellMe features.<br>
You must say the word &quot;Announcements&quot;, or dial &quot;198&quot; on the keypad.<br>
This will take you to the announcements area.<br>
Once in the announcements area, you will need to punch in the announcement number,<br>
which is a seven digit number assigned to you by the TellMe computer. You can type in any<br>
announcement number you wish. I typed in my own, as this was an experiment to see if I could<br>
hack in and change the announcement.<br>
<br>
The computer says &quot;Ok, here is your announcement.&quot;<br>
Then I heard a recording of The Baron Telling what a whimp I am.<br>
This was followed by the computer saying:<br>
Please type in another announcement number, or say &quot;Main Menu&quot; to continue. If you are the <br>
announcement manager, please use you telephone keypad to enter your password to edit the <br>
announcement. If you remain silent, the computer will say: &quot;Please enter your 4 digit password.&quot;<br>
<br>
FOUR DIGITS?????<br>
Were they serious?<br>
<br>
Now here's the kicker:<br>
TELLME WON'T DISCONNECT YOU IF YOU FAIL 3 TIMES IN A ROW!!!<br>
Yes, ladies and gentlement, keep trying to your heart's content. No penalties.<br>
<br>
Obviously a Brute Force hack was in order. Keep in mind that this is not telnet situation. This<br>
deal is LIVE over the telephone, and you are punching in numbers on your telephone keypad.<br>
I handled it by dusting off a *VERY* old wardialer. The newer ones try to do your thinking for<br>
you. They won't dial unless they hear dialtones, or insist on seven/eleven digit numbers, etc.<br>
The first few dialers I tried couldn't do the job, but I found a really old one that would dial<br>
sequenced numbers of any length, separated by a pause of any length I chose. I set the dialer to<br>
attempt *EVERY* four digit number, with a half-second pause between attempts.<br>
<br>
I sat on an extention line, due to the limitations of the dialer, and listened to it punching<br>
in access codes. When it succeeded, I could pause the wardialer program. <br>
I would be able to look at the screen, and see what the last<br>
couple of attempted numbers were, manually dial them in, and gain access.<br>
<br>
The Baron had mercifully chosen a low number, and I was in, changing the message in about ten<br>
minutes. I then tried two other *SAFE* messages, that I would not get in trouble for, if changed.<br>
I gained access, respectively, in 45 and 90 minutes (More or less). My math told me that the <br>
maximum time to Brute Force a TellMe announcement was about three hours.<br>
<br>
Is that it?<br>
No, while having the ability to change any announcement may be a lot of fun,<br>
there is a far more intersting hack that you can do on TellMe.<br>
Remember how when you first sign on, you have to say &quot;announcements&quot;? Try saying the word<br>
&quot;Extensions&quot;. You may be quite surprised at what you find.<br>
<br>
What are Tell-Me extensions?<br>
Tell-Me extensions are that part of the Tellme network, which they have offered to the world<br>
to produce the voice activated web pages. Here is what you do.<br>
Say &quot;Extensions&quot;<br>
You will be taken to the extensions area, and asked to punch in an extension number.<br>
This is a five digit number.<br>
It was time again for my ancient wardialer to do it's stuff. <br>
(Once again, no penalty for incorrect guesses!)<br>
I let it dial away, here is what I have found, SO FAR:<br>
<br>
What did you find?<br>
First off, it is important at this point to mention that the TellMe experiment does not seem to<br>
be working. Gone are the free long distance phone calls (you had to say &quot;phone booth&quot;), the<br>
entire shopping area, and most of the extensions created by individual developers.<br>
TellMe is a dying concern as far as I can tell, perhaps they were ahead of their time.<br>
Most of the extensions are empty. The only extensions still operating, are some Die-hard<br>
developers, and (This is important later) TellMe's *own* extensions.<br>
<br>
Apparently, the idea was to use the extension number as a kind of password, as there is no<br>
directory, and one must already know the extension number in order to gain access.<br>
<br>
UNLESS YOU HAVE AN OLD WARDIALER...<br>
<br>
I checked into The San Remo hotel here in Las Vegas, under my girlfriend's name, and spent<br>
the night hacking. Here's what I have come up with so far:<br>
<br>
Extension 76255:<br>
This leads to a very bizarre game of Rock/Paper/Scissors. It is one of the wierdest things that<br>
I have ever come across in all my days. I HIGHLY suggest you try it. It is like some whiney<br>
hillbilly guy...well see fer yerself!<br>
<br>
The combination 11111 produces this:<br>
A gypsy with an eight ball. You ask it questions, and it gives you answers. There are no<br>
disclaimers, so I guess this is the real deal! Saying &quot;quit&quot; or &quot;Stop&quot; won't help you.<br>
Just shut the hell up, and it will kick you back into regular Tell-Me.<br>
<br>
Extension 33333 produces the words &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;<br>
<br>
-<br>
Is that it?<br>
No.<br>
This is the serious stuff.<br>
<br>
Extension 34118 produces a directory of TellMe's offices, with the regular phone numbers.<br>
<br>
Most of the worthy extensions consisted of foul language, so anyone under 18 should stop<br>
reading now...<br>
<br>
Use the letters on your telephone keypad, and you will get some very intersting results.<br>
These are five letter words corresponding to the numbers on your phone.<br>
<br>
CUNTS - Produces a string of numbers of unknown meaning. Just a long string of a computer voice<br>
saying &quot;one, five, seven, three, twelve, eighty-eight&quot; etc. <br>
I'll figure out what that means later.<br>
<br>
TITTY - This produces a fax tone, as opposed to a computer tone. I didn't mess with it.<br>
<br>
PENIS - This produces a verbal message about the sendmail system.<br>
<br>
HOLES - This is the Quote of the Day.<br>
<br>
BOOBS - This has to do with HTTPprotocols.<br>
<br>
SHIT0 - This is a directory of phone lines in the TellMe system.<br>
<br>
FUCK0 - This is a very interesting directory of phone lines in the TellMe system. Two of the lines appear to be trusted lines, providing a computer tone which I used to log on. There was<br>
a first time user option, which gave me a manager's account. (Do they have hundreds of managers?)<br>
What can it do? I was able to delete my own account and bring it back. I didn't fuck with<br>
anyone elses account. My goal is not to destroy, but to learn.<br>
<br>
PISS0 - As above, the TellMe system addresses me with a choice of talking to a live person, or <br>
an automated directory of phone lines. I'm amazed this is all behind a five digit password.<br>
<br>
Damn0 - Yet another directory of trusted phone lines. This one, however askes you for another<br>
password right up front, so I'm assuming this is a more security sensative area!<br>
<br>
Pussy - A discription of how to configure a TellMe webpage.<br>
<br>
Cum69 - Advice on proper password generation. (hahahahahahahahahaha!!!!)<br>
<br>
EATME - Computer tone leading to nowhere.<br>
<br>
I have not finished checking out TellMe. I got myself all involved in the politics of alt.2600,<br>
and unfortunately have not yet completed my work. I never gained root access. There is much,<br>
much, more exploring to do on Tell-Me, so you can expect a followup on this text later.<br>
<br>
It is the old-school hacker way to send the sysop a little note outlining any security holes<br>
found. Not to break old hacker tradition, I will send TellMe a copy of this text-file,<br>
immediately after I have posted it here.<br>
<br>
The TellMe security protocols are pathetic.<br>
