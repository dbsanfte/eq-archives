A bright light appeared in the dark caverns.... the enchanting beam quickly disappeared as soon as it had appeared leaving Nina, Kirin, Eris, Willow, Seifer, Balder, and Thalia on the ground blown away from what had just happened.<br>
<br>
Kirin looked around...<br>
<br>
&quot;wh... where are we?&quot; She quitely asked... finally getting the nerve to speak. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

HERE!)</span><hr size=1> Eris and Seifer had felt a rushing sensation, and the sudden feeling that the ground beneath them had given way and they had fallen...they'd grabbed each other and screamed, thinking it their last moment on Mahtim before they were sent to the 'higher plane of existence' some people liked to call heaven.<br>
<br>
Then they tumbled to a hard, cold floor.<br>
<br>
Even when the ride was over, and Eris was looking around at the surroundings, Seifer was still screaming.  She sighed and whacked him upside the head.  &quot;Shut up.  You're making an ass of yourself.  And get off of me.  I like ya, but strictly on a friendly basis, you know what I'm saying?&quot; <br>
<br>
Seifer silenced and looked down.  He was laying on top of Eris' crumpled body, clutching onto her for dear life.  Blushing furiously he jumped off, clearing his throat loudly as they both brushed themselves off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wh...where are we?&quot; Kirin had said.<br>
<br>
Eris smoothed back her hair and brushed the dust off her sleeves, feeling herslef about to check that everything was intact.  She looked around and smiled.  &quot;A mine,&quot; she stated.  &quot;A pretty big one, by the looks of it.&quot; She heard a loud, shrill inhuman scream erupt from the mine's bowels.  &quot;And a very interesting mine, too,&quot; she grinned.  She pulled out a scroll and opened it up, then nodded in approval.  &quot;Alrighty.  Mesa litoro, henia kiedoso!&quot;  The paper glowed, as if waiting for something.  She looked at Seifer and everyone. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A ham sandwich,&quot; Seifer groaned.  &quot;With cheese, and on rye bread...haven't eaten in two days...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not food, you idiot! Something we can use to light this place up!&quot; she snapped.  Then, she shuddered.  &quot;Ham sandwich with rye bread...you're gross.&quot;  She went back to the matter at hand.  &quot;Okay, okay.  We'll summon some torches.  Estu kaza, belike!&quot; <br>
<br>
Suddenly Kirin, Seifer, Eris, Nina, Willow, Balder and Thalia's arms were weighed down a bit by a sudden weight...they each held a torch, lit and casting a glow on the cavern walls.<br>

<br>
&quot;I just know I twisted something.&quot; She dusted off her dress with her free hand,  before looking at the new people that due to her flaw of being easily distracted by light and shiney things, and especially shiney light (that and her author's idiocy) she hadn't introduced herself to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um.. Quite.. unusual circumstances and most likely entirely unappropriate, but.. I'm Willow!  And ham on rye doesn't sound half bad... &quot;  Her stomach growled.<br>

<br>
&quot;Good Firadra no!&quot; Eris hacked.  &quot;Eww...that's just...that's just WRONG! Pickles?!&quot;  She looked unable to contain herself.  Then, she quickly regained her composure and cleared her throat.  &quot;Okay...&quot; she whipped out another scroll, placing the other one back in her pack.  She opened it up, and it was blank.  &quot;Sutsei.&quot;<br>
<br>
The piece of parchment suddenly looked as if someone had spilled ink on it. But the ink ran with a mind of its own across the page, in intricate lines and symbols.  Then, it dried and looked like a map, because it was.<br>
<br>
&quot;There we are,&quot; she said proudly.  &quot;A map.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Sutsei scroll? I thought we used that one in Tuthros,&quot; Seifer mused.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no.  We used the Loktor scroll in Tuthros.  Remember the goblin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh.  Oh yeah. I remember now.&quot; he shuddered.  &quot;Goblins are nasty.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eris looked at him, raising an eyebrow.  &quot;O...kay. Anyway!&quot; She smiled and examined the map in the torchlight.  &quot;Um..we should go this way, I think,&quot; she decided, pointing down a particularly dark and ominous looking path. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gelasiawinner>GelasiaWinner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/5/03 4:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm149.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Why is it always..</span><hr size=1> Willow sighed.<br>

&quot;Why is it always the long dark omnious looking hallways that are the right ones to go down?

At the end of this sentence the group heard a load roar from the hallway Willow was pointing to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/5/03 7:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm149.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Appearance in the mines (Kyonae and Zylle!

Kirin's eyes widened.<br>
<br>
&quot;What have i gotten myself into?&quot; She wondered aloud as she stared where the freakish noise was coming from.<br>

She walked up to Seifer and tapped his shoulder.<br>

A bubbling chuckle erupted from his lips.  &quot;Don't mention it,&quot; he assured.  &quot;You were in trouble, and well, we just wanted to lend a hand. No one should face fear alone.&quot; He suddenly grinned.  &quot;Especially not a pretty young lady such as yourself.&quot; He knelt down and took her hand politely, kissing her knuckles chastely.  &quot;I don't believe we've been introduced properly.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, here we go,&quot; Eris sighed, turning her head.  &quot;You've done it now...&quot;<br>
<br>
Seifer looked back at Eris with a cocksure grin, though his features softened as he chuckled at her sarcasm.  He looked back at Kirin.  &quot;She's Eris,&quot; he smiled.  &quot;She's a little cynical, and definitely insane...&quot; he lowered his voice as he said this.  &quot;But she's okay.  And I am Seifer. Seifer Hyperon.  And it's an honor to meet you...Kirin, was it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Eris sighed.  &quot;Stop flirting with her, Seif.  She's scared outta her mind already.&quot;  She walked over to Kirin and grinned.  &quot;Don't worry, Kirin--whoever that guy was in the forest, he won't get you now...not with Seifer and I here.  Rest assured, we'll get you where you need to go.&quot;<br>

&quot;I usually have good discernment... but. Oh well.&quot; She shurgged it off.<br>
<br>
A shadow lurked in the background...<br>
no... it was darker than a shadow.<br>

Whoa...she'd come a little too close to the truth back there...a little bit too close to opening the scars...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, Eris...&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked to her side to see Seifer's face in the light of his torch.  It was full of concern and his voice was low so the others couldn't hear.<br>
<br>
&quot;You okay, Eris?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you talking about? I'm perfectly fine.&quot; She kept her eyes forward, a sign Seifer took as &quot;I'm lying right through my pearly whites&quot;.  He sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, we're best friends.  You can tell me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know. But there's nothing to tell!&quot;  She shrugged. &quot;Okay, if you really want to know?  I'm getting that 'feeling', Seif.  You know, that feeling I get when we're just about to walk into an obvious trap?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Argh, not the feeling,&quot; he smiled, but remained serious.  &quot;Don't worry about it, Eris.  We do this kinda thing for a living, remember? The mighty Sorceress Hunters of Lorion!&quot; he chuckled, clapping Eris on her slim shoulder.  &quot;There's nothing we can't take on.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she smiled weakly, looking at him, feeling her doubts fade as she saw how honest his eyes were, how they always were.  She kept smiling, even as the roaring grew louder. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/5/03 11:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm149.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Appearance in the mines (Kyonae and Zylle!

&quot;Haha,&quot; Eris laughed, seeing the look of shock on the girl's face.  &quot;Just kiddin'.  Where we come from, there are a lot of these annoying pesky wraiths called demisorceresses.  A real sorceress only comes along every thousand years, but demisorceresses can be anywhere! And they all look pretty much the same.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Seifer agreed.  &quot;You know, snake eyes, fangs, the whole unholy seductive bit...really nasty.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And they like to cause trouble.  So people like me and Seifer hunt them down.  And we're the best, so don't worry.&quot;  She shrugged.  &quot;As for what are in mines, it's pretty simple.  Dwarves, wraiths,  shadows, goblins, little fire lizards, and Firadra knows what else...but nothing we haven't seen before, i'm sure.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/5/03 11:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm149.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Appearance in the mines (Kyonae and Zylle!
