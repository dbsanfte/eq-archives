The most devastating single act against America's core values was the enactment of the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  This was the amendment giving 18 year olds the right to vote.<br>
<br>
This amendment, was purported to give those who might go off to war and die, a voice in government.  And if you believe the old Students for A Democratic Society (SDS) led by infamous icons like Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, Abby Hoffman...well then that purported reason probably sits just fine with you.<br>
<br>
In actuality, the 26th Amendment did one thing only.  It gave immense and near immediate political power to ACADEMIA, the folks who's prime area of responsibility was supposed to be non-political and strictly-the education of our kids in colleges and universities throughout the country.<br>
<br>
As a result our colleges and universities across the country have turned America from a prideful and unique melting pot of individuals into groups of multi-cultural class warfare victims on a lightning fast race for socialism.  <br>
<br>
Yep!  Through curriculum, campus voice, instigators, agitators, community studies, and a student block-voting mindset that topples communities, counties, and even state and national political offices, we are well on our way.  <br>
<br>
I have devised a way to stop it; but before I put forth this idea I want some comment from the board to see if the problem is as wide-spread as I suspect it is.  I would appreciate the name of your state when you post.<br>
<br>
I'll leave you with these two thoughts:<br>
<br>
1.  Do you know by how many votes the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate was voted out by in the 2000 general election?<br>
<br>
ANSWER:  2200 votes, which is what Senator Gorton of Washington State lost his seat by.<br>
<br>
2.  Think of 3 famous, well known colleges in the state of California.  <br>
<br>
ANSWER:  got 'em?  Now look for a website that shows which counties in the state supported Gray Davis in the recall of Nov. 2003.  Were those three colleges in a Davis county?  I'll bet all of them were.<br>

There is gobs of stuff in and out of the media that shows your analogy to be right-on. <br>
<br>
Liberals have taken education and turned into a ideological brainwashing tool. Instead of teaching (just the facts maam) they tend to brainwash. We also have the courts that are using the bench to pass laws instead of their real job, interpreting and enforcing the laws. <br>
<br>
Personally, I am very interested in what your idea is. Anything that helps turn the tide is a GOOD idea.<br>

David.  Actually, last night when I posted I lost my internet at the same time.  I didn't think the post came through.  Also, I probably should have cross-posted this to the main conservative board; but Mama tol' me to go with them who brung ya, first.  LOL!  <br>
<br>
Also, I agree with your brainwashing concept.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The university in my town, U of CAL @ Santa Cruz (UCSC) has me thinking of China's re-education camps.  These kids of &quot;no consequences&quot; locally have been in majority control of our city council since 1981.  I suspect most other communities in CA that have U of CAL or Cal State campuses suffer as well.<br>
<br>
LOL!  It's so bad here that we had a school tax measure on the ballot last year during college break that still passed on a 67% YES vote.  It passed by 80 votes.  On campus?  Well, 608 students voted anyway......  599 voted YES...and 9 voted NO.  That's real individual thought, David-wouldn't ya say?  And only 46% of students live on campus.  The rest are in town.  So, in essence, students gave us this tax they don't pay near single-handedly as a group.<br>
<br>
ANYWAY!  First thought...<br>
<br>
1.  If you raise your kid a lefty; don't teach them about this country's heritage; don't appreciate America's values,  and hate the U.S. military....why you can send your kid to college and get a dependent tax break until your kid is 22 years old...or 26 if they go to grad school.<br>
<br>
2.  If you raise you child with the values of America; teach them to love and honor country; appreciate what rights they have as an individual, and the necessity of serving and even defending country.....well, your kid enlists at the age of 17 and right out of high school.  And guess what?  You lose your dependent tax break.  <br>
<br>
Not only that; but the only time America says thank you to you is generally at your son or daughter's funeral when they hand you an American flag as a replacement for your child.<br>
<br>
It seems bass-ackwards to me, David!  It also seems to me that America, as great as she is, ought to be able to find a better way to say thank you.  Ya know?<br>
<br>
NEXT let's go back to the lefties....  Parents get this continuing tax break because their kids are considered to be &quot;in the nest&quot; (meaning still part of the family unit in the home) so their parents can continue to deduct them under dependent status.  Are we clear?<br>
<br>
AND, in my humble opinion, that's all fine and dandy as long as that child continues to register to vote at home-of-record instead of where they go to school, and continues to vote at home via absentee ballot like most senior citizens do.  <br>
<br>
However, once that child voluntarily re-registers to vote where he or she goes to school, they are not only declaring themselves adults who wish to have a say in local affairs; but they also both mentally and physically declare that they have permanently left their home domicile, giving up for a new home domicile.  <br>
<br>
HENCE!!!!!  The parents should forfeit their &quot;in the nest&quot; tax exemption because their own child has legally declared they've left the nest!<br>
<br>
We know this about liberals.... Everything they want....they want other people to pay for.  But if it costs them, they aren't for it at all.  Therefore, if it comes to getting a tax break for their child if the student stays registered to vote at home-of-record......OR.....losing that tax break if their child gives up the home domicile.  I'm betting the child stays registered to vote at home.  <br>
<br>
Either way though, both the student and the parents have something new to consider they never had to worry about before in the student's actions.  That would be?   CONSEQUENCES FOR  THEIR  ACTIONS!!!!  Isn't that amazing?<br>
<br>
Look!  A single-mindset student vote of 15,000 to 20,000 at a large college campus votes one way for the lefty on the ballot which virtually insures his or her victory.  If all of these votes are sent back to the original 1500 to 2000 communities they came from....the residents of consequence in these normal thinking communities regain control of their community.  And in normal communities radical lefties don't win elections, generally.<br>
<br>
And right now, more than ever, it's not so important to think that lefties won't get elected if this legislation were passed by the house and the senate; but more importantly, lefties won't get RE-ELECTED.  Capi'ce?<br>
<br>
Could this kind of legislation get passed?  Now?  Maybe.  Who knows, it might possibly be done through executive order directing a more stringent test of &quot;in the nest&quot; to the IRS.  <br>
<br>
My plan would call for something a little more righteous.  First, it would be 'tax cut&quot; legislation.  Call it the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>American Family Tax Cut.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  It would provide that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the parents of any 17-22 year old serving in their first active duty enlistment would get <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">AN EXTRA</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> dependent tax deduction for the entire first term active duty tenure of each enlisted child....providing that servicemember continues to vote at his or her home-of-record for the entire portion of the first active duty enlistment. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
It would then wrap all 17-22 year old Americans into the same criteria for dependent status.  Register to vote at home-of-record and your parents continue to get a dependent deduction.  Give up your home-of-record voting domicile and the parents lose the deduction.<br>
<br>
One problem.  This is going to take a full on assault of republican Congressional office holders and U.S. Senators.  And it's going to have to be more than e-mail cuz they just don't respond to e-mail.  I<br>
<br>
It will take people who have access to these high-up muckity mucks, it will take pressure.  You see, once these folks hit these higher offices they become real clueless as to what's important for us....versus what's important for themselves.  We need to make them understand that this has the potential to drop the national left dead in its tracks.<br>
<br>

The pitch is in the tax cut.  The Aermican Family Tax Break gives an extra exemption to the claiming family of every 17-22 year old son or daughter serving on active duty in their first enlistment...and extensions to first enlistment; but not re-enlistment.<br>
<br>
The qualifier is not only simple; but as the U.S. Military asks of all its service men and women.  Please register to vote at your home-of-record so as not to unduly impact the communities in which you are stationed.  <br>
<br>
THEN....out of fairness in America (Thanks Bill Clinton) we wrap all 17-22 year olds into the same registration criteria.  Register to vote at your home-of-record and you get dependent status.....but re-register to vote at a new domicile and you're an on-your-own full and free adult.  Your parents, naturally lose their exemption for you.<br>
<br>
As for 7 pm meetings, I'm generally closing up or readying for bed by then.  I day trade...LOL!  I also do news talk radio which means my rantings do get out.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And sadly, I have little to no affiliation with local republicans.  Most are into self-righteous theory around herre instead of actually trying to make an immediate difference.  <br>
<br>
Actually, I liken most of them to space cadets....  They want to take giant leaps for mankind; but they won't try taking the steps necessary to learn to walk first.  Ya know?  Since students overwhelm the locals around here in local elections (probably about 40% of registered voters) they just gave up and surrendered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=17.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=17.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.threadControl?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fcavconservativesfrm2">General Conservative Discussion<option value="fcavconservativesfrm7">Townhall Meetup Talk<option value="fcavconservativesfrm8">Soldiers Appreciation Forum.<option value="fcavconservativesfrm12">Presidential Race 2004<option value="fcavconservativesfrm11">Member Articles...Top Notch Musings<option value="fcavconservativesfrm10">Investment ideas for Conservatives<option value="fcavconservativesfrm13">Links and Conservative Vendors<option value="fcavconservativesfrm3">Polls<option value="fcavconservativesfrm9">Liberal or Political Jokes.<option value="fcavconservativesfrm1">Announcements<option value="fcavconservativesfrm4">Administration Discussion<option value="fcavconservativesfrm5">Help Files</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives>FCAV Conservatives</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2>General Conservative Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/the_right_turn2003">FCAV</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.32<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
