IC:  Trekondar paced up and down the Council room.  It had been some time since he had need to call a council meeting, but now, he seemed to find need.  There had been rumours of insurgence among a few of the clans.  After what it had taken to overthrow the Ventrue, Trekondar could not have rebellion in the city.  If he did, it would only be a matter of time before the Malkavian's were overthrown and the Ventrue once again had control of the city.  As the door to the Council room slammed open, Trekondar looked up, curious as to who would be the first to enter.<br>
<br>
OOC:  The Council room is pretty bare, all that stands in it is a big oak table, with large wooden chairs.  The floor is tiled in a blood red tile of some sort, and there are no windows.  This was to allow meetings to run from night time through the day without causing any problems from the sunlight. <p>Trekondar<br>

Hopefully this meeting wasn't some foolish whim of Trekondar, even his mind was tainted at times.<br>
<br>
Reluctantly, Ludria pushed open the heavy double doors that led to the council chambers. She knew her duty to her clan, the good Tremere always came first in her life, her clan was her life. It wasn't that she hated these meetings, just the unexpected ones, they never brought good news.<br>
<br>
As she entered the Hall, the doors swung shut with a deep thudding sound. Ludria pushed back the hood of her of her night black cloak and began to unhook the single clasp that held the cloak closed around her neck, the clasp was her clan's crest, worked in silver, it reminded her of her duty.<br>
<br>
As she continued to walk down the the length of the hall, the hard soles of her boots hitting marbled red tiles on the floor filled the air with muted sounds. The room was not built with acoustics in mind, but it served it's purpose. He cloak billowed behind her with the wind formed from the air escaping as the door closed.<br>
<br>
Had she been younger, she would have contemplated lowering the temperature in the room, but such pompous uses of her gifts would have been fruitless if not detrimental, she simply relied on her reputation to present herself.<br>
<br>
As she rounded her assigned chair at the table, she fully removed her cloak, and layed it folded neatly over the left arm of the chair before she sat down.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're looking well Trekondar. I'm glad to see you're still healthy, may we presume that time has been as kind to your mind as it has been to your body?&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded in the direction of the other elder at the table.<br>
&quot;Ratri, its good to see you again as well&quot;.<br>
<br>
And so the games begin.<br>

Kain knew that councils that he was invited to usually meant something with the houses but he didn't not care he would go. Once again the assimites had to make another appearance at the beck and call of others but it was for the better. When trouble came about the assamites had jobs and well paid at that.  But what was this meeting really about maybe it was some madness that Trekondar finally put together. What ever it was Kain would see it soon.<br>
   As Kain moved through the space the people gave him unknowing that he was invisible to their eyes. The square of the palace was a large area with a fountain in the middle that many people walked around to get to their busy jobs.  Kain moved fast thought the growing crowds that gathered and made if the steps of the palace. Finally reaching the palace Kain moved though the plain but expansive hallways then Kain saw the double doors that were solid wood but Kain instead of what most people would expect just used his mist form to appeared on the other side still cloaked in stealth to hear &quot;Likewise...im sure.&quot; Kain smiled at the three sitting there in their seats. Kain moved silently to his seat then appeared out of his cloak of invisibility and watched every ones surprised expressions. <br>
   &quot;a council was called ?&quot;  Kain tried to read their auras but he never had a great talent in that and the auras were just jumbled ,this just brought a great clam to him for it showed him that his other skills still could be used more effectivly then this auras that apeared for him. With this great calm he knew that others could not read his aura very easlly and probbly the only one who could read his would be Trekondar himself. <p>Elder of Assamites <br>

This is a chance for Kain to see how Ahmed behaves, as well as to receive a view on his attitudes.<br>
<br>
IC:  Ahmed was the next to enter the room, he had a strong, commanding presence about him.  Nodding to Trekondar, then to Kain, he took a seat in the chair directly left of Trekondar.  Slowly, he swept his eyes across the room, memorizing the appearance of every person who was there.  Studying the subtly nuiances of their behavior.  This man had survived a war.  Very few would still call it a war, but it was a war no less.  He had learned in that war that you never knew who your enemies were, and who your allies were.  He also learned that enemies and allies could change on you at a moment's notice.<br>
<br>
In a deep, commanding voice, one that you would expect to find giving orders on a battle field, Ahmed spoke up.  &quot;So, Trekondar, why is it that you have called us here today?&quot;<br>
<br>
Standing behind his chair, Trekondar spoke in his very sinister voice, the one he used for general purposes, &quot;in due time Ahmed, in due time.  We are still missing some of our number.  Clan Leaders, Elders, there are still those who are missing.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, Trekondar pulled out his chair and sat down, drawing erratic patterns on the table with his finger.<br>
<br>
OOC:  Ok, take your pic, and NPC the Elders who don't exist yet (who aren't being PC'ed) as well as the Clan Leader for your clan.  We don't have to bother with the other Clan Leaders right now, unless you wanna NPC them too for now.  Just don't give em names <p>Trekondar<br>

Cazador’s long jet black hair made is tanned spanish skin seem pale by comparison, it framed his face eloquently, covering his ears completely.  <br>
<br>
Cazador pulled out the chair to Ludria’s left, and rested himself in a comfortable slouching position with one leg crossed.  The man’s posture gave off the impression that they were here to lounge around, it quite marvelously contrasted with Ludria’s proper posture and icy cold composure.  Though his posture suggested a relaxed attitude, his beady dark brown eyes stared down his hooked spanish nose at Trekondar.  <br>
<br>
He was a patient man, he was prepared to wait for plans to unfurl before him as opposed to rush things. <br>

He knew that it was never good when a meeting was called out of the blue like this but he would be damned if he missed out on anything that would be discussed in that room. Moving quickly despite his limp,Craven opened the door to the meeting chamber and moved inside quickly. He didn't like being around any of the other clans anymore then they liked to deal with the Nosferatu but he would tolerate them all for now. When a meeting was called you came,simple as that. Moving quickly around the table and meeting eyes with everyone,one by one, Craven said nothing to no one as he took the chair that was farthest from everyone and sat down. Craven took in the faces of everyone that was already there from Cazador of the Tremere all the way to Trekondar himself. Craven had a head for faces and facts and he would remember all that was said and done here on this day. The most common misconception others,including the other clans(though they knew better), was that the Nosferatu,because they looked deformed and didn't groom themselves, were also not too bright.

She figured she was the youngest, but wasn't sure. She was wearing a dark red tank top that ended at the top of her jeans, which, on the left side of her waist there was her katana, in its sheath, with some black ribbons tied around it. An Assamite would take it at the door. The jeans she wore were black, and were baggy. She wore steel toed boots, but it was more designed, the metal, then the construction steel toes. They ended under her knees and were laced up, though her pants covering her boots. Covering her, she wore a more styled black trench coat, that was virgin wool. It hung loose over her shoulders, unbuttoned. She stood about a 5'6&quot; and had a regular/athletic body type. She was a tad different from a normal Toreador, but I guess that's expected. <br>
      She looked at the knob before putting her hand on it, and opening the door. Her long black hair, bottom back length now, was still behind her shoulders, her spiky, but flat bangs fell long over her forehead. As she walked into the room she got a chill. She saw a few different people sitting in these chairs that, she guessed, were wooden. She glanced at all the Elders, noticing there wasn't yet a Ravnos Clan Elder, and sighed in relief, not wanting to start anything just yet. <br>
       Her face had a curious expression as she looked at the Malkavian Elder. &quot;The leader. &quot; She guessed, and thought. She eyes fell over a quite different fellow that was leaning in his chair. She made a sarcastic face in amusement. &quot; Must be Ravnos. &quot; She smirked. She sighed...she blushed. Her eyes widened in embarrassment, and fought the red cheeks away till they were back to there milky white shade. She looked left then looked right. &quot; .....OH GEEZ! Look at you all, your all so...so ..... Oh well you all just are thinking too much. Oh my, I'm sorry. I'm immature...maybe someone should have brought some party hats. I mean it would lighten things up. &quot; She smiled. &quot; Heh....well...Anyway. I brought a gift for this room, that might last longer then party hats. I will return.  &quot; She walked back out the door, and a few moments later, came back in with a quite large square, flat thing. It was covered in brown wrapping paper. She smiled again as she laid it on the table and unwrapped it.<br>
       She looked at the other Elders and waited for what they might think of it. It was a panting/portrait of vague, yet silhouetted, or shadowed people. There were five in all, the people in the picture. Two women could be made out, and three men. They had no special features, except the figure that stood for her, Marilyn, was transparent. The picture was odd. It was colors of black and red. The four others were silhouetted by red, but were shadowed with black, and for Marilyn, it was same colors, only opposite: Silhouetted with black, and shadowed with red. <br>
       &quot; I do hope you like this panting. It took a while to finish. &quot; She smiled. &quot; Its your choice Trekondar, if you wish to hang it up in here, or have it hung somewhere else, but I think it would be special if it were hung in here. &quot; She tilted her head and closed her eyes smiling. &quot; Just so it isn't as bleak. She opened her eyes and then left the huge picture on the table and sat in a seat, across from Ratri, also in front of the picture. She waited.<br>

If you have an Elder Character or a Clan Leader character, you need to have them present, unless it is the Clan Leader for the Tremere, for give me but my mind is drawing a blank on that character's name.<br>
<br>
IC:  Trekondar had decided that this was all that was going to show up.  Much to his dismay.  This was a very important meeting.  He figured that it was just the stigma that followed his clan, they weren't ALL Kooks beyond salvation after all.  Heck, very few, except those who knew Trekondar personally would even think Trekondar to be crazy, or have any mental issues.  He had learned long ago to control the voices and illusions he suffered from, albeit at a price.  Now when he DID let them out, they were almost unbearable, but it was a price he was willing to pay for credibility.<br>
<br>
Pushing back in his chair, he pulled out a cigarette and lit it.  Taking a deep drag on it, he spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it appears as if this is all that will show up, so as usual, we will do the normal beginnings of an Elder Meeting.  I want each Elder to fill me in on what their Clan has doing since the last time I've seen you.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Trekondar sat back down, stumping his cigarette out in his hand, then folding them and leaning forward waiting for each Elder to reply in turn.<br>
<br>
OOC:  Ok, I know that eventually the Gangrel Elder SHOULD be joining in, because I've found someone to take that position.  Everyond who shows up after this post will be considered late to the meeting.  Basically the report is just a stalling tactic to see if we get anymore Elders soon.  I will aslo need an email from every Clan Elder letting me know where your Clan's loyalties lie.  Wether you are for/against the Malkavians, or are Neutral.  I will be sending out an email to go along with this post. <p>Trekondar<br>

inside almost unnoticed.  The door to the council room was left ajar and she quietly pushed<br>

The only colour her body knew was her dusty red lips, and her chill ice blue eyes. Her gaze momentarilly rested on Cymoril, punctuality is a cuortesy <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well, at least the feral animal came.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
In her unhurried soft voice, she addressed the room. &quot;The Tremere, have been content continuing relations with the humans, exploiting their resources, both physical and mental.&quot; It was common within the Vampiric community to have a hatred towards the humans, they were a lesser being in the eyes of most. In fact, many of the clans refused to have any relations with the mortals aside from seeing them for dinner. The Tremere on the other hand, considered them a enormously valuble resource, even with their limited lifespans, the humans managed to be an assest, an expendable asset, but an asset none the less. Whatever personal feelings towerds the humans were, all the Tremere knew that if the humans could provide and advantage for the clan, then it was worth it. Anything for the glory of the Tremere.<br>
<br>
&quot;From an financial stand point, I would have to say that I am pleased with our progress, TMR Technologies annual gross revenue has increased by 3.2% since last year, and 4.9% from the year before that. I expect this is due primarily ....&quot; Her speech continued on ad nasuem, it wasn't a detailed report, just a overview of publicly known facts about the company. It was a mild tactic she had learned, in a room full of important people, any advantage you could obtain should be obtained. Any emotion elicited could be exploited, the council was growing irritated with incessant talk of unimportant financial details, irritation was a valuable ally. The tongue was more likely to wag when irritated.<br>
<br>
&quot;... and as such, TMR Technologies is set for another financially beneficial year.&quot; She glanced around the room, it was a small audience. &quot;I would also like to address a concern regarding territorial disputes. It has come to my attention that there has been some 'hunting' in the far southern district. Several humans have been killed on TMR Technology property&quot; Had Lamin been there, Ludria's ice cold stare would have borne down on him, the Ventrue Estates was bordering TMR Technologies and Recently the Ventrue had been giving themselves far too much liberty in their 'hunting' grounds. &quot;I suggest that who ever is responsible be advised that it will no longer be tolerated. Simply have your brethren civilised and simply go to a grocery store, or, restrain your hunting to your own section of Nazgoth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Throughout her address, her demeanor never changed, whether it was warning towards another clan, or the seemingly endless report on finances. &quot;And to conclude, I would once again welcome any of the other sects to begin open trade with the Tremere via TMR Technologies, for further information, you may contact Cazador at your leisure.&quot; And with grace, she lowered herself back down to her chair.<br>
<br>

These unscheduled meetings meant something was stirring and he hated not knowing what was going on, even if it did not involve the Cappadocian Family. They were just that a family not a clan but something more. The Kindred had a white silk shirt on, with a ringed collar so that no tie was necessary, and a pair of black silk pants ending in winged tipped shoes. The overcoat he wore was worked in silver vine pattern along the outside of the arms and ending in the silver crest of the Cappadocian Family at the upper arm just before the bicep. The coat shifted against his body as he unsheathed his twin daggers and pistol, handing them over to the Assamite at the door. Marrcos knew his appearance would be no surprise, but those who did not care for him or his Family would inevitably comment on his lateness.<br>
<br>
The door swung open as thoughts of ice calm fell over the man, some here would like to see the Elder of the Cappadocians dead just as soon as see him walking in the room. It was well know that his Family reveled in the search and knowledge of Death, but only a hair below that was their loyalty for each other no matter what, which had led him to cross paths with other who would like to pay him back for his deeds. He was well known to put any to death in search of the knowledge, but never a member of the Family, on the other hand he had been involved in other Kindred’s deaths as a part of research or at least that was the explanation he gave. A vicious smile wanted to cross his face, but he withheld it as he moved. Marrcos stepped through the door, itching at the absence of his weapons as he started to stroll forward. “My apologies Trekondar for being late.” The man nodded slightly to the Leader as he stepped to a chair only a few spaces from him. Marrcos’s glance took in those present, Ludria Clan Elder of the Tremere had earned a nod as his eyes continued to sweep.  His sight fell upon the Elder of the Ravnos Clan, Ratri and the Clan Leader; neither was of any particular interest to him. Kain Elder of the Assamites and Ahmed Clan Leader of the Assamites caught his attention slightly. The Assamites were killers and Death was a domain that Marrcos enjoyed knowing more about then others, he thought about talking with the Kindred, but just as fast his gaze continued to sweep. <br>
<br>
As Marrcos slowly sat he noticed the Nosferatu Clan Leader, Craven, the creature was always something of wonderment to Marrcos, twisted with the turning but still not to be underestimated.  He adjusted to the seat, realizing he had interrupted but still letting his gaze take in the room. Marilyn was the Elder for the Toreador and as exotic as the rest of her clan, but attentive as things happened around her.  Cymoril, Clan Leader of the Gangrel, was sitting staring at Marrcos as he positioned his fingers in a triangle in front of him on the table. Those were all that were present and all taken in a single glance as the man positioned himself, if anything his years had taught him control over himself was the key to learning about other things including other Kindred.<br>
<br>
“If I may ask, what is the topic first on the Agenda?” His tone was one cold composure and precious direction. The man was not a warrior or a politician, and his sadistic tendencies had earned a few raised eyebrows amongst others in this very room, but he was not to be overlooked either. Silence reigned in the room as he looked towards Trekondar. <br>
<br>

She sighed and looked over at Trekondar and brushed her pants a bit nervously. &quot; Toreador... is well known clan for its beautifulness, or elegant like appearance.. the status of my clan is pretty much remained the same over the passed few years.. &quot; She looked up slowly. &quot; It appears to be a few of my underlings missing.. several have disappeared, unexplainably.. I'm guessing they have been killed.. or have perished out of foolishness. Despite the fact that I know that I'm not really looked up to... I am taking a dear care and watch of my clan, though so few... &quot; Her eyes grew a bit colder, and darker shade of red.<br>
<br>
&quot; I'm very much motivated to pursue the killers of my clan.. I suspect the mass majority of my clans children have been killed, more then standing in front of the sun. &quot;  Marilyn looked down letting her bangs fall in her face as she sat in dismay and was hoping her input in the subject was correct and not misleading to any suspensions in the room, rather..she wasn't quite sure if the Elder of the killer of her clan was in the room. <br>
<br>
&quot; To cut to a conclusion, my clans status is neutral at the moment, neither prosperous, or underachieving. &quot; She closed her eyes then opened them slowly, tracing along the side of the table in front of her with her finger. <br>

He knocked on the door, waiting for it to open. A Malkavian lackey opened it cautiously, then sneered. Lamin felt the urge to kill him for his insolence, but that would only cause him trouble.<br>
Looking back over his shoulder, Lamin nodded at the two Ventrue who had accompanied him to this meeting. &quot;Go get something to eat, be back here in an hour&quot; he told them, aware of their secret orders to protect him if the worst came to the worst. Lamin could look after himself, he didnt need servants to look after him.<br>
Walking through the familiar corridors, Lamin felt anger rise in him. This building was Ventrue, the very walls had been built with Ventrue blood. It pained and infuriated him to see Malkavian upstarts in the structure. Every one of them watched him carefully, and one even started to follow him. They probably expected him to rush over and rip their dirty throats out. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The idea does have a certain appeal...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Finding himself at the door of the meeting hall, he placed his hand on the handle. His meagre gift at psychometry told him that someone had used the door recently, but not who.<br>
Twisting the handle, Lamin pushed the door open, finding himself in the dark room, where there were ten of his Kindred sat around the large table in the centre. Several were looking at him. He spread his arms and grinned apologetically.<br>
&quot;Apologies for my lateness, my friends.&quot; he said to them, his french accent leaking into his speech. &quot;The time got away from me.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So did the human,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought, amused. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He was quite fast. Still, he's face down in an alley somewhere now, with about as much blood as a turnip.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Taking a seat which was as far away from Trekondar as possible, Lamin found himself opposite Ludria. She was staring at him with that familiar icy-eyed expression, which she seemed so good at. Lamin grinned at her, which had as much effect as throwing stones at a glacier.<br>
Looking around, Lamin saw somebody stand, and settled back in the chair to try to find out what this meeting was about. Under his coat, in its sheath on his belt, he felt the family dagger which he always carried with him, a comforting presence. He clutched the hilt lightly as another vampire began to speak.<br>

         Kain waited for the next to stand or for Trekondar to begin the main meeting. <p>Elder of Assamites <br>

<br>
IC:  Trekondar stood up, it appeared as though all who were going to attend had shown up.<br>
<br>
Clearing his throat, Trekondar began to speak in the same voice he always used for such occasions.<br>
<br>
&quot;It would appear to me as though we are lacking some members, I appreciate the reports I have gotten from everybody who has been kind enough to give one.  However, this is not merely a meeting to determine how each clan is doing, or even WHAT they are doing.  Rather it is a meeting which is of importance to all.  It would appear as though many things have been going on here inside the city with which I find myself rather unhappy about.  There also appear to be things going on with which I am unhappy about that are taking place OUTSIDE the city walls.&quot;  Trekondar stressed the word outside, causing the room to resonante with his voice.  He hoped it would strike home that the concerns of the clans was not only things happening inside the city, but outside as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;It appears as though we have had many Kindred turn up dead inside the city walls, or else just flat out disappear.  I am rather unhappy about this and will get to it at a later time.  However, since ages ago, Kindred have been locked into an eternal struggle with a race of subhumans, shapechangers... half man... half beast.  It appears that packs of Garou have been massing outside the city to the North and East where the city is bordered by forests.  Also, it appears the Slayers are on the upswing.  Both may cause problems for us in the future.  I believe that the dead bodies may be attributed to wererats.  I do not know that Craven or any of his clan have seen them but they have been lurking about in the city, and I know that they might frequent the sewers.  They may be the source of the missing bodies.  The Slayers are working very secretively, as I have as yet found any for sure, but I've seen their handiwork across the city from time to time.  And they may be the cause of the bodies that are found and are dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Also on a seperate note... there have been rumors floating about.  These rumors have said that the Ventrue are starting to form allegiances with some of the clans, and are planning to attempt a coup against the Malkavian Clan.  I say, if anybody is caught knowing anything of this, the they will be dealt with swiftly, and severely.  Treason is something that will not be tolerated, and Kain has assured me that he has a group of the Assamite Clan set aside specially for dealing with these matters.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, Trekondar sat down and turned the floor back over to everyone else.<br>
<br>
OOC:  Ok, post what you want.  The mention of shapechangers does NOT mean they are able to be PC's yet, however, before I incorporate them into this as PC's I want them to have SOME background.  Same thing with the Slayers.  Any questions on what is ok to post, message me I'll let you know at this point.  Basically, post what you want, but get my approval first before mentioning Garou (werewolves) or Ratkin (wererats) in your post... and before mentioning Slayers.  And as to the thread with the clan's meeting in the club... The Shapechangers are thought of by most as nothing more then the vampire equivalent of the Bogeyman.  Slayers would seem too convenient an explanation to the deaths as well because they are humans, they have been beaten as a large scale group once.  Most vampires would pass them off as being no threat to any vampires anymore.  Hope I don't upset too many people with this post, I was just trying to get things moving and get those two groups into the background. <p>Trekondar<br>
