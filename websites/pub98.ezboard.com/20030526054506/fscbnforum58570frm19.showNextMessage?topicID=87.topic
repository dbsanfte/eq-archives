<br>
“What will they do?”<br>
<br>
“Difficult to say, under the circumstances.” Roche responded. “They’ll almost certainly respond or retaliate in some way, simply because they have little choice but to do so. The Tremere have been in this city as long as anyone. They have served as Princes on more than one occasion, and served this city with distinction. But now they’ve made Marie cross, which is a bad situation to put yourself in.”  <br>
<br>
“But did they deserve it?”<br>
<br>
“Of course they deserved it. They’re Tremere! But its simply the nature of things, Crowley. I did what I felt I had to do to protect this city; and suffered the consequences. Now Marie is doing the same. I can’t say what the consequences will be.”<br>
<br>
Crowley thought for a long moment.<br>
<br>
“I wasn’t there, was I? To face the consequences with you, I mean.”<br>
<br>
Roche seemed to brush the comment aside. “You couldn’t have done anything; you’d have only been cut down as well.” He paused, and then his tone of voice changed. “But don’t think for one minute I’ll tolerate it if you show such cowardice again.” <br>
<br>
Crowley heard at once the threat in his voice and nodded. “Yes, I know. This time I’ll die with my Prince.”<br>
<br>
“You may. Or you may die helping to save her, or you may fail completely and watch another Prince fall. What is important is not how we die, but how we live. Dying comes when the world gets tired of watching us live. Can our actions affect the when? Certainly. But if we live with the constant fear of death, if that’s the only thing that determines our actions, are we really living?”<br>
<br>
Again Crowley took a moment of thought before answering.<br>
<br>
“We’re Kindred. We’re supposed to live forever.”   <br>
<br>
“No.” Roche answered. “We’re not supposed to live forever; we’re supposed to EXIST forever, or until someone tougher than us shows up, and decides we shouldn’t exist anymore. That’s our problem, Crowley. Most Kindred actually fear death far more than Kine. Kine KNOW they’ll face death someday. Kindred don’t. Kindred know that if they play the game right, they’ll live for as long as they want. So we barricade ourselves. Hide behind ghouls and other Kine servants… even childer and neonates. We become these ‘master manipulators’, working behind the scenes watching younger Kindred fight among themselves. All for what? So that we can EXIST for a few more years? Centuries? Millennia? Watching that which had once made us what we are die, while we dither on?”<br>
<br>
Crowley tried to absorb this. “And me?”<br>
<br>
“Do you want to exist forever, or do you want to live?”<br>
<br>
“I want to live.”<br>
<br>
“Good. I can promise you that if you follow the path set before you, you will live. I can’t promise how long, or most of the details surrounding how it will end.”<br>
<br>
“You did say I would be tested.”<br>
<br>
”So I did. By the way, take the next right up here.”<br>
<br>
“Uh, why?”<br>
<br>
“Shortcut. Remember, Crowley. I can only guide you. Its you who decides what path to follow. And by the way, take a look at what’s happening on your left.”<br>
<br>
“What?” Crowley exclaimed. But Roche was gone. <br>
<br>
Crowley slowed the car as he looked on his left, and then immediately slammed on the brakes. There – down that alley in the street – two men… attacking that woman. They were trying to…<br>
<br>
Many things went through Crowley’s mind right then.<br>
<br>
Leave; it’s none of your concern, you don’t know anything about the situation, you have no stake in this, you have enough problems of your own as it is. For all you know, you could have this figured completely wrong. <br>
<br>
Leave; they are Kine, you are Kindred. More than that, you are Ventrue. As individuals, they are nothing but cattle. If you have no claim to any of them, then you should have no interest in any of them. To involve yourself in such a matter without cause would place an unnecessary risk on the Masquerade.<br>
<br>
Leave; what has the world ever given you? It took away your parents, put you in that so-called hospital, drove you nearly insane. Then, when it looked like you had finally regained your footing, your damn Sire decided you’d make a heck of a vampire. He then dropped you into this pack of wolves. All you’ve tried to do is do right by the other Camarilla Kindred, and look how they’ve treated you. You are a best like a ghoul to them. A tool, to be used and then disposed of. And they will dispose of you, as soon as someone comes along they find more to their liking, or who can do things you can’t. You owe no one anything, certainly not that girl.  <br>
<br>
Yes, leave. Be on your way. That would be the smart thing to do.<br>
<br>
GOD DAMN IT. <br>
<br>
Two seconds later, Crowley was out of his car, gun drawn.<br>
<br>
Three seconds later. “Let her go.”<br>
<br>
The first thug had been brandishing a knife in front of the girl, while the second thug, larger and stronger looking than the first man, restrained her. The girl, for her part, was still struggling, but it was apparent she had been struck a couple of times, and the fight looked like it had been beaten out of her. Tears were pouring from her eyes, and her clothes had already been partially ripped. <br>
<br>
All three of them looked up at Crowley. Apparently, the matters at hand had made them oblivious even to his car stopping. <br>
<br>
The first thug was the first to recover, and tried not to look to impressed the Crowley’s weapon. He pointed his knife at Crowley. <br>
<br>
“Man, this is none of your business, man. Just turn around and walk the fuck away. Right now.”<br>
<br>
This time Crowley looked the man directly in the eyes. He spoke slowly and with a deadly seriousness. <br>
<br>
“Let. The. Girl. Go. Now.”<br>
<br>
The punk froze for a second then turned to his friend and the girl. He started trying to force the man to let release her.<br>
<br>
“Hey, Reggie what the fucks the matter with you, man? Hey, suit boy, what the fuck did you do to him?” <br>
<br>
He released the girl and pulled a gun from his own pocket, pointing it directly at Crowley’s head. The girl collapsed to the ground sobbing.<br>
<br>
Crowley turned his full attention to the second man. He doubted the gun would hurt him much, it at all. But it would bring greatly unwanted attention to the situation. <br>
<br>
“Put down the gun!”<br>
<br>
The man started to obey the command, but unfortunately, it had distracted Crowley from the first punk. Regaining his composure, the man again turned on Crowley with the knife, this time swinging it back to strike.<br>
<br>
“Mother-fuck—“<br>
<br>
He never completed his curse -- or his swing.<br>
<br>
A sharp “ping” went through the air, as the gun’s silencer did its job. Crowley’s aim was true. The punk fell to the ground, barely making any noise at all.<br>
<br>
The second punk seemed to have recovered now, and tried to bring his gun back up. <br>
<br>
“Sonofa—“<br>
<br>
PING.<br>
<br>
Crowley surveyed the alley for a moment.<br>
<br>
Three seconds. Two dead bodies. And a weeping victim at his feet.<br>
<br>
Crowley fell to his knees, and turned the girl’s face towards him. He looked directly into her eyes.<br>
<br>
Good lord, she was a lot younger than she had looked from the street. Couldn’t have been older than 16, 17 maybe.<br>
<br>
“Listen to me.” He said empathically. “Did you know these two men?” <br>
<br>
The girl, biting back sobs, answered “No.”<br>
<br>
“Did anyone else know you were coming this way?”<br>
<br>
“No.”<br>
<br>
“Good. Listen to me.” Crowley held the girl’s chin to maintain her gaze. “None of this happened. You left your home this evening with a plan to go someplace, but you fell and tripped… hurting yourself. That’s how you got your injuries. After that, you decided to go home. After I let you go, you’ll leave this place, and go straight home. You won’t come through this alleyway again if you can avoid it. None of this ever happened. I was not here. These two men do not exist. Do you understand?” <br>
<br>
The girl seemed much calmer now. “Yes.”<br>
<br>
“Good. Now leave here.”<br>
<br>
The girl, almost with renewed vigor, suddenly stood up and walked out of the alley on her own power. Crowley stared after her for a moment, and then looked away.<br>
<br>
Crowley, with extensive security training, now turned his attentions to the possibility his had been caught on tape somehow. But it was a more run-down area of downtown. There were no stores or residences across from the alley, only boarded up warehouses and office buildings. No cars had passed by. Certainly no people had, either.  <br>
<br>
Just two dead bodies lying in the alleyway. <br>
<br>
”God damn it.” He whispered, and reached for his cell phone.<br>
 <br>
15 minutes, two cell phone calls, a favor called in, some cash changed hands, and a few very exact uses of his disciplines later, Crowley again stood in the alleyway, this time completely alone. There were no bodies, no blood, no forensic evidence. <br>
<br>
No one would remember what had happened on this night.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, that wasn’t what was bothering Crowley. <br>
<br>
He got back in his car and drove back to his haven rather quickly. <br>
