<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>'Irish-American' Kerry's Jewish roots revealed <br>
<br>
February 9, 2003<br>
<br>
BY LYNN SWEET SUN-TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF Advertisement<br>
<br>
</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
 <br>
WASHINGTON--Presidential candidates find their lives--and their lineage--are put under a microscope.<br>
<br>
In the case of Sen. John Forbes Kerry, new scrutiny led to the discovery that the grandfather of the Massachusetts Democrat was Jewish, born Fritz Kohn in a small town that was once part of the Austrian empire and now is in the Czech Republic.<br>
<br>
The revelation is interesting because Kerry is most often taken as a Boston Brahmin, mainly because his mother comes from the upper-crust Forbes and Winthrop families, who are well-known in New England. Kerry is also a practicing Catholic. His name and his home state, which contains the nation's biggest Irish-American population, have led people to conclude that he is something he is not.<br>
<br>
&quot;People assume,&quot; said Kerry spokesman David Wade. &quot;Your name is Kerry, you are from Massachusetts, the land of the Kennedys.&quot;<br>
<br>
It remains to be seen whether any issue will develop over whether Kerry tried hard enough to wave people away from the assumption that he was Irish-American. Several friends of Kerry who were interviewed said they assumed him to be Irish-American.<br>
<br>
Kerry learned about his grandfather's heritage last month from Boston Globe reporter Michael Kranish, whose research led to Kerry discovering the details of his grandfather's 1921 suicide in a Boston hotel washroom.<br>
<br>
The son of a diplomat, &quot;John has talked a lot about how he grew up in different places, how he did not have a sense of connectiveness,&quot; said Wade. Since the story was published last Sunday, Kerry found it &quot;great to have a sense of family history he did not have before.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kerry told the Globe he had found out about 15 years ago that his paternal grandmother, Ida Lowe, was born Jewish. But he said he knew nothing about his grandfather's roots. Wade said Kerry said he remembers his grandmother as a &quot;zealous Catholic.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Globe pieced together Kerry's genealogy through Ellis Island immigration records, other documents in Chicago and records from the former Austrian Empire. The paper hired Felix Gundacker, director of the Institute for Historical Family Research in Vienna, to examine and translate the German-language records.<br>
<br>
Kerry's grandfather, who emigrated to the United States in 1905, was born in an Austrian town once known as Bennisch, which today is called Horni Benesov in the Czech Republic. Gundacker found birth records noting the 1873 birth of a Fritz Kohn and another record noting Kohn changed his name to Frederick Kerry on March 17, 1902. The Globe quoted Gundacker as &quot;1,000 percent certain&quot; that Kerry/Kohn was born to a Jewish family because the church records were on a page listing Jewish families.<br>
<br>
Ironically, Kerry's younger brother, Cameron, a Boston lawyer, converted to Judaism in 1983, when he married a Jewish woman.<br>
<br>
Kerry grew up in the dark over the circumstances of his grandfather's suicide. &quot;He knew his grandfather died when he was very young,'' Wade said. <br>
<br>
Kranish, the Globe reporter, showed Kerry copies of Boston newspapers from Nov. 23, 1921, headlined with the news that a merchant killed himself with a single shot from his revolver.<br>
<br>
&quot;God, that's awful,&quot; Kerry told the Globe after reading the article. &quot;Oh God, that's awful. That is kind of heavy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wade said Kerry's father, who died in 2000, never talked much about his father's suicide and that the senator only was told about the suicide during his father's &quot;last years, when his father was very ill,&quot; Wade said.<br>
<br>
The revelation, said Wade, &quot;turned on a light bulb for John Kerry on why his father was so understandably reticent to talk about it,&quot; and it &quot;helps John Kerry understand his father much more and what his father went through.&quot;<br>
