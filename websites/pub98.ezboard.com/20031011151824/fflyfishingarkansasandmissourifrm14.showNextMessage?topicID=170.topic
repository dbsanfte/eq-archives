We need to buy 2 of everything so it will be necessary to start out with lower priced gear. As we progress we can buy the more expensive stuff. Any suggestions? I was looking at a St. Croix combo at Cabela's. It's the lowest end- Pro Graphite rod with a cabela's prestige aluminum reel with disc drag. Have any of you tried one of these? What weight should I get? I like the St. Croix unconditional lifetime warranty, but I am open to any suggestions.<br>
I have a 9', 7 weight cabela's combo I purchased a few years ago. Is that too heavy for trout fishing the Little Red? <br>
How about flyline? Any preferences on brands?<br>
I took a full day fly fishing class at Yellow Dog Trading Company back in '99, but can't seem to find any classes like that now. Anyone know of any around the state? We wouldn't mind driving if it was a one day class.<br>
Planning to give it a try mid to late October. Any suggestions on locations would be much appreciated. <br>

Y'all should come to the FFF Southern Council Conclave this weekend in Mt. Home.  You'll be in the company of many of the local fanatics, and will make friends with enough that you probably won't need a school right now.  Fishing with friends will teach you the basics, and then you can take a class later to polish your techniques.  Some people would disagree on that point, claiming that it's better to take a formal course right at the beginning, and that you will avoid making lots of mistakes.  Well even those of us who've been flyfishing for 20, 30, even 40 years will tell you that it's fine to make mistakes so long as you're learning.  Figuring out how to catch a fish on your own is infinitely more satisfying than having every detail planned for you by someone else.<br>
<br>
If you can come to conclave, let us know on this board, and I promise, one of us will have some time to help you and your fiance.  If nobody else can, I'll take y'all fishing after working the casting ponds at the show.  <br>
<br>

The conclave sounds wonderful. We will have to see if we can change a few things around for the weekend and maybe we can come up on Saturday. I just took a look at the SC of FFF website and it looks like we missed a registration deadline. Can we still get in? <br>
Do you have any suggestions on gear? If we are fortunate enough to have one of you take us fishing we will need to get busy this week and buy a few things.<br>
What time do the activities start on Saturday?<br>
<br>

You can register at the door at the Conclave. The deadline was for preregistration and for exhibitors. You should come. It is a total blast and there is plenty of information to absorb. There will be plenty of contributors from this board that will be teaching, tying, casting, etc, and will be more than willing to pass along &quot;everything&quot; we know (that should take about 30 seconds). Seriously you'll learn a lot at the conclave just by participating. I learn something every year.<br>
<br>
We have talked about a &quot;formal&quot; fly fishing school later this spring. We'd need about 10 participants to keep the cost down for everyone. If you are interested let me know. Lessons at the conclave are free.<br>

I know everyone has their favorite beginner outfits, and I have mine as well.  First, I will tell you several that others endorse, such as Scientific Anglers &quot;Concept&quot;, Reddington's &quot;Red Start&quot;, Cortland's beginner outfit, and so forth.  These kits are generally in the 70 to 140 dollar range for a rod, reel, backing, flyline, and a leader.  Some of them include a rod tube to carry and store the outfit in.  <br>
<br>
My favorite is Cabela's &quot;Three Forks&quot; outfit.  I just like the way the rods cast.  Beginners have no problem getting started with them, and then they make dandy backup rods when you advance and want to buy something &quot;better&quot;.  I'll tell you, I can fish a Three Forks all day and never complain about how it casts.  The only thing that's left to be desired is in terms of the cosmetics, but that should be of little concern to you at this point.  They have upgrades to the basic kits, such as nicer reels with disk drags, multi-piece rods that will pack down to fit inside a briefcase, etc.  But the most simple outfit they offer is 59 bucks for everything, and sometimes goes on sale for 49.  Check www.cabelas.com and see if they're on sale now.  This is the time of year that they typically go on sale, heading into the fall and winter.<br>
<br>
I'll have a cell phone with me up there this weekend, so if you get the chance to come by the Conclave, gimme a ring and we'll have lunch or go fishing.  The number is 713-906-8673.  I can loan you a rod and reel if you don't have one, no problem.

Thanks for the warm welcome and invite to the Conclave. I hope we are able to make it up Saturday. What time do the events start that morning? If I am going to miss a day of bow hunting I don't want to miss out on anything I can learn up there. <br>
<br>
Troy- This 9', 7 weight I bought a few years ago is a Cabela's Three Fork Combo. What I don't like about it is the drag on the reel. It's the &quot;dual click&quot; or &quot;dual praul&quot;???? drag and I apparently don't know how to set it because it seems to me there is no drag at all. I opted not to use it in Michigan because I figured I would end up watching line and backing fly off with the first salmon that took my fly. All my friends up there use reels with disc drags that were very easy for me to figure out. I see that Cabela's has this Three Forks rod with a Prestige reel (w/disc drag) for $79 including line and backing. Only availabale in 8' and 8.5' on the 5wt. and 6 wt. models.<br>
<br>
I spoke to someone at one of our local fly shops today and they suggested a Temple Fork combo they have (not sure on the name of the reel but it was aluminum with a disc drag). Rod, reel, backing and line for $150. Temple Fork also has a No-Fault warranty. I am going tomorrow to give it a try. This same person suggested a 5wt. Can I get an opinion from any of you on which weight would be best suited for fishing here in Arkansas? How about rod length? Is there much of a difference in the 8.5' vs. 9' rod? I read somewhere where a longer rod is actually better for women because it requires less muscle. Is this true?<br>
Too many choices! <br>
<br>
Thanks again. I will give you a call if we head that way. Should know better about the weekend by tomorrow. <br>

You will definitely learn plenty to make it worth skipping a day of bowhunting (I'm a wannabe archer in my spare time).  The activities go all day, you can get in about 7:30 or 8:00 if I'm not mistaken.  I'm usually fishing until 09:00 or so, so I'm not often there when they first open.<br>
<br>
If you have the Three Forks in a 7 weight, do you like the rod action?  If so, then I will tell you that they are pretty consistent through the entire series.  But a 7 will generally be too heavy to enjoy fishing the White and Norfork.  Unless they are generating and you're floating, you'll want a 4 or 5 weight.  I've helped a number of students pick out their first outfit, and had them go with the prestige reel.  It's definitely worth the extra money.  That graphite reel with the spring and pawl is nothing more than a line holder.  The Prestige has accounted for dozens of sockeye salmon in Alaska for one of my buddies, and countless 2 to 5 lb bass for several others here in south Texas.  One of them is even using it in the salt, and tearing it down to thoroughly clean it after every use.  So far, so good.<br>
<br>
Regarding length, for a woman I would generally not recommend a longer rod if strength/power is a concern.  Two reasons.  When the load (the flyline) is at a longer radius, it takes more torque (power) to get it in motion and up to speed.  A shorter rod will not be as fatiguing after a day's fishing.  The second reason is that the manufacturer must beef up the butt section for each additional inch of rod length.  Adding 6&quot; of length to a rod will definitely make it measurably heavier.  Maybe only 1/4 oz, but something that you can feel after a whole day fishing.<br>
<br>
Now, that is all in regards to casting.  Regarding the actual fishing of the rod, a longer rod will have some advantages to you.  You'll be able to mend more subtlely and effectively with a longer rod.  You'll have more reach when trying to manipulate a fly into a narrow feeding lane.  If you learn to high-stick when you nymph (you will if you fish with me), then you'll be able to hold more line off the water and get a longer natural drift.  On the down side, it can be a bugger to fish a long rod in tight brush. <br>
<br>
So there are definite tradeoffs when you look at different rod lengths.  I'll let you fish a 9'3&quot; 5 weight, and then fish a 7' 5 weight right after it, and see which one seems more friendly to you.  <br>
<br>
Hope you come join us on Saturday.  Check out the info on the Southern Council's website at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.southerncouncilfff.org/">www.southerncouncilfff.org/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<br>
I'll have to agree with Troy on the length of the rod issue. An 8.5 foot rod is much easier to fish with. My young son uses an 8 foot 4 weight. <br>
<br>
However, if you are going to fish primarily the rivers of Arkansas for trout I'd recommend that you use the longest rod you can handle. I &quot;still&quot; have a Cabela's rod that I bought maybe 20 years ago. Regardless of what we that are &quot;in the business&quot; tell you 80% of what makes a cast is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>caster</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not the rod. Loomis and Sage both have a &quot;Discovery Series&quot; set up that comes with reel, rod, line, and the works. You might look into those as well. <br>
<br>
If I had to have only &quot;one rod&quot; here in Arkansas it would be a 9.5 foot 5 weight medium action. I've landed fish up to almost 24 pounds on a 5 weight. The additional length helps with high stick nymphing and fishing out of a boat. A 5 weight will handle most of the streamers you'll fish here like the sculpin patterns and wooly buggers. If the action is fair you can fish with light tippets like 6X easy enough with a 5 weight. <br>
<br>
There will be tons of demo rods at the conclave. I'll be at the G Loomis booth quite a bit this year (unless I'm in a lesson or a class). I'm bringing several personal rods for people to try in lengths from 8 foot to 10 foot in a 5 weight. I'll even have a 13.5 foot 5 weight spey rod there.<br>
<br>
Spend some time with Troy while you're there. He's a sharp guy and a terrific casting instructor. I plan on taking a lesson from him myself.<br>

Thanks for the advice on the rod length. Maybe we will find something that will suit us at the conclave. <br>
<br>
The 9' cabela's combo that I have doesn't seem to be too much rod for me. I have a fair amount of upper body strength, just not near as much as most men have. Besides, I just had a 4 day exercise program of tugging on 20-30 lb salmon with a 9', 9 wt. rod along with miles of hiking while wearing waders and toting gear. And believe me we did 8 days worth of fishing in 4 days. We barely had time to eat one meal a day and we were very lucky to get 6 hours of sleep each night. I was stiff and sore for four more days after returning home- but it was worth it! I always manage to find strength and energy for my outdoor sports that doesn't usually show during the average weekday.<br>
<br>
Well, I must be one lucky beginner to have Troy offer his instruction as well as some time fishing with him. Especially if you (John) are wanting to have a lesson with him too. You are the same John that I contacted about a guided trip aren't you? By the way- great website! And if I can get a commitment on a date to fish from my fiancé and his friend I will be getting back with you. The busy season has just begun at the hotel he works at so finding time to play during the fall and winter is hard for him.<br>
If any of you know any outdoors women please pass along my website found on my personal profile under &quot;occupation&quot;. I tried to add it under &quot;personal link&quot; but it is not making the connection. We are doing some updating right now so there may be some broken links.<br>
<br>
John- Hope to meet you at the conclave on Saturday.<br>
Troy- I will be giving you a call.<br>
Again- thank you both so much for answering my questions. <br>

<br>
Excellent website you have there!!! My web designer is a girl that I trade some trips with. She hooked a 35+ pound brown last year. I'll definately send her a copy of the link.<br>
<br>
Many of the people that post on this particular board are knowledgeable fly casters and fly fishers. We all share information and help each other as often as we can. Networking is a powerful learning tool. Even as knowledgeable as they are they all have room for improvement. That includes myself. Troy is someone who's opinion I trust and who's knowledge is diverse. I saw Tiger Woods (the golfer) taking a golf lesson the other day. It certianly wouldn't bother me to take a casting lesson from Troy (or Chuck, or Al, or Mark, or Drew, or Jimmy, or a whole list of others from this site).<br>
<br>
Too many fly fishers are afraid to ask for advise from others. I've guided the White for decades but it wouldn't bother me to ask a guy what he's doing if he's catching fish and I'm not. Learning is a never ending process. The more I learn the more I realize how little I actually know.<br>

I had a get together in Cotter on the White. John came in and donated his time and did some class work with us. If he gives you advice, you can take it as gospel. I wish I knew Troy, but if John concurs with what Troy says,...well it has to be good. I think you'll find this board to be very helpful. I am on another board quite a bit, but think I will spend more time here. I saw John work with children of a friend of mine and afterwords, the 17 year old went out and actually managed to land a few fish. He helped me alot as I had been off the water for 4 years due to a medical situation. Anywayz...I'm getting longwinded. Troy...I would definitely like to meet you at the conclave. John...as usual you show what a class gentleman you are. Toni...welcome to the board and I hope you find what you are looking for. If not at the conclave, then hopefully from the sound advice you've been given here.<br>

Maddog -- I think I'll be working the casting ponds some (if and when Chuck needs me), and I may be helping out on a workshop that Tom Jindra is doing.  Other than that, I hope to cast some of the latest and greatest rods coming out, and do some fishing as well.  I want to find some new water on both the White and the Norfork that I have not fished before.  Too many times, I hit the same old spots because they always produce.  I need a change of venue...<br>

If you do set up a school as you mentioned in your first post of this thread, and would like some help teaching, please let me know.  I'd love to add another excuse to my list of reasons to jump in the car and head to Mt. Home!  I can teach knot tying, fly tying, equipment selection, on-water strategies/techniques for warm water, cold water, and salt water, even some &quot;destination&quot; stuff like South America, Alaska, Canada, Carribean, UK, Scandanavia, etc.  Maybe even some casting.<br>

Hopefully we'll run into each other this weekend.  I'm leaving tomorrow for Mtn Home.  I had the chance to hang out with John and Jimmy and other's last Saturday and should have stayed around for Sunday but had other things to take care of.  I also could kick myself for not getting a heavy critique from John of my own casting while I was there.  Actually, I should have done that months ago.  My confidence was sagging a little after trying to do the &quot;snake roll&quot; and watching John do everything but &quot;walk the dog&quot; with a flyrod.  John is the real deal.  Bloody 'ell, indeed!<br>
