i used to work with two guys who were never circumised as infants. they told me they wished they were. they said its a pain to clean the foreskin. plus they said most women they have been with hate it.<br>
<br>
i wont even going into the women mutiliation thing.<br>
<br>
i think its down right stupid to deny anyone medical care because of religious beliefs. my last 2 babies were high risk. with both pregnancies i had aminos every two weeks and with the last one she had inutero blood transfusions through me. my sister said if it was up to her she would have left her in Gods hands. well, if i would have left in Gods hands i wouldnt have my two precious girls right now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whanda>Whanda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/28/03 2:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How far should it extend?</span><hr size=1> Just for the record, I have no doubt that many parents choose circ because they believe it will be in the best interest of their child.  My first two sons are circumcized in fact.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> A blind man would know he was missing sight if he could remember a time he was sighted. If he were blind from birth or lost his vision early enough, he may well not know what sight was.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But surely he wouldn't figure that those people who did have sight and tried to explain to him had no idea what they were talking about would he?  He may not be able to fully understand what it is that he's missing (and, just so this isn't taken wrong, be able to still lead a very fulfilling life), but certainly they could realize that they are missing something.<br>
<br>
Same with the foreskin.  It his full of nerves and blood vessels and removing it does change how the penis functions.  I think it is self evident that removing this type of tissue does change things.  Less nerves, less information making's it's way too and from the brain = different experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What I did know was that my family has a history of priapism and when my nephews were born, they weren't circ'd and it ended up being very painful and they ultimately had to be cut when they were older. When it is done later on there is a great deal more pain and likelyhood of complications. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
First, I looked into priapism and cannot see how it is related to circumcision.  I did not see it mentioned as either a cure or a prophylactic measure.  Perhaps you were simply mentioning that along witht he fact your nephews had pain, and that their pain was caused by something unrelated to priapsim?  From the other details you gave in a later post that may be the case, as that didn't sound like priapism.  I'd would be interested in further explanation, as I noticed you mentioned you'd be willing to discuss this issue further if anyone is interested.<br>
<br>
Also, I have to also argue that the only reason we think it is easier on babies than older isn't because babies aren't  hurting or trying to tell us, it's because we aren't sensitive enough to how they communicate to notice.  They can't use words to talk about it like older children and adults can.  And every experience a child has shapes their development.  Just becuase they do not have a memory of it in the way we would recognize as a &quot;memory&quot; does not mean it had no effect on them.<br>
<br>
I maintain my position that even if it is not always evident on the surface, the real reason behind circumcision is still cultural, not medical, and that there are other more sane treatments for almost every condition of any part of the body than amputation in most (not all) cases, foreskin being no exception.<br>
<br>
TIA if you'd be willing to continue to discuss this.<br>
