It was becoming more and more definate by the second how badly the White Chocolate Army were going to lose this war. The dark would have control by the end of tomorrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;'tis been too long, Jocie,&quot; said the chocolate leader, giving her old friend a quick hug. &quot;And, I suppose we could use another good soldier like yourself. Why not?&quot; she added, winking.<br>
<br>
It wasn't a moment later when the next recruit came down the dark, spiral staircase. Revealing herself to be Jena Skye. For a moment the younger Kerri felt quite sheepish. All of her old rolemodels coming to serve under her own command, but the power was much to great to leave her speechless for long. &quot;I agree, Jena. And it's a pleasure to have you aboard.&quot; Returning the handshake.<br>
<br>
The next recruit was most definately the strangest one however.<br>
<br>
&quot;Reverand Moose, calm yourself!&quot; Kerri yelled, staring at him fiercely. &quot;You're idea is obsered, as well as this invention that you have there. It will not do.&quot; Taking a few moments to study what he said, when a small, evil smile arose on her face. &quot;But it just might do. It just might do.&quot; Her mind turning and turning with ideas, the leader turned to address her troops. &quot;Brave soldiers of the Dark Chocolate Kingdom, the war starts tomorrow at dawn. We will go to the top of our castle at our command points with catapults and dark chocolate. Loading the chocolate into the catapults, we fire! Covering them and their fortress with chocolate! Take warning however, troops, their walls are high, so aim high. Maybe try breaking through a brick or two first to fire. And remember, make every shot count. No reason to waste dark chocolate now, is there?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You may all go to your bed quarters on the second floor. I will be waiting to see if any new recruits decide to join our powerful forces. Good night.&quot; <p><i>"I do not know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody."<i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCC0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ureverandmoose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reverand Moose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One Crazy MO-fo</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#000000>(8/19/02 12:45:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Chocolate, Future Ruler of the World</span><hr size=1> &quot;Aight!

Tomorrow we take the hill.  I am Reverand Moose, and before me, I see a whole army of my countrymen here to battle the White side. Ay, fight and you may die, run and you'll live. At least a while.

Battles that will change the course of history. <p><font color=red>There i was in Dinang. Knee deep in a rice patty.  Leaches the size of frisbees on my neck.  Ole m16 over my head.

It was all the same - yucky, sticky, and when she ate it, everywhere. There had been a chocolate war before, in the dark ages. Rhy had tried to avoid this war but it had found her - the forces and sauces of chocolate. Ah, but the question remained - which side should she join?At last she made up her mind, after sampling a large bar of Dairy Milk (just to help her make up her mind of course!) . Dark chocolate it would be!<br>
<br>
Rhy entered the castle wearing a blue cloak with a large hood. It looked innocent enough but witin its deep pockets lay many bars of the dark substance that this war was being fought over. <br>
<br>
Finding a room full of friends and fellow soldiers, she announced herself by saying,<br>
<br>
&quot;Think dark chocolate, sleep dark chocolate...EAT dark chocolate!&quot;<br>
<br>
With this, she began fishing the bar of choclate out of her robes and handing them around.<br>

Her choices had been to take either this one or the with the patch on the left knee...and there was no way she would have been caught dead in that.  Her nice robe she had, unfortunately, set on fire while experimenting with her new skill...that one wasn't quite ready to be worn anywhere either.  So she had done the best she could remembering to pin her hair back in the beautiful clip Arnie had given her...no one would ever need to know she was poor.  Someday, if she had her way no one would ever guess...success and power, someday...someday.  <br>
<br>
She would have been riding her broom except it was busy enough carrying a cauldron she had filled with dark chocolate after a bit of transfiguration.  The tapping of her footsteps noise grew closer and closer to the large solid door that had edged its way closed as she had come towards it.  Almost there Amber traded her trot into a full run the smile fading from her face in concentration.  Swinging up onto broom she gave the door a good kick with one foot to open it as she let the other slide down the broom until it rested right before the handle of the cauldron.  As she swept into the room she kicked back so the cauldron slid off to land on the floor as she took her seat on her broom.  Circling the room once she ducked down to grab a piece of chocolate from her cauldron and then floated on her broom so her head was the same level as the 7th year's were.  The little actress's eyes were even and she watched the room as if she saw it all daily and it was nothing new.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hope you won't mind another one along for the ride,&quot; she said calmly shaking Kerri's hand, &quot;You didn't think I would miss out on this did you?&quot; <p><font color="Cornflowerblue">
