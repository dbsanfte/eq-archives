ACCEPTING YOUR ASSIGNMENT<br>
<br>
We are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.  Ephesians 2:10<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  Service is not optional.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What’s holding me back from accepting God’s call to serve him?<br>
<br>
You are here to make a difference by serving God and others.  This is God’s fourth purpose for your life.  Whenever you serve others, in any way, you are actually serving God, and fulfilling one of his purposes for creating you.  We weren’t placed on earth just to breathe, eat, take up space, and have fun.  God fashioned each of us to make a unique contribution with our lives.<br>
<br>
God redeemed you for the purpose of doing his holy work.  You’re not saved by service but you are saved for service.  In God’s kingdom, you have a place, a purpose, a role, and a function to fulfill.  This gives your life great significance and value.  Once saved, God intends to use you for his goals.  God has a ministry for you in his body, and a mission for you in the world.<br>
<br>
It is he who saved us and chose us for his holy work not because we deserved it but because that was his plan. II Timothy 1:9 LB<br>
<br>
Jesus said, “Your attitude must be like my own, for I, the Messiah, did not come to be served, but to serve and to give my life.”  Matthew 20:27-28 LB<br>
<br>
For Christians, service is not optional, something to be tacked on to our schedules if we can spare the time.  It is the heart of the Christian life.  Jesus came to serve and to give – and those two verbs should define your life on earth, too.  Serving and giving sum up God’s fourth purpose for your life.<br>
<br>
Wonderful God help me remember today that I was put on earth to serve you by serving others.  Thank you for the privilege of being a part of what you are doing through your church in the world.<br>

SHAPED FOR SERVING GOD<br>
<br>
God works through different people in different ways, but it is the same God who achieves his purpose through them all.  I Corinthians 12:6 PH<br>
<br>
You are God’s hand crafted work of art.  You are not an assembly-line product, mass produced without thought.  You are a custom designed, on-of-a-kind, original masterpiece.  God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique.  Not only did God shape you before your birth, he planned every day of your life to support his shaping process.  This means nothing that happens in your life is insignificant.  God uses all of it to mold you for your ministry to others, and shape you for your service to him.<br>
<br>
How God Shapes You for Your Ministry<br>
<br>
God never wastes anything.  He would not give you abilities, interests, talents, gifts, personality, and life experiences unless he intended to use them for his glory.  By identifying and understanding these factors you can discover God’s will for your life.  The Bible says you are wonderfully complex.  You’re a combination of many different factors.  Five important factors form the acrostic “S.H.A.P.E.”  When God decided to create you, he determined exactly what you would need for your unique service.  This custom combination of capabilities is called your Shape.<br>
<br>
Spiritual gifts<br>
Heart<br>
Abilities<br>
Personality<br>
Experience<br>
<br>
Spiritual gifts.  God gives every believer spiritual gifts to be used in ministry.  These are special God empowered abilities for serving him.  You can’t earn your spiritual gifts.  They are an expression of God’s grace to you.  Neither do you get to choose which gifts you’d like to have.  God receives all the gifts.  Your spiritual gifts were given for the benefit of others, just as other people were given gifts for your benefit.  When we use our gifts together, we all benefit.  This is why we’re commanded to discover and develop our spiritual gifts.<br>
<br>
Heart.  The Bible uses the term “heart” to describe the bundle of desires, hopes, interests, ambitions, dreams, and affections that you have.  Your heart represents the source of all your motivations – what you love to do and what you care about most.  Your emotional heartbeat is the second key to understanding your shape for service.  When you serve God from your heart, you serve with enthusiasm and effectiveness.  Figure out what you love to do – that which God gave you a heart for – and then do it for his glory!<br>
<br>
We are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works.  Ephesians 2:10<br>
<br>
God you are an amazing Creator.  Thank you for all your attention to the details in my life.  Thank you for shaping me to serve you in a way that no one else can.<br>

UNDERSTANDING YOUR SHAPE<br>
<br>
God has given each of you come special abilities; be sure to use them to help each other, passing on to others God’s many kinds of blessings.  I Peter 4:10 LB<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  Nobody else can be me.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What God given ability or personal experience could I offer to my church?<br>
<br>
Abilities.  Your abilities are the natural talents that you were born with.  Some people have a natural ability with words.  Other people have natural athletic abilities, excelling in physical coordination.  Still others are good at mathematics or music or mechanics.<br>
<br>
To apply your abilities in service, you need to understand four truths.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All of our abilities came from God.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every ability can be used for God’s glory.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What I’m able to do, God wants me to do.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If I don’t use them, I’ll lose them.<br>
<br>
Personality.  God created each of us with a unique combination of personality traits.  God made introverts and extroverts.  He made people who love routine and those who love variety.  He made some people thinkers and others feelers.  Some people work best when given an individual assignment, while others work better with a team.  There is no right or wrong temperament for ministry.  We need all kinds of personalities to balance the church and give it flavor.<br>
<br>
God works through different people in different ways, but it is the same God who achieves his purpose through them all.  I Corinthians 12:6  PH<br>
<br>
Experiences.  You have shaped been shaped by your experiences in life, most of which were beyond your control.  God allowed them for his purpose of molding you.  In determining your shape for serving God there are at least six kinds of experiences you should examine from your past: family experiences, educational experiences, vocational experiences, spiritual experiences, ministry experiences, and painful experiences.  It is this last category that God uses the most to prepare you for ministry.  In fact, your greatest ministry will most likely come out of your greatest hurt.  The very experiences that you have resented or regretted most in your life are the things God intends to use to help others!<br>
<br>
Gracious Father, I want you to use all the experiences that have shaped my life – both good and bad – for your glory.  I am so grateful that you can even use the mistakes and failures of my life.  Help me to help others the way you’ve helped me.<br>

USING WHAT GOD GAVE YOU<br>
<br>
Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.  II Timothy 2:16<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  God deserves my best.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  How could I make the best use of what God has given me?<br>
<br>
The best use of your life is to serve God out of your shape.  To do this you must discover, accept, enjoy, and develop the shape he’s given you.<br>
<br>
God wants you to discover your unique shape.  Start finding out and clarifying what God intends for you to be and do.  First, assess your gifts and abilities.  Next, consider your heart and your personality.  Third, examine your experiences and extract the lessons you’ve learned.<br>
<br>
God wants you to accept your shape.  Since God lovingly shaped you, and he knows what’s best, you should gratefully accept the way he’s fashioned you.  Your shape was sovereignly determined by God for his purpose, so you shouldn’t resent it or reject it.  Instead you should celebrate the shape God has given only to you.  Part of accepting your shape is recognizing your limitations.  Nobody is good at everything and no one is called to be everything.  We each have defined roles.<br>
<br>
Since we find ourselves fashioned into all these excellently formed and marvelously functioning parts in Christ’s body, let’s just go ahead and be what we were made to be.  Romans 12:5 MSG<br>
<br>
God wants you to enjoy your shape.  Satan tries to rob our joy with two temptations that will prevent you from enjoying the shape.  God gave you the temptation to compare your ministry to others, and the temptation to conform your ministry to the expectations of others.  If you compare your shape, your ministry, or the results of your ministry with anyone else, you’ll either get discouraged or you’ll get full of pride.  Either attitude will take you out of service and rob your job.<br>
<br>
Be sure to do what you should, for then you will enjoy the personal satisfaction of having done your work well.  Galatians 6:4 NLT<br>
<br>
God wants you to develop your shape.  God expects us to make the most of what he gives us.  We are to cultivate our gifts and abilities, keep our hearts aflame, grow our character and personality, and broaden our experiences so we will be increasingly more effective in our service.  Remember you’re going to serve God forever in eternity.  Right now, you can prepare for that ministry by practicing here on earth.  Never forget that we’re getting ready for eternal responsibilities and rewards.  This is why, like Olympic athletes, we keep training and developing.<br>
<br>
Kindle afresh the gift of God which is  in you.  II Timothy 1:6 NASB<br>
<br>
Lord, you deserve my best.  Help me to be creative in making the most of what you’ve given me.  I want to spend my life serving you.<br>

HOW REAL SERVANTS ACT<br>
<br>
If you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers, you will surely be rewarded.  Matthew 10:42 NLT<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: I serve God by serving others.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Real servants make themselves available to serve; pay attention to needs, do their best with what they have; do every task with equal dedication; and are faithful to the task they have been given.  Which of the five characteristics of real servants is the most challenging for me?<br>
While knowing your shape is important for serving God, having the heart of a servant is even more important.  Real servants make themselves available to serve.  A servant must always be standing by for duty.  Being a servant means giving up the right to control your schedule, and allowing God to interrupt it whenever he needs to.  Real servants pay attention to needs.  They are always on the lookout for ways to help others.  When they see a need, they seize the moment to meet it.  Since we find ourselves fashioned into all those excellently formed and marvelously functioning parts in Christ’s body, let’s just go ahead and be what we were made to be (Romans 12:5 MSG).<br>
<br>
Real servants do the best they can with what they have.  They don’t make excuses, procrastinate, or wait for better circumstances.  They just do what needs to be done.  God expects you to serve him with whatever you have, wherever you are, right now.  Real servants do every task with equal dedication.  They follow the instructions found in Colossians 3:23, Whatever you do, work as if with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men.<br>
<br>
Jesus specialized in menial tasks that everyone else tried to avoid.  Nothing was beneath him because he came to serve.  It wasn’t in spite of his greatness that he did these things, but because of it, and he expects us to follow his example.<br>
<br>
Put on the apron of humility, to serve one another. I Peter 5:5 TEV<br>
<br>
Real servants are faithful to their ministry.  They finish their tasks, fulfill their responsibilities, keep their promises, and complete their commitments.  They don’t leave a job half done and they don’t quit when they get discouraged.  They are trustworthy and dependable.  Real servants maintain a low profile.  They don’t promote or call attention to themselves.  If recognized for their service, they humbly accept it, but don’t allow notoriety to distract them from their work.  Real servants don’t serve for the approval or applause of others.  They live for an audience of One.<br>
<br>
Jesus, today I make myself available to be used by you to serve others in your name.  I want to spend my life in serving you.<br>

THINKING LIKE A SERVANT<br>
<br>
Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.  Philippians 2:5<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  To be a servant I must think like a servant.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Am I usually more concerned about being served or finding ways to serve others?<br>
<br>
To be a servant you must think like a servant.  God is always more interested in why we do something than in what we do.  Real servants are self-forgetful.  They focus on others, not themselves.  This is what it means to lose your life -- forgetting yourself in service to others.  You can’t be a servant if you’re full of yourself.  It’s only when we forget ourselves that we do the things that deserve to be remembered.<br>
<br>
Real servants think like stewards, not owners.  They remember God owns it all.  In the Bible, a steward was a servant entrusted to manage an estate.  Servant-hood and stewardship go together since God expects us to be trustworthy in both.  The Bible says, The one thing required of such servants that they be faithful to their master (I Corinthians 4:2 TEV).  Teal servants think about their own responsibilities, not what other servants are doing.  They don’t compare, criticize, or compete with other servants or ministries.  They’re too busy doing the work God has given them.  Real servants don’t complain of unfairness, don’t have pity parties, and don’t resent those not serving.  They just trust God and keep serving.<br>
<br>
Real servants base their identity in Christ.  They remember they are unconditionally loved and accepted by grace so they don’t have to prove their worth and they aren’t threatened by lowly jobs.  One of the most profound examples of serving from a secure self-image is Jesus washing the feet of his disciples.  Real servants think of ministry as an opportunity, not an obligation.  They enjoy helping people, meeting needs, and doing ministry.  They serve the Lord with gladness (Psalm 100:2 KJV).  God will use you if you’ll begin to act and think like a servant.<br>
<br>
Father, help me to do what I can, with what I have, for you today.  Help me not compare or compete with others who serve you.  Help me focus solely on what you’ve called me to do.<br>

GOD’D POWER IN YOUR WEAKNESS<br>
<br>
The Lord said, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”  II Corinthians 12:9<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: God works best in weakness.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Am I limiting god’s power in my life by trying to hide my weaknesses?  What do I need to be honest about in order to help others.<br>
<br>
God will use us if we allow him to work through our weaknesses.  For this to happen, we must follow the model of Paul.<br>
<br>
Admit your weaknesses.  Own up to your imperfections.  Be honest about yourself.  There are two great confessions in the New Testament.  The first was Peter’s, who said to Jesus, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matthew 16:16).  The second was Paul’s, who said to an idolizing crowd, “We are only human beings like you” (Acts 14:15 NCV).<br>
<br>
Be grateful for your weaknesses.  Gratitude is an expression of faith in the goodness of God.  It says, “God, I believe you love me, and know what’s best for me.”  Paul gives us several reasons to be grateful for our inborn weaknesses.  First, they cause us to depend on God.  Our weaknesses also prevent arrogance.  They encourage fellowship between believers.  Most of all, our weaknesses increase our capacity for sympathy and ministry.  God wants you to have a Christ-like ministry on earth.  That means other people are going to find healing in your wounds.  Your greatest life messages and your most effective ministry will come out of your deepest hurts.<br>
<br>
Honestly share your weaknesses.  Ministry begins with vulnerability.  Paul openly shared his failures, his feelings, his frustrations, and his fears.  Of course when you open up your life to others, you risk rejection.  But the benefits are worth the risk.  Vulnerability is the pathway to intimacy.  This is why God wants to use your weaknesses, not just your strengths. If all people see are your strengths, they get discouraged and think, “Well good for her, but I’ll never be able to do that.”  But when they see God using you in spite of your weaknesses, it encourages them to think, “Maybe God could use me!”<br>
<br>
We are weak . . . yet by God’s power we will live with him to serve you.  II Corinthians 13:4<br>
<br>
I am with you; that is all you need.  My power shows up best in weak people.  II Corinthians 12:9 LB<br>
<br>
Glory in your weaknesses.  Instead of posing as self-confident and invincible, see yourself as a trophy of grace.  When Satan points out your weaknesses, agree with him and fill your heart with praise for Jesus who understands every weakness of ours (Hebrews 4:14 CEV) and for the Holy Spirit who helps us in our weakness (Romans 8:26).  God is never limited by our limitations.<br>
<br>
Father, use my weakness to show your glory.  Let my weaknesses cause me to depend on you completely.  Let my life be an example of what you can do through ordinary people who are yielded to you.<br>
<br>

MADE FOR A MISSION<br>
<br>
Jesus said, “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.  And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”  Matthew 28:19-20<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  I was made for a mission.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What fears have kept me from fulfilling the mission God made me to accomplish?  What keeps me from telling others of the Good News?<br>
<br>
Your mission - - introducing people to God - - is the fifth purpose of your life.  There are a number of reasons why you need to take this mission seriously.  Jesus commands us to continue his mission.  The Great Commission was not given to pastors but to every follower of Jesus.  You are the only Christian some people will ever know and your mission is to share Jesus with them.  Your mission is a great privilege.  Although it is a profound responsibility, it is also an incredible honor to be used by God.<br>
<br>
Your mission is the greatest thing you can do for someone.  We have the greatest news in the world and sharing it is the greatest kindness you can show to anyone.  Your mission has eternal significance.  Nothing else you do will ever matter as much as helping people establish an eternal relationship with God.  Your mission gives your life meaning.  If just one person will be in heaven because of you, your life cannot be considered a failure.  God’s timetable for history’s conclusion is connected to the completion of the commission we’ve been given.  Jesus will not return until everyone he wants to hear the God News has heard it. <br>
<br>
The most important thing is that I complete my mission, the work that the Lord Jesus gave me.  Acts 20:24 NCV<br>
<br>
Completing your mission will bring glory to God.  The night before he was crucified Jesus reported to his Father, “I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do” (john 17:4).  Will you be able to say that at the end of your life?  God blesses the life dedicated to his kingdom.  The secret of being blessed by God is to participate in his agenda for the world, to be a part of what he is accomplishing on earth.<br>
<br>
Father, thank you for the privilege of being a part of you plan for the world.  I want you to use me to bring others into your family for eternity.  Help me to reach even more people for Jesus.<br>

SHARING YOUR LIFE MESSAGE<br>
<br>
Be ready at all times to answer anyone who asks you to explain the hope you have in you, but do it with gentleness and respect. I Peter 3:15-16 TEV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: God wants to say something to the world through me.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider: As I reflect on my personal story, who would God want me to share it with?<br>
<br>
There are four parts to the life message God has put within you: God wants you to share your testimony.  The essence of witnessing is simply reporting your personal experiences with the Lord.  In a courtroom, a witness isn’t expected to argue the case, prove the truth, or press for a verdict; that is the job of attorneys.  Witnesses just tell what happened to them.  Jesus said, “You will be my witnesses” (Acts 1:8), not “You must be my attorney.”  Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony of God in them (I John 5:10GW).<br>
<br>
God wants you to share your life lessons.  The second part of your life message are the truths that God has taught you from experiences with him.  These are lessons about God, relationships, problems, temptations, and other aspects of life.  Write down the major life lessons you’ve learned so you can share them with others.  We should be grateful Solomon did this because it gave us the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, which are filled with practical lessons on living.<br>
<br>
A warning given by an experienced person to someone willing to listen is more valuable than … jewelry made of the finest gold.  Proverbs 28:12 TEV<br>
<br>
God wants you to share your godly passions.  God is a passionate God.  He passionately loves some things and passionately hates other things.  As you grow closer to him, he’ll give you a passion for something he cares about deeply so you can be a spokesman for him in the world.  It may be a passion about a problem, a purpose, a principle, or a group of people.  Whatever it is, you’ll feel compelled to speak up about it and do what you can to make a difference.<br>
<br>
A man’s heart determines his speech.  Matthew 12:34 LB<br>
<br>
There is no fear in love; perfect love dries out all fear.  I John 4:18 TEV<br>
<br>
God wants you to share the Good News.  We must care about unbelievers because God does.  Love leaves no choice.  A parent will run into a burning building to save a child because their love for that child is greater than their fear.  If you’ve been afraid to share the Good News with those around you, ask God to fill your heart with his love for them.  As long as you know one person who doesn’t know Christ, you must keep praying for them, serving them in love, and sharing the Good News.  When you became a believer you also became God’s messenger.<br>
<br>
Lord, give me the courage to speak the unique Life Message you’ve given to me.  Help me to break out of my comfort zone so you can speak through me.  Put someone in my path today so that I can share your message.<br>
<br>

BECOMING A WORLD CLASS CHRISTIAN<br>
<br>
Send us around the world with the news of your saving power and your eternal plan for all mankind.  Psalm 87:2 LB<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  The Great Commission is my commission.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What steps could I take to prepare to go on a short term missions experience in the next year?<br>
<br>
World-class Christians know they were saved to serve, and made for a mission.  They’re eager to receive a personal assignment and excited about the privilege of being used by God.  Their joy, confidence, and enthusiasm is contagious because they know they’re making a difference.<br>
<br>
Jesus said to is followers, “Go everywhere in the world, and tell the Good News to everyone.”  Mark 18:18 NCv<br>
<br>
How to Think Like a World Class Christian<br>
<br>
Shift from self-centered to other centered thinking.  This is a difficult mental shift because we’re naturally self-absorbed.  The only way we can make this paradigm switch is by a moment-by-moment dependence on God.<br>
<br>
Don’t think only about your own affairs, but be interested in others, too.  Philippians 2:4 NLT<br>
<br>
Shift from local to global thinking.  From the beginning God has wanted family members from every nation he created.  The first way to start thinking globally is to begin praying for specific countries.  Get a glob or map and pray for nations by name.  Another way is to read and watch the news with “Great Commission Eyes.”  Wherever there is a change or conflict, you can be sure that God will use it to bring people to him.  The best way is to just get up and go on a short-term mission project to another country!  There’s simply no substitute for hands-on, real-life experience in another culture.<br>
<br>
Shift from temporal to eternal thinking.  To make the most of your time on earth you must maintain an eternal perspective.  This will keep you from focusing on minor issues and help you distinguish between what’s urgent and what’s ultimate.  So much of what we waste our energy on will not matter even a year from now, much less for eternity.  Don’t trade your life for temporary things.  What are you allowing to stand in the way of your mission?  What’s keeping you from being a world-class Christian?  Whatever it is, let it go.  <br>
<br>
Let us strip off anything that slows us down or holds us back.  Hebrews 12:1 LB<br>
<br>
Send us around the world with the news of your saving power and your eternal plan for all mankind.  Psalm 67:2 LB<br>
<br>
Shift from thinking of excuses to thinking of creative ways to fulfill your commission.  If you want to be like Jesus, you must care about what he cares about most; you must have a heart for the whole world!  You can’t be satisfied with just your family and friends coming to Christ.  There are over six billion people on earth and Jesus wants all his lost children found.  The Great Commission is your commission, and doing your part is the secret to living a life of significance.<br>
<br>
Father, I want to care about the whole world the way you do.  Let my heart be moved by the billions who have yet to hear the Good News of your love.  I accept the Great Commission as my commission.  Here I am, send me.<br>

BALANCING YOUR LIFE<br>
<br>
Love life with a due sense of responsibility, not as those who do not know the meaning of life but as those who do.  Ephesians 5:15 PH<br>
<br>
Point To Ponder:  Blessed are the balanced.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider: Which of the four activities will I use to stay on track and balance God’s five purposes in my life?<br>
<br>
Expression:  Talk it through with a spiritual partner or small group.  The best way to internalize the principles of purpose driven living is to discuss them with others in a small group setting.  The Bible says, As iron sharpens iron, so people can improve each other (Proverbs 27:17 NCV).  We learn best in community.  Talk through the implications and the applications of each chapter.<br>
<br>
Evaluation:  Give yourself a regular spiritual check-up.  The best way to balance the five purposes in your life is to evaluate yourself regularly.  God places a high value on the habit of self-evaluation.  At least five times in Scripture we’re told to test and examine our own spiritual health.  To do this you need to regularly check the five vital signs of worship, fellowship, character growth, ministry, and mission.<br>
<br>
Let’s take a good look at the way we’re living and reorder our lives under God.  Lamentations 3:40 MSG<br>
<br>
Reflection:  Write down your progress in a journal.  The best way to reinforce your progress in fulfilling God’s purposes for your life is to keep a spiritual journal.  Remember, this is not a diary of events, but a record of the lessons you don’t want to forget.  We remember what we record.  Writing helps clarify what God is doing in your life.  Your life is a journey, and a journey deserves a journal.  You owe it to future generations to preserve the testimony of how God helped you fulfill his purposes on earth.  It is a witness that will continue to speak long after you’re in heaven.<br>
<br>
Now I want you to tell these same things to followers who can be trusted to tell others.  II Timothy 2:2 CEV<br>
<br>
Replication:  Pass on what you learn to others.  The best way to learn more is to pass on what you’ve already learned.  Those who pass on insights receive more from God.  Now that you understand the purpose of life, it’s your responsibility to carry the message to others.  You probably know hundreds of people who do not know the purpose of life.  Share these truths with your children, friends, neighbors, and those you work with.<br>
<br>
Passing on the purpose of life is more than an obligation; it’s one of life’s greatest privileges.  Who will you share this message with?  <br>
<br>
Jesus, now that I know your five purposes for my life, I ask you to help me balance them.  Don’t let me overemphasize one of  them to the neglect of the others.<br>

LIVING WITH PURPOSE<br>
<br>
David…served the purpose of God in his own generation.  Acts: 13:38 NASB<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: Living with purpose is the only way to really live.<br>
<br>
Question To Consider:  When will I take the time to write down my answers to life’s five great questions?  When will I put my purpose on paper?<br>
There are many good things you can do with your life, but God’s purposes are the five essentials you must do.  You should commit the rest of your life to doing them.  Unfortunately, it’s easy to get distracted and forget what matters most.  This is why it is important to develop a purpose statement for your life, one that you can review regularly.  A life purpose statement states the direction of your life, summarizes God’s purposes for your life, defines success for you, expresses your shape, and clarifies your roles.<br>
<br>
Life’s Five Greatest Questions<br>
<br>
What will be the center of my life?  This is the question of worship.  What are you going to build your life around?  You can center your life around your career, your family, or many other good things, but none is strong enough to hold you together when life starts spinning apart.  You need an unshakable center.<br>
<br>
What will be the character of my life?  This is the question of discipleship.  What kind of person will you be?  God is far more interested in what you are than what you do.  Remember, you’ll take your character into eternity, not your career.<br>
<br>
What will be the contribution of my life?  This is the question of service, knowing what your combination of spiritual gifts, heart, abilities, personality, and experiences are, what would be your best role in the family of God?  Is there a specific group in the body that I am shaped to serve?<br>
<br>
What will be the communication of my life?  This is the question of your mission to unbelievers.  Your mission statement should include any commitment to share your testimony and the Good News with others, the life lessons and godly passions God has given you, and the special group of people God has appointed you to reach.<br>
<br>
We beg you, please don’t squander one bit of this marvelous life God has given us.  II Corinthians 6:1 MSG<br>
<br>
What will be the community of my life?  This is the question of fellowship.  How will I demonstrate my commitment to other believers and my connection to the family of God?  Where will I practice the “one another” commands with other Christians?  To which church family will I be joined as a functioning member?  The more you grow in Christ, the more you’ll love his body and want to sacrifice for it.  You can begin living a purpose driven life today.<br>
<br>
Dear God, I commit the rest of my life to serving your purposes in my generations-anywhere, anytime, anyway.  Help me to spread the message in others so they can become what you made them to be.<br>
<br>
Anyone who is joined to Christ is a new being; the old is gone, the new has come.  II Corinthians 6:17 GNT<br>
