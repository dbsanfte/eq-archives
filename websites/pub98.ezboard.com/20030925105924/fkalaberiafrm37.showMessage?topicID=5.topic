<br>
Vincent de DarkFang.<br>
Calls himself Guy. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Age</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
36.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Profession</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
Hunter of the Supernatural<br>
<br>
Height:<br>
<br>
6’0<br>
 <br>
Personality:<br>
<br>
Vincent is the type of person who will follow laws, as long as they aid him in the long-run.  He has been known to ‘bend’ the rules to achieve his goals, and has even killed any who got in his way, no matter how innocent.  Although once a kind and loving man, the murder of his family drove him to near-insanity, causing the occasional hunt for sport or to protect his family, to something that his life is devoted to.  The distinction between the werewolf fighting alongside the humans and the vampires feeding off of both is unseen by him, making anything that is not human his enemy.<br>
<br>
Description:<br>
<br>
Vincent’s hair is blonde and falls to his shoulders, worn in the fashion that a noble would have, a shard of his broken past.  His face could be described as highly-structured, and seems to carry traces of a forgotten charisma that is now covered by rough stubble and nearly soulless eyes.  Once smiling lips have been transformed into a cold grimace, .  His bangs are parted, revealing his many scars.  A slightly-visible scar ranges from his upper left eyebrow to his cheekbone, running in a diagonal line on the left side of Vincent’s face.  This is one of many scars riddling his body.  Gashes, cuts, and bruises cover his body, wounds that are both recent and remnants of forgotten battles.  A long black billowing trenchcoat seems to sweep his body’s shadows as he walks, dotted with small traces of blood that lead to a stained corner that hovers a few inches above the floor. <br>
<br>
Equipment:<br>
<br>
Vincent wields a variety of weapons, varying from the common stake to a silver blade.  In former days people would have seen him as a walking arsenal, now it seems it is more of the standard Hunter gear.  Three stakes are strapped onto the left inner side of his coat, tightly suspended above a partially concealed dagger, while a canteen of holy water is strapped to the right.  Also on the right side of his coat is a simple pistol, decades older than the pistols that were commonly produced.  Carried in a simple sheath attached to the back of his coat is his oldest weapon, a strangely fashioned katana with silver edges.  The hilt of the blade is decorated as many are, but rather than the popular dragon carvings or the traditional wrap, it is carved of cherrywood and fashioned into a howling demon.  Fangs detail the end of the hilt, giving it the impression of a beast lunging at the sky when sheathed.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Evelyn’s Amulet</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Vincent wears the amulet of Evelyn, his wife, around his neck as a symbol of his undying love, although now misguided, as well a severe reminder of his inability to protect her.  Although it serves no magical ailment, it is more of a spiritural keepsake than a typical amulet.  The amulet is silver in color, and is hung upon a light platinum chain.  The only hands that have ever touched it since Evelyn’s death have either belonged to Vincent, or have been found without a body.  There is nothing overly-special about the amulet itself in it’s design, and was given to Evelyn by her mother, who had recieved it while being courted by Evelyn’s father, a poor apprentice gemsmith, who had made it especially for her.  The amulet was stolen by the werewolf who had murdered Evelyn, but Vincent found it on the ground beneath the window that the werewolf escaped from.  A strange feeling compelled Vincent to keep the amulet as a keepsake, rather than bury it with his wife.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Forms</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Vincent was attacked while in a tavern near his family’s estate by a man wielding a strange set of claws, with tips resembling that of a wolf’s.  His face was slashed, and later became slightly infected.  On a full moon a short while later, Vincent transformed into a werewolf, and unknown to him, killed his family and many of his friends.  The ordeal is said to have driven him to insanity, as even though he awakes every full moon in a strange place with his items scattered nearby, he denies the existence of an inner darkness.  As the werewolf grows and becomes stronger, Vincent slowly begins to gain a sense of consciousness while transformed.  Eventually, Vincent may be fully awake, but for now, he is an entirely changed person.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Human</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
Vincent is human every day, and every night except on the eve of the full moon.  While human, he bears no abnormal traits, other than his highly developed tracking<br>
skills.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Werewol</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
As a werewolf, Vincent is at the height of his power, as well as his insanity.  Driven into a primal, berserk rage, he is unable to control himself and commits acts he would never do as a human.  Although he is unable to remember, he often has a dreaded feeling while he sleeps that he has sinned in some way.  His strength, size, and speed are greatly altered in werewolf form, as he is half-wolf, half-human.<br>
<br>
While in werewolf form, Vincent's body is covered in a thick coat of a silverish fur.  His teeth nearly double in size, and become razor-sharp, as have his fingernails..  Due to being a Hunter, he is currently unable to produce the poison coating his fangs and claws that turns a creature into a werewolf.  Rather than their usual blue, his eyes are a deep blood-red and seem to be soulless.  There is no trace of humanity left within him.<br>
<br>
Although it is rumored that werewolves may ascend to a higher level of power, it is unknown to Vincent’s primal side.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Abilities/Strengths</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
For the most part, most of Vincent’s strength’s are hunter-related, beyond that he is similiar to a typical human.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Tracking</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Vincent has a heightened ability to track creatures, and depending on the skill of his prey, usually finds them relatively quickly.  Few details go unnoticed by his eyes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Endurance</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Years as a warrior have hardened both Vincent’s soul as well as his body.  Despite obvious physical gains, his skin and mind has learned to tolerate more blows before succumbing to injury.  His skin has become hard, almost leathered to the touch.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Awareness of Magical Energy</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Due to being a hunter, beings of a high magical essence, or events of high magical productivity, seem to stand out.  Similiar to an enhanced hearing, he can sense them slightly, although as he becomes stronger as a werewolf, his hunting skills can fluctuate.  Towards the night of the full moon, his skills diminish as he claims that his prey is nearby, almost right on top of him so to speak, and many regard it as insanity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Weaknesses</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mortality</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Vincent is a human, more or less anyways.  Therefore, he has the typical strengths and weaknesses a typical human has.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Insanity</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Due to having two souls, one evil, and one wandering between darkness and light, inhabiting one body, as well as the murder of his family, the strain on his mind is incredible.  Before and after the full moon, the full effects of this strain are noted.  He begins to be incoherent, speaking slight gibberish, seeming to be in another plane of existance, all effects are slightly beginning to show.  He is beginning to lose the highly trained persception between good and evil that a hunter of his order was taught as a result.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Rushed Judgement</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Vincent has a bad habit of rushing into battles and arguments without thinking, or considering who or what he is facing.  The line between evil and good has been erased in his mind, leaving only human and unnatural.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Something physical coming here…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
History:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Under Re-Construction</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
((I know it’s not finished but the minor parts, like the History aren’t as important.  I need a physical weakness, I just haven’t figured out a good one yet.  If there was a Beta this would be it.))<br>
