My ds (15 months) doesn't drink a milk bottle.  I still give him formula.  My dh has crohn's disease and he read an article that showed a possible connection. There is a bacteria that isn't killed in pasturization that was always considered harmless, but now they(the infamous they) say that there may be a connection with crohn's disease.  It would only take an extra 20 seconds to kill this bacteria, but the dairy community refuses.  To do go the extra 20 seconds would be admitting that they were selling something unsafe.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  There isn't anyone else in his family that has crohn's so the genetic factor isn't really there for him.  When he was younger and still lived at home they would go through a gallon of milk a day because of him mostly.  So, now he will not take that chance with his ds.  I would still be nursing ds, but he decided that he was done at about 9 1/2 months.  So I put him on formula.  He doesn't even have a bottle all that often and he drinks water most of the time.  While I am on the subject, does anyone know of a good vitamin for infants?  I should be supplementing his diet.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, that is my two cents.<br>

But like I said, I don't follow any of this real close since I've never kept kosher.  I think there is some debate over whether kosher slaughter is more humane.  Many people insist that it is, and many insist that it isn't.  I'd have to look into it more to form a real strong opinion.  I've always read stuff from the Jewish point of view, so that paints kosher slaughter as the most humane method.  I've never read Fast Food Nation or the other source mentioned, so I don't know if those are completely accurate, or if it is a bit of sensationalism.  There seems to be contradicting sources out there.  I want to say that I tend to believe the Jewish sources since they are the experts on the matter, but they may also be trying to paint what they do in a positive light.  To be perfectly honest, I don't pay close enough attention to all this stuff.  I eat veal, and I know that is a no no with animal rights activists.  I'll also eat venison eventhough hunting is a sport that I don't think I could ever do.  I've always said that if it was up to me to hunt my food, then I'd be a vegetarian, lol.  I also won't order lobster in restaurants where you pick out a live one.  I would just feel too bad. But then again, I'm a sap, lol.  <br>
<br>
I'm not positive, but I think slaughter for the Islamic law of halal may be exactly the same as for kosher.  We had an Arab Muslim visit us on the Jewish Families board at BC and she said that where she lives she purchases kosher products in order to follow halal rules.  Where is our resident Muslim?  Kate?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You said, &quot;Calcium is good, the problem is, Dairy is so high in protein that for your body to process it, it ends up correcting the resulting rise in akaline level in your blood by taking calcium OUT of your bones. So you net a calcium LOSS.&quot;<br>
<br>
Is that something specific about dairy or about all protein (as I sit here with my yogurt!)? I have read that high protein in your diet can cause calcium to leach out of your bones, but I would guess that Americans eat a lot more protein in the form of meat than dairy. Would the same leaching effect be true for high meat consumption? Meat generally has a higher amount of protein per serving than does dairy. The milk in my fridge says it has 8 grams of protein per serving and my yogurt says it has 10 grams. I think most meat servings have somewhere around 20 grams per serving...<br>
<br>
The protein thing is something I hear a lot about being vegetarian because a lot of people think that I must have trouble getting protein since I don't eat meat. But really, most Americans from what I have read get way more protein than they actually need. Anyway, I was just curious since I had heard the protein-calcium connection before, but in relation to overall protein consumption and not just for one food group.<br>

In fact I think it would be better to eat dairy protein than meat protein because at least dairy is replacing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>some</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of that calcium the protein is causing you to lose. But it's still a net loss. Anyway, you're probably much better off eating yogurt than sausage, IMO.<br>
<br>
We are a protein obsessed society! People can get by on waaaay less protein and you are getting plenty as a vegetarian. A lot of health problems, including osteoporosis, result from too much protein. You can get enough protein even without dairy. That whole &quot;protein combining&quot; deal (eat rice with beans, etc.) has been completely debunked too. Francis Moore Lapp (who popularized that notion in her book <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Diet for a Small Planet</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) recanted that ages ago. Turns out you just need to eat various whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds but not even in any special combination or in the same meal.<br>
<br>
I was a vegan for a time (about a year) and a vegetarian (ovo-lacto) for 8 years. I found being a vegetarian easy, but being a vegan was difficult. I had to eat a lot of food volume to be satisfied, and I had to eat frequently or I'd space out.  I lost 10 pounds that year and I wasn't even on a regular exercise program. But it was hard to maintain that diet in social situations, restaurants, etc. <br>
<br>
What I disliked most was people's attitudes about it. I hated when people assumed that just because I didn't eat meat, that I was judging them about it. Then they'd try to make themselves feel better by cutting down vegetarianism. I couldn't care less what other people eat. It's none of my business. I get the same kind of flack with breastfeeding. I don't think I'm a better mom just because of breastfeeding, yet I am continually amazed at how defensive people can be about bottle feeding. I think I need a T-shirt that says &quot;You Don't Owe Me Any Explanation.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We keep a strict &quot;Halaal household&quot; lol, which for Muslims only rests on meat and alcohol (we don't have the no meat w/ dairy thing).  In a pinch we will get Kosher meat, like when we visit my parents, but here in Chicago there are a lot of Muslim butchers, so it's not really an issue.<br>
<br>
I've also read a lot about how this means of slaughtering is more humane than the standard procedure here in the US, but again this is from a Muslim viewpoint, so that shouldn't be a surprise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We have the &quot;Feast of the Sacrifice&quot;, Eid al-Adha, which comes after Hajj every year, and the main event for that is to slaughter a sheep in remembrance of Abraham.  Also when you have a child, you're supposed to slaughter a sheep in thanks.  In past years we have done this ourselves, there's a farm outside the city where the proprietors will allow you to go out and slaughter your own sheep/goat.  Recently though we've sent money overseas for it to be done in a community that would get more benefit from the meat.<br>
<br>
There are also a couple of butchers here who will slaughter chickens &quot;while you wait&quot; lol.  You pick your chicken from the group, they grab it and &quot;take care of business&quot; fairly expeditiously.  For many Muslims they are very very particular about making sure the animal is slaughtered &quot;correctly&quot;.. I remember before I got married I was living in a small midwest town, and they had halaal meat in a deep freezer at the mosque that people had slaughtered at a local farm.. only some members were still questioning whether it had been done correctly, so they left the heads on the chickens so you could see the cut.. for someone used to buying her meat in a neat little plastic package, lol, it was a bit of a shock for me.<br>
