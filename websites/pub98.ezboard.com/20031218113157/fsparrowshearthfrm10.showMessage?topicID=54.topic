<br>
Once there were three terminally ill men. <br>
<br>
The kindest gentleman in the world found them living in pasteboard boxes in a dark park in the cold city. <br>
<br>
&quot;Would you like to be well?&quot; he asked them the evening he found them. <br>
<br>
&quot;What's it going to cost me?&quot; asked one. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing. You need to come to my hospital and take my medicine, is all. Otherwise it will cost you your life if you don't. Come! I'll help you into my car.&quot; offered the man. <br>
<br>
The three men gladly took up the kind man's offer and with a lot of help from the gentleman climbed into the vehicle and rode with him to his hospital. <br>
<br>
There were many rooms in the hospital. Some were taken by some very sick people, so sick they had to stay in bed. Some were sitting up, some walking about, some were well and were giving medicine to the others. <br>
<br>
&quot;My medicine will cure you. It is made of things you do not know of or understand. But it will cure you if you take it regularly. But you must choose to take it and to continue to take it. It may not taste good at first, but it will in time if you continue to take it. Always take your medicine.&quot; the good man instructed them. <br>
<br>
The three men shared a room with others who were in different stages of getting well. At first they took the medicine gladly and without complaint. But as they began to feel better, two of them began to complain of its taste and felt they didn't need the medicine anymore. As time went on they began to argue and fight and throw their medicine at each other. Finally, one left, feeling he didn't need the medicine or the hospital or the kind man's help anymore. The other complainer stayed but refused to take his medicine regularly and grumped in a corner with others of the same attitude, throwing their medicine at each other and complaining loudly. <br>
<br>
However, the other one of the three took his medicine at all times, and continued to get better. He consulted with the well ones who ministered the medicine and followed their mature advice with exercise and proper diet. As time went on, he too was able to minister the medicine to others, always grateful that he was given the opportunity to be healed, always rejoicing when it was time for the medicine, always knowing that without it he would become sick again, always helping the others in the room to take their medicine, always longing to see the kindest gentleman in the world again and thank him for his kindness, praise him for his medicine and his hospital, and ask him to let him have supper with him sometime. <br>
<br>
One day the Kindest Gentleman in the World opened the door of the room and came to the man. The man was so grateful and so surprised that he fell on his knees and kissed the Man's feet. Speechless and in awe, he mumbled and groaned and wept, glad that he was privileged to hold on to the feet of the one that had saved him and cured him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come! Let us go to the hospital dining room. I have prepared a feast for you, for you have been faithful.&quot; said the Good Doctor. <br>
<br>
&quot;How have I been faithful?&quot; the humbled man wondered. <br>
<br>
&quot;You believed in me that I could cure you. You took the medicine faithfully. You gave the medicine to others because you wanted them to be well too. You were grateful and thankful. And You longed to see me and be with me. Let us go and dine together and you will have a new place to stay with me.&quot; <br>
<br>
And he lived happily ever after.<br>

<br>
Your story made me think of Jesus washing the feet of His disciples and how today, if we literally asked to wash the feet of another.....well, I wonder how we would be regarded?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :ebr --><img src=http://www.geocities.com/anne_g_ivy/eyebrow.gif ALT=":ebr"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :nvs --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/nervous.gif ALT=":nvs"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Maybe I am a bit unusual, but that image of Jesus washing the feet of his followers is a very powerful one to me and I take quite literally that we should do the same for others when we can.<br>
<br>
My children both love to get 'foot-baths'.  This is only done occasionally, with special scented oils, and the time is always quiet and peaceful.  They love the foot rub and I love the time we have together, if only for a few peaceful minutes, to pray and talk about what's on our hearts.<br>

Heartjoys... I think there's a special day in the Catholic church... I think it's around Easter or Christmas... well, I went to a mass at the Franciscan convent here on that day, and they had a ceremony for the washing of feet, where the priest washed their feet and they washed eachother's feet... it was really beautiful.  I think it's awesome what you do with your kids, and hey, they're gonna have really healthy tootsies!<br>
