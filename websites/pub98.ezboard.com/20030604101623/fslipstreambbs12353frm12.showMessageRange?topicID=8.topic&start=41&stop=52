She placed her teeth lightly on the lobe of his ear and whispered, &quot;Shall we repair to a more private locale for more individualized entertainment than can be found in this madding crowd?&quot;  The meal grasped at her eagerly and leaned toward her for a kiss.  She placed her index finger on his lips and stood, her hips swaying rhythmically with the music which pervaded the bar.  Eyes locked on the seductive movements of her derriere, the meal followed Antinomy outside.  The meal prattled, rattling off a list of more secluded spots for a tryst.  Unsure of Amaya's intentions, Antinomy quieted her meal by fondling his nether regions and awaited Amaya's pleasure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadegrimmy@slipstreambbs12353>Jade Grimmy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/18/03 1:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://bellsouthpwp.net/d/r/drayven/jadie1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightfall</span><hr size=1> OOC:  The setting of the planet is like the show Jules Verne except more high Tech.  <br>
Everyone is dressed in Victorian garb.  The planet is housed by earth colonies mostly.<br>
<br>
JP with Rujevit<br>
<br>
<br>
Narve Vitalievitch sat relaxingly behind his huge desk and pondered the recent events in the colonial capital.  New Hague was a new venue for the Dark Enterprises and acquiring its market was crucial for the supraplanetary corporation.  Earth3 was a gateway to Old Earth from the resource-rich Outer Regions and Dark Enterprises was determined to become the dominant transporter of cargo in the region. <br>
<br>
The particular event Narve was thinking about was the new governor that has been appointed from Old Earth. Dark Enterprises' political influence had to be extended once more, and the documents that Aria was delivering were supposed to ensure that the new deputy governor was compliant to corporation's requests.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Vitalievitch, Aria is here to see you.&quot;  The secretary informed him.<br>
<br>
The dark-haired businessman didn't reply to his assistant - Aria always had access to his office. Narve turned to face the door and waited for it to open.<br>
<br>
Aria gently pushed open the door.  &quot;I delivered those documents like you asked.&quot;  She smiled warmly.  &quot;The man just nodded his head to me before he left.&quot;  She approached his desk.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. Michael Hauser will soon be in our pocket,&quot; Narve acknowledged emotionlessly. &quot;I see you haven't fed yet, your appearance is very dangerous,&quot; he continued looking into Aria's sunken eyes.<br>
<br>
Aria dropped her eyes with a frown.  &quot;I didn't have time.&quot;  She whispered.<br>
<br>
He chuckled &quot;I see,&quot; and continued to examine her pale face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Once I left our contact I ran into two women.  They were both Vampires but of a different sort.  One of blood the other of mind.  I am supposed to meet them tomorrow.  Perhaps they would be a good asset to our company?&quot;  She raised her eyes to meet his steel blues.<br>
<br>
&quot;Childe, childe,&quot; the fleshstealer shook his head &quot;just because they are vampires doesn't mean they are useful.&quot; &quot;However, presence of more of our kind could compromise *us*,&quot; Narve stood up and approached Aria &quot;have a meeting with them, find out why they are here and assess their threat or usefulness.&quot; &quot;And please,&quot; he took her small hand into his &quot;feed my dear, you are compromising the Masquerade&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed deeply.  &quot;I know.  Its still difficult to kill.  I will look for one perhaps that is already dying.&quot;<br>
<br>
Narve shrugged his shoulders, as if saying &quot;I don't care how, just feed&quot;<br>

You can try your caveman impression out again later; maybe it will impress me then.&quot;  She pulled him by the front of his pants into the dark alley.  Hopefully, Amaya would follow; but she was too tired of this fool to put up with him a moment longer.  She pressed him against a wall in the dark and began kissing his neck.  As his fingers fumbled at the fastenings of her clothes, she sank her teeth into his throat, draining him.  <br>
<br>
She left the last few bitter swallows and saw his realization of his fate in his eyes as he fell, unable to move, to the ground.  She had ripped his throat as she removed her teeth and the last of his blood poured forth onto the dirt and pavement.  If there was anything left of him that Amaya could use, she was welcome to it.  Otherwise . . . Antinomy took in the scene.  The addition of a broken bottle from the nearby dumpster and the police would report a tragic accident and the dangers of overconsumption of alcohol.  She took the time to make sure that her companion had fed safely and then took  her leave of Amaya.  The night had been long; she had grown tired and irritable.

His mind was racing... this being was defiantly of vampiric origin... of that he had no doubt... but there was something &quot;different&quot; about her...<br>
<br>
He decided that he needed to find out the morals of this alien (to him) being... to see if it had any shreds of humanity left... it had been too long since he had been in the company of his own kind... and he admitted secretly to himself that he was more than a little curious about her...<br>

&quot;who are you to decide whether this man lives or dies?&quot; Mordoc spoke haltingly from the shadows &quot;That he was guilty of drinking too much and trying to force himself on you... it is true... but you were in no danger... was the death really necessary?... a glimpse of your true self could have changed him into a better man...scared him into reforming... such wasted potential...&quot; <br>

Mordoc stepped out from the shadows... readying himself to greet, fight, or if need be flee from this mysterious being...<br>

Not her style she thought.....she liked to dine in comfort, relishing every last moment. It wasn't simply a matter of personal taste however, the nature in which she fed often made it necessary. It was possible to feed as her friend had done but for Amaya the alley would have to be considerably more lonely.<br>
<br>
Smiling at the beautiful young man who was to satisfy her craving she led him by the hand back to the finely furnished residence she had designated as her lair. It had not taken her long to accumulate such finery......it was easy to gather a few gifts from her prey whilst she toyed with them and Amaya only chose the ones who could afford it.<br>
<br>
Taking the man upstairs to her bedroom Amaya slipped seductively out of the red velvet dress that had complimented her hair so beautifully. The man couldn't believe his luck! She wasted no time but kissed him passionately and quickly got to work. As the man burned with passion he caught a glimpse of what it truly was that he had in his arms. But it was too late, he was hers, spellbound, locked eternally in pleasure and terror. At the height of his fufillment his soul was lost and he was forever damned.<br>
<br>
Kissing him one last time Amaya got up, dressed and disposed of the remains with a pang of regret. It was often so with her. Too often she hated what she was.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=consubstantial>consubstantial</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/examples/fhpp036.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=purple, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='user title'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table><a

Luck was with her, a young man was strolling through the park a short distance from her. Victoria put on her most charming smile and approached him. They chatted for several minutes walking deeper into the park. She lead him into a part where the trees would shield them from anyone in the area. Then she roughly shoved the man against the tree. &quot;Hey, what the hell?!&quot;, he demanded, more than a little surprised. &quot;Hush&quot;, Victoria replied in a stragely eerie voice, &quot;look into my eyes.&quot; The man looked up and was instantly transfixed. He stood there helplessly as Victoria drained him and then found a convienent place to hide the body. She licked her lips, smiling slightly to herself as she left the park and returned to her home.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=8.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=8.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=52><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.emailToFriend?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.threadControl?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="slipstreambbs12353frm17">Announcements<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm24">The Underground Wire<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm18">General Discussion<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm7">Episodes<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm8">Andromeda Universe<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm13">Fan Fiction<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm25">Challenge Forum<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm15">Filk<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm12">Roleplaying<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm14">Web Sites<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm11">The Observation Deck<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm22">The Abyss<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm10">Science Fiction & Fantasy<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm19">Chat Room<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm20">Questions, Suggestions, and Feedback<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm9">Tech Questions<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm16">Officer's Quarters<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm21">The Black Hole</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#EFD68C>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353>Slipstream Underground</a><font color=#EFD68C> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#EFD68C> - </font><a href="http://www.slipstreamunderground.com">Slipstream Underground</a><font color=#EFD68C> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
