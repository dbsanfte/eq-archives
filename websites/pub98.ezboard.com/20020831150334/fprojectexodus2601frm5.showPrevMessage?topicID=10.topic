The new customers that had just entered the club were even more dirtier and seedier looking then the regulars that frequented Hott Legs. She didn't want to serve them, approach them, or be anywhere near them but the bartender pushed her towards them. &quot;What the hell do you think your doing standing around? Get going!&quot; He said gruffly. The only reason he had kept her was because she brought in a lot of customers with her looks and curvy body, even more so then some of the strippers. He didn't care that she was much to young to be working a place like this because she looked so much older. Besides that Jekht wasn't really known for obeying the rules.<br>
<br>
Lola walked over to the men, looking like a skittish and scared doe. &quot;Wha...What can I get for you, gentlemen?&quot; She asked, her voice naturally deep and husky, though it sounded like an invitation to the men. One of the men grinned to his friends and grabbed her small waist, pulling her down on top of his lap. &quot;How about we start with you, darlin'?&quot; The man stage whispered in her ear, encircling her waist with his arms. &quot;I-I'm sorry...I'm not a stripper,&quot; She said while squirming, trying to get out of his grasp, but that only seemed to excite him more and his hands began to rub up her sides and touch her breasts. &quot;I don't mind,&quot; the man said and roughly grabbed her breast. Lola looked over to the bartender, desperately, but he was serving a man and didn't notice her. &quot;Please...please let go of me,&quot; she said softly, not wanting to cause a scene in fear that she might lose her job. The dirty man paid no attention and continued to squeeze her breast, &quot;Ah, darlin', you don't mean that.&quot; <p><center><img src=http://www.animexposed.com/gallery/Anime%20Cels/Anime_Hot_Babes/hotab69.jpg width=296 height=222></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/uscionofsorcery1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scion of Sorcery1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#0000FF>(8/8/02 5:29:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fprojectexodus2601frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://cfgemini.homestead.com/files/jin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hott Legs</span><hr size=1> Leo walked in the restaurant, he saw the guy feeling on the girl but didn't think to much of it.

They got out of their seats and circled around him, there was five of them when the man Leo was holding was counted. &quot;What does it matter to you?&quot; One scruffy looking man asked.

Lola walked over to the men that were leering at her just moments before with a little more assurance. She took their orders while they eyed her hungrily, but oddly enough they didn't do any more then that. Lola walked back over to Leo, after she had gotten the men their drinks, and slid into a seat across from him. She knew if her boss saw her the she would be in trouble, but she liked the man who had said a couple of kind words to her and she was interested in him. &quot;Is she a friend?&quot; <p><center><img src=http://www.animexposed.com/gallery/Anime%20Cels/Anime_Hot_Babes/hotab69.jpg width=296 height=222></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/uscionofsorcery1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scion of Sorcery1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#0000FF>(8/8/02 7:41:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fprojectexodus2601frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://cfgemini.homestead.com/files/jin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hott Legs</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yeah, you can say that.

&quot;Last time I try to get in the way of one of THOSE guys..&quot; he sighed. &quot;Hey, c'n someone get me a drink in here?&quot; Normally, a sixteen year-old asking for a drink would be outrageous -- but not on Mars, and especially not on Jekht. <p>
