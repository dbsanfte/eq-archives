I shall start with the last post I caught there...sorry can't remember who did it, but I'm sure it's LDS. (for the record I think the submission of the bible is bullcrap for all sects, but this quote struck me so I'm using it first)<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The family is ordained of God. Marriage between a man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Okay so bastard children are being slighted according to this and most xians would probably agree, but what implications does this decree have for babies born outside the &quot;bonds of matrimony&quot;? Are they forever disadvantaged? What if their parents stay together but don't legally marry?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Yes well I obviously disagree, but this is standard xian fare. I think all denoms would agree here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness,respect, love, compassion, work and wholesome recreational activities.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Then why do atheists have lower divorce rates than Mormons, or for that matter 99% of xian sects? <br>
<br>
Perhaps you feel faith, repentance and prayer help you, but the statistics prove this assertion flat wrong.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well whether or not there is a divine design is at the core of how we see our roles I suppose and this is why xian women feel they must be submissive. We really can't argue this since I don't accept there is a divine plan or a divine anything, however I can argue that when most of society buys into these roles and feels they are what god commands, it leads to inequality. Replace the terms &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; with black and white and see how equal you feel the &quot;sacred responsibilities&quot; seem. Not very.  It is a real concern in the workplace for me to know that nearly all the managers of the factory see women in this way---how can it not affect how they value and rate me as an employee? If this is really a core belief of xians and LDS then every woman who works for one of these men has grounds for harassment if he applies his beliefs to the workplace or in any way sees her as having to fulfill these &quot;childbearing/rearing&quot; roles first and her husband as the primary breadwinner.<br>
<br>

 <p>&quot;I don't have any evidence of that... Just in terms of allocation of time resources, <br>
religion is not very efficient.  There's alot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.&quot; <br>

Parenting is a partnership. I think children are at a disadvantage if they are not in a 2 parent home. It doesn't mean they are doomed, but it is less than ideal.<br>

Atheists have a lower divorce rate than Mormons? I would like to see it. I'll have to look up some stats. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I already said that I don't buy into the submissive wife thing and neither do other Mormon women. I don't think God tries to keep women in their place. But I do think some people can buy into the submissive stuff too much and take advantage. That is called Unrighteous Dominion. Not at all ok. <p>Paige<br>

<br>
God never said women were not smart or not needed. <br>
God said Gen.2:18 It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. Prov. 18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord. <br>
<br>
How do you explain Eph. 5:22-23 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the HEAD of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. vs 33 Nevertheless let everyone of you in particular so love his wife even as himself: and the wife see that she reverence her husband. (if your not sure what reverence means look it up)<br>
Don't argue with me about the womens role in life. I didn't write the book. God did. Women in this day and age have a real hard time placing themselves under a man. They want to be just like them in everything they do. God did not make us the same we are different and we have different roles. The women is the weaker vessel<br>
1Peter 3:1- Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;......... (subjection defined in websters 1828 dict.=<br>
the act of subduning; the act of vanquishing and brining under the dominion of another. the state of being under the power, control and government of another.) (I didnt write the book )<br>
Verse 6-7 Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowlege, giving HONOUR unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.<br>
<br>
About the unequally yoked? I'm interested in what you think that means. 2Cor. 6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath rightousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? To me this simply says you souldn't marry someone who is not a believer or have a best friend who is not a believer because for what fellowship hath rightousness with unrighteousness? They will not look at issues in the same light. One is living there life for the Lord, and the other one is living their life for themselves and the devil.<br>

I think I have an awesome marriage. I believe we have a great marriage because we are equal in everything. He didn’t get married to me to have me be his slave, he loves and respects that I can take care of myself. I didn’t get married to be somebody's babysitter or personal maid.<br>
I got married because I loved him and want to SHARE my life with him not let him rule my life.<br>
I would never teach my daughters to blindly obey a man. I think that is just crazy. To me that says you are less and he is more so whatever he does to you is ok. It’s all in god’s plan.<br>
<br>
What if your husband started beating you? Would you let him because you are to be submissive? Where do you draw the line?<br>

Paul writes in 1 Corinthians that a divorce is alright also in the case of one spouse being an unbeliever:<br>
&quot;But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has  wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her. ANd a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let het not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband ... but if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondange in such cases.&quot; (1 Cor 7:12-15) He does note, that this is his opinion, if you will, and not necessary what God says. I've never read anywhere that mentions abuse in the Bible; though, I don't think God would hold a person to a marriage if they are getting abused (emotionally, physically, sexually, etc). Most people like to stick to the verse about women submitting ... (which again, is not equal to slavery - see my post on the JS thread, page 6 I think). But, men are to love and honor their wives to the point that they would lay down their lives for her. To be honest, none of this made much sense to me before I was married. I have been a Christian for over 10 years, but held very tightly to my &quot;I am woman, hear me roar&quot; adage for many years. In fact, when my dh and I married, he was not yet a Christian, and I had not yet recommitted my life to Christ. So, many of these decisions and choices we made and discussed were done between an agnostic and theist (I think that's the correct term - never gave up my belief in God, but dropped most everything else for a while). There are verses that speak of people who are believers gaining understanding and peace from God - I know I have found my beliefs about certain issues changing as I look at them from God's perspective and re-examine why I held fast to my beliefs in the first place. I don't think I'm any less intelligent or a thinking person because of it. But, I'm realizing I'm not too proud to say, &quot;I think maybe I was wrong about how I saw such-and-such an issue.&quot; (Not trying to make any inferences there ...) Anyways, what started as a simple verse turned into quite a spiel. And, ds is claiming he's awake from a very short nap, so I must go check. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There are more divorces among born-again Christians than among atheists, a new study shows. Among born-again Christians, the highest rate of divorce is among Baptists, according to the nationwide survey, done by Barna Research Group, an independent marketing and research association in Ventura, Calif. <br>
Twenty-nine percent of all adult Baptists surveyed have been divorced, while 21 percent of atheists have been divorced. <br>
The results, which came from interviews with 4,000 adults throughout 1999, showed that 30 percent of Jews have been through a divorce, 28 percent of Episcopalians have been and 24 percent of Mormons have had a marital split. <br>
Among other categories of Christians, the percentage of divorce was 21 percent for Catholics and Lutherans, 26 percent for Methodists, 34 percent for non-denominational Christians, 28 percent for Pentecostals and 23 percent of Presbyterians. <br>
George Barna, founder and head of Barna Research, said the findings about high divorce among born-again Christians aren't new. &quot;While it may be alarming, that pattern has been in place for some time,&quot; he said. <br>
&quot;Even more disturbing is that when those (born-again) individuals experience a divorce, many of them feel their community of faith provides rejection rather than support and healing. But the research also raises questions regarding the effectiveness of the churches' ministry to families,&quot; he said. <br>
The American Atheists Inc., said the findings show that &quot;religious claims of a superior morality is not supported by the data.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
And this next part is key to our conversation here....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Atheists reject, and rightly so, the primitive patriarchal attitudes so prevalent in many religions with respect to marriage,&quot; said Ron Barrier, a spokesman for the New Jersey-based organization. <br>
&quot;It would seem to me that churches are the last places one should go for family support, and the statistics bear this out,&quot; he said. <br>
The Barna study showed some other facts that may be surprising. Baby boomers, &quot;widely criticized for their selfishness and inattention of family needs,&quot; said Barna, have a lower divorce rate than the previous &quot;builders&quot; generation, those people aged 53 to 72. <br>
Barna's study showed that 37 percent of the builders have been divorced, while 34 percent of the boomers have been. Only 18 percent of seniors have been divorced. <br>
Other results showed that 27 percent of whites get divorced, 22 percent of African-Americans do, and 20 percent of Hispanics get divorced. Only 8 percent of Asians get divorced, the study showed. Barna also found that divorce in the Northeast is at 19 percent, but the number is 26 percent in the West and 27 percent in the South and the Midwest. <br>
Barna interviewed people in the 48 continental United States. The estimated sampling error is plus or minus 2 percent.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Please note that the sampling error is not sufficient to move LDS ahead of atheists in divorce frequency. Believe me, I was just as surprised by this and probably should re-examine some stereotypes I have labored under myself about religion helping keep families together and about atheist marriages. Sorry not to have given myself more credit from the get-go.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And on raising secular vs. religious children the research is clear from studies over the past 100 years.<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.objectivethought.com/atheism/iqstats.html">www.objectivethought.com/...stats.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I would agree that a 2 parent home is better than 1 parent since I am a mother of two myself and was raised by a single mother. It was tough on her to do everything and I wish there had been someone there to help her as much as us, but I DO NOT agree that there must be a marriage or that it must be a man and a woman (as opposed to say, two loving fathers or mothers….and it seems the leading pediatric psychologists of this country agree with me). <br>
<br>
And on the subject of women’s roles including those in the church I found that Barna has addressed this as well and found the same results I’ve been hearing for years—Women carry the biggest spiritual load at church and at home, regardless of the bible’s position on submission and leadership.<br>
<br>
Men may fill the dominant leadership positions in the church, but women are the ones who keep the church running, according to a new nationwide study by the Barna Research Group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>While only 5 percent of the nation's Christian churches are led by female pastors, women are significantly more likely than men to hold other leadership roles in the church, the study found.<br>
Women also shoulder the largest burden for cultivating the spiritual life of their families, according to pollster George Barna. &quot;Women, more often than not, take the lead role in the spiritual life of the family. Women typically emerge as the primary--or only--spiritual mentor and role model for family members. And that puts a tremendous burden on wives and mothers.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Nor did we say he did. Many slaves have been both smart and needed--why do you think so many peoples had slavery? They were NEEDED, but not equal. There cannot be a master or head without a slave or lower. The president of the United States or Kings of monarchies may take all the advice they want from trusted and beloved advisors and family members, but it is clear who is in power and rules over the rest of them.<br>
<br>
To be clear, I agree with Heather that the bible does call for this--I just think it's another good example of how men drafted this myth to control certain segments of the population and keep the order of the day under the guise of &quot;divine plans&quot;. She is sticking to her religion by being submissive.<br>
<br>
Misty---Gosh I thought I did answer you about the original quote and I think it's right in line with xian theology (which is perhaps why Heather said nice things about it--wow), but I have problems with xian theology and it's views of family, gender roles, healthy environments for children and how these views hurt me as a woman when applied to the real world.<br>

I had always heard the stats on LDS marriages were around 10% or something like that. I've also heard that those married in the temple and not civily had lower divorce rates. Hmmmm...<br>
<br>
The qoute about women doing the brunt of the work in the church/at home doesn't apply to LDS as much I think. We have different organizations and &quot;callings&quot; and they seem about equal to me. The women have their organization and also run the childrens Primary. Men have their Priesthhod groups, serve as Bishops, etc. But both may get called as Sunday School teachers or Primary teachers. <p>Paige<br>

I just heard the other day on the christian radio station that born-again believes make up 1% of the divorce rate.   So I dont think you can believe any stats you hear.  Even if those stats are correct it doesn't mean a thing.  When you fall away from God anything is possible.  Christians are no different than anyother sinner. I'm not denying that baptist dont get divorced.  Divorce is in every religion (including atheist)  Its sad that any family should have to go through a divorce but the ones who rely on God and follow God with all their hearts are less likely to divorce!  If you think about it the only reason people divorce anyway is because of sin, either adultry, selfishness, abuse, etc.  All comes from sin.  So if you want to do right in the eyes of the Lord you will work through problems and not divorce.   I love how you hear people say, &quot;marriage should be 50/50&quot;  No it shouldn't, it should be 100/100.<br>

What we are discussing is submission and the view of gender roles in society that may be based in the bible. For the person that said we are just expressing our views, I say...no, this is a debate board. You are welcome to say &quot;this is what we do&quot;, but expect that here someone is likely to question it or say their way is better even if they are not directly addressing you. The LDS quote I used at the beginning is an excellent example. It clearly states that a life based on JC is best and that marriage between a man and woman is best where they each accept and abide by their divine roles. That means LDS elders would indeed say atheism in general is not the path to familial happiness----duh. Of course they would say that, or else they wouldn't be Mormon or xian. Please understand we're here to discuss and argue and someone attacking my ideas is not necessarily saying I'm ugly or have an ugly husband or we are stupid, rather they are arguing I am wrong or they are more right.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You know, I think it's great that a/a's can claim lower divorce rates etc. But is that what it's all about?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's about debunking the prevalent and long held stereotypes about atheists not being as committed to family as theists and xians in particular. It's about proving that marriages based on real equality and trust and respect without &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;masters&quot; and &quot;submission&quot; seem to last longer. It's about saying that religion, and xianity in general do NOTHING to improve your chances of being married longer or having a happy family. <br>
<br>
This isn't to say LDS are unhappy, just that we are just as, if not more in many or most cases. We are told repeatedley how believing in god and seeing &quot;his diving plan&quot; would bring us more peace, joy and love in ourselves and our family by you and other xians, then when we provide proof this is not so (rather than cute anecdotes and stories based on feelings) you say &quot;why are you bringing this up&quot; and accuse of of having superiority complexes.  Wow--have I claimed that a life based on reason is THE ONLY path to happiness and salvation or that the BEST way to be saved is through atheistic marriage or that atheist parents are what children have a right to as your own elder has? Who's open minded and who closed here? Do I claim there is but one path to happiness and one right way through JC or Jehovah? Amazing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If some of the greatest minds had refused to think outside the box we wouldn't be where we are now.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, and lucky for us and science and progress some of the very best minds went against xian dogma and DID think outside the box. I can only hope we make the same social and philosophical progress as time moves on...particularly around gay rights and gay parental rights. Since LDS support gay parenting I hope to see you standing with me on the front lines of that battle. Glad to see you feel the same way on that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But if we had strong family values, we might be able to raise children who can avoid abusive situations, etc.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
I agree with everything you said in that paragraph, but fail to see how it supports the point your elder makes, submission, xian marriage or anything else. Apparently believing in god is not correlated to personal, professional or family success, so I guess basing your life on JC is not the only way, nor the best way. We agree.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What we believe works for us, and who are you to say we're wrong?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't recall telling you what you and your dh do is wrong or that plural marriage is wrong or that living &quot;in sin&quot; is wrong or that gay marriage is wrong. Frankly, I'm sick and damn tired of xian religious doctrine dictating what marriage is to our country and cannot wait for us to abandon myth as a basis for law. I will debate with you about submission and whether you base your gender roles on a solid and logical foundation, but that's what debate boards are for, no?<br>
<br>
And for the woman who says she's happy at home with her son. Good for you! My sister feels the same way and stays home despite her college degree. I am not housewife material (don't read any weird connotations into this either...it is what it is--I'm not Martha Stuart and I hate being home all day). We should BOTH have the choice to do what we WANT to do, which is proven to be what makes our husbands and children the happiest (working on getting you this data too). Can you see how if most people believed women are divinely commanded to work outside the home that would affect you? Would you not feel others judging you constantly, feeling you are denying your role in life and possibly penalizing you for this? See why women seek equality in and outside the home. I support your choice fully and don't think you're shirking god or anyone else's &quot;divine plan&quot;. Too bad you all don't return the favor.<br>
