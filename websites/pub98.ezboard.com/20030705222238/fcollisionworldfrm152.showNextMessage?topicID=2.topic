Eris awoke to the harsh light above the misty fog, burning down into her eyes.  She winced and moved a bit, takign a breath but suddenly found herself choking.  Stomach reeling, she turned over on her side and retched.<br>
<br>
In the shaky aftermath, she laid limp on the muddy, shallow water bank of the river, shivering and soaked to the bone.  It was a while longer before she regained her bearings, and remembered what had happened.<br>
<br>
She sat up abruptly, feeling dizzy and disoriented.  &quot;Seifer!!!&quot; she cried, looking about blindly.  &quot;Kirin...&quot;<br>
<br>
But the misty fog that hung about the bank and over the water was so great, she couldn't see them.<br>
<br>
Misty River.

Eevee flew above the large river... then she saw something.<br>
<br>
A young girl with blue hair was struggling to pull herself out of the water!!!<br>
<br>
Eevee flew down to the girl (kirin) and saw she didn't have a clue where she was going.<br>
<br>
&quot;That way!&quot; Her small voice was actualy heard above the roar of the water by Kirin.<br>
<br>
Kirin looked up and saw the faerie flying above her... and nodded her head.<br>
<br>
SHe swam to the shore and pulled herself out onto it.<br>
<br>
Her body lay limp on the shore for a moment and she looked around...<br>

Eris was nearby, but Kirin couldn't seem to get herself to speak, no the less get  up. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

&quot;Oh...oh Gods! Thank you! Kirin!&quot; she came near, on her knees, her hair loose and clinging to her face like a curtain.  &quot;Oh jeez...A-are you alright? Did you see the others? Did you see Seifer?&quot; she asked, her eyes filled with fear.  She shivered with immense cold and terror, it seemed.  She took the now sogged blanket from her pack and wrung it as dry as she could, then wrapped it around the trembling girl.  Eris' lips were blue, she'd been lying in the ice cold water for a while.  &quot;Y-you okay?&quot; she repeated shakily.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/8/03 10:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm152.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> mm hmm</span><hr size=1> Kirin heard Eris's voice and opened her eyes.<br>

<br>
She sat up, wiping herself off and standing slowly, barely able to find her feet.  Then her eyes snapped open fully, and she whirled around in alarm, looking in all directions.  *Where is Balder?!  Nina!!*  She screamed through her mind, making Eris and Kirin able to hear her. <p>~Z<br>

She looked over, a glimpse of flesh color catching the corner of her eyes.<br>

Flying over, some other people became visible.<br>

Thalia blinked, watching her.  She coughed briefly, covering her mouth.  Still some water down there...<br>
<br>
*Here,* she said, tearing off some of her skirt and handing it to Kirin.  *That should stop the bleeding.  Hm...*  <br>
<br>
She looked around, hoping to see some herbs or SOME form of vegetation here...<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Nina blinked.  &quot;Maybe we should just stay here...&quot; she thought, then looked up at the sky at the sound of someone yelling.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Hey, you!&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, look up there, Willow!&quot;  Nina exclaimed, pointing at the thing in the sky.<br>
