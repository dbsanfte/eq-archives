This is a favorite creationist chestnut to preface the &quot;argument from design.&quot; It is loosely based on Paley's comparison of the intricate workings of the human eye to that of a telescope and concludes that something so intricate MUST have a designer. (I still don't get how even that conclusion leads to the notion that the &quot;designer&quot; must be &quot;God&quot; and that &quot;God&quot; must want to have a personal relationship with us and to prove it he came to earth and crawled out of a virgin, walked on water, died for 3 days to exponge our sins and rose up to be seated at the right hand of him own self and hey, if we just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>believe</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it we're gonna live forever an' ever AMEN... but I digress).<br>
<br>
I see no point in paraphrasing Richard Dawkins when he explains it so beautifully himself, so here is part of the intro to his book <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Blind Watchmaker</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
&quot;The analogy between telescope and eye, between watch and living organism, is false. All appearances to the contrary, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics, albeit deployed in a very special way. A true watchmaker has foresight: he designs his cogs and springs, and plans their interconnections, with a future purpose in his mind's eye. Natural selection, the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered, and which we now know is the explanation for the existence and apparently purposeful form of all life, has no purpose in mind. It has no mind and no mind's eye. It does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight, no sight at all. If it can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the blind watchmaker.&quot;<br>

All three parts are intended to show the existance of god, and are also independant of eachother.  The first is a scientific analysis based on the origins of the universe.  The second is a mostly scientific analysis used to show that the universe was designed, and thus has a designer.(related to this thread)  The third is tripe, plain and simple.  This is where the author abandoned reason and uses scripture as the main basis of the origins of ethics and morality.  In this section he blatently excludes some parts which would drastically hurt his case.  However, as I said, the three sections are independant, and thus I would suggest that anyone interested should read part one and two. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doublelatte>Double Latte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Milk?</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/19/03 10:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=218.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Blind Watchmaker and junkyard 747's</span><hr size=1> From your link: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In fact, Mr. Ricci even conceded that the statement, “ ‘Everything designed has a designer,’ is an analytically true statement” and thus requires no formal proof (p. 190).

I think they've missed the point ENTIRELY. Let's say for example I have a tree that is shaded by another tree and therefore ends up growing bent at an odd angle in order to get sunlight. The tree wasn't &quot;designed&quot; ahead to be bent that way and there was no &quot;designer&quot; that deliberately bent the tree with some awesome future goal in mind. There was no great bonsai artist in the sky. It just grew that way because <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>it needed to in order to survive.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Plants whose genes did not allow them to bend to seek sunlight did not survive. Life seeks to survive and the result of that is evolution. So living things are not &quot;designed&quot; purposefully and therefore are not proof of a thoughtful designer named God. Evolutionary &quot;design&quot; is incidental to survival.<br>
<br>
Likewise, humans were not &quot;designed&quot; - we just evolved this way in order to survive.  If we had but one eye in the middle of our foreheads, that would look beautiful to us if that was all we knew. The &quot;perfect order&quot; of the universe only seems perfect to us because that is all we know. Kind of like the way we count using a 10's system because we have 10 digits. If we had 12 digits we would count by twelves.<br>
<br>
I suspect that humans that were religious apparently survived better (maybe because they killed off those who weren't) and so humans evolved into a religious animal. <br>

People tend to focus on the successes of nature, and not the failures.  An omnipotent deity would not have so many of these failures and imperfections.  We wouldn't expect Emeril to screw up a basic spaghetti dinner, so why is it okay for a deity to screw up so much of nature?  Shouldn't we expect more from him?  <br>

I hope you will find the time to read it over carefully:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1998-sumimprobabilityofgod.htm">www.world-of-dawkins.com/...yofgod.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Some excerpts:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We can safely conclude that living bodies are billions of times too complicated - too statistically improbable - to have come into being by sheer chance. How, then, did they come into being? The answer is that chance enters into the story, but not a single, monolithic act of chance. Instead, a whole series of tiny chance steps, each one small enough to be a believable product of its predecessor, occurred one after the other in sequence. These small steps of chance are caused by genetic mutations, random changes - mistakes really - in the genetic material. They give rise to changes in the existing bodily structure. Most of these changes are deleterious and lead to death. A minority of them turn out to be slight improvements, leading to increased survival and reproduction. By this process of natural selection, those random changes that turn out to be beneficial eventually spread through the species and become the norm. The stage is now set for the next small change in the evolutionary process. After, say, a thousand of these small changes in series, each change providing the basis for the next, the end result has become, by a process of accumulation, far too complex to have come about in a single act of chance.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The fact that the genetic code is the same in all living creatures overwhelmingly suggests that all are descended from one single ancestor. The evidence for evolution is so compelling that the only way to save the creation theory is to assume that God deliberately planted enormous quantities of evidence to make it look as if evolution had happened. In other words, the fossils, the geographical distribution of animals, and so on, are all one gigantic confidence trick. Does anybody want to worship a God capable of such trickery? It is surely far more reverent, as well as more scientifically sensible, to take the evidence at face value. All living creatures are cousins of one another, descended from one remote ancestor that lived more than 3,000 million years ago. <br>
<br>
The Argument from Design, then, has been destroyed as a reason for believing in a God. Are there any other arguments?<br>
