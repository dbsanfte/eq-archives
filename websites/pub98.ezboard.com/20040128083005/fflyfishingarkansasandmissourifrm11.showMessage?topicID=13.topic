He answered at length and gave his permission for it to be published to this board.<br>
  The letter is printed below in its' entirety.<br>
<br>
 &lt;I'm always happy to address your concerns and concerns of our anglers.  I'm replying directly to you but feel free to post my comments, unedited, on the message board.<br>
<br>
First - the lampreys.  Let me just say right up front that we do not recognise lamprey in the Norfork Tailwater (NFTW) as a concern and we do not think that they have any significant impact on the population.  Nows here's the reasoning and information that allows me to make that statement.  <br>
<br>
Lamprey are the most primitive family of fishes and they are not &quot;eels&quot;.  Eels are represented by one species in Arkansas, the american eel, and eels are non-parasitic and much more evolutionarily advanced than lamprey.  Four species of lamprey are native to Arkansas and three of those species could occur in NFTW.  However, only one of these is parasitic to other fishes, the chestnut lamprey (Ichthyomyzon castaneus).  So the lamprey that you see attached to trout are all chestnut lamprey.  An excellent account of lamprey in Arkansas can be accessed on pages 68 through 75 in &quot;The Fishes of Arkansas&quot; which was co-authored by one of my fisheries mentors, Dr. Tom Buchanan along with Dr. Henry Robison.<br>
<br>
Chestnut lamprey are native species and should in no way be compared to the sea lamprey, which is the species that &quot;invaded&quot; the great lakes through a man-made canal system from the Atlantic Ocean, and caused severe harm to the native fisheries.  Here, the lamprey is the native and the trout are the non-natives.  As natives, the chestnut lamprey exists in low numbers filling its ecological niche, and has never been documented as a problem to any fishery in Arkansas.  <br>
<br>
Now how about some actual data.  We have been sampling the Norfork Catch-and-Release area monthly since this spring, using our new state-of-the-art, eletrofishing boats.  This week on Monday night, October 27th, we conducted fish health assesment and a fish population sample on NFTW at Quarry Park, along with the monthly sample of the catch-and-release area.  In the Quarry Park area, we sampled and released 324 trout.  Of these, we saw attached lamprey on about 4 or 5 trout and a few more with fresh or old lamprey wounds.  This is so insignificant (1.5% with attached lamprey), that we didn't even actually note it on the data sheets, so I'm speaking from memory. The sample in the C&amp;R area was similar with respect to lamprey.  In that sample we sampled and released 215 trout and of those  about 6 had attached lamprey (approximately 2.7%). <br>
<br>
Fish health assesment is a published fisheries standard protocol we've adopted to annually monitor and document the effects of poor water-quality on the trout populations below Norfork and Bull Shoals dams.  The fish health assesment sample was taken from the no-fishing zone below Norfork Dam.  This sample consisted of 20 sub 16 inch brook trout and 20 sub 18 inch brown trout.  The protocol involves a visual inspection of all external and internal organ systems and a final 'score&quot; is arrived at indicating the health of the sampled fish as a representative of the population.  Our AGFC Fisheries Division Fish Pathologist, Jon Stein, helps us with these samples and Jon also runs a blood sample on each fish.  Using this protocol we have documented that trout health is diminished during the Fall season in the upper reaches of Norfork and Bull Shaols Dams. Anyone who would like to see one of these reports is welcome to a copy.  Anyway, the point was this - out of the 40 trout that underwent the critical visual assesment, one had an old wound from a lamprey, and its health was similar to the trout in the sample.  This is important to note because of this fact - chestnut lamprey do not normally stay on a host long enough to do enough damage to kill the host, nor has secondary infection seemed to be an issue.  The lamprey simply attach to the hoast fish for awile, feed and let go.<br>
<br>
Having said all this, I will note that this weeks sample of the catch-and-release area did seem to have more lamprey involved that we have seen in any other monthly sample this year, 2.7% vs none.  So it is interesting that anglers also have noticed the apparent increase, no matter how slight.  According to the &quot;Fishes of Arkansas&quot;, the chestnut lamprey makes spawning runs up tributary streams in late winter and spring.  Perhaps something about the variable flow regime in the tailwater triggers lamprey to migrate into or out of the NFTW on occasion?.?.?  Depending on the species, lamprey live about 2 to 5 years and all natural fish and animal populations are cyclic and highly variable from year to year based on environmental conditions that control spawning (reproduction), recruitment to adults, and growth, and mortality.  For whatever reason the lamprey may be on a population increase or at a peak right now compared to other years past. From an environmental standpoint, lamprey require soft-bottom, silty substrates and organic debris for thier larval life stages.  If an increase in numbers of lamprey is occurring, however slight, it might be due to increased siltation in the NFTW from increasing land disturbance in the tributaries downstream of the dam and the degradation of the banks of the NFTW.  These problems are real and slitation and bank erosion on all of our White River system tailwaters is a major problem.  That's why the draft Trout Management Plan speaks to increasing protection of stream banks and watersheds of our tailwater trout fisheries.  But again, I just got on my soapbox for a minute, and again the situation with the lanprey is not a problem to the fishery at this time but we will be monitoring.  The Norfork remains an incredable fishery as is, and I can only imagine what it could be if it received good water quality and better flow year-round, and experienced less turbid water / siltation during rain events.<br>
<br>
Which leads us to the other topic you inquired about - minimum flow and water quality.  Again, its nice to see that our anglers are so perceptive and concerned as to try to understand these situations.  Let me try to give some explanation to  the concerns ya'll have expressed, from my perspective.  Flow and quality of the water are indeed inherently related, but they are being politically handled separately, sort-of.  The WRDA Act reallocates a volume of water to provide slightly more, adequate flow during non-generation times on the White River system tailwaters.  The Act really doesn't say anything about the quality of that water.  However, the quality of that water needs to be at state-standard levels when it flows from the dam.  To the credit of the White River Dissolved Oxygen Committee and SWPA and the COE, improvements have been made to prevent major trout kills , but we haven't reached the state standards yet for water quality, specifically 6 ppm dissolved oxygen. Right now they can get 3 to 4 ppm from zero coming in.  We'll have to see what the COE report on minimum flow and the EIS says, but from what I understand, any changes to the dams that might need to be made to provide the adequate minimum flow, will also employ the latest technologies to increase dissloved oxygen.  For instance if the house generaters are replaced in some dams, the new house units will be &quot;auto-venting&quot; which employs better technology to entrain atmospheric air into the water in the turbine.  So I think the water quality will be considered when the time comes to makes the improvements.  In the mean-time, the important thing is to acquire the water reallocation.  We can't begin to improve anything without the flow mitigated first.  So it's important that we all get behind the &quot;minimum flow&quot; initiative and get it approved.  That means that all of our concerned stakeholders need to comment to the COE and the appropriate political persons when the comment period arrives. In those comments I suggest you support the minimum flow allocation and express desires to improve water quality to state standards.<br>
<br>
As far the concept brought up by one angler that increased flow of bad water will do more harm than good - let me address that.  The anglers comparison seemed too exagerated.  The person used the only terms &quot;low flow&quot; and &quot;high flow&quot;.  If we were talking about a large volume of water,or &quot;high flow&quot; as the angler said, relative to the size of the channel in one of these tailwaters, that would be a valid point, however we are only talking about a small increase in base flow and that would not push the bad water appreciably downstream.  Also, the slight increase in flow will likely cause better riffle aeration downstream.  Now then, having said that, back to the previous discussion, the water flowing from the dam (s) is of poor quality a few months a year and state standard water should being released from the dam.  Remember that the water quality problems are just seasonal - late summer, and fall, and maybe early winter.  To argue against the adequate minimumflow year-round based on a seasonal problem is probably not a good idea.  Again, first lets work to get the proper flow allocation through the present political avenue.  Then address the water quality issue.  Once we have the water reallocated then we can make sound management decisions on how to use that allocation in any given tailwater.  We'll have to monitor and tweak as needed, and we will have that ability.  <br>
<br>
Well I hope all this oration helps inform folks and I appreciate you bringing these topics to my attention - thanks for being concerned with our trout resources.&gt;<br>

I would say that I'd support most of what they are attempting to do with some criteria. The minimum flow issue is something that has been proposed to increase habitat. This is something that seems to be rather obvious. The more water the more habitat. As long as these concerns are met I think I could give total support to the program.<br>
<br>
1. Currently we have water quality standards set at 6 parts per million. Those minimums are &quot;not&quot; being met by the Corps of Engineers. As long as that continues additional flow will allow more low oxygenated water to be cast farther down river. This issue is compounded by the fact that low oxygen tends to occur in the fall of the year. Thus it greatly effects the spawn every year. Last year the DO issues basically destroyed the spawn below Bull Shoals dam and greatly effected the spawn on the Norfork.<br>
<br>
2. Additional water will create a different river. This will mean we will be forced to change the way we fish. The fish that are in the river will hold on the current habitat. Generally the preferred holds are in the center of the river or in the deeper pools. The additional water will effect considerably our ability to sight cast to fish. For some people this may not be an issue but it would all but eliminate the way that many of us earn our living.<br>
<br>
3. Additional water would change the level of &quot;wadeable&quot; water. I guide people every day that have issue with their ability to wade in certain sections of the river. In many of the preferred holds we &quot;have&quot; to cross the river in order to fish. Limited access requires us to wade the river to get to where the fish are. Crossing to the island at Rim Shoal is tenuous already. Additional water would make it impossible for some people.<br>
<br>
These are not impossible issues to be worked around. We could add additional Catch and release areas to make up the difference to loss of our water. SWPA and COE could insure water quality standards. We as guides and fly fishers could start fishing from drift boats like many of the western fly fishers have become accustomed to. However I'd like to have some assurances that these are going to take place before I feel comfortable in placing my full support behind minimum flow. I definitely believe that AGFC is entitled to mitigated flows. They should be allocated a percentage of the available acre feet to do with as they please. <br>
<br>
In summary I am really close to supporting this program. At this point I feel as though there are a few questions still to be answered. Darrell is a very qualified biologist and my friend. I'm sure that he is looking at the big picture for the river. My concerns are selfish but fly fishing is the way I make my living and I'm &quot;worried&quot; that it will be greatly effected by minimum flow.<br>

Most lamprey that I've delt with released a fish as soon as it was hooked. I rarely get one to the net. I would imagine that would be pretty much the same thing in a shocking program. <br>
<br>
Secondly, thre is definately an increase in the activity of late in the lamprey on the Norfork. It could be as Darrell says and be a seasonal run. Most of my observations are the difference in today vs say 10 years ago. I rarely ever saw a lamprey 10 years ago. Now I see one weekly.<br>

  Trust Darrells' judgement in the matter. You know he is dead serious about improving our fisheries and from several decades of experience in fighting for minimum flow standards in the Southwest I can tell you that the fishing has improved everywhere it has been attained.<br>
   We all resist change. It is a natural human response, but stop a moment and remind yourself that you had no idea of what would work the first time you fished the Arkansas tailwaters yet you coped with it to the point of becoming a consummate professional. I'm sure you'll have far less trouble adapting to new water levels than we average part time fishermen.<br>
  In every instance that I have witnessed increases in minumum flow standards have resulted in more and bigger fish.<br>
  Darrell summed it up well with, &quot;---the important thing is to acquire the water reallocation.  We can't begin to improve anything without the flow mitigated first&quot;.<br>
  So I'll be writing my letters and posts and pushing for better standards in every way I can. To tell the truth I sorta like the thought of more and bigger fish.

<br>
I don't want to seem like I am resisting change, or a nah-sayer, but this equates to a BIG change. We have been threatened for years with the closure of the Catch and Release areas. If they close the C&amp;R areas and institute consistantly higher water levels, fly fishing on the White and Norfork as we know it will be gone. If they (by they I mean the stake holders as described int the trout management plan) take the plan step by step and include &quot;all&quot; of the items described, we will have one of the greatest trout streams in the world. Hell, we already have the greatest trout stream in the world.<br>
<br>
I'm not suggesting that we don't proceed. Just that we proceed with caution. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I floated the White at Wildcat on the test of minimum flow. Yes, there are some areas you will not be able to reach, but overall all of the waders we saw (12-15) welcomed the flow. better drifts, fish not as picky, etc. In that area it only raised the water level maybe 3-4 inches. And the water seemed to have more turbulence, ie dissolved oxygen as it went over the gravel and rocks. If you need to go to a boat, I will gladly teach you drift boats and with a motor, yes they can have motors, you can go up river. Not as efficiently as the jon boats, true. <br>
I agree we need more areas of restrictive regs. The original plan was for 20% of the rivers, not the 4% we have now. I doubt that will ever happen, but hopefully the regs will come soon and not in 20 years. I really think Darrell wants the best for Arkansas' trout waters. Maybe with all of our help he can leave something our children can be proud of.
