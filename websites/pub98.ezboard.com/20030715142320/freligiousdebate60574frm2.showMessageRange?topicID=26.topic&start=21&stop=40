I am always glad to hear differing perspectives.  I have a wealth of xian friends.  TOO many, really.  I also have several pagans, some UU and even a couple of satanists.  Sadly, none of my Muslim friends (I will confess, co-workers) are very forthcoming about their beliefs.  They do not socialize with most of us, they usually pray at lunch, are very reserved and keep to themselves.  I respect their decisions and try not to pry, but I am <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>*VERY*</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> interested in all I can learn if you would be so kind as to share with us.

I appreacate (boy I can't spell this morning) the information. I took a class on Islam many years ago and remember very little of it and I appreciate another view aside from what we are use to hearing.  If I may ask, where does sin come in in Islam or it even of the importance that christians apply to it?<br>

There's no intermediary, no confessional.  If you sin and want to make up for it, you do your best to do good deeds, but you won't know if it's enough until The Day, when they bring out the scales (except for major sins for which you are punished according to the Shari'ah).  <br>
<br>
Sin, in and of itself, is considered going against the Will of God.  It can take many forms, from adultery to suicide, with the worst one being to associate partners with God.  &quot;Partners&quot; is kind of a loose term, not limted to actual idols or other gods, but also anything that you might put before God, such as money or sex or anything else.  If these things become more important to you than keeping to the religion, then they have become your &quot;gods&quot; so to speak.<br>
<br>
Now that I think about it, rather than focusing on sin, we focus more on personal responsibility, for all actions and all words.  You have to consider carefully what you do, and what impact that could have down the road.<br>
<br>
...and since, in Islam, government goes hand-in-hand with religion, some things that are considered sins are crimes as well, which brings you back to the Shari'ah, and the system of punishment for things that, in other traditions/societies, would be seen as sins, but not crimes.<br>

<br>
I totally believe in the Shari'ah.  Anyone who is truly a Muslim must not only believe in the Shari'ah, but prefer it to any other system of government.  It's not very fashionable to say so these days, and most &quot;moderate&quot; Muslims would probably disagree, but facts are facts, and there it is.<br>
<br>
It would follow that I agree with the Hadd punishments(those that lop off body parts) when they are applied correctly and in the proper context and environment; however this is just the smallest aspect of Shari'ah, but unfortunately the one that grabs the most headlines, and the one that is abused the most.<br>
<br>
What has happened in recent years is nothing short of a travesty, and is as far from what the Shari'ah requires as can be.  It's just so typical, some guys take over the government somewhere, and the first thing they do is start with all these anti-women acts, and frighteningly there are other extremists throughout the world who think this is great.  I think it's disgusting.  There's no knowledge here, no wisdom, no justice, just blood lust and a freakish preoccupation with oppressing women.  <br>
<br>
I'm not an Islamic jurist or Shari'ah expert or anything, but even I know that you can't just set these things up in a vaccuum, nor can you hold people accountable for things outside of a bonafide Islamic society.<br>

His basic argument was that US involvement or interference is slowing or stopping the natural progression of the more closed societies like Iraq and the former Afghanistan so they cannot become democracies like India where Muslims can have free and open debate and take their religion into the next century. <br>
<br>
I guess this goes OT, but I would love to hear your thoughts on how US involvement in the affairs of some Islamic countries has harmed not only that country, but possibly those inside and created the negative image we have.<br>

They are having increasing problems with religious violence, and not the comparatively benign marches or mild riots, but wholesale butchering, burning people alive, impaling babies on spikes, etc.  Of all the conflicts in this world, I must say this is the one that frightens me most, because the Indo/Pak peoples are so passionate (I know, I'm married to one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), can be so violent, and have nuclear weapons, I can't think of a worse scenario...<br>
<br>
I think the societies there are becoming very polarized, and something is going to have to break.  The problem with the participation of the US over there, is that they naturally put forth their own model as the ideal, and advertantly or inadvertantly deride the culture there as backward, lower, less, etc.  So the people are torn, they want to have good lives like Americans, but they want to keep their own cultures at the same time.  You get some people on either extreme, those who reject their indigenous culture, and those who reject American culture, but the vast majority seesaws between the two, depending.<br>
<br>
I think the issue of women's role in society is a perfect example.  In some Muslim countries, women are certainly oppressed, brutalized, etc.  This has no place in Islam, and is soundly condemned by every scholar, past and present.  So the question is what will be the most effective remedy?  To impose a new world outlook courtesy of &quot;The West&quot;, or to call the people to return to what their own faith really requires of them?  Which would be easier?  Which more effective?  If we were to send someone over there to talk about women's rights, would it be more effective to send the president of NOW, or to send an American shaikah (fem of &quot;Shaikh&quot;), someone well-versed in Islamic law?<br>

The age 8 for LDS is given in a book of scripture called the Doctrine and Covenants chapter 68:25.27  Before a child or any person for that matter is baptized LDS.  They have an interview with either the bishop or the missionaries who are teaching them (converts).  They must demonstrate a knowlege of what they are doing and be able to answer basic questions about our beliefs.  This is to assure that they are making the decision on their own.  <br>
<br>
When I was a missionary the oldest person we taught and baptized was a sweet little old grandma at the great age of 82.  So 8 isnt the only age.<br>

<br>
While it's true that before the age of 8 (or around there depending on intellectual maturity) children don't understand abstract concepts like justice, eternity, god, etc. I wouldn't say that turning 8 or even 9 makes you ready to select something as important as religion (or no religion as the case may be). Atheists don't baptize children, but I still can't imaging having a conversation with my dd in a year and a half concerning matters of belief, cognition, ethics, epistomology, the nature of the universe etc. <br>
<br>
Maybe high school is better, but I have to side with JWs on this (though I have not seen them speak here) that you have to be at least a teen to understand and choose this stuff independently. Any 8 year old is going to do what mom and dad say and worship what mom and dad do--especially after a healthy dose of unopposed or challenged indoctrination in the form of Sunday school or catechism or whatever.<br>
<br>

I respect everyones right to believe (or not believe) in whatever they choose.  And I have to say it insults my integrity and intelligence to say that because I think differently than you, I am somehow a maniacal manipulative parent bent on &quot;forcing&quot; my kids to believe as I do.<br>

<br>
Of course I take my kids to SS and of course I share with them my beliefs, but I also teach them that I expect them to find out on their own what they believe.  I hope they will choose my values and beliefs because I am firmly commited to my faith and believe that the religion I practice is of God and I want to be with my kids after this life.  But agency and the ability to think for ourselves is the greatest gift that God has given us and to imply that just because I am religious that I disrespect that gift, is at best uniformed. <br>

Just to clarify on what MamaGadfly (I hope this is what you were meaning ST.) was saying was that JWs don't get baptized until they are in high school, not that they don't teach them until then.  I take my kids with me everytime I go &quot;meeting.&quot; (unless they are sick of course)  We wait for baptism until later so that they fully understand what it means to be baptized.  I have an 8 year old right now and I couldn't imagine her fully understanding all of our beliefs.  <br>
<br>
There is something that is taught at the Kingdom Hall.  I have found it to be what very important to have a relationship with God.  &quot;Make the Truth Your Own.&quot;  I think that this is important, it is saying to take what you learn and seek the truth about it.  Some have found that they can't (DBC),it just isn't there for them, and some have found that it is what there and they can't deny it.  Don't just take someone elses word for it.  It is my hope that my kids find what I have found, but if they don't I don't want them to say they have just for my sake.<br>

<br>
This is exactly how I understood the JW process and reasoning and it is how I will raise my children to be freethinkers. I naturally discuss my beliefs and tell them what I think is right, but would never expect an 8 year old to comprehend philosophy nor theology enough to make that life decision---not just for intellectual reasons, but social. A small child cannot fully separate from his/her parents in this way even if s/he felt it was the wrong belief system.<br>

Regarding my Satanic friends, they are members of the<br>

Essentially they are a group of atheists who believe strongly in personal responsibility, meritocracy, and wearing black.  They believe in the psychological power of witchcraft in that coming home from a bad day of work and stabbing a voodoo doll of your boss is therapeutic but not that your boss will feel the pain or start bleeding out his eyes.  Their high holy days a 1) Your Birthday, 2) the MONTH of halloween, and the standard equinox/solstice days.

brainwashing: 1 : a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas<br>
2 : persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship<br>
<br>
I think this fits quite well.  We are all born atheists otherwise you wouldn’t need to teach these innocents the story of god, would you?  Therefore you are indoctrinating these children to give up their natural atheism and accept your contrasting regimented ideas about the supernatural.  It is forcible because they are not permitted to escape it.  If they ask their primary sources of information (parents) they are not provided logical secular answers and they are never informed (at least not until they are firmly programmed) that there are alternatives.  Otherwise, the alternatives are marketed in a lesser degree so as to make the one you are programming them with appear most desirable.  This is a function of the system, not the parent.  You do what the church tells you to ensure your child’s spiritual safety, what they tell you dates back to the dawning of the church.  The Jesuits (I think I said this before) had a saying, “Give me a child until he is 8 and I will have him for life.”  They didn’t say this as a matter of generous theology, it was a direct implication of the depth youth programming takes hold.<br>
<br>
Good definition, thanks.  I’ll have to keep that for future use.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> take what you learn and seek the truth about it. Some have found that they can't (DBC),it just isn't there for them<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I disagree with this statement.  I have found truth.  Not only have I found truth, but it is backed up by solid science, logic and reason.  Not some musty tome of political agendas that has been revised and beaten against the foreheads of humanity for a couple centuries.  I never cease to be amazed at how simplisticly people accept that in 2 centuries we have learned NOTHING more about the mythical land of heaven.  No angel feather, no footprints of god, no miracles, heck, the guy said he’d be back while people who knew him then were still alive.  The War Santa used to talk to people all the time.  Do you really think any of them are alive today?  Where is the 1,988 year old arab?  Makes Methusela look like a spring chicken.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Yep, we're all brain-washed idiots that can't think for ourselves.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Now that is just rude.  I never called you idiots.  I know many intelligent people who are still brainwashed.  You could easily think for yourselves, but you choose not to.  You can examine the contents of your breakfast cereal with a critical eye and evaluate calories, nutritional content and cost/value ratios.  Yet you examine your food more critically than you do your theology.  You do not challenge, you accept; you do not demand, you supplicate.  <br>
<br>
I would not call you a “maniacal manipulative parent” as Shirene alleges.  I would call you comfortable.  I would call the theological system manipulative.  It is structured to sustain itself.  You are loving, caring, generous people who have been misled by your parents and that same faith engine that misled them.  I respect everyone’s right to believe, but I do not think those beliefs have equal merit even if those people have equal right to hold them.  There are people in the world that would rather let their child die than have a tumor surgically removed.  They have a right to their faith; I have a right not to respect that decision.  <br>
<br>
You want a list of the merits of atheists?  They have many as a group that far exceed those of other demographics.  However, I don’t think that is pertinent to this discussion.  Specifically, I don’t think it is pertinent to you or I because at the root, we are loving parents that want the absolute best for our children.  As a population they list off better, we can just as easily rotate criteria until we find ones not itemized (and thus indefensible) or possibly even ones that are worse for them (though I must admit, I have not found any yet.)  <br>
<br>
Try and think of it this way.  I had cancer, and I survived it.  I broke free of the deadly killer.  I was not lucky and born into a cancer free environment.  My parents lived at a time when they didn’t know that smoking around an infant was bad or what it would do to them for long term health.  Should I not be proud of overcoming such a terrible thing?  Should I not tell those who still chain smoke and blow it into their child’s face?  Now replace all the words cancer and smoke with faith and religion, and you’ll understand.<br>
