Aeli nodded his head.<br>
&quot;alright.&quot; he murmered and went off to have a look at his bow and arrows for the morn.<br>
<br>
What would he ask her to do after leaving the next morning? Stay with Kain? No... Kain would probably sneak off anyways. He could always ask her to go back to her home. <br>

&quot;AH!!! No! Stupid ants!!!&quot; Kain yelled in horror as he saw the bugs in the jar of flour he had  just opened. &quot;Grrr...&quot;<br>

A shadow lurked outside the window... aeli could see something out of the corner of his eye. <br>
Why now?<br>
He quickly slipped outside and looked around. Nothing was visible...or could be heard. But...<br>
Aeli turned around just in time, grabbing a hand that was clutching a jagged daggar.<br>

<br>
Aeli let the strangers hand go. the new-comer was tall. About Aeli's height. He had red eyes and long black hair, white streaks running through here and there. He had hooked ears and two fang-like teeth, one on each side of his mouth, sticking out from under his lips. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you here, vampire?&quot;Aeli said, giving a cold glare.<br>
<br>
&quot;well, i came as a messenger and a challegner. My master says he'd love to see what this power you hold is. He's quite interested. But only if you beat me.&quot; The vampire moved in very close to Aeli, thier faces less than 6 inches apart.<br>
<br>
The vampire leaned over, putting his mouth next to Aeli's ear so that he could feel the vampire's breathing on his neck.<br>
&quot;Of course, if you loose, I get to have my reward.&quot; and he drew away. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mister 'slayer', you are not worthy of the title until you can 'slay' me. Being one of the most powerful vampire that I am, i'm fair. I'll give you you're sweet time. Two weeks tops to get to Tainu lake.&quot;  <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

She froze, her suddenly trembling hand dropping the knife quickly.  Her white wings quivered in fear and her eyes were wide; she was completely speechless.<br>

<br>
&quot;Kaed, get away from her now!&quot; Another cold and even more dangerous glare was sent the vampire's way. Aeli tensed up, about ready to use his energy if needed. <br>

<br>

<br>
Suddenly she felt very naked and exposed.  Her hand went up to cover her ears, pointed and elven, but then she had to cover her hands, her wretched webbed, three fingered hands!  Her large, almond shaped eyes, she shut them, but then she was blind.  Though when she opened them again, she once more met Aeli's worried, confused stare.<br>
<br>
She shrank from his touch, pulling herself to her feet.  &quot;You c-could've been hurt, Aeli...and I...I'm sorry,&quot; she stammered, backing away, seeing Kain blocking her path.  She inched away from him too.  &quot;I really am...excuse me...&quot;   she backed off from both of them, running into the bathroom and locking the door behind her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 505<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/26/03 3:22:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm184.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: He Knows</span><hr size=1> Aeli watched her run inside... as did Kain.<br>

&quot;Aeli? what's  wrong?&quot; Kain asked, staring with wonder.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think... we know too much.&quot; The blue-haired man said, still looking after her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Know what? Is she alright?&quot; Kain questioned, worried now also.<br>
<br>
Aeli got up and started toward the house, Kein following. <br>
Was she upset becuase of Kaed calling her a siren? Aeli pondered. But he already thought she was... that song was by far to beautiful to be of a human's voice. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

Why on earth had she come back inside? Especially in here...the bathroom was small and very confining, and her stomach gave a tiny jolt as she realized she was very much boxed in. She went to open the door, but she heard Aeli's footsteps and froze.  She couldn't go back out there.<br>
<br>
She ran to the small window and opened it, gasping fresh air and crying at the same time.  Bitter crystal tears ran down her cheeks as she wept softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;How could I have been so stupid?&quot; she cursed herself softly.  &quot;I never should have left Lapis...never! Now they know, and the vampire knew..he'll tall Tryphaena...I'll put them all in danger! How could I be so selfish?&quot; she sobbed softly on the windowsill, her voice rising and falling like song.  &quot;The first ones who offer me friendship...and I give them grief,&quot; she muttered under her breath.<br>
<br>
Her tearfilled eyes stared out among the scenery.  It was barely raining now, but a light, cold mist fell, and a rumble in the distance promised more was coming.  <br>
<br>
A sudden urge made her want to open the window a little more and crawl out, she was small enough to just barely fit through.  <br>
<br>
But where would she go? She was afraid that Kaed would come back, and attack her.  She was no match for a vampire.  Or Tryphaena...she could be anywhere...but she couldn't stay here and put Kain and Aeli in danger.  She knew she just met them, but...<br>
<br>
..She cared too much for them to see them hurt.  All because she was a siren.<br>
<br>
Laurena slid to the floor, letting go of the windowsill, covering herself with her wings as she curled up into a ball and tried to make some sense of herself as she cried. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 506<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/26/03 4:13:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm184.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: He Knows</span><hr size=1> &quot;Aeli, are you sure she'll be alright?&quot; Kain asked, hearing soft faint weeping.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't say that she'll be alright.&quot; replied Aeli, his heart felt a little more weighed down than usual. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli! Go cheer her up or something! Gah! Nevermind. You probably wouldn't be much a help. You're all depressing yourself. Too bad Fina or Leon aren't here...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're right.&quot; Aeli sat down on a chair with a sigh. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> I don't know what to do... I hate seeing anyone so sad. Maybe we should've never invited her here.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Should I go-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No Kain, leave her for now.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
She looked at herself in the mirror.  She looked so wretched.  No wonder the Humans hated them...<br>
<br>
She silently looked toward the window, then to the locked door.  Without another thought, Laurena when to the door and unlocked it, so that it could be used.  Then, she hurried two the window, and opened it as far as she would go.<br>
<br>
One of her wings knocked into the sink, and tipped over the soap dish and several other items, that clattered onto the floor quite loudly.  The noise no doubt reached ears outside the bathroom.<br>
<br>
She winced, but was quick to climb up onto the winodwsill, looking down at the ground not so far below.  Looking back for a split second, she jumped out and caught her wings on the breeze, leaving feathers in her wake from trying to fit then through the small square opening.<br>
<br>
She landed in mist, and began running.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 507<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/26/03 7:24:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm184.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> aye, poor laurena</span><hr size=1> Kain peeked his head out of the kitcken. &quot;Diner's done!&quot;<br>

&quot;Alright.&quot; Aeli got up. <br>
He had heard the crying stop and some noise coming from the bathroom. Going up the the bathroom door he tapped on in lightly. &quot;Laurena. If you're hungry dinner's done.&quot; but he got no reply save a silence. <br>
<br>
&quot;Laurena?&quot; He knocked again. &quot;Laurena!&quot; Finally he turned the knob only to open the door and find an empty bathroom. Feathers laid on a portion of the floor like a soft white snow, and a cold wind blew through the open window.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kain! Get the silver daggar!&quot; Aeli rushed towards the dryer and pulled his shirt and coat over himself, then going towards the door and getting his bow and quiver off the shelves.<br>
<br>
Kain came in with the daggar in a holder and rushed out the door ahead of Aeli.<br>
