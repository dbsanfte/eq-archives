His vest and shirt were torn open, his hands and feet bound.  His eyes did not see her, but had the look of one who was seeing another plane of existence...ecstacy and lust blocked out all common sense.  The queen straddled his hips, tying the death necklace around his throat and giggling musically with evil mirth as her fingers toyed with his belt...<br>
<br>
The redhead snarled.  The nymph whore must die.<br>
<br>
She swam up unnoticed as Eevee began to annoy the nymph, her musical screech filling the water.  Faeries on Mahtim were infamous for their gift to annoy, but right now, that wasn't a bad thing at all.<br>
<br>
Several of the queen nymph's guards slinked out form the shadows, bearing no weapons, only their temptation.  Eris cursed bubbles at them as she hacked through their beautiful, but fragile bodies with the golden dagger, nymph blood clouding the dark water immensely.<br>
<br>
She swam through the blood and reached the queen, grimacing as she made a blow for her head from behind.<br>
<br>
But the nymph seemed to feel her presence and grabbed her wrist in a cold death grip, flinging her with amazing strength over her shoulder, sending her spinning through the water.<br>
<br>
The nymph leapt forward form Seifer's body with her own dagger made from crudely carved stone.  She shrieked as she speared through the water and pinned Eris to a rock.<br>
<br>
Eris gasped.  She was not beautiful at all now.  Her hair was a disgusting mottled green, and wild like seaweed, her eyes black and souless.  Her skin was tinged a sick green.  Fangs bared as she smiled smugly at her victim.<br>
<br>
He's mine, little landling, she snarled.  You'd make a nice trophy for my son Eleth...    <br>
<br>
Eris gritted her teeth and gripped the dagger that had almost fallen from her grasp on impact.  The queen nymph saw this and grabbed her wrist, forcing her knife hand still.  She ignored Eevee's attempts to annoy her now, interested in larger fish to fry...<br>
<br>
Her other hand gripped at her throat, choking the remaing breath from her.  The nymph's soulless eyes were livid.<br>
<br>
Give it up, landling, she growled musically.<br>
<br>
Eris' other hand was free! She grabbed at some dirt and rocks on the riverbed and threw them at the nereid's face, blinding her momentarily<br>
<br>
Aaaaaah!<br>
<br>
As the nymph cleared her eyes, Eris grabbed the dagger.  She turned back to the nymph who swiped at her with newly grown claws.  Sharp claws.  They ripped at her face and it stung as she bled, but as the queen came near to finish her off, Eris plunged the golden dagger into the nymph's wretched flesh deep and twisted.<br>
<br>
At first, it didn't seem to phase the queen.   The wretched creature rose her hand again, now holding her own sotne dagger, poising to strike.  But the knife never fell.  Her eyes twitched once, and the nymph coughed green blood from her lips.  Then she went limp on the blade, dead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/9/03 10:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm152.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Eevee</span><hr size=1> After a moment Eevee's annoying comments and constant swimming in and out didn't bother the female nymph anymore...<br>

After a moment of the two struggling, the queen was dead.<br>
<br>
A couple more of the nymphs came out... annoyed to see a faerie.<br>
<br>
&quot;HAHA! Didn't hink a faerie could swim did ya?&quot; She grinned at them, &quot;flying&quot; through the water around them, to Eris.<br>

Kirin could barely see what was going on above... and her lungs were starting to feel pressure.<br>
<br>
She kicked back up to the surface, gasping for air.<br>

She looked up at Eevee and smiled weakly, but the look in her eyes told her she wasn't going to last long without air.<br>
<br>
Nymphs began to emerge from the darkness. Eris raised her dagger, but there was no need.  The nymphs that emerged were peaceful, and wary, like humans stepping outside their doors after a violent storm.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Thank you for defeating Lirinia</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, one said to her, holding her hands gratefully.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She terrorized our city and made us all her slaves.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Do not be faint,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> one handsome male said to Eris, smiling as her eyes fluttered closed from no air.  He came forward and placed a chaste kiss on her lips, his white hair swirling about them, and suddenly she had air again.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Thank you, faerie, also</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, one child nymph said in admiration.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We will sing songs about you to our children about how you pestered the fearful Queen Lirinia!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Eris nodded in appreciation, as she swam forth to Seifer's unconscious form.  She quickly cut his binds, and, after pausing a bit, pressed her lips to his, giving him air.  A bit of color returned to his cheeks.  Taking his large form in his arms, she waved goodbye to the liberated people and began to swim upward, her only concern being Seifer's welfare.  As she ascended, she could hear the musical voices singing,<br>
<br>

She held Seifer close, dragging him to shore where Kirin was.<br>
<br>
She was a mess.  She was soaked, her clothes were stained with nymph blood, and her face bled freely, three clawmarks across her cheek and neck.  She placed Seifer down on the muddy bank, then, weak and gasping, giving Kirin a helpless look, collapsed on top of him.<br>
<br>
The sudden pressure on his lungs made Seifer cough.  His eyes fluttered open, and he coughed water from his lungs.  He remembere vividly what had happened, and looked down in relief to see Eris, sleeping soundly on his bare chest, slimy with green blood.<br>
<br>
He chuckled weakly, stroking her soaked hair gently.  &quot;You have to teach me how to swim,&quot; he whispered, before going unconscious again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/9/03 11:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm152.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Eevee</span><hr size=1> Kirin gasped as she saw both of them go unconsious... she quickly dragged herself over to the two... pulling Eris off of Seifer first...<br>
<br>
She ripped part of her  dress off the botton and wetted it with water, and wiped away the bloo from Eris.<br>
Her finger swept across her neck, and the she placed her hand atop where the scratches were, and said a short &quot;prayer&quot;<br>
<br>
Her hand glowed, and when she looked back down, the wounds were gone.<br>
<br>
Her eyes went big with amazement as she stared... the did the same to all of Eris's wounds.<br>
She went over to seifer and healed him... still with big eyes and a very shicked expression.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you're a healer?&quot; Eevee asked.<br>
<br>
Kirin looked up at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, someone told me i was. I'm also a wind mage... and a prophetess, but i don't know how to control my powers.&quot; Her head lowered, a little embarrassed.<br>

Willow, not hearing the small fairy, applauded Kirin.<br>
&quot;Quite amazing!&quot; <br>
  (the author totally missed out on action due to forgetting to check this sucker) The half nymph had seen most of the group dive into the river and.. besides the large amounts of chaos in the water, everything had seemed to be pretty much in control.. or if it wasn't in control there wasn't much Willow could do to help the situation. Instead she had decided to watch Nina, remembering how intent Thalia and Balder had been to find her it'd be best just to keep an eye on the girl as her two.. guardians of sorts were indisposed for the moment.<br>

Seifer opened his eyes after a few moments, shaking the weariness from his head and then held it as the quick movement caused him to spin.  He looked down at him and stared, recalling his encounter under the water.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was a close call...&quot;  he blinked and glanced at Eris, who lay silent beside him.  His eyebrows creased in worry.  &quot;Eris! Hey, wake up...Eris?&quot;<br>
<br>
He shook her shoulder gently, kneeling over her.  After a moment or two her eyes shot open, and a remainder of water erupted from her lips, and she coughed bitterly until she fell back from the spasm, breathing each breath gratefully.  She looked up at him and the expression of one who has seen an angel flashed in her dazed eyes.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Seif...?&quot; she rasped weakly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yep,&quot; he chuckled softly.  &quot;You okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the weak and innocent act dropped.  Eris lunged at him and pinned him to the ground, her hands fisting around his throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;AM I OKAY? AM I OKAY?&quot;  She growled, pounding Seifer's head into the ground as she strangled him.  &quot;Oh, I'm just FINE, Seif! I can't believe you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ach...Eris...&quot; he choked, going blue.<br>
<br>
&quot;No! You're gonna listen!&quot; she pushed him down into the mud.  She felt the gazes of shock, bewilderment, and maybe even amusement around her, but she didn't care.  &quot;I'm up here, hacking my brains out, worrying myself sick *literally* for your life--&quot; she added, remembering how she'd thrown up.  Okay, that wasn't Seif's fault, but she wanted to make him really guilty.  &quot;--and then I swim what seemed like *leagues* and nearly got raped from some horny river nymph...all to save your ugly hide! And what are YOU doing in the meantime, you aphroditic little bastard!?  You're lockin' lips with the nymph queen! What is wrong with you!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Seifer wasn't scared or looking regretful.  On the contrary, he was laughing.  Or stifling laughter.  His face turned red not from being choked to death by the redhead, but from trying to suppress the deep booming laughter that tried to escape him, at the sight of the insane rage in the girl's eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you laughing at???&quot; Eris demanded.<br>

&quot;No! You're gonna listen!&quot; she pushed him down into the mud.  She felt the gazes of shock, bewilderment, and maybe even amusement around her, but she didn't care.  &quot;I'm up here, hacking my brains out, worrying myself sick *literally* for your life--&quot; she added, remembering how she'd thrown up.  Okay, that wasn't Seif's fault, but she wanted to make him really guilty.  &quot;--and then I swim what seemed like *leagues* and nearly got raped from some horny river nymph...all to save your ugly hide! And what are YOU doing in the meantime, you aphroditic little bastard!?  You're lockin' lips with the nymph queen! What is wrong with you!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Seifer wasn't scared or looking regretful.  On the contrary, he was laughing.  Or stifling laughter.  His face turned red not from being choked to death by the redhead, but from trying to suppress the deep booming laughter that tried to escape him, at the sight of the insane rage in the girl's eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you laughing at???&quot; Eris demanded.<br>
<br>
Too late.  He exploded, his laughter filling the air like happy thunder.  Sitting on top of his quaking ribs, a gleam of laughter filled her own eyes, and she fought hard to erase it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up, Seifer!&quot; she shouted, her voice cracking strangely, a strange, uncontrollable grin foriming at the corners of her lips.  &quot;It's not...shut up! It's...it's not...funny...&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly she burst out laughing too, their joined laughter so loud it scared the birds sleeping in the trees above.  She pounded on his chest with her fists, her eyes filling with tears as she laughed so hard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why in the hell are you laughing?!&quot; she shrieked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no clue!&quot; he roared.<br>
<br>
The others watched them, and everyone could most probably tell that the two friends were both critically insane.<br>
<br>

<br>
Thalia reached the surface, gasping for air.  Her damp, almost black-looking hair hung limply around her as she looked around.  She saw no fight, no nymphs, no nothing.  *What did I miss?...*  She thought, hearing laugter near shore.  She swam over slowly, pacing herself.<br>
<br>
Nina had been watching the scene in awe, smiling to herself, but turned at the sound of rippling water.  &quot;Thalia!&quot;  She said in happiness, running to the riverside and bending down to help her out.  Thalia smiled, swimming towards her.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, something grabbed her leg.  Thalia looked down, narrowing her eyes and expecting another attack, but when she looked, she saw something very different...*Balder?*<br>
<br>
They reached shore and she pulled the tired, soiled man out of the river.  Thalia lay her head on his chest, checking his heartbeat.  He was conscious, but said nothing...he closed his eyes, finally able to rest.  Nina looked on silently, concerned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is he okay, Thalia?&quot;  She asked tentatively.<br>
<br>
Thalia was silent a moment, not wanting to alarm the child.  *He seems all right...* she said, holding his wrist and checking his pulse, *but something is...not right.*<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha -- what do you mean?...&quot; Nina stuttered, scared.  &quot;Balder?...&quot;  <br>
<br>

<br>
The laughter soon died.  Eris looked over at Thalia and Balder, and the ashen color of the man's face. she climbed off of Seifer and made her way towards Balder, still stumbling a little.<br>
<br>
&quot;Balder?&quot;  she said his name loudly, shaking his shoulder.  He didn't answer.  There was a blue tinge to his lips and pallor in his cheeks.  Hm...she took the man's other wrist and felt vigilantly.  Her emerald eyes widened.  Something was definitely wrong...<br>
<br>
&quot;Did the water get to him?&quot; Seifer asked, behind her concernedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know...something's not right...at all...&quot; she said softly, so that Nina didn't hear her.  She looked at Thalia in question.  Eris had seen this before...but refused to believe it was what she thought it was. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zylle@collisionworld>Zylle</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://sc.groups.msn.com/tn/31/50/AnimeFanfictionWriters/d/2c9.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/10/03 8:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm152.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uh Oh...B-Balder?</span><hr size=1> (lol...'tis okay, my dear Kyonae-san! lol...poor Balder, I don't know what's wrong with him either.

<br>
Thalia was confused.  *I don't understand,* she thought to Eris and Seifer alone, cutting Nina out so she wouldn't panic, *it's unlike anything...I've seen before.  You're a healer, aren't you, Eris?  Do you know what this is?*<br>
<br>
Thalia looked at Balder again in concern, angry at herself.  How could SHE, the apprentice Healer of her clan under her sister alone, not be able to recognize this?  It simply was improbable.  *You fool,* she told herself, making it so no one else could hear, *just when he needs your help, you are unable to help him...worthless...*<br>

<br>
Seifer looked back at the two women staring at each other, wondering what the hell they were doing.<br>
<br>
*Except for maybe elvish medicine,* Eris shrugged lightly, her eyes now on Balder with deep sympathy.  (There were no elves to be found in Dratilia after the Terrible Cataclysm,) Eris thought gravely to herself.  (They had all been killed...and then the plague struck...)<br>

She made up her mind.  She looked at Eris again, nodding.  *Let's hurry, then.*  <br>
<br>
Eris nodded back, and they stood again.  &quot;Seifer, help me carry him,&quot; Eris almost ordered, attempting to prop him up a bit.  Thalia tried to help, not realizing he was so heavy.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's going on, what are you doing?&quot;  Nina demanded, watching them.  &quot;Where are we going?  Huh?  What's wrong with Balder?!&quot;<br>

Thalia gave her a scornful look.  &quot;Hush, he'll be fine,&quot; she said.  &quot;My voice...&quot; she muttered, feeling her throat.  Her voice had suddenly returned to her...<br>

&quot;Yeah...yeah.&quot;  She picked up her backpack and slung it over her shoulders.  Eris smiled reassuringly at Nina, holding out her hand for her to take it.
