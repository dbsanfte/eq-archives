“I never seem to fit in they fear me like they fear the cadavers out there and I never seem to fit in with the humans.”<br>

She knew that she was probably slowing the girl in front of her down but a loss of blood and lack of proper food in the past months had taken it's toll on her and the only thing keeping her going right now was that hand relentlessly pulling her along.<br>

As they ran through a tunnel, Taylee knew she wasn't going to be able to go much further, &quot;D-Do you think...we could..s-slow down for a bit?&quot; she managed to gasp out, not even sure the girl would hear her.<br>

Taylee's eyes widened as she saw the girl trapped in what looked like a large spider web. The girl shouted at her, telling her what to do if the thing came back and killed her.<br>
<br>
Still breathing heavily Taylee pulled herself up and stepped closer, careful to keep clear of the web. &quot;I can't just hide and let whatever made this kill you.....there has to be a way to get you out.&quot; She stopped, turning her head to listen for a minute before continuing, &quot;I have a knife..maybe I can cut you out.&quot;<br>

<br>
She rounds a bend and cries out “I am sorry they told me this one was out of service at least I think it was, are you hurt.  I am so sorry I don’t want anyone hurt I want it to be safe down here and with there being no real lighting in this part….”<br>

She had started to look around, her eyes sweeping the dark tunnel, when she heard Vania mention a city. 'Down here?' Taylee thought her eyes coming back to the girl. <br>

She nodded to the were then took the girl by the wrist again, hurring down the hall way. She wasn't quit running but it was more then a jog. She could see the cities glow now, it was muffled by large thick black draps. By these draps stood two men that stopped Vania from passing.<br>
<br>
The look on Vania's face was one of obvious irritation,but she knew the city rules, no ghouls. She quickly gestured for the girl to stay where she was and she pulled the two men aside, fighting with them in a low tone, but the words would have been heard by the girl.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

&quot;Listen, she won't get away. If she tries to run, I will kill her. And I will send words to every gaurd if they see her with out me or trying to leave the city they can kill her as well.

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Vania looked to the girl then looked back at the gaurds and nodded. She walked back to the girl and grabbed hold of her wrist, not hard but firmly, and led her to the draps, stopping only to pull out a thick pair of sunglasses and handing them to the girl. Her words were softer to the girl .</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Your going to want to wear these untill your eyes adjust.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>She then turned back to the gaurds and shouted over. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&quot;By the way, I have another friend coming, she has shoulder length black hair, very petite, send her to my apartment, 34 lot J lower level 4. &quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Vania then pushed open the draps, the substitue uv rays bursting through the dark, for Vania she was used to the change and her eyes adjusted quickly as she stepped into the simulated daylight, pulling the girl along with her. <br>
<br>
The change of scenery was drastic, as trees, and plants littered the tunnels, fresh water ran ahead in a large fountain, which stood in the center of the crossing of two tunnels. Most of the tunnels appeared to be hand carved, and others were from the subway. Though the ones that remained hand carved held stairways that led further down, where as the subway tunnels remained one level, containing shops and water stops. The tunnels were filled with people, laughing and walking about, little kids running after one another. <br>
<br>
Vania stood still for a moment to let the girl take everything in before jerking her forward and hurrying through the crowds, turning off into a dug tunnal and down the stairs. The light seemed to never end, and never get dim as she walked down the 4 flights of stairs. Soon however she came to the opening of a lower tunnel. These did not stretch as far and you could see the end of it. <br>
<br>
They were lined with small cave like homes, most decorated with window plants and small vegetable gardens. And down the center of the path ran a small river that diappears under the ground. Bridges crossed the wated to give a way over to the other side of the tunnel where more homes lay. Vania pulled on the girls wrist again to grab her attention and crossed one of the many bridges, walking down the hall to her small apartment. The door consisted of no more then a heavy black drap, that matched her makeshift curtains. She had no plants decorating the place. She pushed past the curtain, and found a piece of cloth to cover her lamp, dimming the light in the room for the girl.<br>
<br>
Vania quickly began removing her weapons, tossing them on her bed which was no more then a few layers of cloth, no pillow, her house was sickenly dull, no decoration, unless you counted her weapons where were pilled in a corner. The only weapon not in that corner was her Katana which as she removed it she hung it on a peg close to her bed. It was then that she turned to face the girl, gesturing for her to sit as she herself sat down on her bed, pulling a cigarette out from the corner of her bed. She placed to her lips and lit it, taking in a deep drag and exhaling before speaking. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

She'd seen the looks they'd given her even though she couldn't quite make out most of what was said and knew they weren't happy about her being there.<br>
<br>
She stood staring at the wonders around her. It was almost like the world used to be. Taylee looked up, squinting even with the sunglasses that she now wore, unable to wrap her mind around what she was seeing. A sharp tug on her arm pulled her eyes back to the other girl.<br>
<br>
They began moving through the people and down other tunnels, and if it hadn't been for the girl's constant pulling her along, Taylee would have just stopped in place. <br>
<br>
Eventually they reached what must be the girls home and went inside. Taylee stood by the door and watched as the girl removed several weapons. Still in shock from what she'd just seen, she hadn't moved since the other girl let go of her, until the girl gestured for her to sit, then began to speak <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I know you have questions, but first, tell me your name.

&quot;You are in one of the many human cities spread about the states. You see, some of us were lucky enough to stumble upon these cities by accident, and the rest were brought to them. This city however is near its capacity, yet there are still hundreds of people wandering around above, struggling to survive. It is my job to bring them below, and give them shelter. You will live here, with me, if you chose to stay. We are building and expanding to make room for more, but you must earn your own cell. You however will have a hard time gaining their trust, because you are a ghoul. I suppose you could call this the first of many heavens. We have no name for this city though I am afraid. <br>
<br>
How this came about? How it is possible? Well, when the war first started, we were able to salvage generaters from above along with other things. A group of scientists we brought down first to find a way to turn dark into light. I do not know all the specific details, I never really paid much attention to the history of this city. All I know is that the only reason any of this works is because of three specific generators powered by water. Perhaps in time you will be allowed to know  their locations but for now this is all I can entrust with you. For you see, even though you think you might be free from your enslavment, you still have vampire blood running in you. You will never be a vampire, and you will never fully be human again. I hope this has answered your questions, but I believe we have more company.&quot;<br>

'Choice?' Taylee thought bitterly, 'what choice. I knew there was a catch back in the park...but I didn't have a choice then either. It's either this or what...go back out there alone.
