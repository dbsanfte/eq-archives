&quot;Trout guides charged with fishing violations<br>
MOUNTAIN HOME - At the close of a seven month undercover operation by wildlife officers from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, 26 area trout guides have been charged with a total of 89 fishing violations. A total of 26 people have been charged with various violations relating to trout fishing.<br>
<br>
Twenty six charges have been issued for four people in Izard County, 46 charges for 14 people in Baxter County and 17 charges for eight people in Marion County.<br>
<br>
The guides are accused of violating a variety of regulations such as over possession limits, littering, retaining fish in a catch and release area, wasting edible portions of fish, possession of filleted fish, culling of rainbow trout, baiting with game fish, use of barbed hooks in a catch and release area, transfer of trout by guides, as well as several other violations. The violations arising out of this investigation are ones uniformed officers normally would be unable to catch. <br>
<br>
The Special Operations Unit of the AGFC organized operation “Repeat” which utilized officers from different parts of the state. The investigation was conducted from August 2002 through February 2003 as a follow up to “Operation Rainbow” which concluded in February 2000.<br>
<br>
The undercover operation was organized due to continued complaints from the public and outfitters regarding violations on the White and Norfork Rivers. Officers participating in the operation called and booked guided trips with various outfitters in the area. The guides were assigned by the outfitter to take the officers out for a fishing trip. Although several guides did violate specific fishing regulations, officers reported on several occasions that guides would not allow the officers to violate the fishing regulations.<br>
<br>
This action was in direct response to the continued complaints local officers received from the public and from outfitters. One of the most common comments the AGFC receives is a call for more law enforcement.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Looks like AGFC actually is out there watching afterall.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I can say that I was offically the &quot;first&quot; guy checked opening day at 12:01 am. The same guy checked me 3 more times that day and one of his buddies checked me twice. Do you remember how many ticket they wrote last year? Holy smokes, I bet they wrote 50 tickets in one day just in the C&amp;R area. <br>
<br>
Some of the guides there &quot;willfully&quot; operate outside the law. I'm not talking about forgetting to mash down a barb. Anyone fishing in the C&amp;R area with bait ought to be written up. No telling how many bait rigs I've found laying hung up on rocks after they've run some water. That just irritates the heck out of me. <br>
<br>
I can see the AGFC is slowly but surely keep increasing the pressure on guides to follow the laws. They doubled the point values last year for violations. Pretty much if you are caught &quot;willfully&quot; breaking the law you could lose your guide privledges. For us guides that means if I have clients tying on barbed hooks in a C&amp;R area, and they catch me doing it, I'm out of business. <br>
<br>
I hope that the law breaker guides finally understand that they are serious this time. I would like to see them take it a little easier on you guys out there with just general fishing licenses. I've seen guys get written up for minor infractions that were really close. Several guys got tickets last year for barbed hooks. I know the guys that got caught and they weren't using them on purpose. They'd just been up all night and got forgetfull. I guess the law is the law though. I respect the job that AGFC is doing and they have my full support.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
It would appear the AFGC gets a little over zealous sometimes.  But, you know if they didn't patrol as they do then the situation on the river would be out of control.  Not everyone has the respect for the law and the environment that you have.  Guides who &quot;willfully&quot; disregard the regs shouldn't be guides.  It's a little like a driving instructor who tells his student it is ok to run a stop sign.  It isn't.  An oversight is one thing and willful disregard is another.  <br>
<br>
Just curious about something.  What kind of boats do the AFGC ride in on the White?<br>

<br>
Yes there are some guides who break the law daily.  I'd like to see them taken out via 18 points.   <br>
There are tons of rumors going up and down the river.<br>
Wardens showed up on our dock 4/25 for one of our guides but they did not get their facts straight.  Had his DOB, picture, guide lic # wrong.  <br>
One of our guides called the Baxter Co DA's office and according to her there are some serious violations.  IE: 40 fish given to the wardens in their boat.  I'll bet that when tis is all said and done there will be a fewer guides on the rivers.  <br>
<br>
Next monday our guides are having a meeting with AF&amp;G so that we may ask Questions and clear up some of the grey areas.  Does anyone have any questions they would like me to ask.  I will post the questions and the answers on this board.  Feel free to e-mail me with questions as well.  This is not an open public meeting but is a closed ones for the guides at our dock ....<br>

<br>
When the rules first came out (and still I guess) the warden on the scene is allowed some latitude as to the amount of points assesed to the guide. The only thing that makes me a little nervous about the whole thing is that if you made a mistake you are left to the mercy of the warden. <br>
<br>
If I have 3 guys fishing with me and one of them gets sighted for fishing with a barbed hook I get violated as well. If the warden sees fit I am assesed double points for the infraction. I'm not sure what the penalties for all the laws are but it sure has me on my toes with people I take fishing. <br>
<br>
If I took a bunch of guys into the C&amp;R area and we caught a bunch of fish on bait and then had a shore lunch in the parking lot by cooking the browns we caught that would be one thing. But having my license revoked because a client didn't mash down his barb is something totally different.<br>
<br>
I think that the new rules were set in place to limit the number of rogue guides we have in the first place. I'm not sure how much good it will do anyway. If those guys are into breaking the rules why would they buy a guide license? <br>
<br>
Gaston's has one of the highest reputations on the river bar none. I doubt very seriously that AFGC is going to concentrate their efforts towards those guides. If I were in enforcement I would be looking at the guys that ran shady operations. I guess it might be easier to identify a guide/client trip since you guys have a big &quot;Gaston's&quot; logo on the side of the boat. For Gaston's guides to be singled out just because they are easy to identify would be totally unfair in my book. I don't think those are the guides that they are looking for.<br>

Wasn't me. I was in the hospital with my little one until Friday. Although I understand that they re-ran the show with Will and I again last week on the Outdoor Channel. I got a bunch of calls about a 6 year old landing a 10lb rainbow so I assume that was the show.<br>
<br>
There is a fine line on enforcement that the AGFC is going to have to walk here. I got checked probably 50 times last year in the C&amp;R area by the dam. Poachers and deliberate rule breakers are going to do it on the sly not out in the open. I would imagine thay are going to catch many more who &quot;accidentally&quot; break the rules by simply making spot checks like that. That is why I really like to see those sting operations. The guys that they ticket are the &quot;deliberate&quot; rule breakers.<br>

<br>
Well it's offical, I need your help! I got a call from TL today and they want me to guide in the St Jude. They are going to float from Rim to Buffalo City which is a stretch of river that I am totally unfamiliar with. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

How about a quick course?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I know the river down to shoestring shoals but have never seen it from that point on.   Did you get my e-mail???<br>
<br>
As to your guiding 3 in the C&amp;R area.   You are not responsible it one of your FF'ers puts on a barbed hook without your knowledge.  The only way you would be responsibe is if you aided or abetted.  Double points outside of the C&amp;R area are only for harvest violations.<br>
<br>
It also appears that there may be two guides who will loose their licenses.  <br>
<br>
Apparantly one guide cleaned 44 fish and gave it to the undercover officers.  This one should loose his privilages for life in my opinion.  No one on our dock was cited. <br>
<br>
At the end of the day if you have fish in your livewell and your fishers decide that they don't want to keep them the wardens will not write a citation for letting loose the live ones.  They could but they won't.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfishar>FlyFishAR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#000000>(5/7/03 7:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://boards.justflies.com/Images/4/4551Photo1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Jimmy:<br>

<br>
In the 2003 Guide book available at flyshops, resorts, tackle shops and Tourist info Centers AF&amp;G suggest that if the barb can pass through a cloth your good to go.<br>
(not a quote)  However most of the time they will just look at the barbs.  I was checked in Feb and most other guides I know have never had the Cloth check.  <br>

I was checked for barbless hooks last year in a trophy area, then I noticed Phil Lilley from Lilley's landing - Taneycomo also posted a note on it.  Luckily I had tied the fly on a cheap hook with the barb smashed down good, and &quot;passed&quot; the test.  I just thought it was a bit extreme.  Some of those barbs would have to be ground off with a Dremel to successfully pass the material test without snagging.  I know I've tried to smash barbs on good hooks, and it can be a chore of you don't have a good pair of pliers.<br>
<br>
I don't get down on the White as often as I like as I live and work in Cassville.  I hit Beaver TW when Roaring River is just too packed to tolerate.   <br>
<br>
