 Pretty Young Thing---meeting each other<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Day 1---<br>
It was summer and very hot out side, i didn't know what to do because i <br>
was so bored just sitting around and doing nothing. I went to go turn on<br>
the radio to Magic F.M. and it was talikn' about Michael Jackson.<br>
&quot;why the heck do people always have to make fun of him?&quot;<br>
I just kept asking myself that for a long time, i listened very close and hung on to every word they said.<br>
&quot;Michael Jackson's going to be in Denver at the Pepsi center, signing autographs, singing some songs, so stay tuned for the winning tickets, we will also give out backstage passes to the winner&quot;.<br>
After the people on the radio said that, i stayed tunned for anymore information. While i wait, i will tell you about myself. since i don't like to say or tell people my real name, i use the name Roxy or Tia, all my friends call me those two names but never my real name. Why you ask?<br>
well because i never told anyone and never will so just remember that. I am also in tottal LOVE with Michael Jackson, i would do anything for him, i have just some of his CDs and hope to get more. I am 17 years old and my best friend is Emily, i have a crush on this guy at my school and we also have a school dance comming up! I might as well go shopping or something later. The thing about MJ was finally back on.<br>
&quot;i hope i end up winning the tickets&quot; i said to myself.<br>
&quot;this is Magic with more information, if you call now and name a song <br>
you win two tickets and two backstage passes&quot; the girl on the radio then repeated herself. I tryed to call in but the damn line was busy, i just kept trying and nothing. It apears that some one eles just won, i was so <br>
bummed out. &quot;this really fricken' bites!&quot; i was so upset for the rest of the <br>
day. <br>
...........................................................................................................................<br>
Day 2---<br>
I ate and got border by the minute, the concert was in a couple of days and i was not going. out of all people why couldn't i go? I jus had to think of something to do besides sit around so i guess i will have to go to the mall with Emily and check out guys along the way of just looking around. I then called Emily,<br>
&quot;hello?&quot; Emily said.<br>
&quot;hey! how are you?&quot; i asked just thinking of that concert.<br>
&quot;i'm good and you?&quot;<br>
&quot;i am just fine, you wanna go to the mall and hang out?&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah sure, well i better get ready talk to you later?&quot; she said fast<br>
&quot;yeah ok um i will come get you?&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah, bye Tia&quot;<br>
&quot;bye Emily&quot;.<br>
We didn't talk that long because Emily is the type of person if you ask about the mall she will want to go in an instint. <br>
I then grabbed my moms keys and told her where i was going then i left to get Emily and then the mall. At the mall we saw so many clothes to look at. My plan was to get something nice then at the end follow Michael to his hotel room. I was hoping my friend would come with me<br>
because i was to scared to go on my own. <br>
&quot;wow! Emily what about this dress?&quot; <br>
&quot;your going to go see him in that thing?&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah, well........i might&quot;<br>
&quot;&quot;so you going to tell me your real name Roxy? because i always call you Tia and or Roxy&quot;<br>
&quot;NO! either of those two names are fine&quot;<br>
&quot;gee wiz but i am your best friend&quot;<br>
&quot;Emily best friend or not? no out of the qeustion&quot;<br>
&quot;ok Tia, Roxy who ever the hell you are&quot;<br>
we both then laughed and finally had our dresses picked out. Then we walked in to a toy shop to look around because i like to collect some things. I saw alot of toys around, i just wanted to look not get it. With out any one knowing, Michael walked in to the store.<br>
&quot;to bad i didn't call the radio station fast enough, i wanted to go so bad&quot;<br>
&quot;i know, same here but we are going to still try to follow Michaels limo&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah, i would do anything to meet the King Of Pop himself&quot;<br>
&quot;i wonder what he will think of us&quot;<br>
&quot;well Michael Jackson is cute and nice so i don't really care, i wouldn't blame him if he just shut the door on our faces&quot;.<br>
Michael heard the whole thing so he decided to watch us. He thought we were interesting to watch.<br>
&quot;Girl i don't know about you but i am so hungry i could just eat up MJ&quot;<br>
&quot;me to but i hope he wouldn't mind because i get first dips! oh wait he will be all done by the time he gets to you&quot; i said evily<br>
&quot;no i'm sure theres plenty of MJ to go around&quot; emily told me<br>
&quot;no because i don't share my men! especially Michael&quot; i told her<br>
Michael laughed the whole time, he knew we ment we wanted to like sleep with him and all that other kinds of stuff. He knew we would never really eat him eat him up. Emily and I heard some one laugh so we went to go ask what was so funny, we knew the person was laughing at us.<br>
&quot;excuse me..........&quot; i started to say.<br>
&quot;yes?&quot;, he said firmly trying to fake his voice to sound like someone eles<br>
&quot;may i ask what is so funny?&quot;<br>
&quot;nothing, it's just that you two were talking about Michael&quot;<br>
&quot;do you have something against him or something?&quot;<br>
&quot;oh no....i....i um.........&quot;<br>
&quot;why are you wearing a disguise?&quot;<br>
&quot;because..........&quot;<br>
&quot;I then stood there thinking why while Emily pulled off the disguise alittle bit so we can just see the face. <br>
&quot;your......your..........&quot;<br>
&quot;yes i am, i'm Michael&quot;<br>
I then walked fast out of the shop and went quickly over to a jewlry shop because i just wanted to go look at necklesses. Emily on the other hand followed me out and then went to hide. Michael also followed me.<br>
&quot;wait!!! stop&quot; Michael asked me<br>
&quot;yes?&quot; i said very shyly<br>
&quot;i wanted to apolagize for what happened i am so sorry&quot;<br>
&quot;no i should be sorry, i walked away and stuff&quot;<br>
&quot;Tia can we go eat now i am hungry?&quot; Emily asked while hidding<br>
&quot;after i get this neckless........&quot; i told her.<br>
I then looked at the tag, it was expensive.<br>
&quot;Nevermind i can't get it not enough money&quot;i said once again<br>
&quot;well Tia, thats what happens when you go shopping for MJ&quot; Emily said<br>
she started laughing and i just stood there emberresed.<br>
&quot;i will buy it for you, its the least i can do for you&quot; Michael said sweetly<br>
&quot;if you want&quot; i said still blushing.<br>
&quot;ok give me the neckless&quot;. he had a big smile.<br>
I then gave him the neckless and he paid for it and we all walked out of the store together and went to the food court, Emily and i ordered the same thing. When Michael saw what we ordered, he decided for the same thing also. I was suprised that he wanted to hang with us.<br>
I then saw to hot guys walking our way, as they got closer they said hi<br>
to us. <br>
&quot;can we sit with you?&quot;<br>
&quot;sure go ahead&quot;<br>
They sat down and i kept looking at one of them as Emily looked at the other. We got to know each other and i got asked out and i said yes.<br>
I gave him my number. Michael looked a bit sad but i couldn't think of a<br>
reason why.<br>
&quot;well i better get going Emily you better come if you wanna make it <br>
home tonight&quot;<br>
&quot;no you go ahead, some one here will give me a ride&quot;<br>
&quot;ok bye then&quot;<br>
i then walked over by Michael and gave him a hug. I told him i would still meet him in his hotel room, he gave me all the information to make<br>
sure i got it right, I then gave him a kiss. But first before the hug and the information, Michael had walked me to the car and told me all that, then the kiss. I then got in the car with out saying much eles or doing much eles and headed off home. <br>
...........................................................................................................................<br>
Day 3---<br>
All day i was waiting around the house, I was sad because i couldn't go<br>
to his concert. I really had my heart set on it. I was just happy because<br>
i was going to sneak to his hotel room. I even thought of ideas to get in with out everyone bing right there to stop me. It was finally time for the concert to start so i turned on the tv and sat down to watch it.<br>
Michael looked so cute and i just wanted to kiss him that night. I had a<br>
feeling inside of me from all his moves he was doing, i kept getting all<br>
excited and everything. Since i was an hour away from Denver, i kind of <br>
left early and i was all dressed up. I went straight to his hotel room and<br>
waited for him to come. I kept thinking what i was doing, i was kind of confused. I was waiting at his hotel door, luckly there was no guards here, they were with Michael. I knew the guards would orignally tell me<br>
no or something or not let me in. Michael was now finally leaving the<br>
concert. The fans outside Practically tryed to follow him and actually<br>
managed to make it here with him. The guards and other people were <br>
trying to block people from getting inside because they were not going<br>
to check out a room. As Michael got in, he finally made it to his door.<br>
I was lucky because i was the only one up there with him. The guards<br>
were blocking the people down there.<br>
&quot;hi, come in&quot;<br>
&quot;ok thanks&quot;<br>
I then followed him in and sat down on his bed.<br>
&quot;wow, you look buaetiful&quot;<br>
&quot;thanks&quot; i said blushing<br>
&quot;so what would you like to do?&quot; he asked sweetly<br>
&quot;well what do you do for fun?&quot;<br>
&quot;watch cartoons or movies, just regular stuff&quot;<br>
&quot;ok can we do that then? if not i can always get your autograph and go&quot;<br>
&quot;yes of course&quot;.<br>
We then put in a movie and watched it, it was scary i kept hidding underneath the blankets because everytime i tryed to put my hand over<br>
my face, Michael tryed to take it off. We both just stayed under the blankets the whole time. I ended up falling asleep, i wasn't supose to i was meaning to go home after the movie. Michael fell asleep to, i ended<br>
up rolling into his arms.  <br>
