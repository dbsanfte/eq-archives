And also, it was their time to die. Everyone has a time to live, and a time to die. You know that, Wilhelm. It was their time to die. If you hadn't have killed them, someone else would have.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't give my trust out as easily as you think, Wilhelm,&quot; Anna began earnestly, ignoring the fact that Exilia was digging her claws into her lap. &quot;On my clients, I actually just use a spell so that they think I trust them. With every person, Wilhelm, I only start out with an inkling of trust, and let them build or take away. With patients, I keep the spell until I'm sure I can trust them. With people, I just keep my old opinion until it is built or taken. Wilhelm, you have done nothing to build of the opinion I had of you back in school days. But neither have you done anything to take away from it.&quot;<br>
<br>
One of her slight, slender hand petted the cat Exilia's black fur gently as the other hand scratched under her white chin. Playfully, she saw Wilhelm's hand and pounced pon it. Anna inwardly smiled, knowing that the cat's claws were soft as a feather and as thus could not hurt her friend. <p><b>Okay. C’mon, let’s go join Moony now, shall we?

Failed time and time again? You may believe people have a time and that's a nice philosphy but it does not carry wieght in my world. I saw fathers and brothers as I shot them down anna. Have you ever seen a man's face when he's dying. Screaming for his last breath.  I even killed my own men anna. There was a tank shot. They were in so much pain. They just wanted it to end. So I ended it. I killed even children anna. The french resitance went as young as 10 years old. I found out later what our country had done to the jews. Six million people slaughtered anna, while we were told of relocation camps. Was it there time?  I wish it had been...&quot;  Wilhelm did not finish it with &quot;my time&quot;. She could guess for he knew she was smart. <br>
<br>
Wilhelm sighed at the cat. A look of warmth. Just wanting to hold something , somehow. Just to feel warmth again. Yet wilhelm's hand came back and rested on his side. Wilhelm's eyes held bags now. From nights filled with the screams of victims of war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/pastel/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.threadControl?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/pastel/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="hoggiesreunionfrm13">The Sea<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm3">The Pot de Moutarde Hotel<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm4">Aprés L'école Diner<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm5">Hoggies Reunion Masquerade Ball<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm12">Diner avec Fleur<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm6">Livre Café<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm10">THE CHOCOLATE WARS!!!<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm14">Sharin Marr's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm16">Kerri McField's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm18">Jena Skye's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm17">Aldalfel Remedus's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm15">Jonathan Desmond's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm19">Tara Hallow's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm1">General OOC<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm2">Poll Room<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm8">Subbies!<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm9">Rules<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm11">Classified Information<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm20">The Dungeons</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bhoggiesreunion>Hoggies Reunion</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6>Livre Café</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
