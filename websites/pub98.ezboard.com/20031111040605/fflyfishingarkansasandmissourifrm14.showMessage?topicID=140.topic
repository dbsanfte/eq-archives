Missouri&quot; but I thought I'd share a little about a trip this morning for bass out here in Osage County, Oklahoma.<br>
<br>
My old fishing partner Steve Huston and I got out to the Smith Ranch this morning about 6:15 which is still pretty much pitch black dark in these parts.  I know the sun is probably up already in Little Rock at 6:15 but not here.  Anyway, using the headlights from the truck to see, I try my key in the lock that protects the &quot;Kelso&quot; part of the ranch and is home to the &quot;Big Pond&quot; and it obviously is not the right lock and doesn't work.  Steve hops out with his mega key ring that has probably thirty keys and says he might have a &quot;master&quot; that will fit.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, out of the darkness, three Cowboys ride up out of nowhere and the first one steps off his horse while it's still coming to a stop, you know, like he's going to hog-tie a steer and explains that they were moving cattle today and didn't want anybody working bird dogs or something and opens the gate for us.  It is amazing watching somebody who makes his living on the back of a horse.  Pure poetry in motion.  These guys don't ride ATV's out here, occaissionally you'll see someone riding by in that not quite a gallop but still pretty quick, purposefull, need to be somewhere manner...<br>
<br>
The Smith Ranch is several thousand acres sitting among other ranches of several thousand acres in what natives call &quot;The Osage&quot;.  The opportunities for running into anyone at 6:15 are between slim and none.  Only three of us have fishing leases and I usually fish with one of those three and have never seen the other guy.  This is pretty lonely country.  Steve and I both thought running into the cowboys had pretty much used up any luck we might have had.<br>
<br>
But it didn't.  We were both throwing Whit Hair Frogs and Steve caught eight bass and I caught nine and we each lost count of Green Sunfish and Hybrid Bluegills.  The bass were in awesome shape, not fat, but nicely proportioned and generally falling in the two to three pound range.  My biggest was an honest three, maybe a little more, but even the smallest ones were in the pound and a half range.  Things pretty much shut down when the sun cleared the ridge about 7:30, but we had each caught probably twenty fish in that first hour.  Even the &quot;perch&quot; put up a good fight, in fact, I had a Sunfish make my drag scream!<br>
<br>
Anyway, we left about 8:00 and I showed Steve some of the ponds we could have gone to had the Cowboys not showed up and while touring around on the Ranch roads, saw deer, coyote, quail, turkey, and pheasant.  Just a beautiful morning out on the prairie...<br>
<br>
Hope you all had good fishing today also,<br>

<br>
You bring back some memories.......<br>
<br>
I grew up in West Texas. My God Father is one of the ones that taught me how to fly fish. When we weren't driving a thousand miles to fish Southern Colorado for the weekend (uggh that could be punishing) we were hitting the lakes of west Texas for &quot;green trout&quot;. My mother bought a ranch in the Texas hill country. She has two miles of the Llano river which is the center of Guadalupe bass country. My dad bought another place in Kansas a few years ago with a massive farm pond on it. <br>
<br>
All of the time that I can remember fishing with my &quot;family&quot; have been hitting some of those warm water spots for bass and brim. My God Father ultimately died on the road in New Mexico driving to the San Juan River. An older gentleman pulled out in front of him on the highway outside of Roswell. He was a terrific father to his children and friend to my dad. He is still sorely missed even though it was decades ago now.<br>
<br>
Those were memories I hold dear. There were both good and bad times. Remembering the fly fishing brings them all together. Thanks for the walk through the past.<br>

Will do some of it myself this weekend. I plan to float tube on the Wichita Mountain Wildlife refuge this weekend. Small largemouth and 4 or 5 types of sunfish. Poppers and wild colored bead heads with materials like pink estaz bodies and hot pink marabou tails; the louder the better for the sunfish. The Refuge is about to get really cool this Fall. There's a little lake between two mountains where the Bull Elk get on each mountain and bugle at each other. Makes me glad to be alive and a flyfisherman. The two neatest sounds in nature are the cry of a loon and the bugling of an elk.<br>
