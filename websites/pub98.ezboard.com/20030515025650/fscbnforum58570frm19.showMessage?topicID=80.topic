<br>
Misha was true to his promise.<br>
After entertaining themselves in the city, he took Osla to the beach.  His well trained thugs and guards hovered discretely  some distance away.  Unlike the natives who had looked askance at her nickname for her Mikhail, her Michael, his family did not even bat an eye.  These also did not immediately look on her as potential meat.  She was the Don's personal friend.  It did not matter what her gender was, or who she was or wasn't nice to.  She got respect period.  More than she was used to without having to fight for it.  Her whispered reputation probably didn't hurt, but it wouldn't have been needed.  Even Angelique's waspish needling could not undermine her possition.  And she did not take Angelique all that seriously after all this time anyway.  Angelique had a position to defend, Osla couldn't care less.<br>
The stars were bright and twinkling, and she could see across the bay to Monterey and Carmel.  Even for the dead of winter, here in California, the coast was almost balmy and tropical to her.  She stripped off her shoes and stretched her toes out in the wet sand.  Michael walked carefully in the dry sand above the tide line.  She laughed at him, a warm deep rich chuckle, and he smiled ruefully back at her.  &quot;Another time my friend,&quot; he whispered softly, knowing she could hear him.  &quot;Appearances mean too much here.  Another time and another place, where people do not know me, and I will walk with you.&quot;  She grinned in the dark and yawned widely again, black tongue curling and stretching cat like to catch the tastes of the night.  It was a bad animalistic habit she refused to curb.<br>
They were odd friends she knew.  A mismatch of the grandest kind.  But unlike her wolven cousins, she understood that there were greater evils in the world.  The wolves were to impassioned, to caught up in modern battles.  They had forgotten that even lions and gazelles drank from the same watering hole when the lion was fed.  They forgot that the crocodile could not be blamed for eating the unwary or brazen.  As well, growing up where and how she had, she was not scared or intimidated by ghosts and spirits.  <br>
Warmed by the stars above and the whiskey within Osla laughed again at the workings of the world.  She stalked up the beach to her long time friend.  The guards could not help but watch, even though they tried to hide it.  How long had they known each other? 25? 30 years?  Was she getting that old?  He she knew was much older, although it had always seemed that she was the eldest.  Her mellow humor tolerated his business drive.  She was sad that he could not come play with her as once they had, but she was patient.  Reaching Misha she threw her arms around him.  Despite his show of indifference, she grinned at the twinkle in his eye.  With a devilish wink at the closest guard, she stripped off her expensive suit as well, taking the time to fold it neatly before handing it all to Michael.  With a wink and a switch of her hips, she strode down to the surf, whiter than the sea foam.<br>
The water was colder than she had expected given the temperate climate, but warm enough that she was not even uncomfortable.  A great white shark recognized a greater predator and veered away.  A pod of dolphins playing with moonlight and waves, realized she was not hunting and chatted and gossiped.  They bitched about the elephant seals just to the North who acted liked they owned the water, even though they were only seasonal visitors.  Interest peaked, Osla started north, then she hesitated.  Treading water in the surf, like a seal, she looked back to Misha standing thoughtfully on the sand.  Her dark tongue flicked the salt water from her lips, and she blew a shrill trilling whistle that meant &quot;reconnaissance&quot; in an old code they had shared.  He looked out toward the water and nodded.  She watched him for a moment as he set her clothes on a sea bleached log near by and sat next to it.  Then she threw herself back into the water and with long deliberate strokes swam out past the breakers and the lighthouse.  Once she was well out in the bay she shifted.  With a body now built as much for driving through the water as covering huge distances on land, she was at Ano Nuevo in short time.  She sauntered onto the beach a good distance from the elephant seal's landing place.  Carefully she slunk up the dark beach.  <br>
She listened for awhile.  Babies whined and played.  Mothers complained and preened.  Fathers and younger males yelled and battled, trying to out macho each other.  She waited until she had singled out a particularly annoying one.  Huge and stupid, he lorded over his section of the rookery with pompous snobbery.  When he galumphed down towards the surf, shoving females aside and running over cubs regardless of whether they were his or not, she made her move.  Loping across the sand as easily as if it were fresh powder snow, she bellowed a challenge.  Other seals scattered before her, but the bull turned to meet her.  Reveling in her own bravado, and her ability to go against her natural cousins' hunting habits, she flung herself into the fray.  She matched his bulk easily, and his strong teeth could not get through her heavy stiff fur.  Clashing against him, she was sadly disappointed.  One strong swipe laid him out.  Another opened him from gullet to tail.  Annoyance made her hungry, so she settled into the too easy meal.  The entire seal population of Ano Nuevo state beach huddled in unnatural silence.  She heard  them whisper in disbelief at seeing a Polar Bear this far south.  Some considered that perhaps this even warranted changing next years breeding grounds.<br>
Her good humor returned before too long however.  And she shouldered back into the surf.  The scent of blood drew another shark, but a short rumbled warning from her stopped it in it's tracks, it started to sink before shaking itself out of it's shock and swimming away.  By the time she was entering the bay again she was happy.  Shifting back to human form again she body surfed the waves to make up speed, and ran up the shore to Michael.  He tapped his watch and lifted an eyebrow.  She grimaced at the lightening sky.  He laughed, and with an impish face she raced for the limousine without bothering to put her clothes on.  The car slid into the parking lot at the compound with a couple minutes to spare.   <br>
