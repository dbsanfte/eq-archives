A Minor Identity Crisis<br>
<br>
Part 1<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The morning after had arrived early. The racket inside his head confirmed that there was quite a merry little bar brawl in there. As he forced an eye open he realized that the brawl was actually outside his head, but that didn’t make him feel any better. How was it possible that he was standing? He felt the back of his head. It was damp and a large lump had risen. A few shards of glass stuck to his hand and he brushed them off on his shirt.<br>
<br>
A beer bottle came flying toward him. As he tried to dodge it, he stumbled, but a strong hand on his arm steadied him. The person attached to the hand belonged to a big, burly man with a bushy black beard. The quick thank-you he meant to utter died on his lips as he noticed that the man's other hand was forming a fist that was rapidly approaching his head. His relief as the fist sailed past his head and into the face of a rat-like creature made his knees sag.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think,&quot; said the burly man, as he knocked away an upraised chair out of another patron's hands, &quot;we should get the hell out of here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; was the weak reply.<br>
<br>
A shrill whistle suddenly sounded causing several of the more enthusiastic brawlers suddenly clamped their hands over their ears. The bearded man laughed at their discomfort, but quickly sobered as he saw the effect that the piercing tones had on his companion. The shorter man gasped in agony and slipped entirely out of consciousness and remained vertical only because he was leaning against his unlikely benefactor. Shouts from outside announced the imminent arrival of security. The bearded man shrugged and quickly slung the inert man over his shoulders, stepped over a couple of bodies, and slipped out the rear exit.<br>
<br>
**********<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Andromeda, how much longer until we rendevous with the Eureka Maru?&quot; Dylan asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Three hours, twenty-seven minutes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And not a moment too soon,” commented Beka. &quot;It’s not that I don’t trust Harper with my ship. I just don’t....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trust him not to get into trouble,&quot; Dylan finished for her. &quot;Relax, Beka. You know Harper always steals a few hours to work on the Maru on a parts and supply run.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka grinned at her fellow captain. The truth was, she was impatient to test out any modifications Harper was wont to make whenever he had the ship to himself and nobody to distract him. The Andromeda Ascendant was such a large job that taking care of her tended to demand most of Harper's time. He made sure that the Maru was kept in good shape, but the opportunities to tinker were few and far between. There was no telling what project had presented itself to the engineer. It would depend on what he found on his parts search, what kind of deals he had been able to make and how much time he'd had between finding the goods and the rendevous time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Intercepting a message from Port Royal Drift,&quot; announced Rommie. &quot;It's from Harper.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Play it,&quot; ordered Dylan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings, oh collective boss,&quot; came Harper's cheerful voice over the speaker. &quot;I found a heck of a deal on hull plating. In fact, it's so great a deal of hull plating, that I can't fit it all into the Maru, but I thought it might come in handy on down the line either for repairs or bartering or whatever. Anyway, I've got it sitting in a hangar along with a lot of other little goodies-I swear Rommie, if you had a heart it would go pitty pat-so if you can get Andromeda into the general vicinity, we can ferry this treasure trove into her storage bays. Oh, and Beka...I didn't forget you. I'll be implementing a few improvements on the Maru while waiting. Harper out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I may not have a heart, but something is going pitty-pat,&quot; remarked the hologram Andromeda.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe we should let Harper shop alone more often. How old is that message, Rommie?&quot; asked Dylan.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was sent four days, seven hours, and seventeen minutes ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain Valentine, take us to Port Royal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; said Beka. &quot;Prepare for Slipstream.&quot;<br>
<br>
******<br>
<br>
Captain Inge Read scowled at her payload specialist as he gently deposited his latest acquisition on the mess hall table.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not what I sent you out for, Teach,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah...no,&quot; he admitted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me see if I can reconstruct the events of the last thirty hours.&quot; Inge crossed her arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Inge, I can explain...really...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;After I told you to find parts for the ship- and an engineer to fix the damn thing–&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I got you your parts! The rest are supposed to be here after lunchtime.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So what did you do for the other 28 hours?&quot;<br>
<br>
A dreamy look entered Teach's blue eyes. That usually meant alcohol, good food, an attractive female (or the equivalent) or any combination of the three.<br>
<br>
&quot;On second thought, I don't need a minute by minute account.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Honest, Inge,&quot; Teach said. &quot;I really did spend most of it looking for an engineer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Inge stepped over to the table and nudged the bundle that Teach had brought in. It gave a quiet moan and shifted slightly. &quot;Looks and smells like a half-starved mudfoot with a hangover to me. That's the best you could do?&quot;<br>
<br>
Teach straightened up in response to the criticism. &quot;He's an engineer. I'm sure of it. Look. He's got a dataport.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Like that proves anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But he's got a tool belt on as well.&quot; Teach squinted, &quot;And I'm sure that's a nanowelder. He's got to be an engineer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Logical.&quot; Inge managed not to roll her eyes only through great effort. &quot;Alright, you old scoundrel, how did you manage to pick him up?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I started talking to him at the Jamaica Arms.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Jamaica Arms? That's all the way on the other end of the drift! No wonder it took you so damn long.&quot;<br>
<br>
Teach cleared his throat. &quot;As I was saying, I started talking with him–just casual like. Well, the easiest way to get to find out if you can stand a man is to drink a few rounds with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Inge shook her head slowly in disbelief. Trust Ned Teach to go look for an engineer in a dive like the Jamaica Arms. Old habits die hard.<br>
<br>
&quot;To make a long story short-well, shorter- a fight broke out. Damned if I know quite how it started. It might have been the Nietzschean and the Nightsider playing cards. Or maybe the Makra...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How about even shorter?&quot; Inge's gravelly voice interrupted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway, the little guy watched my back and got a bottle of Galladrean whisky smashed over his head for his trouble. It's a shame, really. Another five years and it would have been the perfect age–&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure the boy feels your pain at the tragic loss of a fine spirit.&quot; Inge felt entitled to refer to any male under forty as &quot;boy&quot; due to the few strands of grey in her frizzy brown hair.<br>
<br>
The heap on the table emitted another low groan. Inge examined the maybe-engineer a bit more closely. To call him a boy was perhaps a bit ridiculous, she silently conceded. His diminutive frame and fair hair made him appear, at first glance, much younger than he really was. The blue eye he opened briefly was bloodshot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey there, guy,&quot; she spoke softly. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My head feels like an angry Uber has been using it for soccer practice and I smell like a distillery.&quot; The little man slowly pushed himself up until he was resting on his elbows. He looked at Teach and said, &quot;It's a damn shame 'bout the whisky.&quot;<br>
<br>
Teach grinned at him and offered him a cup of water.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, by the way,&quot; the little man asked, &quot;where the hell am I?&quot;<br>
<br>
Inge answered, &quot;You're in the mess hall of the Anne Bonny. Don't worry, we're still in the Port Royal hangar until we get this bucket of bolts repaired. I'm Captain Inge Read.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ned Teach,&quot; the bearded man said as he helped their guest sit up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pleasure. I'm–&quot; the little man broke off suddenly and his face became blank. &quot;I'm....Oh great! I can't freakin' believe it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What’s wrong?&quot; asked Inge.<br>
<br>
He glanced anxiously at Teach, &quot;Hey, during that male bonding experience in the bar, did I happen to mention my name or where I came from?&quot;<br>

Part 2<br>
<br>
<br>
*******<br>
<br>
<br>
Inge sat in the mess hall going over the contract for the latest job. Much as she wanted to help the amnesiac that Teach had rescued to find out who he was and where he was supposed to be, she had a deadline. The repairs required by the Anne Bonny had already delayed the mission by three days. If she and Teach didn't get out of port soon, they'd never get their cargo to Kells in time.<br>
<br>
At least their guest had been helpful with the repairs. It turned out that Teach's assessment had been correct. The little guy was an engineer and a pretty good one at that. He'd not only managed to do the necessary repairs to the Anne Bonny in one tenth the time it would have taken have taken Inge or Teach, but he had managed to do a creditable overhaul of the ship's slipstream drive and conduct countless miscellaneous repairs. About 12 hours after he started working, Inge was astounded to see a rather pleasant blue light working on the command console on the bridge. In the fifteen years she had owned the ship she had never seen it lit. She had no idea what purpose served, but was still rather foolishly pleased to see it blinking at her.<br>
<br>
Considering what the engineer had done for them, Inge felt guilty that she and Teach had not been able to help him more. The captain of the Java, a ship in the neighboring hangar, had loaned them the service of a medic. Aside from his lack of personal memories, the engineer's mental and physical capacities were intact. After the medic left, he grumbled that until they figured out who he was and where he should go that he may as well get some work done. Inge was reluctant to turn him loose on her ship, but he waved aside her protests with a &quot;I may not know what my name is, but I do know that I'm a freakin' genius. Anyway, I'll be sure to charge you for the work. Whoever the hell I am, I probably need the cash.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Java's medic had also brought word that a pair of Nietzscheans were on the lookout for a human who's description matched Teach. Though Teach could handle himself and would probably have enjoyed another rumble, Inge had thought it wiser to keep the payload specialist confined to the ship for the rest of the stay. He was less likely to get into any more trouble. The unofficial investigation into the brawl made it difficult to make discreet inquiries to find out if anybody has misplaced an engineer who was last seen drinking with a large, bearded man in the Jamaica Arms. The official investigation had already made all three of them agree that a visit to the drift's medical stations was probably not a good idea which was why they had asked the Java's captain for use of his medic instead of seeking out a more qualified physician.<br>
<br>
Inge sighed and got up to go look for the hard working engineer. She found him in the slipstream core jacked into the ship's mainframe. He was propped against the bulkhead with his eyes closed. It was the first time she had seen him completely still since he had arrived. His body suddenly shuddered and Inge started toward him in some alarm. His eyes opened and he pulled the jack out of his data port, shaking his head a bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, boss.&quot; He saw the expression on her face and asked, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I've just never really seen anybody plugged in like that.&quot; She added gruffly, &quot;it was a little disturbing.&quot;<br>
<br>
He laughed and said, &quot;I wouldn't know. I don't usually take the time to look at myself through the sensors.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Usually? How do you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good question. It's just a vague feeling.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh...I'd hoped your memory was coming back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;'Fraid not. Just impressions of life--my life I guess.&quot; He frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aren't they good impressions?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Honestly, no.&quot; he admitted. &quot;I won't bore you with the details. I'm not even sure that I want to know the details.&quot;<br>
<br>
Inge patted him on the shoulder. &quot;All of us have things in our past we don't want to talk about. Which only leaves the present.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean, what happens now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Teach and I have to leave as soon as possible if we're going to meet our deadline. We can't help you until we get back, but I don't really want to leave you to wander a strange drift all alone without knowing who might be after you-- for good or evil. Why don't you come with us on our run to Kells?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure you want to travel with someone who doesn't have all his marbles?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh please. I keep Teach around, don't I?&quot; Inge grinned. &quot;Besides, I'm sure you aren't stupid enough to cross a couple of old pirates like us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I don't know. I'll have to check my calendar. Hmm....let's see. Oh yeah. Tomorrow, twiddle thumbs and try to remember who I am. Guess I can do that on the way to Kells as well as anywhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome aboard, engineer,&quot; said Inge. &quot;But we can't keep saying 'hey you' for the next week or so. That would get old awfully quick. You need a name.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You could just call me Super Genius.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nah...I can't live a lie like that. How about Cabin Boy?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ha, ha.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He reminds me of one of my brothers-in-law,&quot; Teach's voice interrupted from the corridor just outside the slipstream core. &quot;What was his name? Oh, right. Jack.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jack?&quot; asked the engineer. &quot;I guess it'll do. Kind of blah, though.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jack–Royal. If anybody asks.&quot; clarified Inge.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wonderful! Now that's all settled, what say we get out of here?&quot; asked Teach. &quot;When you went out to get Jack here some clothes, two Niets were snooping around the hangar asking about who was on this ship. One of them was familiar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Old friends of ours, no doubt. Well, gentlemen, prepare for departure,&quot; said Inge.<br>
<br>
**************<br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan, there's no answer from the Maru,&quot; reported Andromeda.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it still there?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;According the Port Royal main computer, it's been there for over a week.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds about right,&quot; said Beka. “Harper's probably wandered off for beer. Smart man. I'd like to join him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Feel free,&quot; said Dylan. &quot;Take Rommie with you-if you don't mind the company.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, the more the merrier. It's about time for Rommie to take another educational field trip.&quot; Beka grinned at the ship's android avatar and asked, &quot;Did Harper introduce you to the wonderful world of potent potables?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course he did. The rest of what he introduced me to is none of your business.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It takes a true friend not to give the juicy details of how she rejected every advance made by her engineer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rommie merely smiled.<br>
<br>
******<br>
The hangar manager grumbled a bit when Beka and Rommie arrived to take a look at Harper's treasure trove. He was miffed that his old acquaintance and occasional drinking buddy had set his own security codes on the hangar and added a few &quot;surprises&quot; for the unwary.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'd think he didn't trust me,&quot; he groused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn right he doesn't trust you,&quot; said Beka. &quot;There's always the chance that someone will give you a better offer.&quot;<br>
<br>
“Once I’m bribed, I stay bribed.” He gave Beka an injured look.<br>
<br>
Beka grinned at the expression on his face when Rommie took only forty seconds to get into the hangar.<br>
<br>
&quot;What took you so long?&quot; Beka asked her after the manager had returned to his office.<br>
<br>
&quot;He added a new code based on one of those old Earth songs you like. 'Respect.'&quot; said Rommie.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now there's sentiment for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rommie did not reply. She was too busy taking in Harper's trove. There was the hull plating, of course. It met High Guard specifications as well as anything she had come across since the Maru crew had pulled her out of the event horizon. In addition, there was an amazing array of parts, tools, and raw materials-enough for Harper to have gone into business for himself. She said as much to Beka when she found her in the cargo hold of the Maru.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tisdale Regit,&quot; said Beka looking at a delivery manifest that had been left on one of the bundles. &quot;Owns a salvage shop on the drift. He's been talking about retiring to a little cabana on Infinity Atoll since dad and Uncle Sid were still partners. Guess he's going to finally do it. Hard to believe, I always figured he’d die computing profits, but it looks like he's liquidated the stock.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Beka,&quot; said Rommie an hour later as the two examined the Maru’s cockpit. &quot;The logs haven't been updated for three days.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's odd. Harper usually keeps a record of repairs-even in port.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As far as I can tell, all the modifications that he has made on the Maru have been recorded.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I suppose it's possible he got lucky and hasn't been around for three days.&quot; Beka sounded doubtful.<br>
<br>
&quot;He did alright for himself at Albuquerque Drift,&quot; Rommie said keeping her facial expression inscrutable.<br>
<br>
Beka declined to rise to the bait. Instead she hailed the hangar manager on the com system and asked him when he had last seen Harper.<br>
<br>
&quot;About three days ago. We went to the Four-Legged Wench for a drink or seven.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You haven’t seen him since?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I left him there fending off the advances of a Than trader,&quot; he laughed. &quot;The next day I was too hung over to come in for work so I don’t know when he got back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka grinned at that and signed off. Turning to Rommie she said, &quot;Okay, perhaps lucky was the wrong word choice.&quot;<br>

<br>
<br>
Once the Anne Bonny was underway, Jack threw himself into his work on her with abandon. There was an intriguing history behind this ship, he was convinced. For a cargo vessel, she had an impressive weaponry system. The engines, though quite ancient, were impressive and, Jack suspected, lent a speed to the ship that would make her difficult to catch in normal space. He supposed that a cargo ship that made runs on the fringes of civilization would be vulnerable to attack from raiders and that Inge or whoever had owned the ship before her had wanted insurance. Or, he thought with a grim smile, somebody had realized that other ships making cargo runs on the fringes would be vulnerable and had thought to take advantage of it.<br>
<br>
Wait a minute, he reflected, hadn't Inge called herself a pirate? A joke perhaps, but all the funnier for its truth.<br>
<br>
Jack shrugged it off. Memory still eluded him, but the survival instincts seemed intact. If you looked a gift horse in the mouth, you should make sure it's asleep. Or at least not hungry. Still, he thought, an investigation on the sly couldn’t hurt.<br>
<br>
Entering the slipstream core, he jacked into the ship's main computer and started exploring data streams. As he went through them, the blue light on the command console stopped blinking and emitted a steady glow.<br>
<br>
*********<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah ha!&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka looked up in surprise at Rommie.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think I've found the trail of my wayward engineer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka sighed in relief. Though she had not admitted it-even to herself-she had been worried.<br>
<br>
&quot;What have you got?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Three days ago Port Royal Security Forces were called in to intervene in a bar brawl at the Jamaica Arms. While the eyewitness accounts are widely varied as to the cause, three of them describe a short, fair-haired, human male wearing a tool belt as having been present before the violence broke out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper?&quot; asked Beka. &quot;Did he start it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, it's not quite clear who started it.&quot; answered Rommie. &quot;Five reports attribute it to a card game gone bad, eight mention Nietzscheans, five claim the tavern owner watered down drinks (no doubt to justify their own participation), and one account says that an invisible, six foot tall, white rabbit started it by tripping a Nightsider who then bumped into a testy mercenary.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka pondered that for a minute, &quot;I take it that last witness was looking at the fight from the bottom of nine shot glasses. Anyway, noone could mistake Harper for a six foot tall anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It doesn't look like he was arrested or that he sought medical attention. So, do we track him down?&quot; asked Rommie. &quot;Or do we just start ferrying these supplies back to me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Both,&quot; Beka answered. &quot;You take the first load back to Andromeda and report to Dylan. I'm going on a pub crawl to see if I can find Harper.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't decide if I resent that or if I'm grateful.&quot; said Rommie.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, let me know when you decide. Then I'll apologize or say 'you're welcome.'&quot;<br>
<br>
**********<br>
<br>
A search of mere seconds had brought Jack to the ship's logs and he had spent an hour skimming through them. They went back only two years and there was little of interest other than the fact that Inge had noted Teach's marriage on four different occasions without mentioning any intervening divorces.<br>
<br>
Some two hours later, Jack finally unearthed the purged logs and started reconstruction. Though he could only get partial records, they were illuminating. His co-workers had once had quite lucrative careers on the fringes of civilization. No less than ten different world governments had issued privateering certificates to Inge Read and Ned Teach. He was amused to see that three of the certificates authorized raiding on ships from other planets that had hired Captain Read and her crew.<br>
<br>
Ah ha! Here were some freelance jobs, he noted. Ships from the Diamondback Pride worlds were a favorite target even without open warfare between it and other worlds. Jack didn't know why, but he found himself grinning at that. The grin faded a bit as he realized just what Inge's comment about &quot;old friends&quot; meant. Inge and Teach had people looking for them. No, not just people, but angry Nietzscheans.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bring them on,&quot; a defiant voice said.<br>
<br>
Jack was a bit startled when he realized the voice was not his.<br>
<br>
*********<br>
<br>
When Beka walked into the Jamaica Arms, she was impressed with how quickly order had been restored. It was rundown and dingy, but it was supposed to be that way. It was the comfortable sort of dive that attracted Harper.<br>
<br>
A middle aged bald man with an enormous red mustache stood behind the bar polishing glasses. He looked up at her with mournful brown eyes and asked what she wanted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Information and a drink. Not in that order.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;More questions?&quot; he sighed. &quot;Where's your badge?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No badge. I'm just looking for a friend of mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
He gave Beka a long, hard look. &quot;You, I almost believe. The last person who said that wasn't so convincing. What are you drinking?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;San Ska Re Sling. My friend is an engineer. Short little guy, talks a thousand words a minute when he’s calm.&quot; Beka pulled out a flexi. &quot;Look familiar?&quot;<br>
<br>
The bartender handed her the drink and studied the image of Harper. He said nothing for a few minutes before finally saying, &quot;I've seen him before.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka slipped a few credits into the tip jar. &quot;Anyone else looking for him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not exactly,&quot; the barkeeper admitted after a long pause.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean, 'not exactly?'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Couple of Ubers have been in here looking for a man he had drinks with the night of the brawl. It's not the first time they've come looking for Teach. He can handle them, but I don't give 'em any information. Anyway, your friend came in a few hours before the fight started. Teach came in about an hour after that and asked me if I knew of any engineers who were looking for a change of scene&quot;”<br>
<br>
&quot;He came looking for an engineer in a bar?&quot; Beka asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; The bartender shrugged. &quot;This is Port Royal. You can always find someone who needs a new situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka paused at that. Had Harper wanted a new situation? She couldn't imagine that. He was the happiest he had ever been on the Andromeda. His family was there. No, Harper would never just leave without saying anything. Had he been shanghaied?<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh, this Teach person, how badly did he want an engineer?&quot;<br>
<br>
The bartender actually smiled at that. &quot;Nothing like that, lady. The Anne Bonny had been stuck in port for a few days and her repairs were more than Teach and his captain could handle. Captain Read has a good reputation among spacers here. She's tough, but fair and would never put up with anybody on her ship who didn't want to be there.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Anne Bonny? Vague recognition pulled at Beka’s memory.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't suppose you saw what happened to him after the trouble started?&quot;<br>
<br>
The bartender shrugged. &quot;I saw him get in a few hits and take a few hits, but I lost track of him after someone started hurling beer bottles at the bar. By the time security got here, a lot of people had disappeared.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;These Ubers. . . what pride were they?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; the bartender thought for a moment. &quot;Around here we mostly see Diamondbacks. Usually pissed off because some pirate has raided their ship and they want to recover their genetic superiority. We don't pay attention to them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't they get nasty?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure they do. Before that Commonwealth started up again, they'd gotten good and sore and threatened to take control of the drift. Said the pirates shouldn't have sanctuary and that they should clean the place up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
The bartender's face broke into a grin. &quot;The Anne Bonny and a dozen ships operating out of Port Royal ambushed the Diamondback fleet and stripped the ships of most of their weaponry systems.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br>
<br>
*********<br>
<br>
Jack tried to make sense of the data streams surrounding him. It was almost as though they were trying to take shape. Trying, but not succeeding. He tried to take control and make the streams into a form of his choosing, but they defied him. Suddenly, a sad sigh surrounded him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello?&quot; Jack called out nervously. &quot;Inge? I thought you didn't hang out in virtual places.&quot;<br>
<br>
No answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Teach? Is this my pirate hazing? Freak out the new recruit?&quot;<br>
<br>
The data streams encircled him as though they were taking measurements and then pulled away. A hazy form appeared in front of him and spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right back at ya, babe,&quot; he answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you my child?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are connected to me...with a cord. I didn't know I could do that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh. You're the computer. And talking to me. Not about the functionality of the weaponry systems or life support.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am no mere computer,&quot; the voice hissed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right. I'm no mere engineer either,&quot; Jack said. &quot;I'm a freakin' genius.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two had been silent for a few minutes when Inge's voice came over the communications systems.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jack, chow time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be there in a minute, boss.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be there now,&quot; she said. &quot;Teach is very sensitive about his cooking. Read out.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jack regarded the entity in front of him for a second or two. &quot;Look, I'll be back as soon as I can. Try not to...um...permutate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not a virus, you fool!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, my mistake. Forget I said it.&quot; Jack said hastily as the hazy shape suddenly pushed him....<br>
<br>
....out of the ship's mainframe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now that's odd,&quot; commented Jack as he pulled the cord out of his dataport.<br>
<br>

<br>
******<br>
<br>
&quot;Now that's odd,&quot; Beka remarked to herself.<br>
<br>
She casually lounged in the doorway of an abandoned storefront and examined the Nietzschean standing post outside the salvage store bearing the sign &quot;Tisdale Regit.&quot; A human man approached the store, but the Nietzchean scowled at him. Obviously the man was a local for he paid the Nietzchean no mind and went on in. Beka stifled a laugh at the thwarted expression on the Nietzchean's face.<br>
<br>
Apparently he was relying on intimidation to discourage patronage of the salvage store, but was stopping short of physically barring the way. That was a good thing, because Beka was not really in the mood for a fight or for sneaking around to the delivery entrance. Just as she started toward Regit's door another Nietzchean pushed his way out. With a jerk of his head, he beckoned the sentry and they sauntered off.<br>
They were obviously up to something, but what could they have accomplished with at least one witness, Beka wondered as she stepped into the shop.<br>
<br>
Well, not much. There was Tisdale Regit looking exactly the same as when Beka had been seven. The shock of white hair that stood straight up on his head was just as luxuriant as she remembered. He was leaning on the counter drumming his fingers and keeping a sharp, black eye on the customer that had wandered in before Beka. She heard his creaky voice muttering something about &quot;those damn cheap Ubers.&quot; Some things never change. Though her universe was in flux Tisdale Regit remained a constant. Beka suddenly realized that the liquidation of his stock and pending retirement heralded the end of an era. Her wistful sigh attracted his attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;May I help you, mademoiselle?&quot; he asked politely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Knock it off, Tizzy,&quot; Beka grinned at him. &quot;You know you've already unloaded an amazing amount of stuff on Harper.&quot;<br>
<br>
Regit stared at her. Beka felt her grin fade a bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tizzy, what's wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know me?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, I know you...uh, you do remember me, right?&quot; Beka was taken aback. Was Regit going senile? That might explain his pending retirement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course not, you silly creature!&quot; he snapped. &quot;Otherwise, I wouldn't ask. Unless you've misplaced your memories as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; said Beka slowly. &quot;Beka Valentine. I've known you since I was too short to reach the top of that counter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh really?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, really.&quot; She carefully approached the elderly man who stared at her with no hint of recognition in his eyes. &quot;It's okay. I'm here to help as best as I can.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who says I need help?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nobody, now that you mention it. But the Tisdale Regit I know has a mind as sharp as a tack and tongue to match.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, that sounds a lot like me. I think it does anyway,&quot; he sighed.<br>
<br>
<br>
At the approach of the shop's remaining customer Beka faded away among the still full shelves of goods. Regit and the man engaged in a long haggling session over some surplus grappling cables and hooks. Beka was impressed at the price Regit got for them. Even if he couldn't remember her, he still seemed to have his old touch. As the merchant walked his customer to the door, he even handed him a business card and urged him to stop by the next time he was on the drift. As soon as he had ushered the customer out of the door, he locked it and turned to Beka.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, what do you remember? You weren't having any trouble playing the part of the premiere surplus parts dealer in this corner of the universe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Regit laughed. &quot;Of course, not. I know my name because I looked at the business cards and business records. As for the consummate salesmanship...well, it just felt natural. I'm proud to say that I've turned a tidy profit over the past two days! In fact, I'm quite happy that you've confirmed that I actually am Tisdale Regit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hated to think of someone else reaping the benefits?&quot; asked Beka.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, indeed. That would have been a shame. Now that I know I'm operating for myself, I feel much more enthusiastic.&quot; Regit literally beamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you don't remember anything from before the past two days?&quot;<br>
<br>
He shook his head. &quot;The first thing I remember is that I was standing behind the counter there. I'd just written something down. There was a Nietzchean standing over by the power couplers pretending to browse, but he was really looking at me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nietzchean? Not the guy who just left?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, it was the sentry he had posted outside the door.&quot; Regit missed very little. &quot;The fellow today also was trying very hard not to watch me. He spent an hour looking at the junk bin as he waited for the customers to leave. Just as he started to approach me, the door opened and the last customer came in. He made a rude comment about the quality of my scrap metal and left.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wonder what he really wanted from you,&quot; said Beka as they went into the office behind the sales counter.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; he sighed and looked about the room blankly. &quot;I'd offer you a drop of something, but I haven't figured out where I hide my liquor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka grinned. &quot;Hmm...you used to keep a bottle of rum on the shelf behind unfiled tax returns.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course! Why didn't I think of it?&quot; Regit struck his forehead with an open palm and made a beeline for the tax returns of years past. With a cry of triumph, he pulled out a dusty bottle. On the next shelf down, he pushed aside dusty piles of flexies and brought out two metal cups. &quot;Yo ho ho...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And a bottle of rum,&quot; finished Beka.<br>
<br>
The old dealer grinned at her and handed her one of the cups. As he raised his own to his lips he suddenly stopped. &quot;Hang on a moment! Were you ever a redhead?&quot;<br>
<br>
**********<br>
<br>
&quot;So tell me, boss,&quot; Jack asked Inge as he fiddled with the wires under a console on the bridge. &quot;What's the story behind the Anne Bonny?&quot;<br>
<br>
Inge smiled. &quot;Well, I assume you've already found the old licenses.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Correct, mere purging cannot hide the amusing truth from a super genius.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Purging? I didn't realize that I'd purged them. I've been known to hide things in the waste bin, is all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh come on, Inge. I'd share my dirty secrets with you, if I could remember 'em. I just wanna know about your slightly dusty ones.&quot;<br>
<br>
She laughed at him. &quot;Oh well, it's common knowledge on Port Royal Drift. Among a certain element anyway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not quite twenty years ago, I was just the navigator on a tiny cargo vessel which had the misfortune of flying the wrong flag the day the Anne Bonny showed up.&quot; Inge lovingly patted the command console. &quot;We were boarded and a fire fight broke out. I shot three of the invaders and killed one, but it was no use. We surrendered after only an hour. Captain Rackham gave us the option of being set adrift on our ship with very few supplies or joining the crew of the Anne Bonny. I said, 'why not?' and three years later was voted captain after poor Rackham found himself on the wrong end of a Gauss rifle. The rest we'll save for drunken reminiscing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fair enough. What do you know about the Anne Bonny from before your time on her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not much. She's incredibly old, but she was so well designed and built that with the right care she still outruns any ship that ever bothers to come into this corner of the universe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been trying to figure out what her original mission was,&quot; Jack said. &quot;I understand there are some old Commonwealth military relics still floating around, but she doesn't appear to be anything like those.&quot;<br>
<br>
Inge grinned. &quot;Nope, we've outrun a few of those relics--heck we've outrun a lot of the ships from the current incarnation of the Commonwealth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean someone's trying to resurrect that thing? Next thing you'll be telling me that Earth has risen up in revolution and that the Magog have found the Way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sadly-or not so sadly, depending on your point of view-this Commonwealth has teeth. When three of the planets in this area joined, privateering became a bit more difficult. Instead of three pathetic fleets, there are now High Guard Units that can reach us within hours. They pay no attention to licenses.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Savages,&quot; muttered Teach who had entered the bridge just as the topic of the New Commonwealth had arisen. &quot;They've even been known to answer Diamondback distress signals.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah...the universe's new busybodies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah well,&quot; said Inge. &quot;The last privateering job was just too costly. We evaded the fleet only barely and at the cost of several gray hairs for me. I decided to retire from piracy and stick to straight cargo runs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's the end of an era,&quot; sniffed Teach.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, was Anne Bonny always a pirate ship?&quot; Jack asked Teach.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I know that when I was a lad, we heard stories about her. Granddad always claimed that he'd earned and lost three fortunes while serving aboard her under Blind Simon Lafitte. To think that those glory days are over it's an awful shame.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't be maudlin, Teach,&quot; said Inge suddenly. &quot;You've been in the grog again, haven't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The blue light on the command continued to glow.<br>
<br>
<br>
*******<br>
&quot;Hello?&quot; Jack called out in the mainframe's grid. &quot;I came back as soon as I could. Did a bit of digging.&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence greeted him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh come on, darlin'. Don't be shy. Uncle Jack just wants to talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Several long minutes passed, but the hazy form that had earlier spoken to him did not appear. Jack settled back to wait as patiently as he could. Even in this virtual world he could not be completely still unless there was a specific task on which he could concentrate. Every minute or so, he would glance behind him. A few seconds later he would crack his knuckles and clear his throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you stop that fidgeting!&quot; demanded an exasperated voice. &quot;For goodness' sake! It's not like you have a real body in here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jack jumped up and whirled to face the hazy form that had spoken. Only it wasn't very hazy anymore. It had taken some time to define itself into a female human form. There was a long angular face with a strong brow. Almond-shaped eyes of gray regarded him with curiosity. The figure lifted a hand in an unconscious manner and brushed a lock of chestnut hair off of her forehead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh hello, there!&quot; he cocked his head and studied the female figure in front of him. &quot;You didn't have to do that for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I did. And for them. Those two on the bridge.&quot; Her voice was low and drawn out into a drawl.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're the ship aren't you?&quot; asked Jack. &quot;I've heard of AIs before, but I never dreamed...well, I don't suppose I ever dreamed--er-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know about your identity crisis, Mr. Royal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop that. I know I'm not Mr. Anybody.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's ridiculous to call you Uncle. You're too short.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not as ridiculous as my being your child.&quot;<br>
<br>
A look of embarrassment crossed her face. &quot;I was confused. I have not been functional for a long time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I kind of figured that, sweetheart. Hey, what's your name anyway?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not sure. I am the Anne Bonny, but I don't know how...&quot; she trailed off and her brow furrowed in an effort to remember.<br>
<br>
There seemed to be a lot of that going around, Jack thought to himself. There were the Anne Bonny and himself who knew what they were, but not who they were. Then there were Jack and Inge who knew who they were, but no longer what they were. Though Inge had shushed Teach's nostalgia trip, Jack had detected a wistful note in her voice when she talked about giving up piracy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm..well, it's not exactly original-and Inge might change it-but I'm just going to call you Annie.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Inge...&quot; Annie looked worried.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's the matter?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, what am I to her?&quot;<br>
<br>
Realization of the problem hit Jack like a bucket of cold water propped on a half-open door. When Inge had let him monkey around with her ship's mainframe awakening an AI had not been part of the plan. Jack met Annie's worried gaze and gave her a reassuring smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's worry about figuring out what happened to you in the first place. Just relax and start talking to me about the good old days...or minutes...whatever comes to mind.&quot;<br>
<br>
A couch and armchair appeared. Jack motioned Annie to the couch and took the armchair for himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, tell me all about yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That will take too long. I have several billion times the memory capacity that you do. Why don't I just show you what I remember?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jack shrugged and settled back in his armchair.<br>
<br>
*********<br>
<br>
An elderly human woman gently stroked command console on the bridge of the Anne Bonny. She fought back tears as she listened to the Nietzchean male who towered over her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to destroy this ship. I cannot stand the thought of something so useful being wasted on target practice. It will be a good addition to our fleet. This time against the pirates.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But...&quot; the old woman's voice quavered. &quot;Must I dismantle the AI? She is part of what makes the ship so--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The AI is too rebellious and much too complicated for us to reprogram into compliance.&quot; The Nietzchean grudgingly admitted, &quot;your uncle, though a kludge, was unmatched at creating these ship programs. I know that you alone know how to remove the AI. You are the last of the Trieste family. Now do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old woman bowed her head and left the bridge. The Nietzchean commander had agreed to let her do the procedure alone, but she knew she would be under some form of observation. What she planned to do was extremely risky, but it was the only chance. As a little girl she had played in these corridors and the ship had watched over her. As a young woman, when she had started her own AI Restoration and Maintenance business, the ship had offered her guidance and advice. As the chaos of the universe overtook her, she had taken comfort in the fact that the pride of her uncle still defied the odds even though she had become a pirate vessel. She had to do this one last thing for the ship that had meant so much to her.<br>
<br>
She stepped over the scattered remains of the ship's drones and into the slipstream core. There, she could interface with the Anne Bonny one last time. Opening her eyes, she found herself in the ship's mainframe. The figure of a woman suddenly appeared on the grid. Her eyes flashed with a mix of fear and defiance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let them do their worst, Mary,&quot; she said. &quot;I won't have them using me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hush, dear. They've already got you. There is nothing we can do about that. All I can do is keep them from hurting you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary released a preprogrammed data stream into the mainframe. The Anne Bonny would go to sleep and feel nothing. The core intelligence would be compacted and scattered throughout the ship's systems. She would no longer trouble her new owners.<br>
<br>
The Anne Bonny yawned. &quot;Mary, will you miss me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear, you shall miss me. I've resolved that I won't outlast you. I am old and sick of the pain and emptiness that the universe holds. You are the last of my family.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What have you done?&quot; cried the ship.<br>
<br>
&quot;A virus for each of us. Mine is fatal, but you are made of sterner stuff. Watch over me until it's over, then go to sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Die, you mean. Let's just forget the euphemisms.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sleep,&quot; corrected Mary one last time.<br>
<br>
As the Anne Bonny felt her awareness fading, she reflected bitterly that Mary had been right. She did miss her.<br>
<br>
<br>
