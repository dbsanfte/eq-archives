I don't know whether God exists and I don't really care (though I think that if he existed, it would have been proven, wouldn't it ?). I'm pleased when I imagine that the souls of dead people stay like ghosts (but unseeable) to watch out their family/friends, prevent them from bad happenings things, or annoying them if they were bad - but I do think it's only a child dream and I don't know. I don't believe there is something, I don't believe there isn't - I just don't know...<br>

I'm glad that countries like France have split up their Religion and their State. I'm often shocked when I hear W saying &quot;God Bless America&quot; on the end of each sentence, but if he likes that... lol <br>
<br>
I respect people's religions. Are you catholic, no problem for me. Are you from islam (sorry I'm bad a religion words in english lol), no problem either - as long as you don't try to convince me that religion is good, that this religion is good and not this one, and so on...<br>

All hell is going to break loose now. I'm so glad im officially on holiday.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not religious and my family no longer are either, despite spending the majority of my life being brought up in quite a religious(anglican) household. Nothing was ever forced upon me, and I was always encouraged to think things over...untill the a few years ago. I began to challenge more and more thing with people who used to 'teach' me, and so did mom. To cut a VERY long story short my parents are no longer religious, and I guess neither am I.<br>
<br>
Having said all that though, I can see the positive effects of religion. We've had this discussion before so my apologies for repeating things, but I think its long enough ago, that we can start afresh.<br>
<br>
I believe that humans long ago definetly needed religion. It was to explain the unexplained. Creation stories I believe are one of the major reasons for religions to form epitomised by the major role they play today in all of the worlds major religions.<br>
Religion provided comfort to people. It also provided people with a means to meet each other, to share for a common good and a basis on which to lead a good life. Values taken from religious teachings are what almost all countries use to base their laws on. Thou shalt not steal etc.<br>
In that light, I see religion as a good and usefull thing that has played a major role in bringing humankind to where it is today.<br>
<br>
In the modern world however, as you have rightly questioned, its coming under strain. Religion is so enveloping that it in effect can be held responsibile for almost everything that goes wrong in the world. Crime, death and war are atributed to it. Hate inspired wrongs are carried out in the name of religion. And this is exactly how I feel it is. Because the context is so overwhelming, so huge, and so inescapeably complex - I think that it has acquired a bad press. People may carry out crimes in the name of religion, but it is never religion that inspires them. It's simply and excuse. A justification. <br>
<br>
On the issues of belief. Again it is justification that requires the need for a proof of God. Why does their need to be proof? And isn't the fact that it can't proved enough of a reason for religion to exist in the first place? If we could prove there was a God, religion would die solely because the realisation of its existance would render it obsolete.<br>
<br>
You see, I quite agree with the symptoms you put forward. It seems absurd that we are forcing feeding material to our chilren which we know dont serve any sort of purpose in a literal meaning. It's quite strange that we are so intent on mixing science (the unrepenting need for answers) with a subject matter that asks more questions without ever really answering any questions.<br>
<br>
I think religion is misunderstood at best, and manipulated perhaps at worst. Many people benefit falsely perhaps even evilly(is that a word?) from religion and the blind devotion that it may entail. But many more benefit through a spiritual way that adds so much to their daily lives, and to the common good of them all.<br>
<br>
It's not all about whats on the surface.<br>

Nah. <br>
<br>
Do I think it's irrational? I personally find belief in a deity generally less rational than nonbelief. Of course, there are different types of theism everywhere, each having some elements of rationality, however I find the general atheistic views to be most logical because of the abundance of scientific support. Creation is still a small possibility I suppose, but science now shows that a creator was not a necessity to bring about life and humanity. So with all this new evidence, why cling to an extremely old belief from times when people still presumed the world was flat? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There is no proof of the exsistence of god, why do people still believe? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I suppose because there is no concrete proof of the nonexistence of a god. Metaphysical ideas are impossible to prove or disprove, so they stick with their tradition and what they have been taught. Often because of fear instilled in them by the idea of hell and eternal punishment, which seems to disprove the merciful god theory, to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/urespighirf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>respighirf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.flamingtext.com/clipart/icons/gen/Misc1/Music1.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www2.tsixroads.com/~MHedges/Simpsons/new8.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Oceania<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-2-5.gif /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 9/30/02 3:47:12 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: Religion </span><hr size=1> There is no solid proof of how we were brought upon this earth.

As for religion, I believe in spiritual stuff. Religion is an old comfort, that is based on false stories and unreasonable concepts. It is also ruining most of the world and causing wars everywhere. Maybe it's just Gods people going against him and fighting (my arse).<br>

Personally I am sick of it. My little brother (or half brother?) goes to a Roman Catholic School- and I was shocked by the crap that they teach, I have two muslims in the family, and my parents were originally atheists. I had close encounters with religion, and in the end the thing that makes it so bad is the interpretation, being organised. I can understand why people might need it for comfort, I am not immune. An amazing amount of people though still choose to believe, wholeheartedly, and sometimes unquestioningly, and yet the same set of people would think it stupid if I said I believed in fairies or giants in the sky (which I don't!).

I watched the guy on Popstars -The Rivals tonight talk about how he read special verses of the bible over the last week to help him get through the week, and that they comforted him. Not many people would have the guts to say that on tv. My personal thoughts where, what would happen if you didn't have your bible?

However, I will state my own feelings.<br>
<br>
I'm not particularly religious.  I don't completely disagree with it, but I'm hardly a church-goer.  I certainly agree with this comment:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> People believe because they want comfort- and a belief that your soul lives on when you die.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That's the way I was until a couple of months ago... and then I had some experiences that I can only give one explanation for.  It's more than just a comforting belief.<br>
<br>
I've never been very sceptical.  I'm always willing to give ideas the benefit of the doubt.  But when you experience things for yourself, you have the choice whether to accept those experiences or ignore them.  I chose to accept them, and under the circumstances I think I did the right thing.<br>
<br>
Sorry for vagueness, but you might be able to guess... (keep to yourself though, please.)<br>

Well I don't believe that any of things can be true. Perhaps there are reasons to the stories, but it doesn't mean they are true.<br>
<br>
I think the only way I could get though bad news is to seek comfort from others and my own instinct. I wouldn't seek it from a books and those beliefs. I can't imagine actually believing in religion.

I was raised as a reform Jew and went to an Episcopal day school.  One of my college roommates was a die-hard Muslim, and I've always been crazy about Greek mythology... so here goes.<br>
<br>
I believe in a higher power that resides within every living thing.  A step above the concept of the Transcendental Oversoul.  I strongly believe in reincarnation and the idea that souls live on.  I know they do, because I knew the exact second when my Grandma died, even though I wasn't there. I know when she visited me, and I knew when she decided to move on to the next life.  I'm just glad she stuck around for my wedding reception. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I also believe in the concept of a messianic age, and that it is our responsibility to make the world the best that we possibly can in our lifetimes until it is such a pure place that the messiah can come.  The whole reincarnation thing is to return to do as much good as possible until we can rest. Of course, once the world IS that pure, we wouldn't need a savior because we would have saved ourselves, and honestly, I think that IS the whole point.  I believe that God - the messiah - the creator - the spirit that twists our fates resides inside of each of us, whether or not we choose to recognize it.  It's our creativity, our inspiration, the bit of good that fundamentally overrides the crap that each of us could become.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I do not believe that all wars occur in the name of God, but rather in the name of money.  Even in Christianity, when it became bastardized into Catholicism and all of the old ways that used to be a part of it became heresy it was all about having all the money go to the same place.  It was all about power, and it still is.<br>
<br>
I think that outright denial of a higher power is both arrogant and ignorant.  Things came together - the universe in all of its spledor and mystery - in ways we don't understand, and that we certainly did not create.  I do believe in science.  I do believe there are explanations.  But I also believe that in curiousity there is imagination, in imagination, hope, and in hope, both excitement and love, and for me, that's what the little part of God in me exists for.<br>
<br>
If you question, by all means do so. I was agnostic for *years* but never ultimately an athiest.  There are too many wonderful things that we have nothing to do with in this world to believe that we are the most powerful beings in existance. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2 bgcolor=#FFFFFF><table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td align=right class=headings> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"></a>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"></a>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.emailToFriend?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/email.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="email this topic to a friend"></a> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td valign="top"> Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showMessageRange?topicID=41.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddTopicScreenFromWeb><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/ezb/ez-topic.jpg border=0 alt="New Topic"></a>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/ezb/ez-reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a>  </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"></td><td align=right valign="top"><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="bbardenfrm65">Arrivals<option value="bbardenfrm31">free for all<option value="bbardenfrm68">member 2 member<option value="bbardenfrm57">Debates<option value="bbardenfrm69">front desk<option value="bbardenfrm54">creativity corner<option value="bbardenfrm36">tech support<option value="bbardenfrm42">ffa archive<option value="bbardenfrm55">blu memories<option value="bbardenfrm35">videogaming archive</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td bgcolor=#000000><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1"><tr><td bgcolor=#CCE6FF><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.threadControl?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/ezb/topic-control.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image" align=absmiddle></a><b>:::</b> Topic Commands </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95% cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td align=right valign=top><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showPrevMessage?topicID=41.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showNextMessage?topicID=41.topic"> Next Topic >> </a></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width=95%><tr><td bgcolor=#000000><table border=0 cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width=100%><tr><td bgcolor=#FFFFFF class=headings><font color=#000000>Icon Legend</font></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor=#FFFFFF><br><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply button" align=absmiddle>:::Reply to Post Button &nbsp;<img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/edit.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="edit button" align=absmiddle>:::Edit Post Button (Moderator Only) &nbsp;<img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/delete.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="delete button" align=absmiddle>:::Delete Post Button (Moderator Only)<br><br><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="subscribe/unsubscribe to thread button" align=absmiddle>:::Subscribe to Thread Button &nbsp;<img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/email.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="email to friend button" align=absmiddle>:::Email to Friend Button &nbsp;<br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bbbarden>bbarden network</a><font color=#FF0000> -
