<br>
<br>
There once was a king in an enchanted land who had a beautiful garden surrounded by a high hedge. The garden was the lovliest place in all the kingdom. There were tall trees, many bushes, and countless flowers that blossomed at different times of the year so that there were always beautiful blooms everywhere. The array of colors was dazzling; golds more vivid than the precious metal, violets more royal than the king's robes, and reds more brilliant than sparkling rubies. All the plants were arranged in a great circle, with walls and walkways displaying their grandeur.<br>
<br>
In the center of the garden was a tree more curious, more glorious and more enchanting than all the wonderful plants displayed. It sparkled and shined with many colors that were warm and comfortable. Even the blind who were brought near could feel the light and describe it to another person who could see. They both agreed that it was healing and soothing.<br>
<br>
On the tree grew fruit that was delicious to taste and could heal the sick and dying. A wonderful song came from the tree that was mystical and heavenly; joyful, rich, and continious. Even the deaf could hear and rejoice.<br>
<br>
The tree and the garden were so wonderful that the king declared that every seventh day be a day of celebration. Many people of the kingdom were invited to come into the garden and join in the festivities. Songs were composed and sung by the people with glad hearts for the great wonder that was in the garden. The sick were brought to the tree and were healed. And after the celebration was over many people still rejoiced in their hearts throughout the week.<br>
<br>
Many workers, laborers, and craftsmen looked forward to the garden festivities with anticipation of the joy they would receive. Many would prepare their wares and double their effort ahead of time so that the celebration day would be free of work.<br>
<br>
On the seventh day, the people could be heard, singing jubilantly even&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a great distance away. Those who were not invited to come in that day would stand outside the hedge and listen with awe to the wondrous sounds.<br>
<br>
Yet there were some in the kingdom who would not believe when told of the wonderful garden. Even after being invited by the king, they refused to go and see. Several of these people wanted the celebrations to stop.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is so precious, we cannot allow the garden to be desecrated,&quot; declared the king. So he ordered a great wall be built around the garden. He hired many craftsmen to decorate the wall so that it would shine as beautifully as the garden. A great celebration day was given in honor of the wall and many came to admire it.<br>
<br>
New songs had been written for the dedication of the wall. Many people wore new costumes and jewelry. When the festival was over, everyone rushed to the wall to admire its beautiful carvings, inlays of gold, and layers of precious jewels.<br>
<br>
When the seventh day came, many people asked for the wall ceremony service to be done that day, so the prime minister changed the order of the festival. The wall was the center of attention again and the enchanted garden was forgotten. The king was somewhat concerned but dismissed his thoughts when the celebrations began.<br>
<br>
Week after week, the people insisted on the wall festival songs and feast. And week after week, the people would stand by the wall and admire it. After many months of this, the king became very concerned.<br>
<br>
&quot;The garden with the enchanted tree is more important than the wall.&quot; he declared. But the people would not listen and continued to admire the&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp wall.<br>
<br>
One festival day, a very sick man could be heard outside the wall moaning and calling out to the people inside. Before the wall was put up, sick people could enter the garden through the hedge. This man was so sick he could not climb over the wall.<br>
<br>
Two compassionate men went outside and carried the sick man into the garden. The prime minister of the king ordered the men to take the sick man away. &quot;We do not want to disturb the festivities,&quot; cautioned the&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp prime minister. But the king overheard the prime minister and rebuked him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bring the sick man in so that he may find comfort.&quot; said the king. The prime minister had the two men carry the sick man to the wall. After gazing at the wall, the sick man agreed that it was truly a beautiful sight to behold. When the sick man had been brought into the garden, the festivity stopped and everyone could hear the beautiful song of the tree.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please take me to the tree!&quot; cried the sick man. His new friends carried&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp him to the enchanted tree. &quot;Please, pick a small piece of fruit from the tree so that I may eat and be made well.&quot; said the sick man. One of the men plucked a juicy, ripe, golden piece that made everyone hungry to taste it.<br>
<br>
The sick man was too weak to bite into it himself, so he asked the other&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp man to break the fruit into bite size pieces so that he could possibly chew it. He was so weak that at first all he could do was suck on the juices. But strength began to surge through him and he chewed on the bite vigorously. Soon, he was sitting up and taking generous bites and enjoying every savory morsel.<br>
<br>
When he finished, he began to sing a song that he used to hear. The song was one sung by the people for the festivity of the garden before the wall was built. It was one that he had heard outside the hedge when the festival sounds rang out through the city and the surrounding countryside. The people joined him one by one until all were singing the old familiar song.<br>
<br>
After the song, the prime minister declared that the wall should be destroyed and carried off to the rubbish heap. But the king summoned the prime minister and his other officials to a council.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no need to tear down the wall,&quot; said the wise king. &quot;Let us put gates and doors in it, so that the people of the kingdom may come in and go out and have access to the tree and the festival. Let us not honor the&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp wall but the garden during our celebration. The wall is necessary for protection and sets aside the garden as a special place for us and the people. We will maintain the wall and keep it beautiful, but the tree and the garden are much more worthy of the celebration.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ministers agreed whole heartedly with the king and the prime minister declared that the king was indeed a man of great wisdom.<br>
<br>
So the celebration of the garden and the song of the tree continues even now and the kingdom has flourished and prospered. And if you ever are travelling in this enchanted land, stay as long as the seventh day and join the Festivity of the Garden.<br>

He was alluding to the worship time to being heaven on earth (the garden and the tree). Earlier at an adult Sunday School meeting, the teacher was lauding and praising the Law, somewhat bragging of how he kept it down to the Sabbath and admonishing us to live by it (the wall). The contrast between the words of the pastor and the teacher fired my imagination and I found myself sketching out the main parts of the story on the back of a bulletin.<br>

Thank you very much for sharing it with us.  It describes an all-too-familiar scenario in my life too;  placing more emphasis on the structure, the building, rather than on truth, forgiveness, and healing which is in Christ our Lord.<br>
