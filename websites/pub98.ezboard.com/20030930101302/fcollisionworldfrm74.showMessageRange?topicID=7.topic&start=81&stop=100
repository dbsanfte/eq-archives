<br>
Her tears were replaced with gentle fingers.  And her breath was hushed by the sudden warmth of Aeli's lips.<br>
<br>
Her head reeled.  At first, she couldn't remember where she was, or who she was.  Sudden and forceful, but tender and sweet at the same time.  <br>
<br>
Aeli was...kissing her??<br>
<br>
Suddenly she panicked and drew away, breathing harsh, thin air that suddenly did not satisfy her lungs.  She gazed at him lovingly, fresh tears running down her face.<br>
<br>
But why was she crying again? She couldn't remember...<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...&quot;  she whispered before returning the kiss gently, finding she was where she had always belonged.<br>

He found himself wrapping his arms around her in a gentle embrace, bringing her even closer to him than before.<br>
<br>
This was something he never wanted to end. Something he never imagined would happen to him. For the longest time he had remained, for the most part, emotionless, in fear the demon inside him would break the seal again. <br>
But, Laurena even loved that part of him. Even the demon...<br>
<br>
And he loved her with all his heart and soul. It was something he couldn't explain. He'd felt like this since only in instant after he first laid eyes on her. Only had he recently been able to identify it. <br>
<br>
Aeli gently deepened the kiss, now holding Laurena closely to him. He could feel her warmth and hearbeat. <br>
Softly, he drew away from her and rested his forehead against hers.<br>
&quot;When you cry, it tears me apart.&quot; His words finally broke the silence. &quot;Laurena...&quot; Gods he loved saying her name. Just like her, it was beautiful. His grip tightened around the siren-girl in a now firm, yet still tender embrace. Suddenly, he couldn't find the words to say to her. His voice had left him and flown off with the wind, or washed away by the sea.<br>
Why couldn't he just tell her? That's what she needed the most, was to know she was loved more than anything in the world. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've fallen deeply in love...&quot; Finally, he got himself to whisper softly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 672<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(7/13/03 2:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ^______^</span><hr size=1> Laurena heard these words and went pale.  Did it really hurt him so?  She let him pull her tighter into the embrace, her eyes wide and staring in the moonlight that was becoming overthrown by clouds.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so sorry...I'll try so hard not to from now on, you'll see.&quot;  She enfolded her wings about them, and wiped her face dry before holding him once more.  &quot;If it hurts you so badly...I won't anymore.  I promise.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then he said it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've fallen deeply in love...&quot; <br>
<br>
As he said this, she knew she was close to breaking her promise already.  But she fought them back with a new strength that hadn't been there before, and embraced him protectively.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not afraid to love both of your hearts,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;You have to realize that.  Both of them deserve to love, or at least be loved.  You don't have to be afraid either.  That tears me apart, precious Aeli.&quot;<br>
<br>
She knew she made no sense, but the words came from her heart.  However wretched her heart may be, she loved Aeli with all of it.  And would stand by him until she could no longer stand or breathe.<br>
<br>
Did he realize this...?<br>
<br>
She kissed him once more and then held still, gazing at him fondly as she felt rain spattering the back of her wings.<br>

He loved the rain. Rain, the ocean, a quiet forest... all those he enjoyed immensely. Mostly being alone, but now he had Laurena, and no longer had any need or want to be alone. At least right now. <br>
<br>
&quot;Azalea.&quot; He suddenly said, surprised he'd forgetten about her. &quot;Is she alright?&quot; His mind had completely forgotten the others, drifting away into this dream with Laurena. But now he was back in reality. The reality that brought so much hatred and sorrow. The reality that was sending a warning tingle up his spine. Something wasn't right. Maybe it was his demon powers to be able to sense almost any energy...that was telling him this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 674<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(7/13/03 2:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> TRYPHAENA!!</span><hr size=1> &quot;Azalea?

<br>
After a few long moments, she looked up at him and kissed him again.  The action was becoming sweetly addictive, and she couldn't find it in herself to withdraw from it.<br>
<br>
When she pulled away, she laughed breathlessly despite herself, flushing pink.  &quot;You're going to catch a cold,&quot; she said to him.  &quot;I suppose we should get inside.  They'll be worried...&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood up, helping him up with her.  She smiled at him and shook the rain from her hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli--&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly her voice cut off into a shrill scream.  Thunder pounded the ground as suddenly her hand was ripped from Aeli's hand, and she went tumbling into the sky carried by a terrible black winged figure.  <br>
<br>
Black feathers littered the ground where Laurena had stood, along with a mortuil necklace, crushed.<br>
<br>
The lightning splayed a frightening, vivid view of the two sirens jostling in the air.  Laurena had managed to pull herself away, but the dark siren was vicious; she swerved around and caught her from behind just as she tried to fly away, and a painful scream emitted through the air.  The dark siren continued her merciless attacking , ripping at her and ramming at her until all that was keeping Laurena in the air was the force of her blows.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeeeli!!! RUN!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally the dark siren let Laurena fall from twenty feet and land before Aeli, a bloody mess but still very much alive and conscious.<br>
<br>
Tryphaena landed calmly beside her, smirking dangerously at Aeli with Laurena's blood on her hands and on her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fancy meeting you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena's face was etched with more fury than pain, though it looked like her arm was broken and clawmarks ravaged her skin.  She pulled herself up, standing in front of Aeli protectively.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tryphaena...STAY AWAY FROM HIM!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena lunged at her, but Tryphaena merely knocked her aside with a powerful hand.  Laurena crumpled to the sand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Temper, dear,&quot; she growled morbidly.  &quot;Now...give the necklace, and I swear I'll let him live.&quot;<br>

Laurena looked helplessly up at her.  &quot;The necklace...?&quot;  She grasped it in her bloody hand.  &quot;Yes...go on, take it...just please leave him alone...&quot;<br>

He wished Mae or Fina were here...thier healing powers were quite remarkable. <br>

&quot;No...Aeli, please...she only wants the necklace...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right,&quot; she purred.  &quot;Give me the ankh, and everything will be fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena tried to remove the ankh, but she couldn't.  Suddenly her eyes went blank and she fell forward, choking and gasping.  What was she doing?! Tryphaena wouldn't just take the necklace.  She'd take Aeli's life as well...she couldn't be trusted, no matter how much she loved the dark siren.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oops.  Forgot to mention...you can't take it off yourself.&quot;  She came forward, outstretching a clawed hand.  &quot;Allow me to help you...&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly Laurena got an idea.  Breathing hard, she stood up.  &quot;You want it? Come and get it,&quot; she growled, and took off into the stormy air, though she flew awkwardly, grazing the sand with her wings.  <br>
<br>
Tryphaena yawned and took off after her, a hawk after a wounded sparrow.<br>
<br>
Laurena only prayed that Aeli would have the sense to run.<br>

<br>
She didn't notice she was going east until suddenly she hit that wall that made her see fire and hear the screams of the dying.  She dropped to the ground again, shrinking away from that place, that horrible place.<br>
<br>
Tryphaena grabbed her by her necklace and dragged her near, pinning her down.<br>
<br>
&quot;We had to do this the hard way, didn't we?&quot; she bit mockingly.  &quot;And of course, look where we are.  A ghost always returns to the resting ground, does it not?  Now, stay still!&quot;<br>
<br>
She gripped the chain and started burning through it with her power.  Magic untold protected the chain, but she burned through it slowly, watching with glee as she saw the life drain out of Laurena's eyes.<br>

<br>
She watched helplessly as Aeli attacked Tryphaena, pulling at her ankh and screaming.  Never had she seen him so angry.  She watched as Tryphaena went unconscious, limp in Aeli's hurting hands.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...?&quot;<br>
<br>
She hadn't wanted it to be like this.  She wanted Aeli to be okay.  Now he had turned into the demon.  And she was at that demon's mercy.<br>

She would have had it no other way.<br>

Laurena laid still, for it was all she could do, watchign silently and waiting for the demon to finish her as well.<br>

He rested her hand on her forehead, and she disappeared into thin air. Then, he looked over to Laurena, his eyes softening, but remained red.<br>

Azalea rushed to meet him, wary at first, but uncaring of Kelin.  She took Laurena and laid her on the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Laurena...&quot;  She grasped the place where the chain was melted and whispered words that made no sense to Aeli or Kelin.  When she moved her hand away, the cahin was whole again, and Laurena had gone lax, but strangely ashen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Laurena...Laurena!&quot;  Azalea shook her shoulder, but the siren would not wake.  A look of panic was on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;No...I wasn't too late, I know I wasn't!&quot;  Her ear pressed against Laurena's chest and listened hard.  For a moment, nothing stirred.  Azalea's own heart silenced so that Azalea could hear a faint, irregular pounding somewhere deep within the brunette, her heart beating with the weakness of a baby robin's heart.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Maiem...&quot;Azalea whispered.  She collected the girl up in her arms and lifted her up, much stronger now that she had rested.  Then she retreated into the hut she had been staying in.  She looked back at Kelin.<br>
