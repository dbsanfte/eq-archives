He was by himself. He eyed the odd contestants, looking to see if he could spot his target. He had been tracking him for days and it lead him here. He eyed pairs sparring together and getting each other ready. Kenji wondered. Should he join with a partner? He gazed out amongst the fighters. He saw a red fox meditating alone... &quot; Yes&quot; he thought to himself... That will be my partner... <p><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is the practice of principle and the practice of action.Principle is as mentioned before: when you have arrived at mastery, you don't struggle with anything.

Hmm, he has red eyes...I didn't notice that before...No matter, though...He definetely has skill...I can feel it...Well, I guess I should go introduce myself.<br>
<br>
Yuushi slowly raised himself to his feet, and walked towards the red-eyed warrior. He stopped about two feet in front of him, and with a calm and steady expression, spoke. &quot;Hi. I'm Yuushi.&quot; Glancing around the room again, he said, &quot;Wanna team up?&quot; He extended his paw in a friendly, if not respectful gesture. <p>(The pic of Yuushi):<br>

<br>
Yuushi still didn't quite feel comfortable talking to a stranger about his family's murder. Likewise, he was sure that Kenji had his own reservations. Still, it felt nice to talk to someone for the sake of talking.<br>
<br>
Looking around, the tournament looked to be a while. &quot;Hey Kenji...feel like warming up a bit?&quot; <p>(The pic of Yuushi):<br>
