<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>------------------</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
With her back to the aging oak, Anodale sat holding her hands before her, as if to cradle a small child. Turning and twisting her hands, looking upon each indentation with careful detail, she took cautious notice, as she had so many times before. Monstrous, she thought. Suddenly, she lifted the right, positioning it to the dark moon, each tip to edge. Gradually, she lowered her hands into her lap and wordlessly closed her eyes. <br>
<br>
The evening was darker than most but she assumed the feeling was attuned with her mood and lay within herself. The Cursed Forest had always had a smell of desertion. For her, it was filled with despair, as not a beast would even tempt with attack on such a pitiful creature. She was safe here. <br>
<br>
With this consideration, she lowered her staff and dreamt. <br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
<br>
Anodale looked down at her tattered and worn map made from hardened leather and cloth. Surveying her location, she made careful steps north to look upon the keep she saw in the distance. Making her way from tree to tree, she quietly (as quite as a firbolg could allow) stepped down the densely covered hill. Approaching close enough as to not be detected by unruly guards, she quickly scratched a small sketch of the fort with her worn feather. <br>
<br>
This was Albion. A land she had traversed many times in the past. However, as she neared the finish of her sketch, she realized to herself that this could quite possibly be the last Albion stronghold to record. She stopped her drawing and looked up with a saddened face. <br>
<br>
She had enjoyed her inherently safe journeys of this land and was upset that it might all come to an end. She thought of this torn land and the foolishness of men, witnessing the spill of blood from the evenings, past. <br>
<br>
Anodale quickly washed her face of emotion, shook her head, and went back to work. <br>
<br>
As the feather began to continue it's swift motions, a cracking branch was heard from behind. Anodale's ears immediately stood, turning quickly to the noise - Her eyes moving quicker. A small female figure, peering from behind a deadened tree. <br>
<br>
Startled, the strange woman turned to run - dropping her feather and parchment, Anodale quickly took after the woman. Not wishing to lose this curious onlooker, she withheld her want to use magic and the delay it would cause. <br>
<br>
The chase was met with quiet whispers of the bush and leaves as the two ran through the forest. Anodale knew chasing this woman was more than likely a trap, but thought it odd that a scout from Albion would not strike. Who could she be and why would she let herself be seen? Baited, perhaps? Will I be silenced for my own curiosity? <br>
<br>
As these thoughts ran through her mind, Anodale did not notice the forest had grown even denser and that a grasping branch had cut her cheek. However, such matters quickly left her mind as she heard a large crack, a soft scream, and a terrible fall. <br>
<br>
Slowing her pace, Anodale quietly made her way forward until she saw the figure collapsed to the ground. The woman held her left leg tightly whilst pushing her body backward with her right. Blood soaked the woman's gloves. <br>
<br>
Before Anodale could take another step further, the injured woman yelled in a strange language and lifted her hands as to stop Anodale from approaching. The woman then pointed, with her blood soaked hand, to the ground before Anodale. <br>
<br>
Looking down, Anodale saw a rather clever trap lay to quickly still prey. The blade of the trap was perhaps to take away the leg of a smaller animal. Now, it was covered with a small strip of leather and the colour red. <br>
<br>
Anodale looked to the injured woman, who had turned her attention to escaping. However, each attempt to move herself further back noticeably weakened her until she moved no further. The strange woman loosened her grip on her leg and fell backwards, slipping into unconsciousness, blood escaping the wound at a terrible rate. <br>
<br>
Without a thought, Anodale jumped over the trap, dropping her staff to the ground. Kneeling to the woman, she began to chant as she covered the wound with her hands. The surrounding leaves and dirt were staining around the two - the wound would not cease it's torment. Anodale quickened her prayer as she felt the woman's pulse slowing. <br>
<br>
With tightened muscles, Anodale began to shout her prayer at the seemingly uncontrollable gash. Suddenly, the wound stopped and closed. <br>
<br>
Exhausted, Anodale ripped a part of her cloak to wipe away the blood from the woman's leg. To her suprise, the wound had not only stopped, but any trace of such a gap was all but gone. Not a mark! Never before had she healed those without scars left behind. <br>
<br>
Anodale took the blood-soaked scrap into her pack and met her back to a nearby stump. <br>
<br>
Closing her eyes, she drifted away into a dreamless slumber. <br>
<br>
----- <br>
<br>
She awoke to the gentle touch of cloth to her cheek. <br>
<br>
As she opened her eyes, she saw the strange woman nursing the forgotten cut on Anodale's cheek. <br>
<br>
Stopping herself, the woman slowly took her hand from Anodale's cheek and softly smiled. Anodale could only see the woman's lips as the rest of her was shrouded in a dark cloak, as it had been from the begining. She was a scout, and her attire was meant to veil her movement and the strike of her bow. <br>
<br>
Noticing Anodale's curiosity, the woman slowly lowered her hood and removed her bow and quiver, placing them to the ground. <br>
<br>
The woman was nearly as dark as the clothing she was wearing. An exotic beauty Anodale had not seen before this day. Her hair seemed as silk - black - that swam about the woman's face as she stirred. Such precise and graceful movement. Anodale wondered what had happened - how the woman had fallen to such a trap. The woman seemed rather old - perhaps 40 in age - but times had only given her slight wrinkles and an intelligent look. <br>
<br>
Anodale's thoughts quickly left as the woman leaned forward to gently kiss her cheek. Standing upright, the woman began to walk away - not a hint of the wound given to her. <br>
<br>
'Wait,' Anodale whispered. <br>
<br>
Appearing not to have heard, the woman continued to walk futher away. As Anodale began to speak again, she realized what the woman was doing. <br>
<br>
Leaning forward, the lady picked up the staff Anodale had thrown to the ground. Examining the staff closely, she took a small, rectangular piece of cloth from her pack. She then continued to clean the staff gently, as if in search of something hidden. <br>
<br>
The strange woman made her way to the crystals that lay on the staff's head. <br>
<br>
'Please...the staff...be careful.' Anodale quietly spoke. 'It is very important to me.' <br>
<br>
The woman stopped for a moment, in stern examination, and then quickly went to work on the largest crystal. However, her rubbing did not seem to have the desired response. Defeated, the woman took a small vile from her pack. <br>
<br>
Dipping the cloth into the vile, the woman began again. This time, a soft cloud of blue light escaped from between the cloth and crystal. A sweet smell quickly made it's way to Anodale as she looked at the woman. She had ceased and was now looking intently at the crystal. <br>
<br>
The woman smiled and her face grew bright as she approached Anodale, with the staff in hand. <br>
<br>
Bending her knees, the woman kneeled with the staff in both hands as if an offering of a gift. Anodale took the staff and looked over it carefully. She then looked towards the largest crystal. <br>
<br>
The woman smiling, pointed upon this crystal she had been working so diligently on. <br>
<br>
An engraved message was clearly visible. A student of the Great Libraries, Anodale quickly realized the writing was that of a long forgotten variation of ancient Elvish. <br>
<br>
She knew what it said, almost immediately. But, before she could utter the word, the woman began to speak in a tongue Anodale did not understand. <br>
<br>
Confused, Anodale closely listened to the strange woman as if to understand as much as she could from the woman's tone and pitch. <br>
<br>
And spoke she did - For quite some time. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, the woman stopped, became very stern, and removed her glove. She unbuttoned her top just enough to lift the back of her leather and nail vest. Turning, the woman lifted the back of her clothing to reveal hundreds of scars. <br>
<br>
Anodale gasped and began to move her hand to her own back. Before she could reach, the woman quickly turned to stop Anodale - The woman nodded to her. <br>
<br>
Lifting her hand to Anodale's face, the woman carefully touched her cheek. She then spoke in the ancient language written on the staff's crystal. <br>
<br>
'I am bound to you - forever and always - Rhyanwen' <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>------------------------</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Anodale slowly opened her eyes to the dark night. Without leaning forward, she lifted her hand once more to the moon. Lowering her hand to her cheek, she carefully touched the scar from her forest chase. <br>
<br>
She slowly moved her hand from her face and touched her back. The woman she encountered so long ago - thousands of scars they both shared from a long forgotten oppressor. <br>
<br>
Returning her hands to her lap, Anodale closed her eyes once more. <br>
<br>
And dreamt. <br>
<br>
