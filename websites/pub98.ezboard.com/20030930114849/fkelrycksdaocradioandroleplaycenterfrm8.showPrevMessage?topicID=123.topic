It was the right one. Although made from a beast that towered well over twice his own height, the footprint -that of a large boot- only left a slight depression in the fragile green moss that covered the ground. After exploring the Albion frontier realm for days, he had found what he had been looking for. <br>
<br>
A forest giant. <br>
<br>
And where forest giants laired, the Celestial Orchid was bound to grow. Rumored to be a flower of incredible beauty and resistance, it only grew in the deepest of forests. Arboryn had mentioned the flower to him one day while they tended the grove. It was said that the giants had stolen the orchids from Hibernia ages past and that they guarded them still. Although the giants were attuned to the natural weave, they giants had been driven out of the realm because of their evil nature, bringing with them the stunning flowers as a form of vengeance. Many men had tried to bring some of the flowers backs, to their ultimate, crushing demise. <br>
<br>
But Degran was never one to pay much attention to warnings of danger. <br>
<br>
Several days ago, Arieanna and Arboryn had set off to go hunt deep into the Cursed Forest and were not planning on returning anytime soon. Degran had taken his chance, packed his gear and made his way to the region where the giants were rumored to live. <br>
<br>
The trip there had been difficult. The Albs themselves were not the overconfident sort and took defending their territory seriously. Degran had narrowly escaped getting caught –and most likely killed- more times than he’d care to admit. But he had managed to elude war parties and patrols on the way to the woods near Castle Sauvage. He had slept little and ate what he could find on the way. Twice he had to fight monsters that had crossed his path. Both fights had cost him a few wounds, nothing serious but he had feared being discovered more. <br>
<br>
Now Degran walked slowly, testing every step to make sure he would not snap a twig or stumble. The giants were said to be able to blend with the surrounding area and could move with amazing stealth for their size. The young ranger had his bow out before him, an arrow knocked and ready. The wood of the bow, a bow his wife had given him seemed to grant him strength. He felt her through the spirit bond they had shared and knew she was in good spirits, maybe she felt what he was up to, but he did not believe that she had managed to percieve his unease. When he would encounter a giant, he would not have time to shoot many arrows and each shot counted. <br>
<br>
Degran crouched behind a thick bush and surveyed the clearing before him. A tree had fallen years ago, leaving a gap in the canopy above and letting the bright sunshine filter through. He could circle the clearing, but the bushes surrounding it were dense, having taken advantage of the extra light afforded by absence of the taller tree. He would have to cross the clearing. Small plants and large ferns grew thick in the clearing. Although Degran was no novice to woodcraft, his passing would leave a mark, there were too many plants to circumvent them all. The celt breathed deeply to settle his nerves and crept into the clearing. In the middle, like some ancient ruin of a keep wall was the fallen tree. It was almost as tall as Degran and well over thirty feet long. Keeping an eye on the forest around him, he made his way to the log. The bark on the tree was rotting, leaving ample anchoring space for large bone-white mushrooms. Degran noticed the small red dots on the underside of the mushrooms marking them as a particularly deadly species. Every square inch not otherwise occupied by the fungi was covered in thick green moss. The ranger had no choice but to climb over the log and the wet moss would only make his climb harder. He released his grip on his bow string and, still holding the arrow and his bow with his left hand, he reached for one of the rare branches that were still attached to the trunk of the gigantic tree. He deftly swung himself on the branch and managed to stand on it, allowing him a view of the other side of the log. Several small indentations on the ground and some scattered, broken plants warned Degran that a giant had rested here, and fairly recently. He cautiously looked into the woods on the far side of the clearing but could not see any signs of the behemoth. <br>
<br>
A sliver of purple and sky blue caught his sweeping gaze. There, growing in the shadow of the fronds of a particularly large fern was a Celestial Orchid. Degran was sure he was not mistaken. Its stem and leaves were the color of emeralds but the flower itself was what captivated him. In the center, the flower was the red-orange of a clear and bright sunset. The petals were a rare deep shade of purple at the base that lightened to the color of a clear summer sky. <br>
<br>
But something was very wrong. Alerted suddenly by the absence of sound around him save the rustling of the wind in the leaves Degran snapped out of his reverie and peered around him again. <br>
<br>
“By the roots of the Great Willow” Degran mumbled as his eyes fell upon the unmoving features of a large giant. The creature was standing still only a few feet away from the Orchid, its face impassive. The monster was perhaps 16 feet tall, its skin was the green of the forest around it, even changing in hue to match the surrounding shadows. A dirty grayish loin cloth was all it seemed to possess, that and more muscle that a score of oxen. It was clear that it was waiting for the ranger to come down from the log to attack, although the giant hardly needed that since it could reach him even in his elevated position were it to come near the log.. <br>
<br>
How could I have missed it? The ranger asked himself. He nocked an arrow below the top of the log so as not to alert the giant of his intentions. Sweat was already forming on his brow. To have the flower, he had to slay the giant, there would be no sneaking past this obstacle and Degran did no relish such a fight. It was after all a giant. <br>
He shifted his weight on the branch he was standing on to allow for an easier shot and looked over the log again. <br>
<br>
The giant was already halfway towards him, moving as silently as a cat. Degran’s eyes opened wide, but his instincts took over and he loosed his arrow towards the giant. The shaft sunk deep into the giant’s chest. The monster didn’t seem to feel the wound; instead he bellowed and charged, his meaty fists raised to crush the ranger. Degran shot it again, this time the arrow drove into the giant’s green belly. The giant stumbled but resumed to the right but resumed its charge and swung its fists towards the celt. Deg managed to jump down just before the monster’s fists slammed the log. The rotted wood gave way underneath the powerful attack. The ranger didn’t quite make it. Shards of rotten wood and moss flew in all directions and buffeted him. Degran landed heavily on the ground, his balance upset by the force of the impact. The giant was roaring and was climbing over the log to reach him. Degran looked about for his quiver which had fallen off his back. He spotted it lying at the base of the log. The ranger didn’t take the time to debate the feasibility of reaching the quiver before the giant dropped down on him. He quickly jumped up and ran towards his arrows. In a quick, fluid motion he grabbed an arrow and fitted it on his bowstring. The ranger raised his bow as he backed away from the log. The giant was straddling the log, its other leg already swinging over it. The giant’s face was twisted in rage and anger and its yellow eyes were fixed squarely on him. “I crush you puny hooman!” it promised and grinned. <br>
<br>
Degran shot it in the face. <br>
<br>
The arrow tore into its left eye. The behemoth screamed in pain and slapped a hand to his eye. Its depth perception ruined, the giant missed its step and crashed to the forest floor, crushing ferns beneath it. Degran dropped his bow and drew his blades, he was out of arrows. <br>
<br>
Degran’s arrows had taken their toll on the giant though and it was showing signs of fatigue. Its breathing was laborious; the first arrow must have punctured a lung. Its left eye was ruined and the wound in its belly was bleeding heavily. Degran advanced cautiously though. A giant, even wounded, was still very dangerous. The giant seemed to realize the perilous situation it was in and kept an eye on the ranger as it got to its feet. It would not underestimate the human again. <br>
<br>
Degran moved towards the giant, shouting taunts at it. The giant growled and swung towards him. Degran ducked under the clumsy swing, thankful for the lucky eye shot and ran closer to the giant. With his longsword he opened a gash between the giant’s ribs and he used the flat oh his falcate to drive the arrow in the monster’s belly deeper. The giant bellowed again and tried to crush him with his fists. The ranger rolled out of the way of the two fists, thinking the fight almost over. But the giant had expected the move and landed a solid kick on the ranger. Degran’s roll became a wild tumble that ended against the very same bush he had been crouching behind earlier. He felt a sharp pain in his side, probably some broken ribs, but he could still breath fairly well, despite the pain so he new that his lung wasn’t punctured. He couldn’t feel his right leg and guessed it to be sprained or broken. His vision was blurry as well. He could feel the ground shake as the giant was moving towards him. He had lost his blades during his tumble and he searched frantically around him with his hands, trying to find them by feel. His fingers brushed something hard; he figured it was a rock. Having nothing else to use, he gripped it firmly and tried to see where the giant was. When he looked up all he was a great shadow, the giant was leaning over him. His vision cleared enough for him to see a bloody hand descend towards him. Degran tried to roll out of the way but his wounded leg would not allow it. He was helpless as the giant picked him up and squeezed him mercilessly in his fist. The monster brought him up close to its face so it could see him more clearly. It wore a sneer of supremacy as it looked upon it’s weakened attacker. <br>
<br>
“Juse not so tough without yer arraws” it gloated. Degran’s head swam. He had to find a way to get out of this predicament. But what was he to do, with only a rock to fight with. The ranger’s arms were not bound into the giant’s hand and Deg looked at the weapon in his hand, wondering just how much he could hurt the giant. But he grinned, despite his situation. The Great Willow was watching over him after all. Degran looked into the giant’s remaining good eye and smiled at the monster. <br>
<br>
“Look at me closely, you overgrown moss-kisser, it’ll be the last thing you see” He said. The giant frowned, not understanding. Degran suddenly grabbed the arrow shaft embedded in the giants eye with his left hand and pulled with all his remaining strength. Sickly yellow fluid mixed with blood gushed out of the wound and the giant screamed again. <br>
<br>
That’s when Degran threw the poisonous mushroom he had taken for a rock deep into the monster’s throat. Its scream ended abruptly. The giant dropped the ranger and grabbed its throat with both hands. Degran crawled away from the giant as fast as he could. Already its face was swelling up. The giant’s eye was wide open in fear and it tried desperately to breathe but the mushroom was already affecting it. Its skin was becoming pale and its throat was being constricted. It pawed the air with its right hand and crashed to the forest floor where it thrashed about before lying completely still. <br>
<br>
Degran breathed a sigh of relief and managed to stand up. With the same gin on his face, he moved to collect his prize. <br>
<br>
***************************** <br>
<br>
<br>
A few days later Degran came back to the grove. He was limping slightly and his right eye was still a bit swollen. Arieanna and Arboryn were waiting for him, concern was evident on his wife’s face and he realized she must have felt his pain and fear during the battle. She rushed towards him and hugged him, but Degran groaned and gently pushed her away from his aching ribs. Arieanna was about to ask where he and been but he held a finger to her lips and reached down to get the satchel hanging from his shoulder. With a look of pride on his face, he took out a bundle of wrapped cloth. Arieanna frowned and look into her lover’s eyes, sensing that he was about to show her something important. Degran smiled at her and removed from the cloth the Celestial orchid he had plucked from the giant’s clearing and offered it to his love. <br>
<br>
<br>
There after, when someone would visit the grove and ask about the Celestial Orchid growing by a tall willow, Degran would simply smile and say he had fetched it <br>
<br>
to see Arieanna smile. <br>
