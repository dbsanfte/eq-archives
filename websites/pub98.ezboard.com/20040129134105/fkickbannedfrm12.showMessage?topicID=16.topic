Welcome to issue 3 of Phrack Pro-Phile.  The information herein was originally<br>
supposed to appear as a special issue of PWN, but instead was made this issue's<br>
Phrack Pro-Phile.  Taran King and I have collected much information about the<br>
different clubs and groups of today and yesterday and compiled in the form that<br>
you will now see.<br>
\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\<br>
Extasyy Elite:  The story of Extasyy Elite is a sad one for the group was<br>
                literally destroyed by its own members.  The Poltergeist turned<br>
                in all of Extasyy after he got busted for carding.  This led<br>
                the authorities to The Mentor who had stolen 30 Apple //es.<br>
                Mentor's bust almost led to The Protestor, but luckily, The<br>
                Mentor was able to warn Protestor in time.  (See Phrack World<br>
                News Issue III).<br>
<br>
The membership of the club included:<br>
<br>
                  Bit Blitz                    Cisban Evil Priest<br>
                  Crustaceo Mutoid             Kleptic Wizard<br>
                  The Mentor                   The Poltergeist<br>
                  The Protestor<br>
<br>
<br>
Crustaceo Mutoid later joined the Racketeers, but now he and The Mentor write<br>
for a California newsletter called the Underground Informer.<br>
<br>
         Extasyy hung out on Hack Net BBS and FWSO, a bbs in Colorado.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Fargo 4A:  This group was started on a conference consisting of Bioc Agent 003,<br>
           TUC, Big Brother, Quasi-Moto, Video Warhead, and the Wizard of<br>
           Arpanet.  What they did was get several Directory Assistants on the<br>
           conference, and each person assumed a role of some sort of telco<br>
           agent.  Now they told the DA's that all their calls were going to be<br>
           re-routed to a different location.  They got some of the DA's to<br>
           believe them, and some of them were almost laid off because of this<br>
           conference.  By the way, Fargo is in North Dakota, that's where the<br>
           first DA was from.<br>
<br>
           It is believed that Wizard of ARPAnet was busted by John Maxfield<br>
           and that BIOC completely retired from the phreak world.  This group<br>
           was unofficially disbanded, but several of the members are still<br>
           active.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Five-O:  A reasonably new IBM kracking group, which was formally the Imperial<br>
         Warlords.  Currently they are re-kracking software and claiming it to<br>
         be original by themselves.  They are known for placing insulting<br>
         messages towards certain people inside their re-kracked software.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
IBM Syndicate:  This group was formed around April 6, 1986.  Its charter<br>
                members included; Dark Creaper (916), Brew Associates (215),<br>
                Major Havoc (301), and one other whose handle remains unknown<br>
                to me at the current time.  They were a new phreak/hack/pirate<br>
                group.  Unfortunately, this group (like so many others) died<br>
                within its first month.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Icub (International Computer Underground Bandits):<br>
<br>
     This is a hack/phreak group who's main emphasis is on phreaking.  It is<br>
     based in Memphis, Tennessee.  It has 10 members in it, and the only<br>
     semi-active member left is Doc Holiday.  Not much else is really known<br>
     about this group except that it is inactive and there have not been any<br>
     announced plans to revive it.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
LOD/H:  Legion Of Doom/Hackers<br>
<br>
        These two groups are very closely intertwined.  They both were formed<br>
        on Plovernet. The founding member was Lex Luthor.  Through the years,<br>
        there have been LOD/H bulletin boards such as Blottoland, LOD, FOD,<br>
        etc.  Today there is Catch 22 and a new LOD bbs, supposedly being run<br>
        by King Blotto.  The current member list of the group is as follows:<br>
<br>
             Legion Of Hackers                      Legion Of Doom<br>
             -----------------                      --------------<br>
             Blue Archer                            Phucked Agent 04<br>
             Gary Seven                             Compu-Phreak<br>
             Kerrang Khan<br>
             Lex Luthor<br>
             Master Of Impact<br>
             Silver Spy (Sysop of Catch 22)<br>
             The Marauder<br>
             The Videosmith<br>
<br>
LOD/H is known for being one of the oldest and most knowledgeable of all<br>
groups.  In the past they have written many extensive g-philes about various<br>
topics.  (Please forgive any mistakes in the member list since this list was<br>
provided by Lex Luthor approximately 1 1/2 - 2 months ago).<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Metal Communications: A very large group that has written many files throughout<br>
                      its existence.  Some of the boards in its menagerie<br>
                      include Speed Demon Elite, Metal AE, Metal Works AE,<br>
                      Metalland I and several others. The membership of Metal<br>
                      Communications includes:<br>
<br>
Cobalt 60/Crimson Pirate/Dr. Local/Red Pirate/Shadow Lord/The Angel Of Destiny<br>
 The Apothecary/The Byte/The Byte Byter/The Dark Wizard/The Duke/The Dutchman<br>
The Man In Black/The Prophet/The Pink Panther/The Voice Over/The Radical Rocker<br>
                         The Warlock Lord/White Knight<br>
<br>
Red Pirate, Crimson Pirate, and Dr. Local are the group's main ware<br>
distributors.<br>
<br>
A subsidiary of Metal Communications is the Neon Knights whose membership<br>
includes:<br>
<br>
    Baby Demon/Jolly*Roger/The Blade aka Killer Kurt/The Master of Reality<br>
                     The Metallian/The Outland/Zandar Zan<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
PAG/PAP: Phreaks Against Geeks/Phreaks Against Phreaks Against Geeks<br>
<br>
         PAG:  This group was formed by TWCB Inc. as a joke on a conference in<br>
               December, 1985.  The charter members were TWCB, Inc.  taRfruS,<br>
               Blue Adept, The Clashmaster and a few others.  Later, Catcher in<br>
               the Rye and the Slovak wanted to join.<br>
<br>
         PAP:  In resistance to PAG, Boston Stangler and Micro Man formed PAP.<br>
               Several others sided with them but were never formal members.<br>
<br>
All of this nonsense was really started on the Dartmouth system and was mainly<br>
a feud between phreaks in the Boston (617) area until TWCB got involved.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The Administration:  This group was sort of in two parts; The Administration<br>
                     and Team Hackers '86.  The membership of these groups<br>
                     include:<br>
<br>
                  Adolph Hitler...............Team Hackers '86<br>

                  The President<br>
                  Walter Mitty<br>
<br>
The group did disband temporarily for reasons dealing with security, but now is<br>
back together.  For other news about this group see the current PWN.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The Nihilist Order:  This group was really a loosely connected bunch of friends<br>
                     and phreaks and not a true club.  It is based in Fremont<br>
                     and Sunnyvale, California.  It was started by TRASk and<br>
                     The Highwayman.  The membership includes:<br>
<br>
             BelGarion/Ogre Ogre/The Animator/The Highwayman/TRASk<br>
<br>
All of the members of the group have been busted or been involved in busts in<br>
the past few months.  The Highwayman bit it in the Phoenix Phortress Sting<br>
Operation, and the others all got caught on a carding scam.  Although BelGarion<br>
was later released with no record.<br>
<br>
One of the boards in the Nihilist Order's network is the Shattered World Elite,<br>
which is sysoped by TRASk.  The group is currently inactive.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The P.H.I.R.M.:  A somewhat new group that recently has been accused (without<br>
                 proof) of being fed invested.<br>
<br>
                 Not much is really known about this group as they would<br>
                 disclose very little information.  Some of the boards that are<br>
                 now P.H.I.R.M operated include Thieve's Underworld, sysoped by<br>
                 Jack The Ripper, World's Grave Elite sysoped by Sir Gamelord,<br>
                 and SATCOM IV.<br>
<br>
                 The P.H.I.R.M. reportedly will be releasing a newsletter.<br>
<br>
                 The membership of the P.H.I.R.M. supposedly includes:<br>
<br>
                    Archangel                  Blade Runner<br>
                    Jack The Ripper            Sir Gamelord<br>
                    The Stingray<br>
<br>
                It is rumored that Blade Runner is the same person as<br>
                Archangel and/or The Stingray.<br>

                        together to trade knowledge and information and to<br>
                        discuss this information until all the members had a<br>
                        good working knowledge of it.  The final result would<br>
                        be g-philes written by the group about the topic.  On<br>

2300 Club:  Based in Cleveland, Ohio.  The 2300 Club is now being compared and<br>
            treated as miniature mafia by local authorities.  This is mainly<br>
            for crimes including the blowing up of cars.  Two of the members<br>
            were caught for fraudulent use of a credit card and one has been<br>

2600 Club/New 2600 Club:  Both groups are no longer in existence.  Originally<br>
                          started as a local group of friends in St. Louis,<br>
                          Missouri, it gained members quickly, too quickly, and<br>
                          as the membership grew, the unity and productivity of<br>
                          the group lessened until the group(s) finally broke<br>
                          up.  However many of the members of 2600 Club now<br>
                          write (or have in the past) for Phrack Inc.  Among<br>
                          them are:<br>

            California, Maryland, Tennessee, Washington D.C., and Wyoming.<br>

            phreaking and carding group that also writes programs and sells<br>
            them.  He claims that they are not pirates. The group isn't very<br>

If Arch was written up in this magazine in the mid 80's, how is it that some people can say he's only been on the scene for just a few months? (or years for that matter) Are Arch's enemies in total denial? Has anyone ever confronted them with this? How do they react?<br>
