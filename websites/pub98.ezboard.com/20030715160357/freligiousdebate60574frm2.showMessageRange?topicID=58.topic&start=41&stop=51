One thing that really struck me as odd was the Blue Laws saying that places of business couldn't open before 1:30, YET all the resturants would open early for the church crowds. <br>
<br>
And for the record, I agree 100% with the Sabath and not working stuff. If you believe in it, then you should pratice it. kwim? Also, the Sabath is supposed to be on Sat... not Sun (Paige... do LDS pratice Sabath on Sat or Sun?

Oddly enough Paige, what you pointed out was the reason Anton LeVay founded the Church of Satan.  He was a caliopie player for a circus.  The same tents would be where the ministry would happen (and he played organ for them too) on sunday.  He watched all the people sin and debauch themselves friday and saturday night, then repent and be poius on sunday morning, only to repeat it all the following weekend.  From this he deduced that the flesh and its motives, when fed properly, were a higher truth than the biblical one.  Simple example, 7 deadly sins, vanity balances gluttony when they are at odds with each other.  Maybe you should read that book too while we are exploring relative truths...<br>

My friends don’t mention it and I don’t pry.  I know they get a lot of crap from people so they keep it pretty private.  They are not open to just any non-member and they hold them in “grottos” and sound really interesting.  I also know they attribute half the crap they get to poseur satanists that use the name but have no affiliation with the church or even a grasp of their worldviews.  Pretty much everything is summed up in The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LeVay and the basics are on their site under <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.churchofsatan.com/home.html" target="top">theory/practice</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. They place a lot of weight on personal merit and achievement, and I respect that.  They also give credit to our ‘flesh’ nature and are similar to objectivism in that satisfaction of pleasure (as dag pointed out) is a good thing when done in proper balance and not to the harm of others.  I find that it mirrors my libertarian stance on things like drugs or prayer.  Basicly, I don't care if you sit at home and spend your time smoking pot, playing nintendo, praying, having sex or however else you choose to consume your time.  I really don't see it as any of my business so long as it doesn't impact my personal liberties.  They do attach a good deal of personal responsibility for your life and actions.  If you spend your nights stoned or meditating or whatever, don't expect respect from them for failing to achieve.  Do what you want, but be prepared for the consequences of your actions.<br>
<br>
I don't disagree.<br>

PENTAGONAL REVISIONISM: <br>
<br>
A FIVE-POINT PROGRAM<br>
<br>
by Anton Szandor LaVey ©1988<br>
<br>
In recent years, we’ve wasted far too much time explaining that Satanism has nothing to do with kidnapping, drug abuse, child molestation, animal or child sacrifice, or any number of other acts that idiots, hysterics or opportunists would like to credit us with. Satanism is a life-loving, rational philosophy that millions of people adhere to. Now we’re ready for something that goes quite a few steps beyond just explaining our principles. Every revisionist movement needs a set of goals/guidelines that are clear, concrete, and that will effect significant changes. <br>
<br>
The following Five-Point Program reflects attitudes which allow others to decide whether they wish to align themselves with Satanism or not. Each is necessary for Satanic change to take place. When asked what we’re “doing,” here’s the answer:<br>
<br>
1. Stratification—The point on which all the others ultimately rest. There can be no more myth of “equality” for all—it only translates to “mediocrity” and supports the weak at the expense of the strong. Water must be allowed to seek its own level without interference from apologists for incompetence. No one should be protected from the effects of his own stupidity. <br>
<br>
2. Strict taxation of all churches—If churches were taxed for all their income and property, they’d crumble overnight of their own obsolescence, and the National Debt would be wiped out as quickly. The productive, the creative, the resourceful should be subsidized. So long as the useless and incompetent are getting paid, they should be heavily taxed. <br>
<br>
3. No tolerance for religious beliefs secularized and incorporated into law and order issues—to re-establish “Lex Talionis” would require a complete overturning of the present in-justice system based on Judeo-Christian ideals, where the victim/defender has been made the criminal. Amnesty should be considered for anyone in prison because of his alleged “influence” upon the actual perpetrator of the crime. Everyone is influenced in what he or she does. Scapegoating has become a way of life, a means of survival for the unfit. As an extension of the Judeo-Christian cop-out of blaming the Devil for everything, criminals can gain leniency, even praise, by placing the blame on a convenient villain. Following the Satanic creed of “Responsibility to the responsible,” in a Satanic society, everyone must experience the consequences of his own actions—for good or ill. <br>
<br>
4. Development and production of artificial human companions—The forbidden industry. An economic “godsend” which will allow everyone “power” over someone else. Polite, sophisticated, technologically feasible slavery. And the most profitable industry since T.V. and the computer. <br>
<br>
5. The opportunity for anyone to live within a total environment of his or her choice, with mandatory adherence to the aesthetic and behavioral standards of same—Privately owned, operated and controlled environments as an alternative to homogenized and polyglot ones. The freedom to insularize oneself within a social milieu of personal well-being. An opportunity to feel, see, and hear that which is most aesthetically pleasing, without interference from those who would pollute or detract from that option. <br>
<br>
This is the encapsulated version of the current thrust of Satanic advocacy. So when someone asks you, “Well, what do Satanists do?”, you will be qualified to tell him. <br>

As for Levy's book--read the Satanic Bible in high school and I was also surprised at the glaring lack of goat blood shedding. He also spoke against harming the innocent so it didn't seem very xian version of Lucifer to me.<br>
<br>
As for taking offense--I'll be damned if I have a clue where the terrible thread you're all referring to is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> (punny eh?) but if it's a debate board who cares? If you were getting personal crap the don't feel guilty giving it back. As for Joseph Smith being called &quot;nuts&quot;....wow--I've heard way worse and can't say I disagree, but then wasn't Jesus supposed to have been treated similarly. You must know that some of his claims, particularly the debunked &quot;new egyptian&quot; thing are subject to the sort of raised eyebrow that L. Ron Hubbard followers get when they whip out their machines and talk about aliens and blah, blah.<br>

Like I said, I have no earthly idea where you're embroiled in this hit discussion (oooo couldn't resist again) and if it's a support board then you should complain to the host. I hope she's better than some I've seen, but if you can't get satisfaction leave and go where you're welcome. If it's a debate board then sling some good biting sarcastic logic back at them<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

ST  <p>&quot;I don't have any evidence of that... Just in terms of allocation of time resources, <br>
religion is not very efficient.  There's alot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.&quot; <br>

Now that I have little kids, the only Zappa album that's appropriate to play at home is Apostrophe. But Filmore East is still my favorite.<br>

Boy, we are far off topic now!<br>

He's one of my favorite composers, ever. When I was a kid, first learning percussion, it was my dream to be his Ruth Underwood <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
