I agree.<br>
For the longest time I have been against the current guide license program, where any two-bit cracker such as myself, can get a guides license for the same or less amount of effort as ordering a pizza.  I have always thought the privilege of obtaining a guide's license should include something like a 2 day in-class educational program with topics ranging from &quot;business&quot; issues, such as, insurance, liability, tax info, and common since issues such as ethics, river changes/safety, CPR/First Aid, and river right of way.  I personally view my guide license as a contract, and perhaps it should be possible to have it revoked as the AGFC sees fit.  Now I know that raises flags, but if the AGFC slowly enacted a program over the next 2 years where the license was a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">revokable contract</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->,perhaps folks won't feel so eager to break the law at a client's request.   The excuse that a client brought up the idea shouldn't be a way out of a ticket.  Also included in the program should be a list of the guides in the fishing manuals, online if one so inclines and such.<br>
As for the entrapment bit, guides are PAID for VALID fishing information and instruction on the particular body of water.  The line of telling someone the limit and then ignoring the fact they take more is the same thing as being told your child can have a cookie at Walmart, but ignoring the dozen CD's they have under their shirt.   Like you said before, if someone if someone wants to break the law, it is a simple trip back to the dock/boat ramp.   It's kinda frustrating seeing the amount of money they threw into the operation mean nothing.<br>
Just my thought!<br>

I think this would do two things. Get rid of the weekend warriors ie part timers and add more professionalism to the rivers.      As for the entrapment deal I don't think it's necessary for officers to encourage a guide to go afoul of the regs.<br>
I will say this!  I don't feel that asking a guide to keep two limits is entrapment.  It happens all the time and the simple answer is NO. <br>
   Two officers showed up at one guides house with the following info:<br>
Picture,DL#,SS#,Guide liscense#, DOB,.....All the info was wrong. They had a picture of someone else. None of their info was correct on this guide. I know this guide well.  He lives around the corner from me and we will often ride to work together.  He spent two weeks trying to get in touch with an enforcement officer to find out what was going on.  He finally called the sherrifs dept and an enforcement officer of AF&amp;G showed up. <br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with doing sting ops but IMHO all they have to do is let the guide screw up on his own.  They can get plenty that way.  Yeah as it turns out they spent a lot of money.  But contrary to the written words in the newspapers not all of the guides got off.  Many did go to court and pay fines and court cost. Of those listed in the paper they just got lucky with the timing.  Many of them are outlaws and go afoul of the regs on a regular basis.  There are fewer of them now than 10 years ago when I started. (at least on the white)<br>
<br>
So once again I ask this Q?  Your guiding three people in the C&amp;R area.  One of your fisherman breaks off his fly and ties a new one on and forgets to smash the barb down.  Who is responsible.  Do you get a ticket or does the offender get a ticket.  Now lets say he is an undercover enforcement officer.  Do you still feel responsible???  Who should pay the ticket?<br>
Does it matter if you are wading or in a boat?  <br>
I don't think I should be responsible.  What if this same person yanks a deeply hooked fly from a fish releases it and causes it to bleed and die.  Do you get a ticket for wasting the edible portion of a fish and or are you held liable by way of aiding and abeting. Do you net it and put it in your live well?  Then you could get a ticket for netting fish. If you were in the C&amp;R area you could be in real trouble.  So yeah! I have a real problem with the entrapment thing.  <br>
<br>
So here is the dilema in my opinion.  Do you sacrifice the one innocnt guide for the good of the whole or do you let them all off to protect the one innocent guide?<br>
(referring to those in the paper)<br>
I think in our society we would mostly choose the latter and thats what happened.  <br>
<br>
Please don't get me wrong I'm not trying to defend the guilty guides.  It will catch up to them eventually.  The officers pretty much know who the offenders are and they have been put on the (payroll).  The operation really was a success in that some guides got points and fines and a bunch of them have straightend out their act.  <br>
<br>
Will see ya on the river Andrew.  <br>
<br>
Respecting and Encouraging all opinions of those involved with the White River.  There are no problems only solutions.  Fortunatly in our democratic Republic we can come up with solutions by lobbying and politicking those that represent us.  Otherwise go live in Cuba.<br>

You've both got it right. Let's have the AGFC take care of the bad guides, get them off the river without sacrificing the AGFC reputation. These big stings have not really worked in Arkansas because of the good ol' boy network. Let's start off with having qualified, ethical guides. When I started thinking about guiding, I talked to guides in the Rockies to find out what was necessary. I got all the insurance, re-upped my CPR and first aid certification, did business cards and brochures, registered as a business and rowed my boat for 4-5 months before I ever took out a client. Boy was I surprised when I went to get my guides license. No test, no nothing, only gimme 25 bucks and you're a guide.<br>
I had talked to Bill Ackerman when he was a Commissioner, and he was all for getting a program to license guides, but he got booted for a petty political agenda by our state senator. Don't know how the other commissioners feel about this. A 2 year faze in of existing guides and immediate testing for new guides doesn't seem too bad. We need to have at least the basics for guides, first aid/cpr, ethics, etc. The only thing I don't want is to be required to be through an outfitter. I enjoy the opportunity to be an independent guide.<br>
Let's have no more big stings, let the dummy guides sink themselves. Maybe volunteer river keepers to watch out for the river. Someone that is on the river every day. Good guides watching out for their river. Each of us taking responsibility for the resource. As one of the enforcement supervisors told me, it is cheaper to raise trout than pay for extra officers to be on the water all the time.<br>
Drew, remember the time you took my wife and I out and got checked at lunch. The officers went through the trash to see if we were eating fish. And then told us it was illegal to clean fish in that area (Shoestring). <br>
Jimmy, as for your question about the barbed hook in C&amp;R really don't know with the regulations we have now. As a guide we are responsible to inform the clients of the regs., but can we tie on all their flies? And was it the intent to break the law. Right now if you tie on a fly and accidentally drop it in the water before you have a chance to de-barb, you are breaking the law. <br>
I have a problem in the same vein. Had clients out and one caught an undersized cutthroat. It was hooked in the gill and was bleeding very bad. Took the fly out, barbless, and let the fish go after I thought was revived. It swam to the bottom and then went belly up. Re-netted it and spent nearly 10 minutes reviving. The fish swam about 15-20 feet away and went belly up again. What should I have done? I know I broke several rules, but there was no way not to. Whatever was done would have been a violation. The only thing worse would have to be in the C&amp;R area. Felt very bad about the fish, but clients were impressed with the effort made, but I still broke several regs. What to do?<br>
Hope to see all of you on the river. Tight lines to all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfisher74>Flyfisher74</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#000000>(6/25/03 2:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=96.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sting</span><hr size=1> In my (not so) humble opinion, this entire thread should be forwarded to the AGFC.

I am reminded about my days during the 50's while I was stationed in Germany.  Myself and another member of the base Rod &amp; Gun club were nominated to attend a 30-day course in Frankfurt just to to become Hunting Instructors and teach a one-week course before members could obtain a German hunting license.  Hunting guides in Germany were all Foresters and every one of them were the equivalent of college graduates in their training. <br>

When we had our meeting with two enforcemnt officers that very question came up.  Here is the answer we got.<br>
<br>
&quot;we wouldn't write you up for that. But if it was a sting op you would and when it got to the cap't or the Lt. it would be thrown out&quot;  We got the same response about putting fish back into the river at the end of the day.  If for instance you had a couple of limits of fish in your livewell and at the end of the day your fisherman decided that they really didn't want to keep them these two officers were not going to write a ticket.  However they said that if they went over to the spot they were released in and there were dead ones<br>
a ticket would then be issued.  Their thinking was why tke more fish out of the river.  If you make these people take them and they really don't want them they will just dispose of them one way or another.  There are a lot of grey areas and 'catch 22' like senarios.<br>
The officers indicated to us that the benefit of the doubt would always be given.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your right John that guy was a nimrod.  His response is not indicative of all guides. Wished I knew who he was.<br>
<br>
It's unfortunate we lost Bill Akerman as a commisioner. He was a heck of a jig fisherman and really cared for the rivers.  <br>
<br>
75 some minimum testing should be required.  As it stands now $25 bucks and your a guide.  Heck any dock on the river will rent any one a boat and set them loose.   <br>
