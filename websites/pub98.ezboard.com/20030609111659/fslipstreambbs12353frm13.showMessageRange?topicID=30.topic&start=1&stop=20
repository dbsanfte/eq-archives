Rating: R (It's gonna get real ugly)<br>
Disclaimer: If I owned Andromeda, well we won't go there, but I'd be rich and would not be on this board, I'd be in Tahiti, with my mini-Harper, catching some waves. But I don't own Andromeda, or any of their characters.  Man disclaimers are depressing.<br>
Summary: Strange things happen when the crew studies an unusual nebula.  Harper centric with a dren-load  of angst!<br>
Spoilers: For safety, let's just say up to season three.  And this ignores The Tunnel at the End of the Light and all of season 3(bad season 3)<br>
<br>
Survival Instincts<br>
<br>
Chapter 1<br>
<br>
The purple light from the gaseous glowing nebula radiated into the bridge of the starship Andromeda and was absorbed by the faces of the crew.    <br>
<br>
&quot;It's beautiful,&quot; the gold Trance remarked in awe.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's just a diffuse mass of interstellar dust and gas which is visible as luminous patches of darkness depending on the way the mass absorbs or reflects incident radiation.&quot; Rommie dryly stated.  &quot;Though it would be much more interesting if all of my sensors were on-line....Harper?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I&quot;m working on it Rom-doll, hold your horses&quot; the engineer answered over the coms.  He was deep inside the ship's VI matrix trying to fine tune some of the sensors to pick up as much data on the nebula as possible.<br>
<br>
A few days ago, Trace discovered the nebula on long range sensors.  It had very unusual energy readings.  Higher energy readings than had ever been seen before in any nebula.  So she managed to bug the crew until they gave in and headed off towards the rarity for some scientific study.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you feel the energy radiating off of it?&quot; asked Trace.  She was in a complete state of bliss - eyes closed, just taking it all in.<br>
<br>
&quot;I feel my cells being destroyed,&quot; complained Tyr.  &quot;Ship, are you sure the radiation isn't too high?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's well within safety parameters&quot; replied the annoyed hologram.<br>
<br>
Beka was standing at the pilot station watching the galactic dust and gas.  &quot;It's pretty Trance, but I've got a bad feeling about this place.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me too,&quot; chimed in the 300 year old captain who was standing next to Beka.  &quot;Let's just get the readings and get out of here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka gave a concerned smile, &quot;This is a switch.  We're getting the hunches and Trance isn't.  Now I REALLY don't like this place.&quot;<br>
<br>
After a few minutes of silent watching and waiting, Dylan finally spoke up, &quot;Harper, how close are you to getting those sensors working?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;About twenty more minutes boss.  What's the hurry, you're not enjoying being a space tourist?  Ya wanna go find someone to shoot at us?&quot; replied the disembodied voice of the engineer.<br>
<br>
Dylan rolled his eyes and let out a sigh. &quot;No Mr. Harper, we just have a bad fe......&quot;  The captain was interrupted when he looked back at the view screen.  The nebula was changing and expanding at great speed towards them.  &quot;ANDROMEDA REPORT!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All of my working sensors are overloaded.  I can't get any readings.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;BEKA! GET US THE HELL OUT OF HE.....&quot;  But Dylan's order was cut short by an energy blast that shot out of the expanding nebula.  The blast raced towards the ship, passing through the outer hull and hurtled towards the shocked crew.<br>
<br>
The wave first hit Beka and Dylan.  The energy pulsed through their fragile bodies as they screamed in agony and fell unconscious to the ground.  Before any of the others could react, the wave was upon them too.  Trance let out a blood curdling scream and then went limp to the floor.  Even the stoic Tyr screamed in pain before he collapsed to the hard metal grating.  Rommie was silent as the energy wave rushed through all of her robotic systems, frying each one until she joined the rest on the floor, unconscious and smoldering.<br>
<br>
Even the ship's AI was not left untouched.  As the destructive energy wave ripped through her main processing center, a huge surge of power pulsed through every bit of the ship's system.  Unfortunately, the last conscious crew member's mind was in the ships system when the pulse raged through.  Harper was slumped over in a conduit deep within Andromeda plugged into her matrix.  When the energy pulse hit the system he was working in, his motionless body jerked up.  A primal scream of pain ripped out of his throat as sparks flew from his data port.<br>
<br>
A few seconds later it was all over.  The nebula returned to it's previous size and the wave dissipated.  All throughout Andromeda, it was dark and motionless.  Only emergency power was on and command was illuminated by an eerie shade of purple from the nebula.  Lying on the cold floor was Trance, Beka, Tyr and Dylan, all with small trickles of blood flowing out of their ears.  Laying next to them was Rommie who was smoldering and unmoving.  And in the conduit, laid Harper with puss and blood pouring out of his data port.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 2<br>
<br>
The unnerving silence in command was finally broken with a groan originating from the large Nietzschean.  He quietly pushed himself up with much effort and then surveyed his surroundings.<br>
<br>
The bridge was still an eerie shade of purple from the now normal nebula.  What few internal light that were on, were flashing in such a way to raise one's blood pressure by simply being in their presence.   Luckily, besides for the lack of power, there was no other damage.  Looking around for his comrades he found them all slowly stirring back to life.  All save the annoying engineer and the android.  The first was missing, the second was just a mass of collapsed metal still smoldering on the ground, unmoving.   <br>
<br>
The captain was the second to rise.  Like the others, his ears had stopped bleeding but the dried blood lingered on his head and neck; a sign that not all was right.  Dylan bent down to help up his second in command, who stood up with a groan.  <br>
<br>
The strange gold alien had already picked her colorful body off the cold grated floor from the back command.  She was now making her way up front with Tyr to join her other crewmates.  <br>
<br>
The crew of the Andromeda Ascendant were unusually quiet.  They all were just staring at the nebula. All had a longing look in their eyes.  The same look you see in wary travelers once they finally spot their long sought after destination.   The usually quite Try was the first one to break the almost religious silence.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So that is what our home looks like.  Wow, it's beautiful.&quot;  More emotion filled his voice than had ever been heard before in public.  <br>
<br>
But the others were not surprised at his out of character behavior.  Instead, Beka walked up next to the Nietzschean and placed her hand on his shoulder.  &quot;Yes it is quite a sight, but we have more important things to do than stare at our home.&quot;   Beka then moved in front of the group, commanding their attention.  &quot;If you haven't guessed already, I'm Velac. Get used to me in this body from now on,&quot; she spoke with the grace of a leader.  &quot;I need to know where everyone ended up.  All report.&quot;<br>
<br>
The alien controlling Dylan's body made him step forward.  &quot;Fex here.&quot;  His usually calm and collected voice was filled with anger and defiance.  &quot;The vessel I'm in is under my complete control now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Next to step forward was Trance's body, but her body seemed to hesitate.  Her legs shook and fought as her alien invader forced it forward.  &quot;Nixic here,&quot; came out Trances voice, quite and subdued.  &quot;I'm having a bit of trouble controlling this one.  She has a quite strong and unusual mind.  What we learned from the simulations don't seem to be working on her.&quot;   The last part was said almost with a quiet panic.<br>
<br>
Beka's commanding voice replied, &quot;Well then try whatever you can.  I can't have one of you failing.  You know what will have to be done if you can't get control.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Trance's eyes filled with horror from both minds trapped within the body.  They both shared each other memories and knowledge. They both knew what Beka/Velac was referring too.  If any of the bodies could not be controlled, than that body, with it's new alien owner, must die.  The other's would not take any risk of the mission failing.  It was too important to them to let one weak link ruin it for all the rest.  &quot;Don't worry Velac.  That won't be a problem.&quot;  she quietly replied.  Trance's mind had let Nixic take over to save both of their lives.  Trance felt some goodness in Nixic and did not want either to be harmed.<br>
<br>
Tyr was the last one to step forward.  &quot;Stolic reporting.&quot;  His voice was full of false bravado.  &quot;This one's mind was strong, but I've got control now.  No one is a match for the great and powerful Stolic of the Tolken Nebula!&quot;  he shouted out the last part as he raised one of his newly acquired powerful arms in the air.<br>
<br>
Dylan/Fex rolled his eyes and mumbled under his breath, &quot;Tell me again how we got stuck with this child?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I&quot;m not a child!! I'm almost an adult!&quot; rebutted the childlike Tyr.<br>
<br>
Beka again stepped up to take control of the situation. &quot;Fex, we all know why the Ruler's nephew is here. It is because that is how he wanted it. We have no say in the matter, so DEAL WITH IT!!! And Fex, if you cause us any problems, don't think just because you are royalty the same rules don't apply to you. If you, by any means, endanger the mission, I will slit that nice new throat of your with my own nice new fingernails!  Understand?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sir&quot;  Fex answered as he forced Tyr's head down.<br>
<br>
Beka/Velac grunted with approval and started to look around the dimly lit command.  Her eyes stopped when they caught the still form of Rommie on the floor.  Velac ordered Beka's body to cross to the back of command and to knell down next to the still form of the android.  Beka/Velac then ran her hand across the surface of the motionless being.  It was smooth, cold, and hard.  Velac could sense no life force radiating from it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well?&quot; asked Tyr/Stolic impatiently.<br>
<br>
&quot;It seems to be an artificial life form of some sort.  It looks like the power from our transfer overloaded all of it's circuits.  It's out for good.&quot;  Beka/Velac replied with a cold matter of fact tone.  There was no hint of Beka Valentine in that tone, only the actually sound of the voice was hers.  <br>
<br>
Dylan's body was forced to move up next to Beka's.  &quot;If that's not the fifth life form we detected than where the hell is it and where is Melak?&quot;  spoke an agitated Dylan/Fex.<br>
<br>
Beka's head dropped with a sigh as her eyes rolled upward. &quot;I&quot;m surrounded by idiots,&quot; she mumbled.  &quot;Fex, moron, use the host's memory, that's what it's there for!&quot; she emphasized her point by smacking the back of Dylan's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ouch!&quot;  reacted both Dylan and Fex.<br>
<br>
Beka/Velac started pacing in front of the others while she searched Beka's memories to find what she needed to know.  &quot;The fifth life form was that of the engineer, Seamus Harper.  He was last on level 12, in conduit 23,&quot;  she paused as she formulated a plan.  &quot;Let's get the power back on-line, then deal with Harper and the AI.&quot; <br>
<br>
The others silently nodded in agreement.  Velac then commanded Beka's body over to one of the computer consoles.  Velac placed the first officer's hand on to the cool smooth surface of the console.  Energy rushed through her body and flowed out of her hand and into the computer.  A nano-second later, the lights in command flashed back on.  Computer stations roared to life and the engines could be heard to be powering back up.  Life flowed once again through Andromeda.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now we are enlightened,&quot; joked Tyr/Stolic through blinded eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Idiot&quot; mumbled Beka/Velac and Dylan/Fex in unison.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Can we please get back to work now?&quot; Dylan/Fex sarcastically asked as he gave Tyr's body an evil glance.<br>
<br>
Tyr looked down and gave a small nod.  <br>
<br>
Trance/Nixic quietly broke in with some information, &quot;Communications are back up, and the ship's AI is partially back up.  Luckily, it's control of the internal defenses and many other internal systems are off line.&quot;  Trances' fingers punched some more commands into the console she was standing at.  &quot;And it's not responding to my orders.  It might know that something is wrong and is not taking our commands, or it's sensors are off line and it can't register my orders.  Either way, we need to hurry to get it off line.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka/Velac took command and started to bark out orders, &quot;First, let's see if we can find out what's happened to the fifth one.  Fex, do your thing,&quot; <br>
<br>
Dylan's eyes went off of Beka's curvy frame and focused on thin air in front of him.  Fex was trying to conjure up Dylan's personality to use over the comms.  &quot;Harper report,&quot; he finally said.<br>
<br>
&quot;.......&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Harper, come in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;.......&quot;  Still nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure the comms are working?&quot; Dylan/Fex asked to no one in particular.<br>
<br>
Trance/Nixic looked at the display to double check the information, &quot;Yes, it's working.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dylan/Fex stood up straighter and held his head up high. &quot;Mr. Harper, you better answer now or I will come down and throw your skinny ass in the brig!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;........&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell was that!!!&quot; screamed the leader of the aliens in Beka's body.  &quot;That IS NOT how Dylan Hunt talks!  Idiots!&quot;  Beka's legs started to amble around command.  Her body was tense and filled with frustration.  &quot;Damn, something must have gone wrong.  Melak should be in control of Harper's body by now.&quot;  Beka stopped walking and faced the others. &quot;Nixic, come with me.  We must locate the engineer and find out what happened.  Fex and Stolic you get the AI off line before she gains controls of more systems.  Oh and don't kill each other.&quot; she added with a sigh.  She then headed off with Trance towards Harper's last and current location.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the dim, small conduit they were heading for was still quiet and motionless.  The blonde engineer laid on the hard metal grid.  The normally clean metallic disk on his neck was now coated with blood.  The skin around the port was already starting to blister and swell.  Fortunately, Harper felt nothing and saw only blackness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper.&quot;<br>
<br>
A sound had broken through into his dark, peaceful world.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper, come on, wake up.&quot;<br>
<br>
The voice was getting louder and pulling him away from his nice quiet void.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on Harper.  If you wake up now I'll let you interface with me.&quot;<br>
<br>
That offer finally force the horny little mudfoot out of the dark and back to the painful blinding light. &quot;What, uh?&quot; he managed to get out as he shot up from his previous prone position.  Which, as an afterthought, was a very bad idea.  His raw port felt like it was on fire, covered in acid, with millions of nano-sized magog feeding on it.  His head felt like each synapse were being sucked down a black hole while being shot at by Drago Kazov <br>
ships.  He now very much missed the darkness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper....focus.  It's me, Andromeda.&quot; instructed the painfully loud voice from nowhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooohhh, man.....what happened?&quot; he asked as he mistakenly reached for his data port.  The second he touched it, he regretted ever having lived.  Pain, ten times of that of before, shot through his neck, up to his brain, and out through his eyes. He groaned and curled up into a ball with his back against the conduit's cool wall.<br>
<br>
The familiar voice continued.  &quot;Harper, are you with me?&quot;  Even with being a machine, Andromeda still felt concern for her favorite engineer.  His port looked awful and his complexion was paler than normal, but they had bigger problems to deal with.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yah,&quot; he groaned out warily.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have a serious problem.&quot; she stated as sternly as possible.  She needed him to focus. She didn't have much time and he was their only hope.  We're all dead she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;I really don't like the sound of that.  Spit it out Andromeda,&quot;  Harper said as he adjusted himself into a more comfortable sitting position.<br>
<br>
&quot;There was a blast of energy .... or something from the nebula.  It went through the whole ship, even my main frame.  It caused a massive power serge through all of my systems. That is what kicked you out.  But I'm more concerned with the effect it had on the rest of the crew,&quot;  she paused to make sure Harper was still focusing and listening. &quot;I was off line for a while, I'm not sure how long, but as soon as I came back on-line, I knew something was wrong with everyone else.  They were all on command, all acting very unlike themselves.  The first thing I heard was Tyr making a very bad joke, a pun even.&quot;<br>
<br>
At that Harper's head shot up, his blood shot eyes filled with concern and worry. &quot;Tyr?...made a.....joke??  Ok, now I'm worried and scared.&quot;<br>
<br>
Andromeda continued to explain how bad the situation really was, &quot;I kept quiet and just kept watching them, I'm not sure if they know I know something is wrong.  My current theory is that somehow aliens from the nebula have taken over the other's bodies.  They are even calling each other by different names.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Great, invasion of the body snatchers, just what we needed ....... Andromeda?  Are you sure about this?  Are you sure some of your sanity systems are not malfunctioning?&quot;  asked Harper as he raised an eyebrow in question, which, he really shouldn't have done seeing that moving his eyebrows even hurt.<br>
<br>
Andromeda didn't have time for this, &quot;Yes Harper, I'm sure. Now please shut up and listen, we don't have much time.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Harper was taken aback by her forwardness, but shut his mouth and listened.<br>
<br>
&quot;The more urgent problem is that the aliens are trying to shut me down.  It feels like they are just going for the AI core, not ship operations.&quot; Andromeda finished.  She could feel parts of her being erased.  Fear was racing through her circuits. <br>
<br>
&quot;Shit,&quot; spat out Harper. &quot;Wait, what about Rommie? She shouldn't have been taken over like the others.&quot;  Hope filled his face.  He didn't want to face this alone.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's out cold.  The energy wave fried all of her circuits.  I'm not even sure if you could fix her,&quot; she answered with sorrow laced in her voice.<br>
<br>
Harper' head dropped.  Tears built up behind his eyes.  This was just not going to be a good day.  &quot;Andromeda,&quot; he paused, &quot;Do you have any more info?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just that everyone's energy readings are higher than normal.  The extra energy must be coming from the aliens in their bodies.  Harper, you have to find a way to.........&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence.<br>
<br>
Harper straighten up through the pain.  &quot;Andromeda?&quot;  fear filled his voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;..........&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;ANDROMEDA!!!&quot;  he screamed, hoping beyond hope for a response but only unnerving silence answered him back.<br>
<br>
Harper's blood shot eyes were now as wide as they could possible get.  What little color that was left in his face drained out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Andromeda?&quot; he whispered right before he buried his painful head in his shaking hands.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 3<br>
<br>
Harper stayed in his hunched over shaking position, just listening to the overwhelming silence.  There was no more Andromeda and no more friends.  All he could hear was the purr of power running through the ship.  He slowly picked his throbbing head out of his hands.  His brilliant brain was slowly starting to work past his over welling pain and fear to form a plan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, Seamus, pull yourself together. You can do this,&quot; he said to himself reassuringly.  But do what, he thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;I gotta get Andromeda back on-line,&quot; he whispered.  He reached out for the free end of his connector cable.  It was lying on the ground next to him where it landed when it got wrenched out of his port earlier.  The other end was still connected to the computer panel.  He examined the free end as he picked it up.  It was coated in a thick, sticky, dark red goo.  His blood. <br>
<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; he grumbled to himself.  He then took one hand to his brightly colored orange shirt and wiped the substance off the rod.  Next he reached up, with the rod in his shaky hand, and placed it at the opening of his bloody, swollen port.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is gonna hurt,&quot; he mumbled as he started to push the rod in.  As it entered the port, a scream escaped his lips.  His quivering hand tried to push the connector in father, but the pain just increased as the rod got deeper.  Finally, the rod could go no farther.  Through agonizing pain, Harper realized that he was not connecting to the matrix.  He tried to push the connector in farther, but it would not budge.  The harder he pressed it in, the more pain shot through every nerve in his body.  As his whole body shook, he realized it would not work and painfully pulled the connector out.  Deep red blood dripped off the emerging rod and flowed out of the metal port.<br>
<br>
&quot;Crap,&quot; hissed Harper through clenched teeth.  The tissue in his port was so swollen that the connectors on the rod and in his neck could not touch each other and therefore could not transmit information.  Because of this there was no way he could jack in to re-boot the AI.  Even the VI goggles could not give him the freedom in the system to do what he needed to do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aggghhhh,&quot; he grunted as realized this.  He once again threw his pounding head into his hands.  Trying to re-boot Andromeda manually could take days, and that was if the aliens simply took her off-line.  It could take weeks if they did worse.  Hell, he might not even be able to bring her back at all.<br>
<br>
&quot;Think, genus, think,&quot; he commanded as he rocked back and forth in his confining conduit.  His plotting was interrupted when the ship jolted under him and he fell onto his side onto the grated floor.  Slipstream.  Someone just entered Slipstream and was piloting his Andromeda.<br>
<br>
&quot;THAT'S IT!&quot; he yelled as he jumped up, hitting his already sore head on the low hard ceiling.  &quot;Ouch,&quot; he mumbled as he collapsed back onto the familiar floor, rubbing his spiky and now bruised head. <br>
<br>
After a second of self pity for his new boo-boo, he picked himself back up and started crawling down the conduit.  His destination was the Slipstream core.  &quot;If I can't get Andromeda back, then at least I can stop them in their tracks.&quot;  He giggled at his clever rhyme.  &quot;I think that bonk to my head is effecting me......maybe I should just go and have some tea.&quot;<br>
<br>
Giggles could be heard reverberating throughout the conduits.<br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
All that could be heard in one of the many corridors on Andromeda was two pairs of boots, hitting the grated floor at a very fast pace.  Suddenly, a voiced boomed over the comms, breaking the semi-silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Velac, we are underway to the rendezvous point,&quot; boomed Dylan's voice.  &quot;We should reach it in about 2 days.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good,&quot; replied one of the two women who were hastily making their way down the empty corridor.  Beka and Trance's minds could hear, see, and feel everything that was happening.  The only thing they couldn't do was control anything.  They knew what the aliens were commanding their bodies to go do.  They were heading off to find Harper, their friend, part of their small family.  Both women wanted to yell out, to fight.  But the more their minds fought the intruder, the more pain the aliens inflected on them.  They were completely helpless.<br>
<br>
Dylan's harsh voice spoke again, &quot;How's the hunt for the mudfood going?&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka's new commanding harsh voice answered, &quot;We're almost where the computer says his life signs are originating from.  We'll know really soon what happened.&quot;  The two Maru crew members continued on their fast pace down the corridor towards their prey.  Suddenly, they both stopped dead in their tracks.  They could feel Harper's energy pattern.  He was near.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn,&quot; hissed Beka/Velac. &quot;Do you feel him?'<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes and Melak isn't with him.  I cant sense Melak anywhere,&quot; whispered back Trance/Nixic.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something must have gone wrong, Melak was strong, he should have easily taken over that weak one's mind,&quot; hissed Beka's cold voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want to do?&quot; questioned Trance/Nixic.<br>
<br>
&quot;Beka seems to think he's a genius of some sort.  Maybe our allies would like him as a nice gift when we finally meet up with them,&quot; Velac forced Beka's voice to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trance holds him in high regards too.  Plus, apparently he came from a slave planet.   That should make him easy to brake,&quot; Trance/Nixic said.  The real Trance was screaming as her body was forced to say such a thing.  Apparently, Nixic wasn't as nice as Trance hoped.  As she once again fought her invader, pain from Nixic ripped through her mind.  <br>
<br>
Back in the corridor, Trance's body doubled over.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; coarsely questioned Beka/Velac.<br>
<br>
&quot;I-It's Trance's mind.  S-She's fighting me again,&quot; Nixic struggled to get the sentences out of Trance's mouth.  Suddenly, both Trance and Nixic heard Beka's body move and heard the sound of her gun charging.  They also felt a cold smooth blunt point be placed on Trance's temple.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Get her under control, or I will fire.  I know she's hard to kill, but I think a shot through the head might do some nice damage,&quot; Beka/Velac quietly and calmly said.<br>
<br>
Trance fought harder, hoping to overcome Nixic and fake still being invalided.  Unfortunately, Nixic was not so weak.  She, he, it forced more pain into Trance's mind.  The harder Trance fought, the more intense the pain got.  She finally had to give control back to Nixic, both in exhaustion and in order to save her body.  She gave up her fight and returned to the darkness of her own mind.<br>
<br>
Trance's body stopped shaking and snapped back up to a standing position.  &quot;Sorry about that Velac  It won't happen again,&quot; Nixic forced Trance to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;It better not,&quot; hissed Beka/Velac.  &quot;If it does......,&quot;  she was cut off by the sound of running feet coming down the corridor perpendicular to them.  &quot;Just follow my lead,&quot; she whispered into Trance's golden pointy ear.<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
The blonde engineer was now racing towards the Slipstream core through the larger corridors.  He had to leave the safety of the conduits to make it to his destination.  He was sprinting around a corner when he slammed into two soft bodies.  All three tumbled backwards, letting out a collective groan as they hit the hard floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper!  Watch where your going!&quot; shouted out Beka's tone of voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you going in such a hurry anyways?&quot; asked Trance/Nixic as innocently as possible.<br>
<br>
Harper rubbed his now sore back and cocked his head.  Tons of thoughts were running through his mind.  What was going on here?  They were acting perfectly normal.  A trap maybe?  Or maybe this was all a prank from Andromeda to get him back for making her sensors believe there were 3,000 Dylans onboard last week.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper?&quot; questioned Beka/Velac with a hint of concern coming into her voice.  She started to dust herself off and get back up.<br>
<br>
Harper was still silent as he pulled his aching body off the floor.  No no.  Andromeda wouldn't burn his port for a prank.  The aliens must just be playing with him, hoping he was dumb and wouldn't see through their little rouse.  But he wasn't called a genius for nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?  Oh, sorry girls.  Just going for a jog, you know, trying to bulk up.  Trying to give Tyr and Dylan a run for their money on the &quot;Hunky Men of Andromeda&quot; title.  Well, it was nice running into you both, literally, but I gotta go back to working out now.&quot;  He flexed his sleeve covered arm and felt his bicep.  &quot;I've got a lot of catching up to do, bye!&quot; With that he turned to flee, but didn't get too far as he felt Trance's strong hand grab his arm.  Beka came around in front of him and invaded his personal space.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, come on Seamus, you already won the hunk award in our eyes.  Do you want to claim your prize?&quot; Beka voice said seductively.<br>
<br>
&quot;W-What prize,&quot; shuddered out the horny Harper.<br>
<br>
Trance/Nixic then moved closer to his body and wrapped one of her legs around one of his shaking legs.  She then started to lightly blow on the non-injured side of his neck.  &quot;The prize is that you get to live out your fantasy.  Beka on bottom, me on top and you,&quot; she paused as she slowly licked the back of his neck. &quot;and you in the middle.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harper shuddered and his heart rate went through the roof.  His Super-Ego was desperately trying to beat down his raging Id with a nice phallic shaped club.  No, no, no.  Bad evil aliens, must resist, he thought.  He regretfully pushed the lustful girls away from him.  His Id slumped down and started crying.<br>
<br>
&quot;I-I-I'm sorry ladies, but the Harper body is off limits.  You know, training and all, gotta keep the mind clear.&quot;  He slowly started to back away from the curvy, seductive, attractive women.  As he quicken his backward retreat, both females kept pace with him.<br>
<br>
&quot;OH! HI DYLAN!!&quot; Harper yelled out as he pointed over the girls' shoulders. Both of the aliens turned their attention away from Harper to look for the larger man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Suckers,&quot; whispered Harper as he turned and fled down the corridor.  By the time Trance and Beka turned back to face Harper, all they saw was an empty corridor.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Damn,&quot; they both cursed under their breaths.  But deep, deep inside Beka and Trance's mind, Harper's true friends were cheering.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 4<br>
<br>
The long empty corridor stared back at the two women with spiteful glee.  Trance/Nixic was the first to break the silence.  &quot;What now Velac?&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka's eyes gleamed with the hope of vengeance.  &quot;We get him and we have some fun with him.  Then we hand him over to our allies so they can have some fun with him.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Where do you think he was heading too?&quot;  asked the imposter within Trance.<br>
<br>
Both ladies paused while they searched their host's memory and knowledge.  They then exchanged knowing glances and chimed out in unison.<br>
<br>
&quot;Slipstream core.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka voice could then be heard alone, still full of confidence and intensity.  &quot;You head off to the core and wait for him.  I'll head back up to command and take over piloting.  I think with Beka's skills we might shorten our trip.  I'll send Fex and Stolic down to the core to help you, um, contain our problem child.&quot;  She said with a evil wink and an even eviler smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok,&quot; replied Trance/Nixic as she started to head off towards the Slipstream core.  She only got a few steps before she heard Beka's voice adding some last minute instructions.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just remember, we need him alive, so don't have too much fun.&quot;  She paused.  &quot;And if you guys could, please leave me a little bit to play with too. Okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
A classic bad guy laugh escaped Trance's throat.  &quot;Whatever you say Velac.&quot;  The golden alien then sprinted down the corridor while the Maru's captain could be heard sprinting in the opposite direction.  Both had a chilling grin plastered on their faces'.<br>
<br>
*********<br>
<br>
Harper was still slowly making his way towards the Slipstream core.  The going was slow partly because he was taking the safe long backwards route to the core.  He was trying to avoid any more run-in's with the &quot;new&quot; freaky crew.  But the main reason the going was slow was because of the pain that raced through his tortured body.  His back hurt from his collision with the girls, his head hurt from hitting it on the ceiling of the conduit, but mostly, his port was the problem.  The small sliver disk was coated in deep rich blood that ran down his neck and onto his bright orange shirt causing it turn a lovely shade of puke reddish orange. With each new heartbeat came a new wave of nausea and dizziness.  The skin around the disk was swollen and burning.  Just turning his neck caused new levels of pain to course through his body.  And due to his wonderful immune system, his port was already becoming infected and was started to cause a rise in his body temperature.  &quot;I love my life,&quot; he muttered out.<br>
<br>
Harper continued to push onwards towards his destination.  He had to get the core to shut down the engines.  He still didn't know what he would do after that, but he knew that was Step One.  Step Twos are highly overrated anyways he thought.<br>
<br>
As he neared the core, he felt some stress and worry lift off of his shoulders.  He had made it there safely with no more encounters with the body snatchers.  He knew for a fact that he would not be able to withstand another run-in with Mistresses Beka and Trance.<br>
<br>
Harper walked up to the door control panel and punched in the sequence to open them. The heavy metal door slid open with just a whoosh.  Harper made his way into his second home.  He always felt safe here.  The roar of the engine and the soft vibrations that could be felt through the grated floor made him feel like he was in some sort of womb.  Safe and protected from the wicked, cruel outside world.  He made his way over to the main engine controls and was about to initiate Step One of his one step plan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatcha doing Harper?&quot; A voice bellowed out over the hum of the engines.<br>
<br>
The tired engineer jumped as his heart began to imitate that of a humming bird's heart.  His spiky hair even managed to stand up straighter on end.  He knew who the voice belonged to and this knowledge scared him even more.  If it was Dylan, Beka, or even Tyr, he would at least have had a slight idea of what they were capable of, both mentally and physically.  But this voice belonged to the new scarier gold Trance.  Under normal circumstances, he still didn't trust her, but under these circumstances, he was scared shitless of her.<br>
<br>
He spun around to face his fear.  She stepped out from the shadows of the machines she was hiding behind.  She looked different.....scary different.......bad different.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trance!  Nice to see you here,&quot; Harper managed to get out past the lump in his throat.  He had no idea how to play this.<br>
<br>
Trance walked towards him while keeping her eyes glued on his trembling form. &quot;Nice to see you too Harper.&quot;  The way she said his name sent shivers up his painful spine.  &quot;I'm quite hurt you didn't want to play with Beka and I.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harper was slowly backing up towards the safety of the closed doors.  &quot;Look,  I know you're not Trance so you can stop playing this game,&quot; he said sounding as confident and as authoritative as possible.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I like this game,&quot; Trance's voice responded. &quot;It's fun.&quot;  Trance was matching Harper's retreat step by step.<br>
<br>
Harper had made his way to the doors. With his hand behind his back, he felt the wonderful cool smooth surface of the door controls.  He silently keyed in the code while keeping an eye on the imposter. &quot;Well, sorry to ruin your fun, but I gotta be going now, bye!&quot; Harper spat out as he turned to run out the newly open doors.  But again, he didn't get far as he ran smack into the hard chests of Tyr and Dylan.  &quot;Crap,&quot; he muttered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just where do you think your going little man?&quot; questioned Stolic as he impersonated Tyr while staring down at the petrified engineer.  <br>
<br>
Before Harper could even compose himself to answer, Tyr and Dylan's powerful arms were pushing him back into the Slipstream core room.  They kept advancing until Harper backed up into Trance's solid form.  Harper was then in a situation he never thought possible. He was surrounded by his friend, but dread was racing through his mind and body.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh-heh, guys, come on, work with me here.  How 'bout we just take you back home? Huh?  How does that sound?  You don't want theses bodies. They're crappy bodies.  I mean it.  Look at Dylan, he's old.  I think I even saw some gray hairs the other week, and look at those bags under his eyes, you don't....um....want......that......?&quot;  He slowed down as his three friends closed in on him.  Their eyes were filled with such rage and disgust that it was a wonder the stares alone didn't kill Harper.  &quot;No, huh?&quot;  he whispered before the new round of anguish began.<br>
<br>
At first, Harper did try to fight back, but he had to do so without harming his friends' bodies.   When at first Trance grasped his upper arms, he used her as support as he jumped up, pushing Dylan and Tyr away with his feet.  As he did this, he felt Trance's hands tightening on his arms.  Her grip continued to tighten until he could feel his left humerus begin to crumble under her amazingly powerful grasp.  He let out a heart wrenching scream of pain as the bone was torn apart under the pressure.  At that point it was all over.  Tyr and Dylan started to pummel Harper's chest and stomach until they were almost sure all of his ribs were broken.  Then they moved onto his face, giving him two black eyes, a bloody nose and a very nice slit lip.  As an added bonus, they threw in some random bruises to help fill-in his battered face.  Once they got bored with his face, they moved back to his mid-section to re-hash the previous damage.  <br>
<br>
With each new punch came a new gasp of pain or plead for help from his friends.  Harper knew they were in their bodies somewhere and he needed their help.  In fact, his friends were right there with him, fighting their own battles inside themselves. <br>
<br>
The real Dylan was close to tears (that is if he had control over his tear ducts).  All he wanted was to stop hitting his poor engineer, to stop hurting him, but he couldn't do a thing.  Hell, he couldn't' even stop watching.  Even closing his eyes would be bliss right now.  But no, he had to see each blow HIS fists laid into Harper's bloodied face.  He had to see each grimace of pain that followed every time one of HIS punches landed on one of Harper's battered and broken ribs.  And he had to hear every cry of agony and every plead that left Harper's bleeding lips, as he, Dylan Hunt, commander and friend, beat him into unconsciousness.<br>
<br>
The same battle was raging within the Nietzschean's mind.  As much as he hated to admit it,  he did care for the little mudfoot.  With every kick that he felt his foot landing and with every rib that he felt breaking under his own clasped hand, a primal scream would escape Tyr's non-corporeal lips.  What made it worse was that Tyr could feel the joy that was coming from his host, as could the others.  They were linked.  Stolic could feel Tyr's pain, but could block it out.  Tyr, unfortunately, could not do the same.  He felt joy as he broke Harper's nose and he felt all warm and tingling as he saw the boy loosing consciousness.  Tyr wished for a second that he could join his friend in the blissful world of nothingness.<br>
<br>
All the while, the real Trance was simply crying.  She cried when she felt Harper's humerus crumble under her grip and she cried when Harper finally collapsed into her arms.  She even cried as Tyr came over and picked the bloody, limp, unconscious form of her friend off the newly stained red floor.  She cried the whole time, but not once did a single tear escape her eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 5<br>
<br>
Andromeda shook as Beka's hands expertly piloted her out of the slipstream and toward the rendezvous point.  Due to Beka's expert piloting, they arrived there earlier than planed.  They now had time to kill.<br>
<br>
Beka/Velac pushed up the slipstream piloting console and started to look around command.  It was quiet.  The void of space filtered through the view screen and filled the room.  Beka's lungs let out a sigh of air.  &quot;Where are those guys.  I hope they're not killing the toy,&quot; she mumbled to herself.<br>
<br>
Then, as if on cue, the command doors hissed open and the silence was broken. In strolled the bodies of Trance, Dylan and Tyr.  The large Nietzschean had in his arms the body of the bloody, beaten engineer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Took you guys long enough,&quot; complained Beka/Velac as she marched up to the group.<br>
<br>
&quot;Man that was fun,&quot; exclaimed Dylan/Fex with a huge sneer on his face which seemed oddly out of place.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where do you what him?&quot; asked the burden-laden Tyr/Nixic.<br>
<br>
Seeing that there were no chairs on command, Beka's finger pointed to one of the corners away from any of the computer consoles.  &quot;Just throw him there.&quot;<br>
<br>
The large Nietzschean ambled over to the appointed corner and heaved the body on the ground.  The engineer landed with a thud but disturbingly there was no groan or movement to accompany the thud.<br>
<br>
Beka's eyes grew concerned as she finally saw the state of her prisoner.  &quot;Shit guys.  I said NOT to have too much fun with him!  Is he even alive?&quot;  screamed the voice of a leader.  Velac didn't have to lead Beka's body over to the heap of flesh and bones lying in the corner.  Beka's mind was already begging to go over to check on her adopted little brother.  All Velac had to do was to order her legs not to break in to a sprint.  As she neared him, her non-corporal stomach started to churn. If she had control of her digestive system she would have been heaving onto the shinny command floor right now.  The closer she got, the more damage she saw on his fragile body.  She finally reached him and knelt down next to the broken body.<br>
<br>
Beka mentally threw up when she saw the full extent of the beating.  His young face was now varying shades of blues and violets with lovely splatters of red.  His blond mess of hair was now partially dyed red from his own life giving bodily fluids.  But his left arm was the most grotesque wound.  The upper arm was now in a figure eight.  His bicep was crushed to half it's normal size.  Beka was on her fifth round of mental heaves at this point.  Thankfully, some might say, she did see Harper's chest rising and falling, but each breath seemed like is was the result of great effort.  Both Beka and Velac were happy to see that rise of his chest, but Velac was happy because it meant she could have her fun with their little toy.<br>
<br>
The alien leader was about to turn away from the lump on the ground when something caught her interest.  It was Harper's bloody, inflamed data port.  She turned Beka's body to face the others. &quot;Did you guys do this?&quot;  she asked pointing to the port.<br>
<br>
All three aliens commanded their bodies to walk over to the corner and to look at the wound in question.  Dylan/Fex was the first one to speak up.  &quot;No Velac, that was already there when we got to him.  I wish it was our work.  It looks like it was very painful.&quot;  A cold grin grew on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mmmm...&quot; pondered Beka/Velac. &quot;I wonder if that is why Melak wasn't able to take over this one's body.  If he was plugged into the AI when we merged then his mind and body would not have be able to be hijacked.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then where is Melak?&quot; asked Trance/Nixic as she looked over the port with interest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who the hell knows and who the hell cares!&quot; spat out Tyr's booming voice.  Stolic was getting bored just standing around playing detective.  &quot;I wanna have more fun with our toy.  Why did he have to be so....mortal?&quot; uncharacteristically whined Tyr's voice.<br>
<br>
Beka/Velac looked up at the child-like Nietzschean.  &quot;Oh young naive Stolic.  That is what nano-bots are for.  Nixic, run down to Medical and grab some supplies.  I'll show you amateurs how to have some real fun.&quot;<br>
<br>
*******<br>
<br>
Harpers world consisted of two things right now, pain and darkness.  The darkness was slowly starting to leave him, but his pain was intensifying.  He felt his ribs crack with every breath he struggled to take.  He felt the warm blood trickling out of his nose and out of the other cuts on his face.  He tasted the metallic fluid that was invading his mouth.  He felt pain everywhere, from his throbbing arm to his little toe.<br>
<br>
As his thoughts were returning to him, he remembered what happened...actually who happened.  He still could see Tyr's grinning face as Tyr's large fist made contact with his face.  He could still hear Dylan's laugh after they broke another one of his ribs. And he could still feel Trance's warm breath on the back of his neck as she restrained him for the duration of the beating.  As he felt the pain surge though his broken body, he remembered that his friends, his family, had done this to him.  The few people he had actually let into his world and had trusted.  Deep down Harper knew that the aliens were controlling his friends, but their betrayal still hurt more than the physical pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper...wakey wakey,&quot; a familiar female's voice filled his ears.  Hope rose in Harper's heart.  He loved that voice.  Whenever he was coming back to the world of the living he wanted to hear that voice.  That was Beka's voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on toy.  Wake up.  Mommy wants to play,&quot; the voice teased.<br>
<br>
Dread replaced the hope in his heart.  This does not sound good.  Maybe I should just play dead, he thought.  His thoughts were then interrupted by a blow to his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on! Wake up you miserable mudfoot!&quot; The voice then paused.  Beka's voice started up again but this time it sounded distant, like she had turned her head.  &quot;Nixic, inject him with some more nano-bots.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harper felt the cold point of the syringe press against the uninjured side of his neck.  It's always a bad sign when the bad guys heal you, thought Harper.  He learned this through his years on Earth and his many encounters with the Nietzscheans there.<br>
<br>
Play dead, play dead, he repeated to himself.  That plan was ruined when excruciating pain shot through his body originating from pressure placed on his wounded arm.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Agghhh!!!&quot; A scream escaped his dry throat as his aching body leapt to a sitting position.  His world spun as his eyes adjusted to the new light and movement.  Slowly a familiar face came into view.  He could make out the blond hair and the strong cheeks.  Beka.  Usually he wanted to see this face, but today it was the last face in the world he wanted to wake up to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks for joining us Harper,&quot; said Beka's voice.  The words were dripping with sarcasm.<br>
<br>
&quot;He-he, no prob...um...you wouldn't be interested in letting us all go, would you?&quot; Harper struggled to get the sentence out of his dry, sore throat.  <br>
<br>
Beka came closer to his face.  Harper felt trapped.  On both sides of him were walls and in front of him was a very ruthless looking Beka who was backed up by three equally ruthless looking friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, sorry.  We like these bodies, this ship and....you,&quot; she whispered as she caressed his cheek.  &quot;But you see, there's a problem.  They,&quot; she pointed to the others behind her, &quot;got to have their fun, but 'cause I was flying this ship I missed out.  And I'm in some serious need of some fun.&quot;  She ended by running her hand through Harper's bloody hair.<br>
<br>
Harper's response was a hard swallow hoping to push down the rising sense of dread.  He'd try to run if only he thought he could get up without passing out.  This did not seem like a possibility seeing that his world was still a spinning and blurry mess.<br>
<br>
Beka's voice continued as she stroked his bruised cheek, &quot;Now, now, don't worry.  I'm much gentler.  I won't hurt you like these barbarians did.&quot;<br>
<br>
A growl could be heard originating from Dylan's throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;No offence,&quot; added Beka/Velac as she looked over her shoulder at the others.  She turned back to face Harper.  Beka's face was touching Harper's as she caressed up against him.  &quot;I'm more into enlightenment.  I think you really need to know what Beka thinks of you.&quot;  Beka's hand reached forward to wipe away some of the blood on Harper's forehead.  She continued, &quot;Not what she tells you or what she leads you to believe, but what she really thinks of you.  You see, I know all that she knows and feels.  I know just what she thinks of her little pet mudfoot.  But I really think it's best that you hear it from her mouth and her mind.  Let me get her for you.&quot;  Beka/Velac stopped talking.  She took her hand way from Harper's trembling face as her eyes rolled back into her head.  <br>
<br>
Inside of Beka's mind, Velac was calling for Beka.  But Beka knew all.  She knew what Velac was planning, she knew how it would devastate Harper and she knew that she had to fight Velac for Harper's sake and the sake of their friendship. <br>
<br>
Velac was finally able to grab onto Beka's metal self and tried to control her through pain.  Beka's mind felt like it was on fire.  For Harper, she thought as she withstood the agony.  The more she fought it, the more intense the burning sensation got until it was unbearable.  And since she was locked in her own mind, she couldn't pass out.  Wave after wave of pain flooded through her mind.  She just couldn't fight it anymore.  As she started to let Velac call up her consciousness, the pain diminished and light filled her previous dark existence.  She found that her voice worked again.<br>
<br>
&quot;H-H-Harper,&quot; Beka sputtered to get out.<br>
<br>
Even thought the voice was the same, the tone and energy Beka's body now emitted made it clear that the real Beka was speaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;B-Beka?&quot; croaked Harper with a hint of hope and relief in his voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is me Harper.  Listen, don't believe......AAGGHHHH!!' screamed Beka in pain as she arched backwards.  She was trying to warn him, but Velac was in control of what Beka said here and helping Harper was not in the script.  Again, after waves of pain, Beka finally gave into Velac.<br>
<br>
Beka straightened up and looked into Harper's sparkling blue eyes.  The same eyes that filled her life with laughter and joy.  The same eyes that she was about to fill with tears.  Hesitantly, she began to speak.<br>
<br>
&quot;Seamus Zealanzy Harper, my little pet mudfoot.  My cheap labor....my slave.&quot;  Beka paused.  She couldn't do it.  She could already see the hurt in Harper's eyes.  But Velac sent more agony through Beka's mind and she continued out of weakness. &quot;Do you know how many times I've been tempted to throw you out of the Maru's airlock?  How many times I wanted to smack that constant gibbering mouth of yours off your pathetic face?  Everyday since I brought you onboard!  Which I only did due to a misplaced sense of pity.&quot;  Beka swallowed hard.  She could hear Harper's heart breaking.  His eyes were slowly starting to make their way to the floor.  Beka did as Velac commanded.  She grabbed his chin and yanked his face upward.  &quot;LOOK AT ME BOY!!&quot; she screamed.  She tighten her clasp on his chin until he jerked away in pain, but his dejected eyes remained locked onto hers.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know why I kept you around?  Do you!?  So I could feel superior over someone.  So I could feel empowered every time I had to rescue your pathetic runt ass out of trouble.  You are the best ego trip in the known universe Seamus.  Hell, an ameba looks more competent compared to you.&quot;  Harper's eyes dropped again. This time his face was meet with a hard slap across his already stinging cheeks.  &quot;LOOK AT ME BOY!!  See you can't even follow a simple instruction.  How pathetic!  When I look at you all I see is a ego whore.  A skinny, weak, incompetent, runt of a ego whore!&quot;  Beka screamed as she quickly pushed herself off of the floor.  She started to kick at Harper's dejected form.  &quot;A SKINNY&quot; ...kick... &quot;WEAK&quot; ...kick... &quot;INCOMPETENT&quot;... kick... &quot;RUNT&quot;... kick... &quot;OF A EGO WHORE!!!&quot;... big strong kick .  <br>
<br>
Harper was curled up into a fetal position, writhing from the pains of both the kicks and of the words.  Tears were welling up behind his eyes but he refused to let them fall.  Beka had hit on all of his fears.  He hoped it was just the alien talking, but he wasn't sure.  Maybe Beka really did feel that way.  Maybe the alien just embellished a little.  Maybe he was just a useless ego whore.  The tears continued to build up.<br>
<br>
Beka stared down at the curled up form.  Her heart was breaking too.  She should have been stronger, should have fought more.  But she didn't and she failed Harper.  She failed their friendship.  She failed.  <br>
<br>
Velac started to push Beka's mind back into her deep consciousness.  Beka didn't fight this time.  She went back willingly.  She didn't deserve anything.  Not a body, not a mind and not a friend like Harper.  She welcomed the darkness of her own mind.<br>
<br>
Velac turned Beka to face her comrades.  Their faces were quite a site.  Jaws on the floor, eyes wide open.  Silence.  <br>
<br>
Dylan's hands broke that silence with a round of applause.  &quot;Wow, that was....amazing.&quot; <br>
<br>
Beka/Velac took a little bow as the tears in Harper's eyes finally broke through and ran down his face.  Tears were now mixing with blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, thank you&quot; joked Beka/Velac.  The tone and energy of the body showed no sign of the real Beka.  She was deep inside crying non-existent tears.  &quot;See young ones, THAT  is how you have fun.  It's all in.....&quot;<br>
&quot;BEEP...BEEP&quot; Andromeda's computers interrupted Velac's speech.<br>
<br>
&quot;Report Stolic,&quot; demanded Beka/Velac as she regained her professional composure.<br>
<br>
Tyr/Stolic was the closest to the beeping console.  He punched in a few commands and looked back up.  His strong angled face was filled with a smug smile.  &quot;They're here,&quot; he chimed.<br>
<br>
All eyes went to the view screen as Tyr/Stolic punched up the image.<br>
<br>
Harper's wet eyes managed to get a glimpse of the screen.  What he saw filled his insides with more dread.  He was actually quite surprised he could fit more dread in himself.<br>
<br>
The view screen was filled with the image of three ships.  The ships the aliens were meeting up with.  Each ship was twice the size of Andromeda with what looked like ten times the amount of fire power.  And heading towards Andromeda was a rather large transport pod.  <br>
<br>
Beka broke the awe-inspired silence. &quot;Grab him and lets go meet our allies.  We don't want to keep them waiting.&quot;  She marched off towards the command doors.  Tyr and Dylan approached Harper's corner from hell.  They each grabbed an arm and yanked him upright.  Tyr/Stolic was lucky enough to get Harper's bad arm and was having fun playing with it.  &quot;Gee, does this hurt&quot;  Tyr/Stolic teased as he squeezed the malformed arm repeatedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aggghh...no,&quot; grunted Harper.  But he wasn't completely lying.  The nano-bots were working.  He was feeling a bit better.  He only felt like he was worked over by 20 Nietzscheans instead of 40.  My day is finally getting better, he thought as the bodies of Dylan and Tyr dragged him off to meet his new owners.<br>

I love feedback!  Here's chapter 6. <br>
<br>
Chapter 6<br>
<br>
By the time the group had reached the hanger bay that held the transport pod, Tyr/Stolic had gotten rather bored of playing with Harper's mangled arm.  The engineer was quite happy that Stolic seemed to lack Tyr's eternal patience.  Even with his blood saturated with nano-bots, his arm was still useless and painful.  On the bright side, breathing was easier and he could now be dragged with out getting dizzy.<br>
<br>
The heart in Harper's chest started to pounding faster as the doors to the hanger bay hissed open.  Inch by inch he caught his first glimpse of the allies he had only heard about.  The transport pod they came in was huge.  There was only a few feet of free space around every inch on the sleek, black ship.  The pilot must have been an expert to have gotten it in the bay without hitting the walls or ceiling.<br>
<br>
Filtering out of the enormous ship were the allies.  Harper was too far away from them to tell what species they were.  All he knew is that they were humanoid and there were a lot of them.  The strong hands griping Harper's arms dragged and pushed him into the hanger bay and towards his new owners.<br>
<br>
A group of ten of the allies were marching towards the invaded crew of the Andromeda.  As the groups descended on one another, Harper's racing heart stopped dead in his trembling chest.  All color drew from his already pale face.  He saw what species the allies were and he was not happy.<br>
<br>
Nietzscheans.<br>
<br>
Beka's form stepped forward into the gap that separated the two groups.  She said nothing as she stared down the group of imposing Nietzscheans.  <br>
<br>
From the collection of all rather large Nietzscheans, the largest male stepped forward meeting Beka in no-man's-land.  He was about the size of Tyr with almost more muscles, if that was possible.  His complexion was that of someone who spend their whole life in space away from any sun-light.  His short cropped hair was platinum blonde, giving his whole body a unified look.  The only features that stood out were his striking blue-green eyes.  They were the shade of cold ice water and like ice water, they sent shivers down Harper's spine.<br>
<br>
Those callused eyes slowly scanned at Beka's body from head to toe.  &quot;Velac, I assume,&quot; the harsh, hallow voice echoed through the hanger bay.  &quot;Galaver Merilis, out of Athenia by Mercurous, of the Pytho pride.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harper's stopped heart fell out of his chest and splattered on the featureless hanger bay floors. The Pytho pride.  His mind swirled with memories that had long been tucked way into the recesses of his mind.  Memories of one year of his life when the Pytho pride had Earth as their play thing.......<br>
<br>
****FLASH-BACK****<br>
<br>
Earth.  Smog filled, dirty, depressing, hell-hole Earth.  The home of the human species, once free, now under Drago-Kazov control.  Except for one year.  One year when a more fearsome nomadic pride of Nietzscheans decided they wanted Earth for a little while.  That pride was the Pytho pride.  And that year was Seamus Zealanzy Harper's 16th year of painful existence.<br>
<br>
Dirty, tattered boots sank into the inch thick layer of debris that coated all surfaces in Boston.  The boot were moving quickly through the sludge as nightfall was getting closer by the second.  This year, nightfall meant that the Pythos came out to play.<br>
<br>
The young Harper normally had no intention of every being this far away from the safety of his home during this time of day.  Normally he was already tucked away into the safety of his own little drainage pipe, cuddled up amongst the slime and dirt, trying to stay warm.  But today, tonight, he was not there, he was not safe.  Instead he was sprinting wildly through the growingly dark alleys, gasping for air as he pumped his thin weak legs as fast as they could go.  He was in this situation because of family.  <br>
<br>
Susie, his youngest cousin was killed yesterday by the Pythos after they raped her and beat her to a bloody pulp.  Now the last remaining cousins, he and Brendan, had to go bury their sweet innocent Susie.  There was one place in Boston to bury family and friends.  That was in the park.  The trees were long gone and the playground equipment was long since pulverized, but the dirt and ground were still there.  Also there were bodies buried on top of bodies, on top of bodies.  That is why Harper and Brendan were out at this late hour, digging and burying.  Harper could still see dirt slowly covering up Susie's gentle eyes as she stared up from her final resting place.  <br>
<br>
By the time the boys had finished, it was later than they thought and wanted.  Brendan raced off in the opposite direction, hoping to get home to his ailing mother in time.  While Harper raced off hoping to reach is empty, lonely pipe.  His parents were killed four years ago and since then he was on his own.  Brendan had helped him out a bit, but Harper hated being a hindrance to the older cousin.  So most of the time Harper hanged out with one of the many groups of roaming orphaned teens.  That or he kept to himself, tinkering away in his pipe while dreaming of the stars.<br>
<br>
The hazy sun-light sky was getting darker and darker as the mother star dipped below the horizon.  Harper commanded his aching, numb legs to move faster.  He was only a block away from the entrance to the sewer system and to safety.  The young man hurdled over unwanted corpses and debris, desperately trying to reach his home.  Finally, when he thought his legs were about to give out under him, he saw the entrance.  Yes! Take that you ubers, thought a joyous Harper.<br>
<br>
That joy came tumbling to the ground along with Harper as he crashed into the layers of sludge.  He felt fire course up his right leg and he felt his pants getting warmer and wetter around the thigh.  He reached down and with a hiss felt the warm liquid.  Drawing his hand back up to his eyes he saw dark red mixed into the normal grim that coated every inch of his skin.  He had been shot.  Before he could make a move he heard a voice from overhead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well.  Look at what we have here boys,&quot; a course hard voice bellowed out.<br>
<br>
The fallen form slowly pushed himself over to face his attackers.  What Harper saw still haunts his nightmares.  Above him stood five very large and intimidating Pythos who were looking at Harper like he was a bunny and they were a pack of ravenous wolves.    <br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like we have a kludge who doesn't know how to tell time.  Stupid kludges.&quot;  The towering speaking Nietzschean knelt down to face the trembling kludge.  He thwapped Harper's cold nose.  &quot;Don't you know how to hide kludge?&quot;  The others laughed a cold heartless laugh that chilled Harper to the bone.  Luckily, the Nietzscheans' bad sense of humor left Harper with just the opening he was hoping for.<br>
<br>
Harper instantaneously kicked the legs out from under the knelt down Pytho.  He jumped on top of the now prone Nietzschean and with one swift punch to his face, forced the Pytho's septum up into his brain, killing him instantly.  Within a nano-second, Harper was up on his wounded leg tackling one of the other Pythos.  He quickly grasped his trusty knife from his boot and impaled it into the Pytho's temple.  Two down.  But the third never came.  Before Harper could blink an eye, he felt a powerful blow to his unprotected back.  That blow was quickly followed by another to his head, then to his chest, and so forth and so on.  Eventually, sweet blissful unconsciousness claimed him.<br>
<br>
Surges of energy passed through his body filling each synapse with pain.  This is what the young Harper woke up to...agony.  Harper reflexively jumped forward upon waking but found that it was not possible.  He was strapped to a type of adjustable metal table.  He felt the electrodes attached at his temples as more waves of energy coursed through him.  <br>
<br>
Harper really didn't expect this.  He was expecting death, sweet peaceful, painless death.  Why did the Pytho's want him alive?  Why not just kill him like they did to poor Susie.  Why was life so unfair?<br>
<br>
He never did get the answer to those questions but he did get more pain.  From what he could speculate, he was in some sort of sick recreation center for the Pythos.  He was in a small room with one door.  Lining the walls were torture instruments of every kind.  In the middle of the room laid Harper strapped to the table.  He could hear screams coming from both of the rooms next to him, and everyday he would have up to ten Pythos come and visit him.  They would do whatever they felt like doing to him.  The worse the day they had, the worse the day Harper had.  It turned out that Harper was a favorite for many and he saw many repeat customers.  Maybe it was his smart-aleck remarks that kept them coming back.  He really did need to learn to shut up.<br>
<br>
This daily torture went on for weeks, and then months.  They kept him alive with nano-bots and fed him through tubes.  Not once did they let him off of the table.  Harper turned 17 on that table.  For his birthday, the Pythos gave him two thousands deep small cuts all over his body.  He would have rather had a puppy.  <br>
<br>
Finally, one day months later, Harper's ears were filled with the sound of gun fire echoing through the halls of the recreation center.  Apparently the Dragos finally got sick of the Pythos and were kicking them off of Earth.  The Pythos were ruthless and quite a force to be reckoned with, but their nature was nomadic.  They were not about to put up a fight for Earth, they had their year of fun and that was all they wanted.  Off to another planet they went.<br>
<br>
The Drago-Kazov had no use for the half-dead recreation toys.  They simply threw all the beaten skeleton-like kludges out into the street as they reclaimed the building.  Harper landed on top of another victim of the Pythos with a thud when the Dragos threw him out.  He slowly breathed in the relatively fresh air of Boston.  He was free and alive.  Well barely.  Harper commanded his body to crawl out of the heap of writhing bodies and toward safety.  His limbs were atrophied from being restrained for so long.  Slowly and painfully he crawled and dragged himself to Brendan's old home, hoping that his last family member had not moved over the past year.<br>
<br>
After what seemed like hours of drudgery, Harper finally spotted Brendan's building.  It was a ruin down collapsing old apartment building.  The seventeen year old dragged his broken body through the doorway and up the steps to his cousin door.  A shaky, bloody, pale hand reached out and weakly knocked on the filthy door.  The sound of his fist on the wood was the last thing Harper heard before blackness enveloped him.<br>
<br>
Brendan heard the soft knock on his door.  He quickly grabbed his knife from the counter and slowly opened the creaking door.  Brendan peaked out, ready to attack whoever was there, but to his surprise, the hallway was empty.  His tense body relax and he opened the door wider as the still form on the ground caught his eye.  It was a body.  Bending down he rolled over the filthy, stinking, poor soul.  A gasp escaped his mouth when he saw the face that belonged to the pathetic body.  His last living family member, Seamus.<br>
<br>
About a year ago, Shay had disappeared and was eventually thought for dead.  After Brendan's mom finally died, he believed he was all alone in this world.  Now that body on his door stoop changed that belief.  Brendan took another look at his cousin.  He could hardly believe what he saw.  Harper was basically just a skeleton with flesh.  New and old bruises filled every inch of his skin, while new and old cuts overlaid the bruised creating an interesting patchwork.  Harpers face was thin and hollow, his eyes were sunken deep into his face.  His cheeks were also so sunken that if a smile could have filled that face his trademark dimples wouldn't have been able to show up.  Dried and fresh blood was covering his dirty, tattered clothes.  His normally short blond spiky hair was now shoulder length and dyed red from the year of blood flowing through it.  The stench coming off of Harper was that of death, but Brendan could just barely make out the rise and fall of air filling Harper's lungs.  Even though he looked dead and looked like he would want to be dead, Harper was alive.<br>
<br>
Gently Brendan picked up his cousin.  His stomach turned when he felt how light Harper had become.  He couldn't have been more that 50 pounds.  Brendan carried the sack of bones into his apartment, laid him down on the soft makeshift bed and began nursing his last family member back to health.<br>
<br>
From that day on, Harper never spoke one word of his 16th year on Earth.  He had pushed all the memories and horrors back into his mind where they stayed buried under a thick blanket of denial.  And they stayed there until that fateful day on Andromeda when the Pythos came back into Harper's life.<br>
<br>
*******<br>
<br>
Harper shook the nightmarish memories out of his head.  He came back to the present to find the cold harsh eyes of Galaver staring deep into his terror filled eyes.<br>
<br>
Beka's commanding voice broke through the stare.  &quot;We brought you a gift to strengthen our relationship.  Fex. Stolic,&quot; she ordered.<br>
<br>
Dylan's and Tyr's powerful hands pushed Harper toward his nightmare.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do we have here?&quot; spoke the cold dark voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;A Earth kludge for your pride.  One of our boarding team was lost and this....mudfoot was not take over.  My people give him to you as a gesture of cooperation.  A free slave to go with your new ship,&quot; Beka/Velac stated diplomatically.<br>
<br>
Harper felt himself get pushed toward the large Pytho as realization of what Velac said struck him.  &quot;Your new ship.&quot;  No, it can't be, Harper thought with dread.  Andromeda now belonged to the Pytho pride.<br>
<br>
Galaver caught the small form that was pushed toward him.  He grabbed Harper's arm and his bad one at that.  Harper's pain from the arm was now insignificant.  The Pythos had control of Andromeda and his friends were lost within their own bodies.  Not for the first time in his life, Harper wished for death.<br>
<br>
Galaver's rough hands caught Harper's chin as he tilted up the beaten face of the engineer.  He was examining the goods. &quot;Not bad.  A little beaten up, but not bad.&quot;  The words were void of any emotion.<br>
<br>
Strongly against Beka's will, Velac spoke up.  &quot;He's also an engineering genius.  As for the wounds, he's already been injected with nano-bots so he should heal quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, good.  You've done well.  I&quot;m glad to see your species is cooperating.&quot;  Galaver's head was raised high as he spoke.  Turning his proud head behind him, he gave commands to the lower Pythos.  &quot;Apoc, Zeck,  take our first slave here to the holding cell.&quot;  He turned back to face Beka.  &quot;I do assume this magnificent ship has a holding area.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, Deck 15.  Nixic will show you the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Follow me,&quot; Trance/Nixic said as she lead the two muscle bound Pythos and the small, disheartened Harper out of the bay.  <br>
<br>
Harper could just make out the next part of Velac's and Galaver's conversation.<br>
 <br>
&quot;How many of your pride did you bring to colonize this ship?&quot; asked Beka's voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;About 3,000.  They are all docking in the other hanger bays as we speak.&quot;<br>
<br>
Inside of Dylan's, Tyr's, Beka's, Trance's and especially Harper's mind the exact same word filled their thoughts.<br>
<br>
SHIT.<br>

on the other hand, as long as harper saves the day, im happy. and if he ends up with trance im even happier. and a certain person might avoid being fried by Hex vision. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nureek>Nureek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magog</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/1/03 6:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   RE: Chapter 6</span><hr size=1> hawkeye: LMAO!!!.

<br>
PART TWO<br>
<br>
&quot;Correction, standing next to you [Trance], Beka, Rev, Rommie, Dylan....err, well anyways, then I'm one of the good guys, but I didn't survive twenty years on that hellhole we lovingly call Earth by being Santa's Little Helper.  I survived by being the nastiest piece of work that ever clubbed someone over the head in the back alley over a hunk of cheese.&quot;<br>
-----Seamus Zealanzy Harper<br>
<br>
Chapter 7<br>
<br>
Andromeda's corridor was quiet save for the four sets of stomping boots on the hard metal floors.  The boots belonged to the two lower Pythos, Apoc and Zeck, the abducted body of Trance Gemini and the Earth kludge Seamus Harper.  Trance was in front of the group leading them to V deck.  Following her were the stereotypical thugs.  Both had muscles larger than their brains and their low brows dominated their faces.  You could see the ancient Earth Neanderthals' traits still in their so called superior DNA.<br>
<br>
In-between the two towers of bulk walked Harper.  Apoc had a nice strong grip on his right arm, while his non-related twin had the same grasp on his still mangled and useless left arm.  Luckily for Harper, the nano-bots Trance injected him with earlier were doing their job.  His ribs only hurt a bit and all the other bruises and cuts were now only superficial.  All of the internal bleeding from the punches and kicks had been fixed and even his fever from the infection in his data port had broken.  Trance/Nixic had been nice enough to mix in some antibiotics with the nano-bots.  Nice bad guys.  Unfortunately, two major injuries still remained.  His left arm, if Zeck were to let go of it, would fall uselessly to his side.  Pain was still radiating from it, but not as intense as before.  The other major problem was his dataport.  Still swollen, still quite painful, still unusable.  The nano-bots were seemingly having no effect on it at all.<br>
<br>
Harper's mind focused on the silent corridor instead of the pain.  Soon, he thought, the corridors he now called home, would be home to thousands of Pythos.  Thousand of treacherous Pythos' feet would be strolling these halls.  Voice of the horrible ubers would fill Andromeda's lovely walkways....and rooms....and even her...HIS engine room.  NO! screamed Harper's mind.  I can't let it.  I won't let it.  After he survived the Pytho's recreation center, he promised himself that he would never be in Pytho control again and that any Pytho he saw would leave this world with Harper's grinning face staring over their bleeding, broken body.  He promised.  The blood in his veins started to boil, his mind racing with memories from years ago mixing with the memories from the past 24 hours.  When his mind reached his current situation, his blood froze.<br>
<br>
Who was he kidding.  Three thousand Pythos were boarding Andromeda.  Three thousand!  And he was being dragged off to V deck by two Pythos twice his size who were being lead by his golden goddess.  To top it all off, his friends were prisoners in their own minds and unable to help.  Or were they?  They had beat him and tortured him, but were they truly helpless?  Harper knew that he annoyed them and that maybe, sometimes, they only kept him around for his technical merit, but did he annoy them that much.  Enough for them not to fight while being forced to hurt him?  Enough for Beka to say those things to him?  How much did they truly despise him?<br>
<br>
Harper internally shook his head, rattling the clouds of doubt that constantly overcast his thoughts.  Not now.  It didn't matter either way, if they hated him or not.  Either way they would not or could not help him.  It was up to him to save himself and his friends...even if they did hate him.  No one deserved to be left with the Pythos, well except maybe the Drago-Kazov.<br>
<br>
Pain shooting though his arm brought his thoughts back to the real world.  The real world where Zeck had just squeezed his poor arm as he shoved the smaller man forward.  The boiling blood that had been placated earlier with fear was getting hot again.  Familiar anger rose within Harper's psyche.  Anger that had not been fully used or felt since that day Beka rescued him from Earth.  Every once it a blue moon, the rage would peek it's ugly head, but never to the magnitude that filled Harper's mind and body everyday on Earth.  He had felt a twinge of it with Gerentex and with Satrina, but it wasn't the same desperate, empty stomach, survival-of-the-fittest rage that filled his thoughts every second he survived on that hellhole.  The rage had been placated because Harper had always felt safe with Beka and the others.  He always knew, no matter how much he annoyed them or how much they hated him, they would always have his back.  He hadn't needed to call up that part of him since he meet that lovely redhead-now blonde captain.  But now it was different.  Now no one had his back, no one could help him but himself. <br>
<br>
Deep in the recesses of the spunky kluge's mind there is a locked door.  A door which has years of dust settling on it's large strong lock.  A lock that Harper's non-corporeal hand was now fiddling with.  A lock and a door that was now creaking open.  Behind that door, inside that dark cold harsh room, laid pure, unsaturated survival.<br>
<br>
The door was now wide open and Seamus Zealanzy Harper of Earth was finally let loose.<br>
<br>
Apoc's grip loosened for a second and that was all Harper needed.  Ripping his good right arm from Apoc's loose grip, Harper quickly took aim at Zeck's large nose.  With the palm of this hand, the engineer plunged Zeck's septum straight up into his rarely used brain.  The soft sweet sound of cartilage on gray matter brought back sweet memories for Harper.  He loved that move.<br>
<br>
Before Apoc could even register that the weak injured inferior kludge had just killed his fellow Pytho, Harper had laid a strong solid kick to his family jewels.  Apoc violently hunched over in pain. With the Pytho's head now at Harper's level, the weak human took his only useful arm and put Zeck into a headlock.  With his hand securely griping Apoc's chiseled chin, Harper twisted his arm.  Snaps and cracks filled the corridor as Apoc's head twist like a cap on a Neubayern Weisbrau bottle.  A sick thud followed as the large body hit the ground.<br>
<br>
*********<br>
<br>
In the dark recesses of her mind, Trance sat and thought.  The number three thousand kept repeating it's self.  The word crap also kept repeating it's self.<br>
<br>
Inside her mind she sat, useless and helpless.  She watched her body lead poor Harper into a life of slavery.  Poor Harper.  Her thoughts paused on that phrase.  He had been through a nightmare today and she had a good feeling that it was only just beginning.<br>
<br>
Her golden heart broke realizing there was nothing she could do for him...or herself...or for the others.  The future was so hazy and uncertain right now she couldn't even win a hand of Yeshi-dono.  That thought alone was scaring her.  Usually she could see or figure something out, but this was like being blindfolded.  She hated not knowing what would happen, or even what could happen.  It was so...so...mortal.  She could only figure that it had to be Nixic's presence that was blocking the possible futures from her.  It had to be.<br>
<br>
Her thoughts were interrupted by a sound behind her of bones breaking.  HARPER!  She thought as worry and dread filled her mind.  Nixic turned her body around to see Harper grabbing a gun off of Apoc's dead body which was laying next to Zeck's corpse.  Both bodies were quite a site.  Apoc's head was now on backwards and dark red blood and gray matter were oozing out of the area that used to hold Zeck's nose.<br>
<br>
Nixic focused Trance's eyes off of the grotesque forms on the ground and up at the barrel of the gun that Harper was pointing at her.  His left arm hung limply at his side.  Trance had done that to him.<br>
<br>
Nixic commanded Trance's voice to speak. &quot;Damn Harper,&quot; her voice was filled with admiration.  &quot;Trance didn't know you had that in you.  Impressive.  Futile, but impressive.&quot;  Nixic focused on the gun that was pointed at her.  &quot;You know that thing is useless against Trance.  Plus, you hurt me, you hurt your golden goddess.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harper's cold and empty eyes just stared at Trance.  He spoke up in an equally cold and empty voice, &quot;Silly alien, tricks are for kids.&quot;<br>
<br>
He fired.<br>
<br>
A wave of fire burned through her leg as the bullet from the gauss gun made contact.  Pain shot up through her whole body, but there was something else...something good.  Nixic was feeling the pain too and is was causing him, her, it to loosen it's grip on Trance's mind and body.  Trance jumped at this opportunity.  She fought past Nixic's powerful mind and grabbed hold of her voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;H-H-Harper! It's me, Trance!&quot;  She yelled out feeling simple pleasure at the act of using her own voice.<br>
<br>
The mysterious golden alien had crashed onto the corridor floor after taking the shot to her leg.  The second Harper heard the real voice of his golden goddess he raced over to her side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trance!!&quot; he yelled in joy as he held her dreadlock filled head with his good arm.  The left arm hadn't moved an inch from before.<br>
<br>
Trance's eyes locked on that arm, that mangled arm. &quot;I&quot;m sorry Harper,&quot; she said nodding towards the limb.<br>
<br>
&quot;No prob babe.  I've had worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AAAGGGGHHHHH....&quot;screamed Trance.  The pain from the shot was wearing off and Nixic was starting to regain control.  Trance pushed Nixic back down.<br>
<br>
For a split second, Harper could see the minds switch from Trance to Nixic back to Trance.  A wave of energy had flowed across the surface of her eyes in-between transitions.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Trance, don't leave me,&quot; he begged.  Fresh tears were coming to his tired eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;H-Have to...can't keep Nixic at bay.... pain... makes... them... weakkkkkaaaagggghhh... run.... harper.... run.&quot;  Silence.  Trances eyes rolled back into her head as the waves of energy returned to dance across her retinas.  Nixic was returning.<br>
<br>
With one swift movement, Harper placed Trance's head down, grabbed all the guns off of all the bodies, alive and dead, and ran for his life.<br>
<br>
A second later, Trace's voice could be heard reverberating through the empty corridor as Harper fled. &quot;DAMN IT!&quot;<br>
<br>
The pumping of his sore legs and the air struggling to fill his lungs reminded him of Earth and his past.  A past which he had fought to forget, deny or repress.  Instincts from that past were resurfacing along with the memories.  Instincts that his friends didn't know were in him, would not want to know were in him and would be repulsed by.  Instincts that Harper, of Earth, were about to release on the Pytho pride.<br>
