Taylee did not seem like she wanted to run, at least not with me. George wanted to use her as a hostage against Cale who seemed like he wanted to kill George for killing his twin brother. And then there was the othe girl that just stood there watching all of us while the rest of the vampires strained against the invisible leash of their master because they wanted to attack.<br>
<br>
I still had my guns drawn and I was not about to let anything happen to myself. And I was going to get that bomb away from Taylee so she couldn't be stupid enough to follow George's selfish orders. Frankly right now I had lost all interest in Taylees blood and as it was my nature to stick it to the vampires every chance I got, well I just wanted to spit in Cale's face by running off with his brother's ghoul. I was still curious also if George was pulling a bluff about the bomb.<br>
<br>
So I moved, fast enough that George could not have seen, only the vampires including Cale could possibly have. My path was true as I swept past Taylee, the tip of my blade clipping the package and sending it sliding far away from her and landing at Cale's feet instead. Just as quickly I then leaped up onto a light post were I crouched with my guns trained on them all for I was now out of the circle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look what we have here... The one who killed your brother, your brother's last ghoul and a bomb that George claims will go off the second he hits the detonator.&quot; I sneered from my perch. &quot;Quite honestly I don't give a shit what you all decide to do with eachother since none of you are the ones I am after. As for the familer, well I did save her from a vampire that was attacking her, your property because I saw the real fear in her eyes. That vampire did not follow you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I seem to the the only one without an introduction, I'm Midnight Rayne...&quot; I flashed my fangs dangerously as my eyes narrowed. &quot;Phasen sehnen sich das motherland&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwynnethdelioncourt>Gwynneth de Lioncourt</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://animatedgif.net/bulletsballs/flasharrowrt_e0.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/8/03 2:52 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.jasminebecketgriffith.com/boredfairy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> Iris snorted lightly, becoming increasingly tired of the redhead's overly flashy displays of bravado. She didn't smell right, not human, and not quite vampire... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dhampire...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she decided, matching the smell to once she'd encountered before. &quot;You're not the only one here who hasn't given an introduction, darlin'... Iris Devereux. And if that name doesn't ring a bell, maybe you'd recognize me as Leadrian's pet...&quot; she half snarled, her fangs flashing unintentionally. &quot;And if you don't recognize Leadrian's name, then you haven't been in the city for long.&quot;<br>
<br>
She glared and a small spark appeared beside Rayne's head, singeing a few of the girl's hairs. &quot;And if you don't give a shit about what the rest of us do, then why in the name of Hell are you still waving those bloody guns about? If you don't give a damn, why not just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>leave</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?&quot; There was more menace in that last word than Iris had intended there to be, but all the talk of Leadrian throughout the night had put her on edge and she was feeling a bit peeved. <br>
<br>
Her dark eyes glittered with malice and a sudden breeze swept her long hair back from her pale, graceful features. She seemed to disappear and then rematerialize as she grabbed the bomb, almost fading into nothingness again as she ran a few good yards from Cale and flung the pack of cancer sticks backhanded in Rayne's direction. She was back beside Cale again in what seemed like seconds, the only sign that she'd moved at all being the settling of her long ebony locks.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

<br>
It didn't mean anything to Taylee, but what she did notice was that this Iris seemed determined to show Rayne up. As the others watched Iris' little tricks, the blonde girl took advantage of the distraction. Slowly Taylee inched back, praying that the child would stay asleep and not bring attention on the two of them. If she could just get a little further away, she could make a run for it. She had no idea where she would go but knew she had to get as far from Cale as possible. For she knew what he wanted..what he'd always wanted.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/9/03 5:55 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> &quot;Names mean nothing to me, nore do your actions.&quot; I smirked, infased by the quick flame that licked at my hair. I was a dhampire and flames did not harm me like they did vampires. &quot;I have never heard of you, and certainly not of anyone else you mentioned. But I take it that I will soon come to know them? Well you may not know my name but you will soon enough... Its Midnight Rayne... remember it or regret forgetting it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I watched as the package of smokes landed near the base of my towering lamp post so I quickly leaped out of the way to the next lamp post were I perched above it. My guns were still trained upon them all as best I could. I had managed to follow the female vampire's movements better then a mortal could have but I knew if they all attacked me, I was not going to make easily. I did not bother answering her comment on my guns, she did not need to know all my tricks. Once more I flashed my fangs as I took aim at the now distant package. Time to see if this bomb was a bluff and since it was out of range from us all, I decided to destroy it.<br>
<br>
With Taylee out of the way, the bomb exactly where I wanted it, nothing could be closer to perfect. Sparks shot from the barrels of my magnums as the shots echoed into the night. The bullets tore into the package, completely destroying it in the blink of an eye. Any bomb that might have been in there would now explode if one indeed had existed. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;So George, bomb or bust?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/10/03 8:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> (O.O.C. Two things. 1. Sorry about the no posting. School caught up with me. 2. Does no one have patience anymore? NE way. Here we go.)<br>
<br>
Cale watched as the two females battled it out. He had to admit, they both displayed impressive skills. He could have had Rayne killed in a second, but this was fun. As for Taylea, a wave of his hand and her escape route was blocked off.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, George was watching the ladies play hotpotato with his cig pack. Then when Rayne put bullets through it, he mouthed &quot;Shit&quot;. <br>
<br>
Cale watched the pack turned to shreds, and then nothing. &quot;You were bluffing!?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks that way doesn't it. Question is, where's the real bomb?&quot; With that he through the detonator at Cale who caught it of course. What he wasn't expecting however was the small puff of smoke fused with essence of garlic that came out and caught his eyes.<br>
<br>
On George's end, immediately after the detonator left his hands, he reached into his coat and grabbed a couple of rare items. Tear gas made of the same thing as in the detonator. About the time Cale was being blinded, the pins were out of the canisters and the bombs were on the ground, spewing smoke and gas into the air. His lungs full before he became invisible to the vamps' eyes. Hidden from all eyes, even Rayne's, he flipped open the manhole cover at his feet and grabbed Taylee and the baby. Holding them close, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Too close for a ghoul</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, George jumped into the hole and replaced the cover. Upon landing his brace shook and his leg hurt even more, but he fought above it. &quot;Let's go.&quot; He said, pulling Taylee along and not giving her a choice.<br>
<br>
(George and Taylea continued in Warehouse district. And Rayne, if you insist on following, give us a few minutes to get some arguments in the mix.)<br>
<br>
Cale waited for the smoke to disappear. He blinked and physically shook with anger. &quot;I WANT THEM FOUND. NOW!!&quot; He doubted even Rayne could deny the strength that radiated from him at that moment. And what's worse is he hadn't calmed down at all.<br>

I had not been able to see where he went but it was so obvious. All tricks are smoke and mirrors and I was not about to stick around for Cale's wraith. He could rant impressively all he wanted but I felt it was time to go. It was nice to see however that Cale did not like garlic, it had been a while since I had seen that simple item cause trouble. Hardly any vampire I had slain had been weak to that, which was sadly now the reason I never carried it. Guess it was about time I did.<br>
<br>
Knowing that the manhole, plus the sound of it clanking only seconds before had to be George's escape route, I knew I had to follow him. Now it mattered not to me what he did with his life but he had fucked up my evening so far and I wanted to make sure his did not go so well anymore either. Take something from me and I'd take something from you was how I thought. Humans were so stupid and pathetic, I praised the fact I was not one of them.<br>
<br>
Quickly I leaped off the lamp post and into the darkness, not caring what Cale or the other vampires did. If they followed me the I would have to change my plans but for now I had some very good ideas. It was not possible for two humans and a baby to get very far fast in the tunnels and with my sense of smell, I would be able to track them down easily. I signaled my companion in the truck to continue on, there was no way he would be able to follow me. Playing a little deception of my own, I made it look like I got in the vehicle with him as he drove off but in reality I used the truck to block the view of me climbing into another manehole and closing the lid.<br>
<br>
Darkness and stench surrounded me as I walked back through the tunnels. In the darkness, my dhampire vision played out well and I was able to see foot prints of the two in the sludge. Following them was easy enough though they did vanish when the floor got hard, but the trail was simple enough to pick up again and I knew I had to be headed towards the warehouse district. Now that was a place I hardly went myself alone for it was the vampire front for importing food in human form. The place always swarmed with vampires, even in the so called day and though they left you alone for the most part, should something go wrong then welcome to your fate. But nothing would go wrong tonight for what vampire there would care I was after humans?<br>
<br>
The stench of the sewer tunnels grew as I progressed and I stopped for a moment to look around. It was then I heard the sound of clicking claws upon steel and I knew what approached. There was no place for me to hide as the shadowy forms approached so I stood my ground with weapons drawn, my eyes going from one to the next. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Just fucking great... Were creatures... Shit. This is definatly not good</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

The vampire male and leader of the pack held no interest to him but the male human that escaped and the red headed dhampire that followed them did because they seemed like hunters.

After a few moments, she arrived near where the voice had called to her, but she didn't see anyone around. She glanced into the shadows, thinking that she saw a humanoid shape in one of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhekath>Rhekath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/16/03 9:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> &quot;Time hasn't changed you one bit... still curious as ever my dear.&quot; the darkness spoke before David made himself known by stepping out into the dim light.

<br>
&quot;It has been a while since we have seen eachother, but surely I don't need to introduce myself do I?&quot; he flashed her a charming smile before glancing down the street. &quot;But before we talk, lets get off the street because with the commotion going on down there with the others will draw attention I am not in the mood for.&quot; <br>
<br>
Quickly stepping over to a doorway behind him, David pushed it open and invited her inside before closing the door behind her. The room was lit with a single lanturn from the ceiling and Dave walked into the middle of the room before stopping and looking at her once more. &quot;Its good to see time hasn't changed you... now are you curious as to why I called for you?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwynnethdelioncourt>Gwynneth de Lioncourt</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://animatedgif.net/bulletsballs/flasharrowrt_e0.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/17/03 5:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.jasminebecketgriffith.com/boredfairy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> Iris crossed her arms and tried not to smile.

<br>
She nodded slightly. &quot;To say I'm curious would be a bit of an understatement, so..

<br>
&quot;Since I met you Iris, I have gone deep into the underworld of our vampire nation. I have seen things that could cause even the ancients to shudder and learned things I was happier not knowing.&quot; Dave began slowly, speaking his thoughts carefully.<br>
<br>
&quot;I belong to a sociaty that's soul purpose is to hunt and kill the hunters of our kind. I must say you put yourself in a fair bit of danger just by being in the presense of two of them.&quot; he spoke of the interesting dance he had witnessed between them all earlier. &quot;The human is of little concern to us of the order, we have plans for him but the red head has been causing us a fair amount of trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Midnight is new to New York but already she has slain many of our kind... I warn you to be careful because no only do I see you run into her and start a fight with her, I see you with a vampire that could care less about your life. Now I could be wrong it what I saw...&quot; he paused, his eyes looking towards the floor as he stroked his goatee softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I really was not looking for you till I sensed you and now that I have found you I would like to offer you a place with me. We vampires are faced with a war... Humans blame us for their extinction yet they are to blame for the pollution that has made this city our home. They gather in secret and with the Were creatures... I need vampires like you... And if I remember correctly you love excitement...&quot; he charmed her with a grin as he looked back up into her eyes to wait for her response. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhekath>Rhekath</A> at: 9/17/03 9:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwynnethdelioncourt>Gwynneth de Lioncourt</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://animatedgif.net/bulletsballs/flasharrowrt_e0.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/18/03 5:38 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.jasminebecketgriffith.com/boredfairy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> &quot;Dave, honey... A place with you could be more dangerous than deciding to sleep on a park bench when you know there's a serial killer on the loose that's just escaped from the state pen.&quot; Iris replied with a little laugh, still finding it slightly unsettling that she had to look up to meet his gaze. She was so used to having to slump and glance down to look people in the eyes...<br>
<br>
She folded her arms casually across her waist and leaned back against the wall opposite the other vampire, sighing softly. She looked away from him and said softly, more to herself than to him, &quot;The weres aren't much of a threat. They're a lot of talk, but so long as you can be faster, they can never best you in any sort of fight. Unless there're more than five of them. Then you're fucked,&quot; she added, looking back up and across at him. <br>
<br>
She was silent a moment, her eyes steadily meeting his gaze without blinking. She finally closed her eyes, slowly, her coal dark lashes coming to rest on her snowy cheeks. &quot;I... will stay with you, David.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhekath>Rhekath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/18/03 5:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> Dave listened to her weigh the odds and seem to find absolutely no reason to come with him but when she said she would, he arched his right brow in question. &quot;I take it you want the danger if not being with me is safer...&quot; his lips turned into a small grin as he lifted himself away from the wall and stepped near her.<br>
<br>
He hid his delight in her agreement to go with him because it was just not the tough guy way so instead he stood there with arms crossed over his chest, his eyes looking down to hers slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since you are coming with me, there is no reason to hang around here.

<br>
Like the tease that he was, Dave brushed past her and towards the door without even a look back until he had checked to see that the coast was clear. One could never be to safe and Dave knew the other vampire had to still be out there. But that was not his concern once he saw the coast was clear and with that he took Iris's hand and lead her outside.<br>
<br>
Quickly he lead her around the back of the building to were a black 1997 Corvette sat in the darkness sat. The lights flashed as he disarmed the alarm and opened the passanger door to let her in. It clicked when he closed it and moved around to his side of the car and climbed in. &quot;Its almost morning, do you want to come back to my place or go to yours?&quot; he asked as he turned the key in the ignition to bring the powerful engine to life. The tires squealled as he shifted into gear and took off down the street, knowing he could change direction if she wanted to go somewhere other then where he was headed which was for the moment back to his house. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwynnethdelioncourt>Gwynneth de Lioncourt</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://animatedgif.net/bulletsballs/flasharrowrt_e0.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/18/03 7:30 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.jasminebecketgriffith.com/boredfairy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Damnable tease...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Iris thought to herself, cloaking the thought although he'd probably get the gist of it, regardless.<br>

His question gave her pause, and temporarily saddened the tall vampiress.

<br>
&quot;My place is fine, I have a spare bed you can sleep on if you like.&quot; he replied as they drove down the deserted streets towards his home. As they drove since he lived on the other side of the city, he decided to ask her a bit of her life recently and see if she was attached to anyone. &quot;So Iris... how has life been?

<br>
&quot;Life has been... odd. My folks passed away a while back, but so far as I know, my sister's still alive somewhere. I've been afraid to look for her, because I don't want to see her already growing old when I haven't aged at all. It just.. goes against nature, and I know I wouldn't be able to handle it.&quot; Iris went silent a moment.<br>

The darkness hid his slight smile as she mentioned the sleeping arrangements but he could not disagree with her. Time was just a good of time as any to get done what they never had before when they had met long ago.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well my bed is big enough if you wish to sleep there instead... I warn you I'll be sleeping there to.&quot; Dave cautioned her though he knew full well that was probably her reason for wanting to sleep there in the first place. &quot;Sharing isn't something I have done in a while but its you so I'll get used to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The idea of the tall slender raven haired girl lying so close to him he could feel the heat of her skin drove his senses a little wild. Home seemed so far away now but with the speed they drove they would get there soon enough. He shifted through the gears as they rounded a corner and increased speed once more towards 100miles an hour, his home now only a few blocks away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your sister... do you even know if she is alive with all this destruction around us? Humans are disappearing very quickly... sad really...&quot; he made idle conversation as they drove the last few blocks and pulled up to his house. His house was located on a deserted block, everything very run down but his car did not stick out as he hid it in the garage. <br>
<br>
Dave lead her inside his home which was rather well furnished and even had running water. His bedroom was to the back of the house, the windows all up with iron plating like every other house in the area since this was a vampire sector. &quot;Welcome to my home, make yourself comfortable.&quot;<br>
