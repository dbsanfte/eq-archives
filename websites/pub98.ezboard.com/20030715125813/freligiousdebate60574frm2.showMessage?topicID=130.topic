I read today that MSNBC is cancelling &quot;Donahue&quot; after 6 months due to low ratings--apparently it couldn't compete with Bill O'Reilly.  I read an article on MSN yesterday about several failed attempts at establishing a liberal talk radio show in a market dominated by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.  <br>
<br>
Could someone please point me to the liberal media bias?  I hear this term over and over again, and I don't get it.  It seems to me like the conservatives have completely overtaken the airwaves.  <br>
<br>
Do you feel this way also?  If so, why do you think this is?  Are conservatives just more likely to watch/listen to these kinds of shows, so that's what gets the ratings?  Or do they represent the majority point of view?  Just wondering what others think about this.<br>

Their personalities has a great deal to do with their popularity (or absolute hate by the other side). They aren't afraid to yell and get emotional about issues. <br>
<br>
THe radio has tended to be a conservative base while the print and tv has usually been liberal. But after Fox news came on the scene it has really started to change.<br>
<br>
I don't think there really are more conservatives then liberals, I just think conservative news commentary makes for more interesting listening. The hosts tend to be more dynamic, more egotistical (gotta admit that's what pulls me in), and seem to welcome disagreement with them. <br>
<br>
Look at Bill O'Reilly, he loves putting up email messages that trash him. It proves that even people who don't agree with him watch him. Plus both Rush and O'Reilly look and act like that are loving what they are doing. Its fun to them. They are having fun. And while I never caught a show of Donahue, I really can't imagine him having fun. <br>
<br>
Anyway, the bias once was there - if you were a conservative, of course as a liberal you wouldn't think so. But the last 5 or so years has seen a HUGE change in tv media. I think the radio had gone through the change earlier. And the print is still I think more liberal then conservative. <br>
<br>
I'll admit it, I love Bill O'Reilly. I haven't seen him in ages though. We get it over here in Germany, but I can never remember when its on, plus DD just isn't as taken with him as I am. <br>

<br>
I agree that blowhard conservative commentators tend to be more vocal and opinionated, and less tolerant - even ridiculing - of other points of view. That is what makes them more entertaining than liberal hosts like Donahue. You all know what a liberal I am, yet I'd watch O'Reilly over Donahue any day. I want to be entertained. When I want balance I watch Mark Sheild and Mike Brooks on PBS.<br>
<br>
What I find entertaining is the way some right-wing conservatives have taken up the mantle of &quot;victim&quot; in recent times.

Yes yes yes.  Totally!  The ultra-conservative tends to have a one track mind, and whenever someone disrupts their little world with logic, they blame the liberals.  If someone has a different opinion, then they couldn't have possibly been thinking for themselves, it must have been the liberal media that caused this.<br>
<br>
I do think the media is more conservative than liberal, and maybe people here are right that the conservatives tend to present more of a circus.  I was watching O'Reilly one night, and I was getting so ticked off at the things he was saying to this lesbian lawyer he was interviewing.  Did I just call the guy an asshole and change the station like a rational person would?  Nope.  I stood there watching like it was a freakin car wreck, and then I had something to bitch about the rest of the night.  My tangent over how I get sick of gays being mistreated entertained me the rest of the night.  <br>
<br>
For the most part, I think the media dishes out what sells.  If a reporter has a good idea to present to the public, then his voice will only be heard if the executives think they will bring in an audience and make money.  It makes sense because integrity and objectivity don't put food on the table for your kiddos.  Controversial subjects might be what tags the media as liberal, but controversial subjects sell.  We all watch the news to find out what is going on in the world, but we also want to be entertained in the process.  This means that the media might have to throw a few subjects out there that would make the conservatives drop their bible.  Its all business.<br>

Because it is the truth.  Each year there are major elections they poll the news media. Tv anchors, newspaper journalist etc.  and it has consistently shown that the vast majority of media personalities and writers vote liberal democrat.  <br>
<br>
As as perfect as I am sure they are, they write and produce their stories from a liberal slant.  Ex.  The hole in the Ozone is now getting smaller.  Hmm not widely covered in the news because it doesnt sit well with the liberal, green peace attitude of the press.  Another example.  Lots of rallies being held in support of Pres. Bush and the possibility of war with IRAQ, are they covered in the news NO. but get two people together and call it an anti-war rally and every news station and newspaper are there to cover it.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A LIBERAL DECALOGUE<br>
By Bertrand Russell<br>
Perhaps the essence of the Liberal outlook could be summed up in a new decalogue, not intended to replace the old one but only to supplement it. The Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate, might be set forth as follows: <br>
 1. Do not feel absolutely certain of anything. <br>
 2. Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light. <br>
 3. Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed. <br>
 4. When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory. <br>
 5. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found. <br>
 6. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you. <br>
 7. Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric. <br>
 8. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter. <br>
 9. Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it. <br>
 10. Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool's paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
I think it was the Howard Stern movie &quot;Private Parts&quot; that pointed out how the main reason both people who liked him and hated him kept listening to &quot;hear what he would say next&quot;.  I don't know that Howard is necessarily liberal though.  He is atheist and pro-choice, but there are also a lot of things he agrees with conservatives on as well.  I think people assume he is liberal because of the nutty stuff on the show.  His main demographic is people from 25-54 years of age who are &quot;affluent&quot;.  A lot of people just think only derelicts listen to him, but he in fact has a highly educated audience.  I used to listen to him, but he was dropped in this market.  I miss Howard.  Waaaaah!<br>

LDS GRABS FOR MEDIA MONOPOLY IN UTAH -- ONLY $173.5 MILLION<br>
                             By Rich Andrews<br>
<br>
Bonneville International Corporation, the media arm of the Mormon Church, has announced its intention to purchase 15 radio stations from Simmons Media Group.  The price tag for this acquisition is $173.5 million.  The sale would violate FCC antimonopoly regulations, and require a waiver or change in existing FCC rules.  The deal would give the Mormon Church three of the five top-rated radio stations in Salt Lake City.<br>
<br>
The LDS (Latter-day Saints) already owns KSL-TV and KSL-AM.  They hold sway over Salt Lake's two daily newspapers through their Newspaper Agency Corporation.  The Mormon Church also has educational TV and radio stations and a cable television system that serve Salt Lake City and numerous counties in Utah.<br>
<br>
All the stations involved in the proposed sale are located in the Intermountain area.  The Church already owns KCSG-TV channel 4 in Cedar City and St.  George, and the sale would give the LDS two AM and two FM stations.  It would also allow the LDS to gobble up five FM and three AM stations in the Pocatello - Idaho Falls area, thus cementing the media monopoly the Church already enjoys.<br>
<br>
All of this is at odds with federal regulations designed to protect people from a high degree of media concentration that is repugnant to antitrust principles, and inconsistent with the Communication Act's goal of providing for the expression of diverse views.<br>
<br>
In RED LION BROADCASTING CO.  v.  FCC (395 US 367, 390 -- 1969) it states:<br>
<br>
&quot;It is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which the truth will ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopolization of that market, whether it be by government itself or a private licensee ...  it is the right of the public to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral and other ideas and experience which is crucial here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many Utahans rightly fear that Church-controlled media is used to propagate the Mormon religion, protect it from outside scrutiny, and exert undue influence on matters of public importance.<br>
<br>
The 1996 Telecommunications Act instructed the Federal Communications Commission to revise some ownership rules and waiver policies; but the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule was not among the ownership rules it should consider.  Furthermore, the U.S.  Supreme Court has upheld the FCC's diversity standard supporting its newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership policies.<br>
<br>
Past experience with Mormon media have led many residents of Utah to be wary.  This is the same church that purchased documents from Mark Hoffman years ago (including the notorious &quot;Salamander letter&quot;) to keep them from public view, and aired a groundless story on KSL-AM that Gary Sheets was having marital problems.  All of this was designed to deflect attention from scandal within the Latter-day Saints church.  Also, KSL-TV was the station that aired another groundless story on Foothill Financial that created a run on its assets and led to its closing.<br>
<br>
Today, KSL-TV refuses to broadcast Saturday Nigh Live, and recently took the Jay Leno Show off the air for one night because of its content..<br>
<br>
The Mormon Church is seeking to circumvent the FCC rules and acquire these addition stations to add to its existing monopoly.  Few potential buyers can match the $173.5 million offer.  For the Mormon Church, this is a small price to pay for control of the free flow of information.<br>

This reminded me of a big news story here in AZ though with the polygamist Mormon sects that actually indoctrinate very young girls and engage in what is basically child molestation--often marrying them off at 12 or 14 after daddy has performed his proper role of &quot;introducing&quot; them to sex. I am pretty outspoken about not being against adults choosing plural relationships, but these cults really seem to be abusive with the kids having no real chance for escape (though I say some women who had gotten out last night) and the kicker is they own and profit from nearly every coin-operated vending machine around!! Have to get the name of the company again, but it makes me never want to use one again...this certainly goes beyond anything I boycott Dominoe's or Payless for and it makes me just sick.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This reeks of the 1984 Orwellian Minsitry of Truth and Big Brother.  Were it a true freemarket, all sides would be equally represented and choice would be done on an individual basis by consumers, not siezed and controlled by a theocracy to spew disinformation and propaganda (as cited in the message.)  Freedom of speech is lost if the means of expression are controlled by a single entity and those controlls are wielded to restrict access.<br>

There are so many freakin radio and tv stations here that the purchase of these stations is HARDLY a monopoly.<br>
<br>
Locally we have 9 TV stations.  2 are owned by the state universities as part of public tv. 1 is owned by BYU, the LDS University, but the programing is that of public tv. (Barney, teletubbies, cooking shows etc)<br>
<br>
Bonneville international (owned by the LDS church) owns the NBC affliate (NBC programming) ABC, CBS, WB, Fox, and a local UPN are all owned independently.  As far as radio stations, I cant even begin to name all the radio stations, but suffice it to say there are minimum 50.  NOt to mention all the cable, or satellite stations on tv and radio.<br>
<br>
The reason to purchase these stations is to provide a resource for  broadcasting our general conference which occurs two times a year and the BYU devotional which is 1 hour a day. (currently only played on the BYU station in SLC)<br>
<br>
On KSL , I watch ER, third watch, Law and Order all the regular NBC stuff.  The only time the church does anything differently with broadcasting an NBC show is when that show has something that is considered SERIOUSLY offensive.  And then it opens the door for any other station in town to broadcast it.  A prime example, is that it does not broadcast Saturday Night Live, (the local news does a sports show at the same time) however the local WB affliliate has picked up the broadcast rights.<br>
<br>
A monopoly would mean, I could only see or hear what they choose to broadcast.  Which is not the case here. - Shirene<br>
