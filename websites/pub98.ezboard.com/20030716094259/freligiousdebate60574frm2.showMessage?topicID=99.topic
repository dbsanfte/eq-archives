(i.e. heaven). I know he has to say nice things and be the Chief Mourner and all, but wasn't it a bit sappy and hypocritical of a xian of his strain to say he prayed for and knows god will return all the souls to heaven when at least one of these souls (the Jew) will burn in hell according to his own theology?<br>
<br>
Maybe he should have just said something nice and more inclusive than faking a prayer for those he clearly does not think are saved or &quot;home&quot;...unless by home he meant hell or purgatory for the Jew and any other non-evangelical born again on the shuttle.<br>

<br>
Was Bush expressing his religious views? That was just my point that he was being a hypocrite saying they all went home since he personally believes the Jew is burning in Hell right now. <br>
<br>
And as for political leaders and expressing themselves---yes, they should be more tactful because when they speak as the leader of ALL of us and role model inclusion and unity they should be trying to bring us together. Does a religious person have to express his personal views and quote scripture to do this? No. Does not expressing one's religious views that contradict those of many others at a time of mourning take away from his convictions? Hardly. <br>
<br>
Question for those that are so happy to have a fundie in office who pushes his faith down our throats with our own tax money. Would it be okay with you to have had a Satanic prayer or reference to Allah today? Do you know for a fact that every person that died and their families worship a xian god and read Isiah for inspiration? <br>
<br>
Pretty diverse crew with members from India, Israel, women, people of color, yet xians just can't help feeling if the leader of our country doesn't offer xian scripture and prayer that somehow it's unfair to him...poor Shrub.<br>

So you agree with me about SOCAS where electing Lieberman is concerned but not Bush....or did you mean to say you supported my statement about a woman being elected and don't really support SOCAS and the constitution of the United States? I'm confused.<br>

If I were President, I would have said that I was praying for the families of those who had lost loved ones.  <br>
<br>
I personally think the statement of 7 souls going home was not the best thing he could have said, just because it reminds me of people who are trying to comfort someone who has lost a loved one and says &quot;it was Gods will&quot;  SO what? maybe it was maybe it wasnt but that dont make the hurt go away.  To me it is a thoughtless thing to say, meant to comfort without validating the pain and hurt of the families<br>
<br>
I just had to defend Bush's right to make a statement that included his personal religious expression.  <br>

***** Interestly enough I heard a NY Rabbi on a talk radio program the other day that said there is more support among the Jewish community for a Christian(meaning Bush) who is Pro-Israel than for Jewish man (referring to Lieberman) who is so detached and neutral on Israel.<br>

I can't believe I'm going disagree with you BUT the reason I wouldn't have had a problem with him saying that he and Laura were praying for the families is because the president's job IS 24/7. He is never off duty. We have to accept that he practices a religion (even if I do think he is putting on the cloak of fundieism). However, he should practice disgression.<br>
By saying he and Laura were praying, it would have made it personal and not official, kwim?<br>

They don't end their previous meetings with an explanation about what they are going to pray for or how their religion demands strict observence and they are dutiful practicioners.  I also don't begrudge him the right to express himself in his personal space.  Just like one of my subordinates has a crucifix on her wall and a pic of JC.  A judge can have the decalogue in his chambers, on the wall in a frame he bought (not on my taxes thankyouverymuch) and I take no exception to that.  What I do take exception to is leading the country in his prayer, quoting the scripture inpertinantly his stumbling monologues, and explaining in awful deatil what he is praying, with blatant dichotomy in what he says and what he has always said he believes.  That would be like Heather telling me I was right in how I live my life, I just wouldn't believe it.  Forgive me for thinking I should believe my president when he addresses us as a nation, I must be some kind of wacko idealist or something. <p>DBC67<br>

The majority of people where in an uproar about how Bush won and to top it all off all of Bush's first speeches made him sound like a complete moron. Not that when he speaks now he doesn’t sound like a moron.<br>

<br>
I understand where you are coming from, but can you see the difference that I'm saying as opposed to what he did? <br>

THough, personally, the more I learn about Bush the more he scares the hell out of me. I really thought he was full of shit and was just playing to the fundies. I'm beginning to think I was way wrong on that account. Guy is scary.<br>

And they'll be dusting off excuses for ignoring warning of equipment failures from Challenger too. My dh met the guy who blew the whistle even before Challenger was launched and paid with his career and an equipment f&amp;*(^ up that was probably overlooked or ignored and considered &quot;acceptable risk&quot; was the first thing I thought of Sat morning.<br>
<br>
P.S. I thought Jimmy Carter was born a good Baptist the first time?  Wasn't it his sister that was the born-again preacher??<br>
Anyway--thought Carter lived his faith and was open and out about his deep commitment to god and his religion, he was also highly, highly intelligent and sensitive to others---as evidenced by his post-presidential activities. I just love that guy.<br>

Clinton comforted those after the OK City tragedy, and now Bush has the unfortunate duty of being the comforter to these families after this tragedy.  <br>
<br>
My thought is this...if he is to comfort these families, what would you prefer that he just let them know that their loved ones are all just dead, gone, pfft...that's it, worm food...after all that is the A/A belief, right?  Yep, that would definately comfort me in my grief <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

No, telling them their loved ones are worm food would not be what I would recommend either. Do you really think Candy that this is what atheists/agnostics tell our friends and family members at times of mourning or are you just being a smartass, because I thought you were more intelligent than that.<br>
<br>
There are many, many ways to be of comfort and he can even say he and Laura are praying if that makes him feel better, but giving a sermon and quoting from his bible and telling the families their members are home (and we all know that neither Bush nor you nor Heather believes all 7 of these &quot;souls&quot; are in heaven now don't we) is uncalled for in a public offical....or private for that matter since the point is that he should be of comfort. <br>
