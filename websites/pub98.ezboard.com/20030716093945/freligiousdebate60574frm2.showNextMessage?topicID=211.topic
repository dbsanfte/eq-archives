<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1.‘EC in ER’ Call to Arms</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Rape cannot be prayed out of existence, nor can supernatural forces be relied upon to take care of its consequences. That is why the Institute for Humanist Studies (IHS), joins with New York State Coalition Against Sexual Assault (NYSCASA) and Family Planning Advocates (FPA) to ask the state Senate to pass the “Emergency Contraception in the Emergency Room” bill. <br>
<br>
The bill, S.202, would require all New York hospitals, regardless of religious affiliation, to provide emergency-contraception information and access to rape victims. If used within 72 hours of a sexual assault, emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy in 90 percent of the cases.<br>
<br>
“Too many rape victims have already been faced with violence, have already been victimized and then they go to a hospital to be re-victimized,” said the Hon. Catherine Abate of the New York Health Care Network in a FPA press conference June 4. “Nothing is more unconscionable, inhumane then to tell a rape victim that she cannot receive this kind of help.”<br>
<br>
However, this state’s Catholic Conference says it will not allow its hospitals to deliver emergency-room services it considers immoral, and that includes administering emergency contraceptives.<br>
<br>
Religiously affiliated hospitals are public institutions, receiving government funding to provide secular services. Such hospitals received $40 billion from the government last year. This status makes them subject to legislative regulation. Furthermore, the IHS considers it immoral for religious facilities to stick to church doctrine and deny women, already suffering the trauma of a sexual assault, access to the full range of medical care available. A victim of sexual assault, who may not share the religious convictions of the facility where she is seeking medical attention, should not have the added burden of disinformation and fear of pregnancy placed on her during this traumatic time.<br>
<br>
The New York Assembly approved its version of the bill earlier this year. The Senate version of the bill is stuck in committee. You can help get it out before the session ends on June 19. To send a letter to your senator in support of S.202, visit the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://humaniststudies.org/nylegislation.html?id=1&amp;letter=yes" target="top">IHS Web site</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> or send a letter via e-mail by visiting http://www.senate.state.ny.us/
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2. ‘EC in ER’ Letters Continue</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Institute’s May 20 letter to the editor supporting passage of the “EC in the ER” bill has resulted in a small firestorm of response over the last few weeks.<br>
<br>
Published in the Albany Times Union, the Institute’s letter called for passage of S.202 and outlined the IHS position that religious institutions offering secular services should be held to the same standards and practices as nonreligious institutions. <br>
<br>
So far, the IHS letter has provoked <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.humaniststudies.org/enews/ecletters.html" target="top">seven responses</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. To write your own letter to the editor, send it via e-mail to tuletters@timesunion.com. The TU limits most letters to 250 words.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
So what do you think?  Should secular public institutions be held to a different standard than religious ones?  Should churches be allowed to hide pedophiles and hospitals object to regulated quality of care?  If they don't like the rules, they can always just not take the money...<br>

These hospitals replace formerly secular medical care and are frequently the only medical care available for miles. They deny women the full range of reproductive care, contraception, sterilization, abortion etc. regardless of the women not being Catholic (or even if they are Catholic but not choosing to accept that particularly idiotic doctrine). It's total hypocrisy. Most of the hospitals doctors and nurses at these hospitals are not Catholic anyway.<br>

I don't think they should get a dime of Medicare/Medicaid funding unless they provide the full legal range of reproductive care services. Likewise they should get nothing for caring for the resulting kids, they oughta do it out of the goodness of their ever-lovin' Christian hearts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

It's not like these women can just go to a secular hospital across the street, because chances are the pope's bought that one up too.<br>

How many hospitals does the pope own now anyway?<br>

Edited to add: According to Catholics for Free Choice, about 10% of all non-federal hospitals are property of the pope.<br>

Okay, now I'm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>completely</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> confused. Are you saying that 70% of Catholic hospitals provide the full range of reproductive services (including contraception, sterilization and elective abortion), or that 70% will provide the morning-after pill to a rape victim despite the fact that they believe that constitutes the violent murder of an innocent potential zygote?<br>

A mandate requiring them to provide something that violated the tenent of their faith would be a serious violation of the right to religious freedom.

Tell that to &quot;Rosa.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news_wire/hospitals.html">www.motherjones.com/news_...itals.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
&quot;Pregnant with her sixth baby, &quot;Rosa,&quot; a 36-year-old Hispanic woman, decided enough was enough. Her husband wouldn't have a vasectomy, and other birth control methods either were unreliable, made her feel sick, or required her husband's cooperation. After much soul searching, she decided to be sterilized right after she gave birth -- the easiest time, when it could be done in the same hospital visit. <br>
<br>
She wanted to have her baby with her usual doctor, but that doctor only delivered at St. Louise Hospital in Morgan Hill, Calif. St. Louise was a Catholic hospital, meaning that, in keeping with church opposition to any form of contraception, it didn't perform sterilizations. So Rosa chose a different doctor who delivered at South Valley Hospital, a nonsectarian hospital in nearby Gilroy, a poor, rural, largely Hispanic town. <br>
<br>
But in between that decision and Rosa's delivery, St. Louise bought South Valley Hospital. It closed the old St. Louise and reopened in South Valley's building last December as St. Louise Regional. Rosa had her baby in the new hospital with the new doctor, but the hospital was now Catholic; as a result, despite her decision and her planning, Rosa couldn't have the sterilization procedure. <br>
<br>
Now, she's back on birth control pills. They make her feel sick and she dreads forgetting a pill, but she doesn't have much choice. The nearest hospital that accepts her insurance is about an hour's drive away, in San Jose. With no car, poor bus service, six kids to take care of, and an uncooperative husband, getting the tubal ligation is, for now, a practical impossibility. <br>
<br>
Catholic hospitals, with their commitment to serve the poor, have long played an important role in providing medical services in the United States. But Catholic hospitals and hospital systems are expanding rapidly, riding a growing trend, spurred by cuts in Medicare payments and the growth of HMOs, toward consolidation among the nation's health care providers. That trend has led to an increasing number of small hospitals being either merged or subsumed into chains. When a merger happens in an isolated community, it can leave a Catholic hospital the only game in town, often leaving women with limited or no access to services from sterilization and fertility treatments to abortion.&quot;<br>
<br>
So you see Shirene, the problem is with so many Catholic hospitals now people don't HAVE a choice to &quot;take themselves&quot; somewhere reasonable. <br>

<br>
Secular hospitals do make it on their own, but most hospitals have a religious affiliation.  Also, if the religious hospitals that refuse to provide the full range of healthcare would stop taking govt funds, then there would be more funds for the secular hospitals to use.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you choose to take yourself to a Religious institution, you must be willing to abide by their rules and regulations.&quot;<br>
<br>
There isn't always a choice in the matter, as DL's link showed above.  Besides, is the church in this to help people, or to push their religion on people in a time of need.  A hospital shouldn't be considered a religious institution, it is supposed to be a place to help all.  If someone wants a religious institution, then that is what church is for. <br>
<br>
&quot;I worked for a Catholic healthcare company for 5 years, they did not pay for my bc pills. BUT it was my choice to work there. I had marketable skills and I could have found a job elsewhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
Most companies don't pay for bc.  That is a whole seperate debate in itself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its not like the morning after pill can only be obtained in an emergency room. Planned parenthood or a regular physicians office can provide it for those who are interested and I am sure that the Hospital social workers can and do provide the information for those who are seeking it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not everybody knows this.  There are people who have never heard of the Morning After pill, and it is up to hospital workers to educate patients about things they do not know about.  I never heard of albuterol before my son suffered his first bout of bronchiolitis, but fortunately his doctors had the good sense to step up and prescribe it.  Also, hospital social workers will not provide the info if the hospital is against it.  If they were willing to provide the info, then this wouldn't be a problem.  These hospitals place religious rules above helping people.<br>
<br>
&quot;A mandate requiring them to provide something that violated the tenent of their faith would be a serious violation of the right to religious freedom.&quot; <br>
<br>
If they don't like the rules, then they need to get out of the healthcare business.  They aren't being forced to run these hospitals.  When it comes to people's lives, healthcare workers should not have the option to pick and choose.  You are either in it for the long haul, or you need to get out of the business.  Healthcare workers need to have the best interest of their patients at heart.  Nobody is telling them that they need to violate their religious freedom, but we are telling them that if they choose to enter certain fields of work, then they need to do their job to full capacity.<br>

The difference IS choice.  a person who chooses to have unprotected sex also chooses the risk of pregnancy.  A person who is raped does not have that choice and therefore God knowing the emotional impact that a pregancy caused by rape can have on a woman, has allowed for an exception. Sounds logical to me. <br>
<br>
My church allows for abortions in instances of rape, incest, and when the Mothers life is in serious jepardy, or the baby has an illness where it would not survive beyond birth.  We are encourage to make a prayerful decision and to counsel with our local bishop when making such a serious decision.<br>
<br>
As far as social workers in the ER's they are state licensed and should in every situation inform the person of their options, including the morning after pill, THAT is not a violation of religious beliefs, but forcing them to provide it is.<br>
<br>
I have to admit I am suprised that a community would not have ONE secular hospital.  Here is Salt Lake we dont have any that are religiously affliated and we have 9 hospitals in Salt Lake alone. And probably 8 more in a 50 mile radius.  There are 3 that used to be owned by LDS, Catholic and another religious group but now they are owned by nonprofit non religious groups or for profit companies.  But they can still go to planned parenthood or a secular clinic. -- Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doublelatte>Double Latte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Milk?</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/11/03 10:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Church hospitals and hypocrisy</span><hr size=1> First of all, look at all the pregnancies that happen because of contraceptive failure.

I think any woman who did not CHOOSE to become pregnant (regardless of whether she chose sex, or chose contraception) should be allowed to continue or not as she sees fit. I know we don't agree on that point and I don't expect to change your mind.<br>

Second, with 9 hospitals in your community NO WONDER you think it's so easy to just choose a different one. Think outside of your little world Shirene. My community has ONE hospital.

A girl gets raped and beaten, and is taken into the emergency ward.  Since she is unconscious at the time that she is picked up by the ambulance, they rush her to the nearest hospital, which happens to be a religiously affiliated hospital, who condemns the use of contraceptives.  Her religious background is not the same as the religious background of the institution and does permit the use of contraceptives.  Based on her first amendment rights, she should have access to the medication.  Her injuries are quite severe, and she does not regain consciousness until 65 hours after conception.  The medication is usually only reliable up to about 72 hours after conception, thus she has about 7 hours to have the medication administered.  Seven hours may seem like a long time, but after she becomes fully aware of the situation, and the fact that she can't get the medication, there may be 2 or 3 hours left.(Doctors can often take awhile to get around to you)  She no longer has the time to go to a hospital who will give her the required medication, and thus because the hospital enforced their own beliefs upon the victim, she delivers a child that she is not able to properly care for.  The child grows up neglected and abused, and goes out and rapes another poor young girl.  The cycle repeats itself...<br>
<br>
People keep getting caught up in the supposed violation of the institutions right for freedom of religion, and thus forget about the rights of the victim.  <br>
<br>
I am over 21 years old, thus I have the right to drink.  I have a valid license, thus I have the right to drive.  However, I do not have the right to both drink and drive, because it would violate the rights of the other motorists on the road.  Doctors have the right to practice medicine.(As granted by their medical degrees)  They also have the right to practice religion.(As granted by the 1st amendment)  But the moment that the simultaneous exercise of those rights infringes upon the rights of others, they no longer have the right to exercise that combination of rights. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaia25>Gaia25</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/12/03 7:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hospitals</span><hr size=1> I can't believe the amount of hospitals you guys have over there!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Phoenix, I agree with your overall point, that hospitals should not foist religious dogma on patients. But it occurred to me that even after the 72 hours were up, the victim could still have chosen abortion up to something like 24 weeks. Let's say she was hospitalized that whole time - even then she still could have put the child up for adoption. <br>
<br>
So by making her wait, they would have forced her into harder situations (D&amp;C versus morning after pill; giving a child away versus raising a child) but she would still had some choices.<br>

So it’s all about choice? Well then it is still her fault she got raped. After all she made the choice to go out of the house that morning, she made the choice to walk down that alley, she made the choice to where that skirt, she made the choice to sleep with her window open. Hmm she must not have been praying hard enough because god didn’t help make very good choices.<br>

If he knows everything then why wouldn’t he want her to go through this part in her life, why wouldn’t he want her to have the baby that she made some choices that she could have changed? Wouldn’t this just be another test? After all if she had made some different choices it wouldn’t have happened right?<br>

It's also worth noting that a hospital need not be owned outright by a religious organization to be prey to dogmatic interference in medical matters.

The incident was the most visible consequence of the merger, which has been opposed by many residents of the Manchester community. The physician said his patient, who had a history of miscarriage, needed the emergency abortion when her water broke at 14 weeks of a wanted pregnancy.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
Do you know about the severe mental trauma that can come with having an abortion?  Even in the situation where a person is raped, a mother who has an abortion rarely walks away from the process as mentally healthy as before the proceedure.  This is because the body has already begun releasing certain chemicals that create the strong maternal bond.  <br>
<br>
As far as adoption,(which I encourage over abortion in non-rape related cases) you again have that maternal bond issue.  Listen to the song &quot;He would be 16&quot; by Michelle Wright.  You may then have a better understanding what is likely to occur if the mother can break the maternal bond long enough to put her child up for adoption. In most cases that bond is too strong, resulting in a mother who is not well equipped to raise a child, but who will raise it because they believe that it is not a sign of love to give the child to someone who is better suited to the job of mother.<br>
<br>
It is just my opinion, but I believe that rape victims suffer enough mental trauma from the incident that they should not need to face these additional traumas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=213.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=213.topic&start=41&stop=41>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=213.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=213.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=213.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=213.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.threadControl?topicID=213.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=213.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=213.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="religiousdebate60574frm2">Debate Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm10">Christianity Discussions (G Rated)<option value="religiousdebate60574frm1">Announcements<option value="religiousdebate60574frm11">Test Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm5">Help Files</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574>religiousdebate</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2>Debate Forum</a> <font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
