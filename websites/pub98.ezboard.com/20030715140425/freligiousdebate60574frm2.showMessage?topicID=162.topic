They're protesting on a high traffic bridge during rush hour.  By doing this, they're infringing on other people's right to drive home.  At one point they rushed the police officers, injuring one.  One of the protesters made a statement along the lines of, we want to inconvenience people and cause problems, so that we'll be noticed!  <br>
<br>
Does this really do anything besides make people angry?  A couple months ago in Seattle, some protesters (maybe 15 people) stopped their cars simultaniously on the 520/floating bridge during rush hour.  They suspended themselves above the bridge and protested the war.  They were just causing problems for people!  One guy who was stopped just behind the protestors said....&quot;I agree with you!  Now get out of the way so I can get home!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I've always tried to remember the adage...&quot;my rights end where your rights begin&quot;...  why is it that people think it's okay to cause civil disobedience just to protest something that they really have no control over?  I don't get it. <p>-Misty<br>

I have the right to say whatever I want, but I don't have the right to stop someone and make them listen.<br>
<br>
I think the 'civil disobedience' we see is coming from the fact that the protestors feel that their opinions/concerns have been completely disregarded - and they have.  It's been stated by the administration that they don't care what the protestors think, they are going to do what they want.<br>
<br>
I think it's counter productive, and if I was stuck in traffic trying to get home, I'd get seriously pissed off.  And unfortunately it really does nothing for their cause. <br>
<br>
But on the other hand, I think it is sad that this group now feels that they have to go to such extremes in order to have their voices heard - or to get media time.   If reporting was so &quot;fair and unbiased&quot; it would spending as much time examing the case against as the case for war.<br>

We have the right to gather peacefully but that isn't peaceful. They are infringing on the rights of others. And while I feel for them for feeling their voices haven't been heard, this is only going to make matters worse. I find the fact that they have harmed police officers horrifying. Its things like that that cause things to get out of control. <br>
<br>
And if I were one of the ones stuck, I would be very pissed. Especially as I usually have my children in the car with me and being stuck in traffic is one thing that pisses my babies off. The car is fine if its moving, but not so fine stopped. <br>
<br>
There are more constructive ways to get their point across. A legal peaceful peace march. Letters to the editor, to their congressperson, to the president. Signs on their car or in their yard. It is unlikely they will change anyone's mind about it, but that will allow their voices to be heard, and it wouldn't infringe on other's rights plus it does not have the possible reprocushions what they are currently doing has.<br>

Hardly an unbiased poll.<br>
<br>
I can say that the anti-war protestors did not get the media attention <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>prior</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to the decision to go in with a straight face.  Come on, can you with a straight face say that there was in-depth examination of their peaceful protests and issues.

<br>
My feeling on this are tainted by my belief that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>real</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> journalism has been destroyed by the media moguls - as CNN, FOX et al become bigger and flashier they are spending money on catchy graphics and people to spout their opinions, not on reporting the news.  Bill O'Reilly, Cavuto, Greta VanFaceLift, and puleeeeeeez - Geraldo Rivera providing deep indepth coverage.  My ass.<br>
<br>
People need to turn off the news and turn on C-Span and see what is really happening in this country, as we are all glued to &quot;shock and awe&quot; the budget is getting pushed through the house with frightening speed.  As they put forth and pass a resolution to support our troops, the budget takes away $15B in veterans benefits for the same troops over the next 10 years - when they are going to need it the most.  Yeah - support our troops, take away their benefits.<br>

I think depends on what state you live in. Here in Washington we have a huge military presence (we have several bases). Although there hasn’t been as much coverage of the Pro-military and pro-bush demonstrators we have had quite a bit of media coverage on the their side. One channel even had a reporter stationed in one of our heavily military populated cities and covered their reactions all day.<br>
