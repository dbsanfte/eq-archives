I just thought the term terrorism was a bit strong and misapplied.  The lovely state of MO declared war on the Mormons when Gov Boggs signed the Extermination Order.  It is not unreasonable to assume that those people involved in the attack feared that the Missourians and OK'ites posed  a very real future threat to the safety and sanctity of the newly settled Utah.  I think they were wrong and innocent people were murdered as a result of that irrational fear, but the word terrorism implies a whole different ball game.  <br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, I dont feel any guilt by association.  I just resent the implication that the LDS church had anything to do with &quot;terrorism&quot;.   (that just encourages religious intolerance) Like innocent Muslims who are looked at differently since 9/11.  When the actions of a few are equated with the intentions of the masses, that is an unfair generalization of religious beliefs or religion in general.<br>
<br>
While looking at all the &quot;evil&quot; that has come from religion, and saying we'd be better off without religion, you need to balance all the good that comes from religion and religious humanitarian efforts.   And theists dont have the corner on bad history.

<br>
No. Nor is it unreasonable to assume that Timothy McVeigh felt that there was a very real threat to the U.S. and that a race war or some other great injustice was upon us that would have consequences out of the &quot;Turner Diaries&quot; (not unlike those end of times books so popular now that may be leading zealots to dangerous actions). Were the Mormons feeling attacked? Yes. Was there perhaps good reason or signs that this was true? Yes. <br>
<br>
BTW--the analogy to Native Americans is interesting since they WERE HERE FIRST and it was their land taken away in a very different scenario than what you speak of and African American slaves were treated even more poorly.  I understand Mormons suffered in the &quot;Mormon Wars&quot; and agree about polygamy (which atheists don't generally oppose anyway), but LDS simply cannot claim the same level of persecution as Jews, Native Americans and African Americans and I find the persecution complex rather distasteful. Women have been property and abused far longer in history than LDS have even existed and I'm not throwing a pity party over it or claiming it creates an environment in which terrorism or &quot;acts of war&quot; are okay.<br>

<br>
The thrust of my original post was about JS, not the Massacre--but I am happy to continue it. And for the record, as DBC points out quite well, it is not atheists promoting religious intolerance, rather theists on theists as each claims to have the &quot;one truth&quot; and believes his or her beliefs are superior and ordained by a perfect being. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Try China, Cuba, USSR great examples of how a non-theist countries are so much more evolved .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Excellent point (although most people in these countries are not strong atheists and continue to practice and believe under these regimes). The real point is that putting god in government does NOTHING to promote peace, tolerance or justice. If there's no difference doesn't that make you wonder why bother with the dogmas that promote division and intolerance on top of things like nationalism and racism (which is where the nastiness of China, USSR, Cuba, and other totalitarian governments really comes in)??<br>

Not between civilians in an unorganized vigilante mob.  (Please forgive my post not addressing your Q b/c I was posting at the same time as you.)<br>
<br>
I am not saying that you condone the action, nor am I saying you feel persecuted personally.  As an atheist I feel prejudice all the time, I just don't happen to care about it.  I am sure that any line of differentiation between people, race, religion, orientation, height, weight, hairline, anything at all, will be an object of some derogatory opinion to one degree or another by a group against a nonconforming person.  <br>
<br>
Kind of like me telling you the water is on in the kitchen and you telling me you closed the refridgerator door, we are at cross purposes here.  We're both in the kitchen, but not on the topic.  What I am saying is that at the root, this occurs because religion is present.  Two equally wrong ideas have no resolution between them.  They cannot disprove you without disproving themselves.  They cannot tolerate or accept you without invalidating themselves.  All that is left is fear, hatred and massacres.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I don't have to balance any good that religion does against the bad it does.  I only have to balance the good it does that couldn't be secularly achieved.  We build secular hospitals, we have secular charities and mission work that doesn't erode culture by faith sublimation.  We have elder care, battered shelters and dependancy programs that are all secular and do every bit as much good as faiths do (more in my opinion).  What faith has that secular areas don't is the unsubstantiated claim to an afterlife or damnation of some type.  All the worldly works were acomplished by mankind and can be done secularly.<br>
<br>
All things being equal, I'd rather not castrate myself. <p>DBC67<br>

My personal belief is, I guess we will all find out when we are dead. It is just such a bizarre idea to me to spend my whole life living for what is going to happen to me when I die. What is the point of living? Wouldn’t you instantly have all the knowledge you needed when you met god? So what would be the point of having a lifetime of knowledge?<br>

<br>
Just to repeat my recurring theme, you can prove yourself right if you're backing the right thing with facts and evidence.  I do not think everyone has 'parts of the truth' and I believe masses of people can be wrong.  I don't think anyone is going to hell, or heaven for that matter.  There is no evidence either of those places exist.  I think those fundies who obsess over their own righteousness and your inadequacy are in hell right here already.  <br>
<br>
What you are is a very nice lady.  You don’t want others to be left out or excluded, so you incorporate a way into your beliefs to save them.  Because your theology is as wrong and fallaciously based as theirs, however, you can no more prove yourself right than they can.<br>
<br>
Who is right?  Agnostics, Atheists and Deists.<br>
<br>
Why?  They either cannot be disproven or are supported by the facts.  Everyone else (except maybe Buddhists) is in breach of material facts to the contrary.<br>
<br>
The result is that they have a vested interest in you being proven wrong or their beliefs are rendered invalid.  This is the mechanism of all religious persecution.  It may be to oppress you and steal your goods, or convert you and increase their ranks, or just plain old kill you, but that is the mechanism by which they devalue your rights to accomplish their ends.<br>

So I find it very hard to believe that I would end up in hell or God himself would be a lier.  See the problem with mormons is they are using the BOM to base their faith on.  Thats where you get in trouble. JS twists the bible and they believe what he says instead of reading just the bible for themselves.  Lots of religions add tradition to the bible.  That could be a big mistake!  If I follow the bible and the bible only I cant be wrong.  I may have a different opinions on speaking in tounges but that has no bearing on my salvation which is clear in the scripture.<br>
<br>
Col 2:6-10  As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:  Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thaksgiving.  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.  for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.<br>

<br>
Also we base our beliefs on continuing revelation not just the Bible or the BoM.  God himself in Amos (3:7)says that he will do nothing without revealing himself to his servants the prophets.  At least the leaders of my church CLAIM divine inspiration.  Whoever came up with your faiths interpretations of the bible dont even claim that.<br>
<br>
If the bible is so clear,why are there 1000's of different interpretations/opinions on what it says.<br>
<br>
And just FYI I base my understanding on the Bible from what I have read personally, as well as what I personally have read in the BoM, D&amp;C, Pearl and Great Price AND have pondered and prayed to know God's will.  So I am not the one who is blindly following someone else's understanding of what the bible means.<br>
<br>
EX. who came up with the Trinty?  Priests at swordpoint under direction of Constantine. (not exactly divine inspiration)<br>
<br>
Who came up with Salvation by grace alone when scriputure after scripture states that other work on our part is also required?  (oh I forgot, you conveniently ignore those passages or shrug them off as only applying to Jewish people) Why dont you do a little research on your own faiths/doctrines history before calling the kettle black.<br>
Early Christianity looks more like my doctrine than yours.<br>
