<br>
Were they still watching him? Tracking him? Listening to him? Amusing themselves with him? Waiting to decide whether or not to kill him? <br>
<br>
Let them.<br>
<br>
At least he now knew who was responsible for this condition.<br>
Crowley asked Blackmore if the Seneschal had felt the presence of the tracking device made him a security risk. The Seneschal had all but dismissed the matter, politely asked if Crowley had any ideas regarding the nature of the individuals involved in the planting of the device, and then asked for an update on the ghoul underworld investigation.<br>
<br>
When Crowley had attended Populace earlier in the evening, neither the Prince nor the new Keeper had expressed concern regarding the matter. One would think having Kindred in their Elysium with a tracking device and an explosive in the back of his head would make them nervous. <br>
<br>
Crowley had also encountered both the Sheriff and Scourge during the night. Neither of them had so much as mentioned the matter.<br>
<br>
It was disappointing, although not surprising. Such actions were the kind of petty, malicious and ultimately counter-productive acts that had seemed common when Nikke Black was Prince of the city. Even after Crowley’s return to the city and the death of Kaergon Roche, he still had high hopes that those dark days had been put behind them. Now, it appeared the new regime intended to follow in the footsteps of its infamous predecessor.<br>
<br>
Very well, then. That was fine. Irrelevant, really. Nothing he should concern himself with. <br>
<br>
Fine. Really.<br>
<br>
Crowley’s hand lashed out and smashed a Rolodex on his office desk. The bits of plastic were not sharp enough to penetrate his dense flesh, but they did clutter his work area, and this irritated him further.<br>
<br>
Absolutely fine.<br>
<br>
What had that new Malkavian, Miara, been trying to tell him? What had she hoped to accomplish? Trying to get him to remember a time he had been &quot;happy&quot;? A time when he had last experienced &quot;joy&quot;? <br>
<br>
The sounds flooded back to Crowley’s ears…<br>
<br>
Christmas, 1961. The Crowley household in the state of New York. For most families, &quot;chestnuts roasting on an open fire&quot; were merely an expression. An 11-year old Steven laughing, opening his presents. There was a train set, a Daniel Boone costume complete with a BB gun and a beautiful, hand carved toboggan. Loving, doting parents, so proud of their son. There was snow on the ground. Steven had taken his brand new toboggan and gone sledding. He remembered falling off at the bottom of the hill. Lying in the snow, laughing. He had never been happier. He couldn’t remember a time that he’d been happy since.<br>
<br>
More than four decades. An eye-blink compared to many Kindred, but more than three-quarters of Crowley’s life. <br>
<br>
Crowley shook himself out of it. That was the past. With it came so much pain that the joy of that moment seemed almost an aberration. His Sire may have taught him to value history, and Crowley did. But there was a part of Crowley that had learned since long before his Embrace; there were some things you just didn’t look back on.<br>
<br>
Happiness? What a ridiculous, absurd, outdated concept. They were Kindred! Their lives, or what was left of them, were no more than brief moments of pleasure or contentment mixed with what was an eternal struggle, be it political or otherwise. Oh, Kindred might receive great power with their Embrace, but all that did was put them in another level of competition – an entirely higher level of competition which was destined to last until they turned to ash. <br>
What need did Crowley have for such a thing?<br>
<br>
Damned Malkavians!<br>
Damn them for forcing him to remember!<br>
<br>
Crowley hit the auto-dial #3 option on his cell phone. <br>
&quot;Evening, Andrews. This is Mr. Crowley. Have you made the arrangements we discussed? Excellent. I will expect you in ten minutes. Good bye.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fifteen minutes later, Crowley licked up the puncture wounds in Andrews’ neck. This time, there was no surprise when he heard the voice coming from the gun. <br>
<br>
&quot;Let me see if I understand you, Crowley.&quot; The voice of Kaergon Roche said. &quot;You summoned me, forced me to cross the border between life and death to contact you simply because… you felt unhappy?&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley stood up and approached the gun mounted on the wall.<br>
&quot;No, sir. I wanted to speak with you because I am still at a crossroads.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley sat down at his desk and dropped the gun on the table.<br>
&quot;Crowley, your situation is simple, and not any different from when Jason Black was here..&quot; Kaergon answered. &quot;It works like this; they can take you at any time, at their leisure, the moment they feel its in their best interests to do so.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley thought about this for a moment and grimaced. &quot;Hardly a pleasant thought.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, its not. But it’s the hand you’ve been dealt.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose it would’ve been impertinent to have expected a fair one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, it would’ve.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And so the reason why I’m pressing forward is why? Because you’ve made me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Crowley. The reason why you are pressing forward is because you made yourself press forward. I’m here to try and give you a sense of direction.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then why do I bother?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because, Crowley, its not too late to set yourself on a path that will lead to authority. And if you achieve that, then one day you can help make the decisions about who has explosive tracking devices embedded in their skulls.&quot;<br>
Crowley thought about it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes… but is that what I really want?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Want what? The power?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly, Mr. Roche.&quot; Crowley answered. &quot;I know seeking authority is both the right and duty of our Clan, but since I’ve entered this city, it seems all I’ve witnessed are gross abuses of that authority. Nikke Black was a tyrant who used her position as a cover for her Diablerist activities. Marie believes the solution to her problems is to track and humiliate those she distrusts. When you were Prince, Jason Black returned to the city and destroyed his enemies, flaunting his authority as an Alastor. Is there any doubt to the Kine adage ‘Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely’?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I pointed out before Crowley, we, the Populace of Santa Carla, corrected the problem with Nikke Black. And Jason Black reminded us all that sometimes the price of doing our duty is great, indeed.&quot; <br>
&quot;As for Marie, I know it’s a small comfort to you, but keep in mind; she’s a new Prince who recently had a Justicar visit her city and accuse a number of her people of breaching the 6th Tradition on a previous Prince. She knows Jason Black is still watching, and will make his presence known if he sees anything that displeases him. As a result, she needs to be hard on you, at least for now. Give her some time, make yourself useful to her, and you will find yourself in her good graces.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The point, Crowley, is that these problems have a way of correcting themselves, albeit rarely cleanly. There is a reason why Elders rarely openly flaunt their power; its because the world eventually turns on those that do that. So instead they retreat into the background, and work behind the scenes.&quot; <br>
Crowley nodded slowly to himself. &quot;But how do I know that its worth it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can show you its worth it at any time, Crowley. Just close your eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley obeyed Roche’s instructions. Once more, the light blinded him, but it also brought him a certain warmth – a warmth that reminded him of that final Christmas. Still, there was no happiness; simply a renewed feeling of strength. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you realize what this light is? It’s a taste, Crowley. A gift, you might say. Something you’ve been given to keep you motivated. Try this; open your eyes, and then close them again.&quot; <br>
<br>
Crowley did as he was told. This time, he felt almost totally immersed in darkness. Almost, aside from a small point of light in the distance; little more than a star in the night’s sky.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where am I, sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Think of this as a tunnel, Crowley. You’ve just walked through one end. That point of light you see in the distance? That’s the other end. That’s where your going, if you can make it there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It looks a long way off.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have a long way to go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you know I won’t trip.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don’t. I’m here because I lack anything better to do with my afterlife.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you understand something of the journey you’ve undertaken.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One last question, sir.&quot; Crowley said. &quot;You know why I wanted to speak with you this evening. You’ve shown me this tunnel… with the light at the end. Do you mean to say… that at the end of the tunnel… I will receive happiness?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Crowley. I showed you the tunnel with the light at the end to show you the journey you have ahead of you. Happiness is something some of us choose to pick up along the way, if we allow ourselves to do so. If you want guidance along your journey, Crowley, well… my schedule appears to be open for some time.&quot; <br>
Crowley could detect a faint chuckle emanating from the gun’s barrel. &quot;If its happiness you’re seeking… that you will need to find on your own. Remember, Crowley, you started this journey because there was some part of you that wanted a greater legacy than to be found headless at your desk, a disgraced and broken Ventrue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will tell you this, however. Our memories are a part of us. A lifetime or two ago, I played a part in some of the most heinous acts in history. I spent much of my Kindred life trying to atone for those acts, which was one of the primary reasons I had to oppose Nikke. Having idly followed the orders of one despot’s insane orders, I could not repeat that experience. For this, I paid the ultimate price.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your problem is different, Crowley. But don’t bother trying to run from it. It defines you as do your other experiences. It shapes you, and no one can doubt it influences the paths we take. How it influences you, Crowley, is up to you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Once again, Crowley was alone.<br>
<br>
He put the gun back on its display and looked out the window. This was Santa Carla, not the upstate New York suburban town of his childhood. It never snowed here, and regardless, it was far too late for Christmas. <br>
<br>
The events that followed that last, happy day had defined him, he knew. They had driven him to succeed, driven him to achieve wealth and power, driven him to his Sire’s Embrace and beyond.<br>
But perhaps the life he had lived before, the boy he had been, opening his presents on Christmas morning, perhaps that was something that could be drawn on as well. <br>
<br>
&quot;Andrews, wake up.&quot; Crowley spent the next five minutes looking his young employee in the eye, and explaining to him how he had enjoyed a wonderful night partying at the local night clubs. This would all become clear to him after he went home; &quot;and please, take the day off tomorrow; you’ve earned it&quot;. At some point, he would have to take advantage of Sebastian’s connections. For now, however, he had bigger fish to fry. The young broker left. <br>
So where did he go from here?<br>
<br>
Crowley thought for a moment, and then smiled. He picked up his phone and started to dial, but turned his head and looked again at the gun.<br>
<br>
He closed his eyes again. <br>
<br>
Somehow, the light at the end of the tunnel seemed just a little big bigger now. <br>
