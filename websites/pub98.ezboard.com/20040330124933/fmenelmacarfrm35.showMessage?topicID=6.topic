Studies in Achieving Transcendental Illumination From Within the Confines of the System<br>

<br>
You are a slave. A peasant. A machine. A robot designed for a sole purpose. You are a self-perpetuating societal construct of self-destruction. You have no free thought, and nothing you do escapes the clutches of the Robot.<br>
<br>
This is not how it should be, it is how it is. Society, -soviety-, is a self-destructive mechanism based on destruction of the individual. It is an enforced rule of law, &quot;Do as they wilt shall be the whole of the law.&quot; You are a number in the system. This is indisputable, it is fact. It is impossible to break free of the system. Life requires it, breaking free results in destruction. An ultimate paradigm.<br>
<br>
Remember who you are. You are you. Know thyself! Just because you cannot escape the robot, does not mean you should become one with the robot! It means you should transcendentally ascend through the robot, becoming above the system, while remaining within...is this possible? Humans have dug themselves into a horribly deep pit. Society is the noose, and humans took the jump. <br>
<br>
Now I'm not saying Society is bad, no more than I'm saying you are bad. I'm saying bad is bad. Bad is a concept. Bad is a self-destruct button. Bad is the opposite of good, and good is bad. Both good and bad are concepts of the human mind, and while all concepts are not bad, some are restrictive to full human interaction. For instance, the concepts of good and bad automatically label all actions of serving the majority good, and all actions of serving oneself bad… this is ultimately communist, and anti-individualist, which is therefore inherently unjust…<br>
<br>
However, there is quite a bit of irony in my statement. The human language, in fact, the human experience, is inherently bipolar. Good and Evil, Love and Hate, Beautiful and Ugly, Fragrant and Reeking, and so on and so on. The effect is a limitation of human consciousness. And limiting the human consciousness, is the ultimate evil… even now I demonstrate how limited it is. Human language is incapable of properly describing human affairs on a metaphysical level, however, it is the only means, besides telepathy, of communication of thoughts.<br>
<br>
No man is an island. A man can be a peninsula, however, or a coast. The secret to achieving reality is, of course, individuality. Know thyself! But it is necessary to discuss what individuality isn’t. Many people make many assumptions about what individuality means. Aloneness, bucking society, escaping the machine, finding the “inner self”… however, all these things are wrong. For me. For you, they could be right. That’s the secret. Individuality is individual.<br>
<br>
However, one should not assume automatically that what one likes is right. One mans trip is one mans trip. It’s also every other mans trip. “Reality is that which doesn’t go away when you stop believing in it.” That’s Niels Bohr. He was a famous physicist. He invented a model of the atom that is only one step away of the one we currently use. He was an individual. No one else was Niels Bohr, maybe by name, sure. Maybe by profession, sure. But no one else was Niels Bohr, nor will anyone else be Niels Bohr. Niels Bohr is Niels Bohr. He thought, therefore, he was. He was Niels Bohr.<br>
<br>
You are not Niels Bohr. That makes you someone else. Someone different. But you’re a human. You eat like Niels, drink like Niels, brush your teeth like Niels, and put on shoes, using the same tying technique, as Niels. Still, you are not Niels Bohr. I’m not Niels Bohr either. Nobody except Niels Bohr is, was, or ever shall be Niels Bohr.<br>
<br>
Why is this? Is it because Niels Bohr invented the most common and correct model of the Atom? Sure, that’s part of it. But Niels enjoyed long walks in the park, contemplating the nature of reality. Do you? Maybe so. But there are some things Niels liked or didn’t like that you don’t like or don’t not like. Hmmm, there’s a double negative. Guess what? My individual self is saying that’s OK.<br>
<br>
So now we have determined you are not Niels Bohr. Are you Abe Lincoln? Repeat the process. He had to make an Emancipation Proclamation in order to avoid getting in trouble for making war on a bunch of States that decided they wanted to be different from the US. Did you? Probably not. So you’re not Abe Lincoln. <br>
<br>
OK, are you George Washington? He was a big tall guy who ran the most powerful country on Earth back before it was the most powerful country on Earth. You’re more than likely not him either. So who are you? And here, I say it bluntly, KNOW THYSELF!<br>
<br>
That is the first step towards transcending the Robot and becoming illuminated. Let’s return to that quote by the person you aren’t. “Reality is that which does not go away when you stop believing in it.” So Reality is not relative, Reality is Real. Why is that? Why aren’t all those people who say reality is subjective right? Well, simple. When those planes flew into those towers on 11 September in the Year of our Lord 2001, they smashed into them for everyone. Now, some would argue “but the people in Ubersheissestekistan with no TV and no outside contact with the world never experienced it!”…but they WOULD experience it, if you brought them into the world…<br>
<br>
This reinforces the point, you do not know everything. Neither do Niels Bohr, Abe Lincoln, or George Washington. Nor does Mary Jane Foster, the housekeeper, who is at this moment cleaning the closet in the estate of one Sir James von Trapp Esq. In a country in Europe, and fussing about how he always leaves his clothes in a pile on the floor instead of hanging them up on hooks and using the proper clothes covers.<br>
<br>
At any moment, you could learn something you didn’t know. But other people knew it. Even now as your read this, I’ve read this paper. It exists, I assure you, but you don’t know what I’m going to say 3 paragraphs from now. But it’s not relative, what you think I may say in the next EWIGE BLUMENKRAFT UND EWIGE SLASCHENKRAFT!<br>
<br>
Point delivered, verdict rests, your honor.<br>
<br>
And now for something completely different.<br>
<br>
We have now established that you are an individual. So why haven’t I suggested you run off into the woods to clear your soul and become some happy nomad folk, “living deliberately” off the land and taking only what you need, like Thoreau does in Walden? Because if I were to suggest that I’d be telling you to run off into the woods, start a camp fire, be arrested by a Fire Marshall or Game Warden or Park Ranger, defined as a vagrant and moved to a welfare community to live the rest of your life as a hobo in a shack with a 24 dollar a year income. That’s not a very wise thing to do, and I wouldn’t do it either.<br>
<br>
So then, how can you become an individual in a society where individuality is persecuted? Simple. Non Serviam! Society restricts your actions, but it does not restrict your thoughts. It restricts how you can harm others, but it doesn’t restrict the clothes you wear. Think about it. How many pairs of clothes do you own? How many do you need? How many do you want? Ok, all that’s fine! Needing, and Wanting, is all something that makes you individual! Remember, all people are fundamentally are memories and experiences. <br>
<br>
Ok, so the real question: How many of those clothes do you like because someone else likes it? Do you like blue super hero megaman because he has nun chukka and you like nun chukka, or do you like blue super hero megaman because your buddy does too? It’s time to come to terms with something, Capitalism, while superior to Communism, is still very restrictive. Basically, you have no free will. You buy things because popular culture makes you think subconsciously that you want to buy things. And popular culture makes you think you want to buy things because companies and industries make popular culture (i.e. everyone else) want to make it look REALLY COOL to have a brand new insert random product here.<br>
<br>
This is NOT A BAD THING. (Return to 4th paragraph, and NOTA BENE!) All this is good. UBI EST SUB UBI!? As I was saying, all this is good. There is no need to take action against it. The only thing you need to do to be one step closer to transcendental illumination is realize what it’s attempting to do. Realize the intent. And if you realize that the individual that is you does not need, or really want, the object or sensation or whatever, but rather, is being told it wants the object or sensation (which exists whether you think so or not), remember the principle that covers all acts of the individual: <br>
<br>
NON SERVIAM! Literally, “I will not serve!”<br>
<br>
Those two words are the ultimate in individualistic utterances. Those two words tell all around you, rather obliquely, and except in the presence of those who know Latin, probably not without explanation, but none the less, that you will not do what society tells you to do. You are your own self. You are not Niels Bohr, Abe Lincoln, George Washingon, Mary Jane Foster, or Sir James von Trapp Esq. Who has now fired Mary Jane Foster after finding her slacking on the job. She began yelling at him for leaving his clothes in a heap, saying “Nobody else leaves their clothes in a heap because it’s not clean! It’s disorganized!” and Sir James von Trapp Esq., who was familiar with Latin, as a lawyer, said “NON SERVIAM!” and in that instant, he was Illuminated.<br>
<br>
Sir James von Trapp Esq., successfully realized that he was his own self, he could leave his clothes how he pleased, and while he’s now down a housekeeper, he doesn’t care. He shrugs, picks up the phone book, and in the immortal words of the United States Army, “suck it up and drive on!” The shrug is quite possibly the most definitive of all human interactions. The shrug, in all it’s complexities, encompasses the most important statement of all. He does not care that he’s down a servant. He’s taking what he deserved for acting the individual. He met the repercussions, and said to fate itself, “NON SERVIAM!” And fate had no hold over him.<br>
<br>
Take things in stride. You can only be made sad by what saddens you. You can only be made mad by what maddens you. And you can, in effect, master yourself, by simply saying “NON SERVIAM!” when you’re downed. Society hates that. Bureaucracy hates that. You’re mastering yourself, instead of being mastered by society. And that, in effect, in Reality, is Transcendental Illumination. Open your eyes and see what non-accepting acceptance has to offer. Or don’t. Non Serviam.<br>
