<br>
I'm perfectly happy to hear what non-believers have to say.. just not in a worship service. <br>
<br>
&lt;Why do you only want to hear what the televangelist has to say? What is it exactly that bothers you about non-believers speaking?&gt; <br>
<br>
I, personally, don't care what any televangelist has to say, but I know many home bound people that use them as their &quot;church&quot;. The case in point was Robert Schuller. That he would open his pulpit to non-believers is tantamount to putting a false teacher, or an idol, in a place of worship.<br>
<br>
As I said, I do not, at all, in anyway, have a problem with a non-believer speaking.. just NOT in a church service that is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>suppose</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be to the Glory of God.<br>
<br>
Frankly, it's been years since I've seen any of Robert Schuller, but the few I DID see, he usually just schmoozed with them.. all friendly. Which is fine over coffee, but NOT in a worship service. GOOD GRIEF! Can you NOT see how inappropriate that is?!?!!!?!?!<br>
<br>
&lt;However, I will stick by my analogy. You don't invite a non-believer to speak from the pulpit - it would be like inviting George W. Bush to address the Democratic Party's National Convention.&gt;<br>
<br>
Or Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson to be Grand Marshall in a Gay Pride parade.<br>
<br>
Pseudo, perhaps you're not familiar with the idea that teachers and pastors are held to standards, by God. 1 Timothy 2 &amp; 3 talks about it.

Your idea of churches being a forum for questioning just won't work.  Much like Femme's analogy of Falwell being the Grand Marshall of a Gay Pride parade.  That just wouldn't work.  The gays would claim that his presense would be offensive.<br>
<br>

<br>
Rational thinking is what leads one to defend their views.  It's a mistake to think that there is some neutral ground where one may no have 'real' convictions, thus labeling it 'rational thinking'.<br>
<br>
As far as open floor/round table discussions go, these happen all the time.  Check out Ravi Zacharias sometime.  I'm not sure if he still does the college speaking/debating tours, but you can find many of his conversations with atheists, agnostics and the like in his books.<br>

I hope you understand Pseudologist, that when we gather together for our worship services, it has little to do with Christians hanging out and talking through things to figure out what we are going to do next, and how we are to explain things to other people.  It is a dedication, and a learning experience, and a fellowshipping with God as HIS people.  It is considered &quot;HOLY&quot; and any questions would be reserved until after the services.  It is not an open, free for all, say anything you please to anyone you please type of place.<br>

Ah yes, the whole superiority complex, forgot all about it. But the fact remains it should be this parish's right to make that decision. Its not like they are being duped by these non believers, contrastingly they are coming to know them more effectively (this goes both ways). So that there can be a level of understanding between the groups, instead of the arrogance, and closed mindedness that exists right now on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>both</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ends.<br>
<br>
Esdras you say it wouldn't work, but the funny thing is it has never been attempted until now. And it seems to be working out just fine. Obviously to turn every place of worship into a debate forum is not the goal, nor is it feasible. But too allow churches that do encourage a questioning of faith should be acceptable, and would only help matters. <br>
<br>
What I meant when I said my idea of a &quot;true church&quot; would be an open mic. I meant more of the idea of those who gather in smaller groups to study the bible and worship. There is always a &quot;minister&quot; of sorts, but each person in the group has a say, in which it is perfectly acceptable to to voice during a service, possibly in a predetermined time slot and/or manner. There are many ways of regulating this as well, the speaker could voice the topic, with a majority rules veto being possible if the topic is unacceptable. I realize that after hundreds of years of tradition, what I speak of is an ideal, and unachievable in large scale. <br>
<br>
I truly believe that churches are much too big today. The sheer size of some of them <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>seems</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to promote conformity as much as it does spirituality. <br>
<br>
Heartjoys, I meant society as a whole. As in everybody, on every issue. I said rational discussion, not thinking...but I suppose I meant Mature discussion. Wherein both parties can discuss issue x without patronizing, or using the Im right, your wrong argument, or even the &quot;I just know&quot; argument. <br>
<br>
Speaking of patronizing, vonalbro, I was christian for the majority of my life. I do realize how the commonly accepted worship &quot;process&quot; goes. So I suggest small changes for the common good, and I get the word tradition thrown back at me tenfold. It was expected, but atleast identify with where I stand here. <br>

There are a ton of different Churches that hold to different doctrine.  If one doesn't agree with that doctrine, GO TO A DIFFERENT CHURCH.  And at each Church there may be different practices that could be up for debate.  Fine, debate those things, but do it during DEBATE hour, not WORSHIP hour.<br>

As for superiority complex, call it what you like, the &quot;Im right, your wrong&quot; complex. Or the &quot;Im not listening&quot; complex. <br>
Whatever you call it, most religions can claim partial ownership of this social pest, and so can some non beleivers. You guys need to back off of me, you all assume I came here to argue, and i just want to discuss maturely without having to clarify every second sentance I write. Pay attention the first time you read it. <br>
<br>
Acting the martyr? playing you like a patsy? I am afriad you completely lost me there. I am more than happy to partake in the fellowship, but you have to realize that I am obviously not going to agree with most things said here. And that also does not mean that I am here for a fight. I mentioned that I am here for your opinions and thoughts, and within the forum rules I will express my own as well, but thats where it stops. I am not actively looking for debate. <br>
<br>
That is the last time I am going to say that. <br>

<br>
How condescending of you. NO one said anything about being &quot;better&quot; than anyone else. In a BELIEF system, of COURSE what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> believe is what you're going to think is correct. YOU believe something is correct, right? So, you're not going to want what you think is FALSE to be presented with authority from the pulpit. <br>
<br>
&lt;But the fact remains it should be this parish's right to make that decision&gt;<br>
<br>
Who said it wasn't? But other's have the right to make observations about the practice from within the frame of the over all belief system. Namely that GOD tells us to NOT listen to false teachers. One that does NOT share the belief system is NOT the best one to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>learn</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> from about the belief system.<br>
<br>
&lt;But too allow churches that do encourage a questioning of faith should be acceptable, and would only help matters.&gt;<br>
<br>
NO ONE said it was a bad thing for ANYone to question anything. What <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> WRONG is to put a person that is NOT of the belief system in the position of presenting a sermon or sermonette, or small speech, or whatever from the pulpit IN A WORSHIP service. What's hard for you to understand about that? <br>
<br>
&lt;What I meant when I said my idea of a &quot;true church&quot; would be an open mic. I meant more of the idea of those who gather in smaller groups to study the bible and worship.&gt;<br>
<br>
That happens all the time in small group study. Were talking about a WORSHIP service..  Those are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for discussion or debate. That is for another time and another place.<br>
<br>
&lt;Heartjoys has a nice place here. It's for FELLOWSHIP. If you'd like to partake in that fellowship, please do. If you have questions, please ask. If you'd like to debate, throw down the gauntlet.&gt;<br>
<br>
Thank you Tommy. You articulate it nicely. <br>
<br>
&lt;Also I was not being derogatory towards anyone with the words &quot;close-minded&quot; and &quot;arrogance&quot;. I mentioned this is a problem that stems from BOTH sides.&gt;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WHAT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> &quot;BOTH SIDES&quot;?!?!!! and are you saying &quot;closed-minded&quot; and &quot;arrogance&quot; and &quot;superiority complex&quot; do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> show disdain? Come on.. be serious. <br>
<br>
You make judgements and then do the &quot;Oh...what ... who me?&quot; please... <br>
<br>
&lt;I was christian for the majority of my life. I do realize how the commonly accepted worship &quot;process&quot; goes. So I suggest small changes for the common good, and I get the word tradition thrown back at me tenfold. It was expected, but atleast identify with where I stand here.&gt;<br>
<br>
Operative word here being &quot;WAS&quot;. If you are no longer are a believer, what credibility do you have? NONE, that's what.  Why should we take tips from you about the way services or any church function should work? What makes you think your *suggestions for small changes for the common good* are welcomed at all? Why should we believe that you were EVER a believer? I'm not buying what you're selling here. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:fuchsia;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:x-small;">....·´¨¨))</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:small;">-:¦:-</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:teal;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:x-small;"> <br>

Accusing Chrisitians who hold to a core belief, and would worship God in the sense as Christ desires, to be closed-minded, arrogant, or having a superiority complex is inappropriate here and unwelcome.<br>
