There is no such thing as spiritual confirmation and noone outside of LDS accepts your prophet’s rants, so my point is, as it has always been that using this as some sort of “proof” is silly on a debate board. I am sorry you struggle as much as DAG with logic and fallacious arguments, but it appears we are both bored here with your claim of divine intervention in the founding of the US so can put this to rest.<br>
<br>
For the 800th time--NOONE CAN PROVE A NEGATIVE! <br>
<br>
It's been explained so many ways, I don't have the energy to rehash it, but claim the US was inspired by fairies if you want, just don't expect others to agree or accept in the face of logic and without proof. That's where the whining comes in again...<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Noone said you claimed all knowledge of other religions either, just that you get your info through an LDS filter and DON’T always go straight to the source as you demand others do. I can get links to threads where you discount all info not received from an LDS site as anti-LDS if you wish. <br>
<br>
”If a Sikh missionary came to my door, I would invite them in and ask them to share their doctrines with me. I like to be educated about other religions, because it only confirms my faith in my own beliefs.”<br>
Unless it is Satanism<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , which you already know everything about even though you haven’t studied with atheists…you know all about them already and it’s okay to get info on them from anti-Satanic sources right? Fine by me if this is how you want to play.<br>
<br>
”…absolutelyand do not apologize for it. But my prophet has been more than clear that we are to love everyone. A former prophet even went as far to say, dont judge another because they choose to sin differently than you do. People who have homosexual feelings are more than welcome as members of our church as long as they choose to keep the same commandments that we all are given. anyway blah blah blah we've been down this road before as well.”<br>
So you can have homosexual “feelings” as long as you don’t touch other same sex people out of wedlock in no-no areas? Oh well, IN THAT CASE you are tolerant!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
”I dare ya to find anything in President Hinkleys writings or addresses that encourages hate. We also dont condone adultry or premarital sex, bank robbery, lying, drinking smoking or drinking coffee, .......... but that doesnt mean we HATE people who engage in those activities either.”<br>
No, but it means you find it immoral. An action against god being taken consciously even when it harms NOONE as we know even coffee does (hurts the drinker that is). Paint this how you like, say you love the sin, hate the sinner…homosexuals don’t find this anymore flattering than I do and think you should find a thicker veil for your bigotry.<br>
<br>
”I have better things to do.”<br>
And yet you return…<br>

It matters not how many or who condones the beliefs of your HF who punishes followers for transgressions by darkening their skin or calls homosexuals people with &quot;feelings&quot; they can suppress who are sinning against him if they choose to love someone of the same sex. If you feel good about this, yay for you---it is bigotry. Put a pretty ribbon on it and gather a rainbow of supporters, but it is, what it is.

Homosexuality HURTS NOONE, but portraying homosexual sex/lifestyle with sin DOES HURT MANY, MANY PEOPLE. <br>
<br>
I have much more respect for people like Candy and Heather who dont' try to candyass their god's commandments and the implications, or dress it up claiming it doesn't matter if their theology calls for this or that since &quot;they have a few friends who are....&quot;. We will not agree on this, but it would be more honest if you simply stated your beliefs and tried to defend yourself with either logic, science, proof or any one of these.<br>

P.S. And Puuuuhhleeze I am begging you to go to the fallacies link and study what is meant by circular argument, ad populum, appeal to masses, bandwagon...<br>

I mean, this would be funny if it wasn't so pitiful.. it reads like a bad joke. <br>
<br>
Also, if you read towards the bottom, it mentions the US gov't has been funding this religious charity for many years now.. I didn't think that was allowed?  And also that they were accused of prefacing some of their charitable works with religious sermons.. *big shock*<br>
<br>
I'm just wondering how many times I'm supposed to believe that the present US gov't doesn't have a religious agenda here.. I tell my friends that we don't have it out for Islam, but these things keep happening to cast doubts on that.<br>

I have a great disgust and intolerance for the bigotry perpetrated by your belief systems, evidenced without apology or shame most recently in the middle east. Do I very much dislike what you CHOOSE to believe? Yes. You were not born this way, and sexism, racism and ethno-centricity are things you were taught and chose to embrace as part of your religion. You constantly accuse folks like Candy and Heather of judging your system too harshly and calling it not xian or saying you won't go to heaven, but now that you're being called on your hypocrisy, it's all &quot;neener, neener boo, boo&quot;. Okay to call others intolerant for criticizind LDS but turnabout not fair play eh? Hmmm....poor dear<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you cannot handle someone debating your theology without refuting it with logic, or geting all weepy, why are you here? Geez Shirene, accusing you of using fallacious arguments, poor reason and baseless claims does NOT equal accusatoins that you smell or are ugly.<br>
You know how I feel about the god you worship, and that MOST of the info I get about you is from your sources, but if being a martyr and whining instead of refuting any of this &quot;feels&quot; right to you, than as you say, don't let reason or logic stand in the way. Why start now?<br>

HOMOSEXUALITY IS NOT NATURAL - But I can dislike the behavior, just as I find Liberal politics foreign and &quot;STUPID&quot; and not hold that against a person or judge them.  Apparently you equate disagreeing with someone on fundamental principles as equaling not being able to have a civil or even warm relationship or friendship with them.  Apparently YOU cant disagree with someone and still have a positive relationship with  them, so you cant fathom how someone else can do it.<br>
Dont judge everyone else by your inabilities.<br>

Homosexuality IS natural and I can actually provide some scientific data and research to support this, but am reluctant to do so because as an atheist I don't give a rat's ass whether or not someone is born gay or straight. I know you do, but in the face of evidence to the contrary.<br>

I will now call you a loon.  God has a vested interest in religion and specifically the one true faith.

Excellent example of LINEAR logic.  Circular logic would be if one of those end steps went back to the beginning again.  Like “The bible is inspired by god.”  How do you know?  “The bible says so.”  How do you know it isn’t wrong?  “Because the bible is inspired by god.” Circular…  <br>

<br>
Yes, your actions DO speak for themselves.  “Calling a spade a spade” is a racially derogatory statement popularized in the anti-civil rights movements of the 50’s and 60’s, or was that not covered in you enlightened and history intensive human development degree?  Irrespective of the person you claim to be, you practice a religion that is both sexist and racist.  You personally might know someone gay or black or mexican, and it doesn’t change the fact that you support an institution that is morally objectionable to some of us.

I have been watching people deal with cognitive dissonance for years, they survive by not examining it too closely or using arguments in support of it that they have not bothered to examine too closely.

Not so much a hate the sin love the sinner thing as hate the bad connotations of the title but love the actual action of being a racist/sexist/homophobe/antisemite.   <p>DBC67<br>

Again I refer you to the half a million or more black LDS!<br>

Do you have such a need to feel morally superior that you are willing to just make stuff up? Tsk tsk.  and you who claim to love truth and logic.  But then again, you are placing your own values and perception into the equation, something you accuse me of doing, but I shouldnt be suprised.<br>
<br>
And  please make a list of historical innacuracies I have made, I dare ya! They arent there.<br>
<br>
Dave the question on whether or not we should have let Hitler continue, was not referring to Americans but ALL the allied forces as Trish had stated that she felt there was no appropriate time for war.  My question to HER was Should we (meaning the world) just have let it continue.  Please tell me how a question on the validity of the war on Hitler and Germany in general became a historical innacurracy?<br>
<br>
On the electoral college/popular vote debate its all a matter of opinion and speculation.  My opinion is that if it were only a popular vote, the candidates would want to get the most bang for their buck as far as campaign time, which would be the most densly populated metropolitan areas, leaving rural and smaller cities out of the loop.    So what if your vote counted equally, there wouldnt be anyone who was willing to represent rural and middle america so the vote would be  a choice between a liberal panning to metro US or a conservative panning to metro US.  Small town issues like federal land use or farm assistance would get not attention at all.  The Electoral college system demands that at least some attention be given to less densly populated states.<br>
<br>
And last but not least, I have one face thank you!  But I am able to separate the value of a person, all of us are children of God who are of infinite worth, and their behaviors or beliefs that I disagree with.  Just as I hope that others will see beyond my human frailty.  None of us are perfect, I accept others as they are and hope that they grant me the same.  But again, I guess this is a foreign concept.<br>

So none of us are perfect, but you are less imperfect than we, marvelously self serving.  Well Madame Perfecctione’ in the future, target your reply to those actually questioning your accuracy.  I did not say you were historically wrong regarding hitler and killing jews or the electoral college.  I was responding to your point about should we have let it continue or not, and my point was, we did allow it.  I stand by that point.  Trish says that there is no cause to go to war, and if the world believed that then there would be no wars.  Neat, tidy package backed by the full weight and authority of her churches doctrine and consistent teachings.  When the world converts to JW and all these false religions are vanquished, there will be an end to war.  Good luck Trish.<br>

Now please, distinguish for the viewing audience the differences in Saddam murdering those he is dissatisfied with and Shrub doing the same thing.  I would like to see this moral higher ground.

Sadam was killing people at his leisure and forcing them to live in fear of expressing their own thoughts, starving people including children while he lived in opulance.  He held no value on the lives he took and did it all for HIS own glory (Stallin was his self proclaimed idol)  The &quot;collateral damage&quot; a term which I hate, in this war, was avoided at every possible turn, The lights power and water, were not targeted so that the people of Iraq would not suffer needlessly.  Those who were killed were those who suppressing and destroying the rights of others, not innocent men women and children (not that some were not injured or killed, but they were not the target as they were in Sadam's regime.)  That is the difference.  Now I speak to  every motive of Pres. Bush but I can say that IMO his motive at least in one aspect was to rid Iraq of a tyrant who the world and Iraq is better without.<br>

I dont argue your right to disagree, I do say and agian it falls back to that not proving a negative thing which I know y'all hate,but you cannot say that GOD did not inspire the government.

We alredy discussed a little bit of the fatih based initiative.  The money that is given to those organizations to my jnderstanding and I admit I havent read the law, is to be used on the same types of Social service programs that secular sponsored programs are already receiving.  I think both types of prgrams should be given equal treatment if the money is going to be given out.  But as a conservative who beleives that individuals should support the organizations that they choose on their own and govt assistance should be cut altogether.   I would love to see all the pork cut from the budget altogether.  I support the Alzheimers Association and several local charities. I would love to give them more of the money that is taken from me and given to charities that I HAVE to give to via taxation. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the scripture supporting god as allowing different beliefs,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
The 11th Article of faith is in the Pearl of Great Price and is LDS scripture.  It states: We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience and allow all men the same privilege, let them worhsip how where or what they may.<br>
<br>
Another example is a little long to be quoted here, but it is in the last chapters of Mosiah and the first few chapters of Alma in the BoM.  But to summarize, this is one of the key verses that talks about the way that we are to treat each other despite differences  Alma 1:21 : Now there was a strict law among the people of the church that there should not any man, belnging to the church arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should not be any persecutions among themselves.<br>
<br>
Several other references : 2Nephi:2:27  &quot;Wherefore men are free according to the flesh and all things are given them which are expedient unto man.  And they are free to choose...&quot;  This is not saying that all roads lead to Rome, but that God is not going to force us into believing or having faith.  We are free to choose whatever life we want to live.  Now the LDS differ a little from other Christian sects in that we believe that we are responsible for our choices.  If we choose to repent, Christs blood will atone for our mistakes, but that doesnt give us license to repeat the mistake or continue in sin.  We think that repentence is an ongoing process and that we arent &quot;saved&quot; until we endure to the end doing our darnedest to keep the commandments for all of our lives.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>or mourns the loss of unbelievers more than his own worshippers<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->;  <br>

I have been looking for a while and cant find the exact reference, but in Alma 28:11-13<br>
11...and many thousands are mourning for the loss of their kindred, because they have reason to fear, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are consigned to a state of endless wo.<br>
<br>
12 While many thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of their kindred, yet they rejoice and exult in the hope, and even know, according to the bpromises of the Lord, that they are raised to dwell at the right hand of God, in a state of never-ending happiness<br>
<br>
13 And thus we see how great the inequality of man is because of sin and transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes by the cunning plans which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of men.  <br>
<br>
It doesnt come right out and say it but the implication is there that the death of the wicked is a more sorrowful event because they fell for Satans plans and because of their choices they are lost forever.<br>

I do not FEAR the Satanic Bible.  I just know from the choice of reference that they choose to believe in something that is directly OPPOSITE from my beliefs.  Adn since I know what my beliefs are, then I know what is opposite of those beliefs and nothing I read on that website has led me to believe any differently.  So what is the point?  I have 100's of more positive religious systems to choose from, when I want to spend my valuable time as a working mom of four looking at other religions, I would prefer to check out Hinduism, the Bahai faith (my sil has a good friend who believes in that faith)  or other Christian faiths  The reference to my wanting people to look at LDS info when they are WANTING to know about our faith, is just that; if they are trying to find out about us it makes sense to read our stuff not an anti-site.  If I had a deep deisre to know what the church of Satan's doctrines were, I would read their stuff.  But I dont have any desire!  Im not going to any anti-church of Satan websites to get the dirt on them.  They can just exist in their own little world and I am no worse for NOT knowing the details.  The one question I did ask was about who they believe he is and since I was under the impression that someone on the board was familiar enough with the &quot;faith&quot; to answer that question I dont see the comparison.<br>
<br>
The very reason that STACEY chooses to continue to reference the Church of Satan is solely because she knows that is probably the one &quot;church&quot; we Christians would not want our kids exposed to and so uses that in every discussion of freedom of religion with the sole intent to prove that we are &quot;hippocrites&quot; for not wanting our kids to be exposed to the very representation of EVIL itself.  Its all very self serving, in her need to feel morally superior.  Even saying that the church of Satan is more of a positive thing than Christianity.....Yes we christians are just evil.... we teach our kids to be honest and treat others the way you want to be treated.

If you want a debate you have to give something more substanial than that.<br>
<br>
My guess is that you are implying that Mormons are forced to believe and act a certain way without choice?  If that is the implication you are sorely mistaken.  Our church is all about choice.  You either accept the doctrine or you dont, no one forces you.  Now if you mean that members dont have input on the doctrine, well you are right. God gives the doctrine and we either accept it or not, its entirely up to you.  Now if you want to believe or act in a way that is contrary to specific moral codes ( no adultry, no sex before marriage, no homosexual activity) and still be a member, you may not be given that choice.  <br>
<br>
Or if you think that the doctrine is wrong and you start preaching out publically about how wrong the doctrine is, you may be excommunicated its true. But then again, why would an individual want to belong to a church that they think is teching false doctrine.  If you are a member of this church you believe that God inspires his prophet and that the Prophet is the mouthpiece of the Lord.  If you dont buy that, then you are free to find a church where you feel more comfortable with the doctrine. <br>
<br>
Nobody knocks on my door to ask if Ive paid my tithing, no one asks me if Im living the word of wisdom unless I choose to go to the temple.  And I am aware of the temple recommend requirements so its not a suprise, I make the appointment I go talk to the bishop, no ones coercing me to do anything.  I dont have to turn in a log of missionary time or how many hours I spend reading the scriptures.<br>
<br>
Now I do know a few parents who forced their kids to church, but I dont know of any other person who is being forced or coerced into being a member or living by its teachings.<br>

I beg to disagree, but with our lovely new Patriot Act(s) this is exactly what's happening.. the only one you may have heard of is Jose Padilla, who as you may remember was arrested nearly a year ago now, and quickly transferred to a military brig so no one could know where he was or hear of any evidence or question why this person is being held.  He, unfortunately, is only the latest of several who have fallen victim to &quot;Secret Evidence&quot;, and has joined a group of men, pretty much all Muslim men, who are being detained indefinitely with no way to see, let alone counter, the evidence against them.  In his case he is actually a citizen as well, which makes it even worse.<br>
<br>
And maybe *you* don't care, because he was a gang member, and he's Muslim, and he's Hispanic, but in our current climate and with the new freedoms our government has, it is entirely possible that one day the FBI could pluck my dh off the street and whisk him away to an &quot;unknown location&quot; on &quot;secret evidence&quot;, denying him access to a lawyer or due process, and I might not hear from him again for years.

<br>
On that certain bill, I see what they are trying to say - if you blow up a bridge to prevent access for commerce or transportation of goods thats terrorism, having a sit in isnt.  Having a sit in that blocks the transportation of needed supplies to a war zone, which happened recently, then they are guilty of more than just disorderly conduct.  IF those delays cost lifes or impedes necessary actions  of the military in a war zone, they are domestic terrorists IMO. <br>

Having a dissenting opinion does not give you the right to do something like that.<br>

Well, skipping the part that it doesn’t address about my right to NOT worship, reconcile the above against the first couple commandments please.  I believe it goes something like:<br>
1 And God spake all these words, saying,  2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:  5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;  6 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.  7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:  10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:  11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.<br>

<br>
No I don’t.  You are saying that good solid linear logic is equally as bad as unsound, irrational circular logic.  There is no point there to see.  That’s just dumb.  If I disagree with you for believing something because god says so, and I do it based on lack of evidentiary support for god’s existence, that is solid, sound reasoning.  Just the same as if you claimed little green men told you or that your dog wrote it in the snow with his pee.  Try this, if you disbelieve that your child caught botulism from eating undercooked red meat because he never ate any red meat, you are using sound logic.  If you disbelieve your child caught botulism from eating warm sugar because botulism can’t survive in sugar concentrate, you’d be using sound logic.  If you disbelieve your child caught botulism from eating your cooking because you are his mom and no mom would give her child botulism, that is flawed. <br>
<br>
Here is the crux of it, you don’t like it because it invalidates your position.  You equate it to something you think we don’t like and expect us to agree.  Important differences being that what you think we don’t like doesn’t invalidate my position, nor is it solid logic so we don’t really care either way.  You are making the extreme claims, therefore you need to provide evidentiary support for your claims.  Lacking that you have nothing to debate and no purpose here as this IS a debate board.<br>

Stacey chooses it because a great many people don’t bother to check into things and it is easy to differentiate it by name alone.  If she were to use other religious organizations like Westboro Baptist Church, Church of the Creator, The Church of Jesus Christ Christian, The Covenant Sword, The Arm of the Lord, Christian Patriots Defense League not many would actually recognize just from name alone that they were reprehensible institutions.  Equal tolerance of religion must be for ALL religions or it isn’t equal.  You decide things in absence of facts and out of visceral reaction.  That is intellectually irresponsible.  It is also logically fallacious to presume the opposite of something is bad if it is the opposite of something good.  That is the same as “I am a good fundie and you don’t agree with me so you are a bad evil mormon.”  Small minded and Petty. But as you say, to each their own.<br>

LDS teach that all people whether in this life or in the spirit world will have a chance to hear and understand the gospel and will have the chance to accept or reject it.  We do NOT teach that, if they dont believe like we do now they are damned.   <br>

My mom was the Relief Society President, my sis is the Primary president in her ward.  Women are in leadership positions over ward organizations, Stake organizations and on a church wide level there is a Presidency for Primary, Young Women and Relief Society as well as boards for those organizations.  We plan ward activities and stake activities and have many responsiblities.  The first presidency constantly speaks out against abuse of wives and children. telling the men that if they do those kind of things they are not worthy of the priesthood they hold and that the authority of God leaves them if they engage in such behavior.
