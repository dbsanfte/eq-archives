You guys were right on the money with what you told me. I'm very excited and hopeful with the information and analysis I got from you guys. I went out today for about an hour and I'm already casting 5 to 10 feet farther consistently. When I got back to my motel at Mountain Home, I spent about 30 minutes writing everything down.  What I learned from you all coupled with the Bill Gammel class and then the Chuck, Art Mazzier and Bill Gammel class, I really got some things to think about and work on this winter. I've read 3 or 4 books on casting and probably studied 4 or 5 casting videos, read untold numbers of articles, spent 6 months preparing for the Casting Certification test but there's nothing like getting personal instruction. Where I live out here on the Plains, the nearest flycaster I know of is miles away and its great to get help from people who know what they're doing. Basically I had hit a plateau and needed someone to look at me and tell me what I was doing wrong. You can only go so far on your own. Wish I lived closer. <br>
     John, I went back and reread your 9/26 post on tracking and your backcast being out of plane with your forward cast and I remember reading it and thinking 'ok, that sounds about right&quot; but I really didn't think it applied to me and then at the Conclave you picked that up as a problem almost immediately. Goes to show you that you can have the knowledge but can't apply it to your own problem. It takes someone to step back and take a look at you.<br>
     Chuck, I wrote 4 points that you saw but the one that has helped me immediately is bringing my elbow tighter to my body. I was carrying about as much line as I possibly could tonight for about an hour and I didn't get nearly as tired as normal and like you said and demonsrated when you had me apply pressure to your hand, I've definitely got more power than when I move my elbow and arm farther from my body. Muchos Gracias, eh.<br>

<br>
Your elbow being out is why you weren't tracking properly. Even when you were bringing your elbow in you were swinging your body and your rod tip was swinging with it. As soon as you would pull your elbow off your body would stay still. <br>
<br>
Tracking is the next step in distance casting and it's a tough one to make. Honestly, there is very little that is about &quot;fishing&quot; to properly tracking the rod tip. Mostly because everything in fishing makes you have an eliptical casting plane. When I ran into Lori Ann Murphy in Denver she was griping because her cast had gone eliptical because she had been guideing so much lately and not practicing her casting.<br>
<br>
You have a tons of ability Robert. You definately have a great understanding of what makes a cast work or not work. Something that really helps me is to get some video tape of my casting. If I'd of thought about it I'd of taken some of you while we were at the Conclave. The easiest feedback on your tracking is how your loop turns over. If you have an &quot;L&quot; it's off track.<br>
<br>
I really enjoyed casting with you. I hope we get a chance to do it again.<br>

Getting ready for the Certified Instructor test has improved both my understanding of what is involved in making a good cast and my casting itself.<br>
<br>
I was able to spend almost all day with Bill Gammel last Friday and then he spoke to our group of eight brave souls prior to the test on Saturday morning.  (He told me that I had better not EVER miss a question on the &quot;five essentials.&quot;)  I also got to meet Chuck and Art and spent quality class time with them too.  John has provided me with valuable assistance in preparation for the test and I am just awed by his ability with a flyrod, his eye for seeing the casting stroke, and his relaxed manner in instruction.  Quality help freely given, thanks to all you guys.<br>

One of the great things about the Conclave is it provides a rare opportunity for us to get together, cast, talk about casting and learn from each other.  <br>
