I just have to laugh at some of the &quot;unchristianlike&quot; comments directed towards you.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think being strong in your faith is wonderful. No matter what I believe, everyone has the right to believe what they need to believe (Who knows... maybe your belief is 100% correct. I am not one to say you are wrong) What I do not agree with is the different sects of the same religion telling the other sects they are &quot;going to hell&quot; because of a doctrinal difference. It just blows my mind.<br>
<br>
My mother (whose mission in life is to convert all the world to Christianity before she dies) has told us that we are going to hell because we think Paul was a false prophet. ~ Then we had a sermon preached about a conversation we had with the asst pastor about the same subject (with the same message... anyone who does not believe everything 100% in the bible is going to hell). That was the last time I sat through a christian church service.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I do not feel that anyone has a right to judge how you worship. If G-d exists, then it is no one's business except yours and his.<br>

Pres. Hinckley, our Prophet and church leader, travels a lot and has met with a lot of international and local uppity-ups. He has had nothing but kind things to say about them and in return, he has gained the respect of many. <p>Paige<br>

<br>
Honestly, I think people who find cause to attack like those posts were have serious problems in their &quot;walk&quot;.<br>
<br>
The reason for religion is supposed to be a means to bring you inner peace, and to make sense of the world, and your place in it, right?<br>
<br>
How peaceful can it be if you find the need to decide who's more whatever than you are? I think some people only feel better  if by cutting people down, they somehow bolster their flagging sense of self. I'm suspicious of claims that people are blissfully happy when they find the need to attack others. <br>
<br>
I mean, that converation could have gone peacefully, and you were more than civil, and it's like some people couldn't help themselves, even though it was off topic and mean. Even the atheists got drug in there again (but I guess, to them as partners with Satan, we make good fodder for discussion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>

For those who follow what goes on over at the &quot;other&quot; place, do any of you encounter many people like this in real life?  I work at a large company, belong to a church, live in a suburb with lots of neighbors, yet I must be pretty sheltered because I never encountered this type of extremism until I started reading these boards.  And I even live in a conservative area.  Sometimes I have to remind myself that this is not the norm so I don't get too disillusioned with religion.  I'm curious if others have the same experience.<br>

I have never understood why one person or church would take all the time and energy to teach everyone how wrong another was. Why not take that time and energy to teach what is important-about the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, of charity and love for ALL people.<br>
For most LDS people, this is not just some religion or a place you go to on Sunday. It's a total way of life and there are things that you are involved in several times a week, if not more.<br>
<br>
Julie, I haven't personally encountered this kind of stuff in real life. I have encountered it online on message bb's, at anti-mormon websites, etc. There is a local church here called Focus On The Family and they are pretty anti-mormon. They even have a talk radio thing.<br>

On the brighter side, the book had  a floor plan for  Heaven. Had its exact location in the sky, and the dimensions of the mansions for Christians (that was a new one for me).... <br>
<br>
Nice and neighborly, though, don't you think? She was horrified that my 7 year old goes to mass with my MIl occasionally (her head would explode if she knew my kids have also been to temple, and what they hear about at our UUA church)....<br>

We have the same beliefs, but we don't speak ill of other faiths, nor do we try to shove it on other people. If we have a chance to share or someone asks, great. But we don't think &quot;Hmph!

I don't follow that board much (frankly, it bores me) but I do know where to find it. I think what contributes to the occasional animosity is the anonymity of the Internet (try saying that 3 times fast<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  There are a few who get up on their high horses and are as nasty as they want to be<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , knowing they'll never have to face the people they offend. If they lived next door to you, they wouldn't have the nerve to say the outrageous things they say online.<br>
<br>
A big thing that turned me away from xianity was attitudes like those. (That, and it just never made any sense to me on any level except an admittedly emotional one). It really made me question why, if they &quot;have the answer&quot; how can they be so dang ugly, mean-spirited and generally nasty to anyone who doesn't think exactly the way they do? Blech.<br>
<br>
But I will also say that the majority of posts I've seen on that board are pretty mundane and inoffensive and most of those people (I think) are at least trying to live up to their beliefs. Take Candy (Bonbon2d) for example, I have never seen her post anything mean here or there - she seems quite reasonable.<br>

<br>
As to the point about being &quot;buddy buddy&quot; with us evil atheists...maybe it's because Paige realises that there is no point in trying to witness to us...maybe she respects us as individuals and respects our &quot;free will&quot;(isn't it the fundies that love that word? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), to believe or disbelieve as we see fit!  Maybe she thinks that witnessing by example (living a decent life...being *nice* to people! etc..) will be more effective than cyber-preaching!?!<br>
<br>
Paige - I don't think you said anything there that needs apologising for...plenty of other people did though! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Good Maude, I've never read such an uptight bunch of bull in my life!  Well...maybe I have..but this lot comes close!<br>

Edited to add ** The only fundie I know in real life is the headmaster at my childrens school - he is *very* into bible stories every day at their &quot;collective act of worship&quot; as they call it (xian hymns and prayers..but it apparently takes in all religions *shrug*)...in England religion is a much more private thing on the whole...as an atheist I just assume that everyone I know is an atheist unless I find out otherwise...so far I know of two families that go to churches in the area.

Umm, sadly I'm related to several of them. My MIL - though she is usually nice as long asyou don't bring up religion, and interracial marriages, and homosexuality, and half a dozen other topics - my aunt and uncle, a couple of kids I went to high school with and about I would say 50 or so other people I've had the unfortunite luck of meeting in the last oh 5 or so years. <br>
<br>
The worse is MIL because I can not escape it. Hell my family is Catholic and I don't hear ANYTHING from them, other then the one time my grandmother asked me to baptist my son before he had head surgery. <br>
<br>
MIL's attitude is almost enough for me to just go &quot;fuck it, just to piss you off even more, I'm going to raise my children Catholic&quot;. Shit, DH has come close to that point. <br>
<br>
When I was waiting tables I use to get asked if I was born-again about once a week - usually sundays. And when I was working for the Red Cross calling blood donors and letting them know that their usual donation site was having another drive, it was about once a month someone would attempt to witness to me. <br>
<br>
Umm, three times on the street here in Germany. <br>
<br>
Its only been very recently that I have admitted that I am not Catholic. So until that point when asked what was I, I would answer Catholic. And it was about 80% of those people who asked me that would in some way say that I was not saved, was going to hell, and surely I could accept the blood of Christ etc etc etc. <br>
<br>
I haven't been asked since I've shed the last of the catholic skin. Other then asked on those stupid forms I had to fill out for DS's birth. And I still am pissed that they messed up my &quot;NONE&quot; when asked about religion and put &quot;no preference&quot; I HAD A PREFERENCE...NONE. GGRRR<br>

My mom has finally been told that we are not Christian (a couple months ago). I did not tell her that I am agnostic, but I did say &quot;I am not Atheist... does that make you feel better?&quot; She said no. Well, this Christmas, all Rob and I got were angel stuff (Which is ok... I think they are pretty) I think it is her way of getting us to turn back towards G-d (using her words). Oh well. Oh... during our family gathering at my gmas house over Christmas (All aunts, uncles, and cousins were there as well), my mom asked if we could all sing the doxology after the prayer. She loked straight at me and smiled. Oh well on that too. I think the song is pretty and I like singing harmony to it anyway. No one else was confortable singing it... not even my Luthern minister uncle. <br>

<br>
I ask because, I know most religions are not like this, but we believe in keeping the Sabbath holy. We avoid working when we can and we don't go out shooping, out to eat, etc. on Sunday. That also causes other people to work. Anyway, I'm wondering if these people thought they were saved, went to church, then went out to eat which is breaking the Sabbath <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now, I am not saying you shouldn't have worked, etc. Just the hypocrisy of asking if someone else is saved, then they are out breaking the Sabbath.<br>

Going out to eat after church is HUGE in the south. Sundays were always hell days to work when I waited tables because most of those people also tip like crap and are high maitenence customers. <br>
<br>
I guess they figured they already gave 10% at church so we should only get 5%. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
