There's a chance having two storylines to follow will eliminate the lag that killed the last chain.<br>
<br>
Some guidelines - Perhaps we could try a gm-less world.  In order for this to work, everyone must police themselves with the abilities of their character, and the agendas of each character must be developed by the players themselves.  If you stay in the bounds of what your character can do (and not harass people in an ooc way).  Each person must take the additions to the world presented by the other players, though everyone also has to respect the plans and previous posts of others.  If you see someone setting up something, don't ruin it.  I'm sure if conflict arises, I could step in (or someone not involved in the dispute), and if a valid point is raised, certain things could be changed.  Anyone can take control of NPC's, but try to keep them fairly non-proactive unless attitudes or previous scores prescribe a different path.  <br>
<br>
Magic: try to keep the myteriousness magic has, it's ok if your character can use them, but it should be a physically/mentally draining action done only when the need presents itself<br>
<br>
And remember, Character Development is the most important thing in games like this, not combat.  The more layers and agendas the better.  Think about underlying thoughts that would influence each action.  Feel free to run with this<br>
<br>
/edit Also - there's no posting order, so just jump in whenever.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sovbeos>sovbeos</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.xsiteclub.com/forum/images/avatars/gallery/cowboy_bebop/cb_02.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 9/20/03 9:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sovbeos>sovbeos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk Man Monster-killa</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/03 2:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Along the paths of adventure</span><hr size=1>    Tehn Semulis gratefully entered the tavern along the dark and stormy road stretching bleakly for miles in both directions: a refuge for travellers of all kinds between the towns of Kremos and Helayn.  Immediately suspicious of the diverse and numerous peoples populating the small dining area, he knew he must be on his guard.  Quickly spotting an table empty of occupants, he made his way to it, disgusted that the wenches had yet to clean the previous eater's refuse.  Hearing the heavy footsteps behind him, he realized perhaps there was a reason it was uncleared.  <br>
    A gruff voice from directly behind him uttered &quot;yur in meh chair&quot;, and Tehn, unwilling to make any sudden movements, locked his eyes on the man's reflection on a grimy pewter mug.  He had at least 80 pounds on Tehn, and his massive paw was frighteningly close to the hilt of some unknown weapon. <br>
    &quot;I beg your pardon milord, the road is long and tiring.  If you'll let me...&quot;  <br>
    His thought was cut short as he dived to the right, seeking the wall as protection against an unknown quantity, as his chair was smashed by the mace sailing out of the man's garments with startling speed for the man's size.  Tehn rolled to his feet, a pair of wicked looking daggers in each hand before the roll was half complete.  Raising an arm, he quickly said &quot;as I was saying, if you'll let me stand, the seat is yours, and seeing your claim has been made, I'm glad I could oblige you&quot;<br>
     Trying to gage the rest of the tavern's reactions, he heard the man cry in anger as he lunged towards the wall.  Starting a roll to the right away from a cabinet of plateware and more importantly the man's weapon, the other hand unexpectedly reached his throat, showing the thug's intellect at gaging his victim's escape route.  <br>
     The man showed a broken grin as he secured his grip and slammed him against the wall, shaking the daggers out of Tehn's hands. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sovbeos>sovbeos</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.xsiteclub.com/forum/images/avatars/gallery/cowboy_bebop/cb_02.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 9/20/03 3:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sagecoqui>SageCoqui</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://homepage.mac.com/jubei1/kenshin/sakabatou.png" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/03 6:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Along the paths of adventure</span><hr size=1> Tehn immeadietely realized he was in quite the predicament.  His mind raced through possibilties out of this, when the man let out a low grunt and staggered to the right loosening his grip on Tehn's throat.  Tehn quickly grasped the situation and did not waste his opportunity.  He used his right foot to kick up one of his daggers,  he caught it while spinning out of the man's grip and slammed the butt against the back of the man's head.  As the man fell Tehn saw a cloaked figure spin away and face a group of grim drunks quickly advancing. The cloaked figure was wielding a simple staff, however Tehn had glimpsed a flash of an ornate scabbard when the man had spun away.  The cloaked man brandished his staff in front of him as he readied himself to deal with the oncoming drunks.  When the drunks charged, Tehn observed another figure leap towards the fray from a secluded table in the shadows... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sovbeos>sovbeos</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.xsiteclub.com/forum/images/avatars/gallery/cowboy_bebop/cb_02.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk Man Monster-killa</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/03 6:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Flying action already!</span><hr size=1>    Spinning away from his downed foe, the regained dagger leapt from Tehn's hand, sailing into the next assailants's foot.

Much to his surprise Sparrow was now witnessing the makings of a small brawl. At first glance Sparrow’s best option was to move to the dark and secluded corner and watch this free entertainment. Sparrow soon realized that the crowd of drunks was out for more than a mere exhibition of pugilistic fun when the large bear of a man quickly smashed the seat that was where the nimble man had been a moment before. Understanding that things would be getting very nasty for on of these two men in a moment Sparrow checked his Rapier to make sure it was clear in its scabbard, then began to advance upon the men intending to put a stop to this event that would surely stop the serving girls from coming to his table. As Sparrow began to take quick strides toward the fray a cloaked figure intervened sharply rapping the hulking lug at the base of his skull, the small fellow being bullied wasted no time in his escape and secured his victory by sending the brute to the floor with a quick spinning motion slamming the butt of his dagger into the man’s head. Sparrow bounded up over the table tops drawing his rapier and brandished it at the advancing drunks intent on recapturing their friends honor by beating the two travelers to an unrecognizable pulp, “what hospitality” he thought. With a lightning quick motion he brought the basket of his rapier crashing down upon the skull of two of the nearest drunks, slowly working his way toward the two men now pitched in a more typical drunken brawl using whatever smashable objects came into their hands to knock their foes into an oblivion that would allow them to awaken in a very bad hangover. Finishing the remaining two drunks in his corner Sparrow bounded up to make the acquaintance of the two travelers he had aided. “Good day my fellow travel weary friends, I hope I find you in a good mood” joked Sparrow as he bounded toward the two men. “I am Robert Sparrow, most infamous nave in the port city of Tortuga and aspiring pirate captain.” said Sparrow as he introduced himself. “Might I inquire as to your names good sirs?” said Sparrow as he bowed ostentatiously; it was obvious that this man had a tendency to be very flamboyant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sovbeos>sovbeos</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.xsiteclub.com/forum/images/avatars/gallery/cowboy_bebop/cb_02.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk Man Monster-killa</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/03 7:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> More flying acton</span><hr size=1>    Smiling at Sparrow's assistance, Tehn was about to respond when he suddenly leapt directly at the bowing figure.

With a quick glance behind him he noticed that the fellow had quickly dispatched the brute and was engaging more of the drunks.  As Glenn planted his staff into another ruffian's gut after easily ducking a lunge he thought &quot;I thought I was done with idiots like these...&quot;  As he then elbowed another assailant trying to flank him he realized a third member had joined the fray wielding a rapier as if he had much experience with the weapon.  Glenn quickly relayed his name to the fellow behind him &quot;The name's Glenn&quot; and the three of them easily dispatched the rest of the ruffians. As the zealous rapier man introduced himself, Glenn saw the other fellow dive and take out the last drunk who was about to plant a bottle into Sparrow's head. But then the bartender did to him as the drunk meant to do to Sparrow, and Glenn rushed to the downed mans side to check his wound, while Sparrow reproved the bartender for striking Tehn. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sagecoqui>SageCoqui</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://homepage.mac.com/jubei1/kenshin/sakabatou.png" BORDER=0> at: 9/20/03 8:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=totallyradjenna>Totally Rad Jenna </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/03 9:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'm new don't yell at me!</span><hr size=1> &quot;That's enough!&quot; she yelled as a brawl became out of control in her workplace.  Sure she had seen the occasional bar-drunk brawl of all kinds, but this one was different.  Someone had actually defeated Magus, the 8 foot giant who visited the tavern everyday, and quite frankly that made her happy.  She didn't enjoy much serving him drink after drink, having drunk all the beer, and scaring away some customers.  Not the whole bar was in a frenzy with drunks, breaking bottles, knives, blood, and the new men.  She had seen 3 new men who had never stepped foot in her tavern quite ironically on the same day this massive fight begun.  Curious and angry at the same time, she went in the back and changed into something like herself, black leather studded light armor, because she had no Idea what she was getting herself into at the time.  She grabbed her long sword with its shief and headed outside.  In the back ally she acame across the 3 men all together, a smaller man, a cloaked man, and one who looked as to be a pirate.  Approaching the men, they had began to have hand-on-weapon, including a broken beer bottle.  She stopped dead in her tracks, afraid to start and more disturbances and spoke aloud, &quot;I promise I won't draw my weapon, if you do the same.&quot;  She slowly extened he hand and dropped the sword on the pavement.  As it hit the men became somewhat relaxed, while brawling was still going on inside.  &quot;Well since my tavern is in shambles, I pondered if I could see what you 3 were up too.  You know the first day you set foot in the tavern, my worst customer is gone along with my tavern.  That's quite odd to me.&quot;  As she waited for an answer, she thought to herself maybe she could go back on adventures like the olden days and as memories flushed her head, she longed to be apart of the group.  &quot;Well no matter, since my job is almost a total loss, mind if I join you fellows for a while at least until I can find a better place to work.&quot;  As she picked up her sword and walked toward the 3 men. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=totallyradjenna>Totally Rad Jenna </A> at: 9/20/03 10:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sovbeos>sovbeos</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.xsiteclub.com/forum/images/avatars/gallery/cowboy_bebop/cb_02.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk Man Monster-killa</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/03 10:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> pretty birdies...</span><hr size=1> The act of being dragged none-too-gently from the tavern's warmth into the biting rain did wonders for bringing consciousness back to the still smiling Tehn.  The smile quickly left his face as the sharp pain was realized.  Beginning to swat incoherently at the raindrops, he mumbled something about actapuntchure and the mean litshel people.  Once he finally regained some sense he said, &quot;a mite cold out here, i'n'it?  Mayb...&quot; he tried scrambling to his feet when he saw the agressive woman approaching, scarier than any giants, but sank back down into the mud in relief when he realized she wasn't hostile, or at least as hostile as some he'd met.  Smiling a winning smile, and attempting a very awkward bow, Tehn said &quot;A fine evenin, tonight milady... would you know of some <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>other</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> locale nearby where we could rest?  I saw much of nothing on the way here.&quot;  As he began to rise, he absentmindedly fingered his sleeves, and gasped &quot;my daggers!&quot; and promptly ran back into the brawl. He rolled to a diving crawl as he launched himself back through the rear entrance.  Just as the others were about to go in after the fool, he crawled back out the door,  grinning from ear to ear and sliding the weapons back into their holding places, wiping the one clean of blood.  <br>

My dear lady what makes you think we have any affiliation at all?” queried Sparrow as he stared at the newcomer in black leather dumbfounded. “I came to this inn for a hot meal and maybe some nice company, but I come out after helping these two fellows in a brawl.” He explained. “I honestly know nothing about these two other than their names and that each can hold his own, I’m sorry for the mess your tavern is in but I have my own important matters to take care of.” Sparrow said as he reached to the small of his back. The bartender prepared herself for him to draw a hidden weapon but was surprised to see him pull out a small leather purse. After pulling out a few golden coins and tossing them her way he said “That should keep you out of the cold for a while and maybe fix your tavern, miss.” After replacing the purse and suspiciously emptying a few others into it he bowed to the three sweeping his hat back in a grand gesture and said “ I’m going to the next inn for some stew would anyone care to join me? I find this chill weather to be a bit unpleasant, and I would enjoy the company of a lovely lass such as yourself miss… beg your pardon but I don’t believe we’ve introduced ourselves. I am Robert Sparrow aspiring captain and the most infamous ne`er do well for twenty leagues `round the lawless city of Tortuga” ended the jovial pirate with an all too formal bow. After the introductions where finished Sparrow lead the group to a nearby inn called “The Green Dragon” and sauntered in through the door.

After struggling for some time with the notion of getting off of the ground, he realized that he couldn't stay there forever.  In fact, where was he anyway??  The last thing he remembered was getting hit over the head and falling down.  The worst possible way to end the worst day in history.  Hilga was SUCH a pain.  She would never let up.  Well, granted, that was usually the case, but she was getting worse.  That tavern was his only safe place.  She had no idea where it was he disappeared to, and he was all the happier because of it.  He never really meant to upset that nice woman Athena.  He just could never find a way to tell her how warm the beer made him feel and how Hilga wasn't so bad after he had some beer.  Yesterday, though, was when Hilga went from bad to really really bad.  It was all poor Murm could do to get the hell out and drink away his feelings.  If only he could have drunk less and thought more. Maybe then he wouldn't have beaten up that poor skinny man.  Maybe then he wouldn't have gotten knocked out cold.  He finally realized that he was NOT in the taver, but lying in the middle of a stinky sewer.  What the HELL????  At long last he forced himself out of the ditch and made his way along the street.  A LOONG way. Until he found another inn.  This one had a funny picture of a green dragon on the front of it.  He wondered to himself where those guys he rememberd from the night before could have gotten to....they had probably disappeared a long way from here.  The idea of not getting to hang out with such strong fighters upset Murm to no end.  He was almost at the point of tears before he decided that the best plan would be to NOT cry and NOT drink and just try to get some sleep.  How bad could it get anyway?  He reached for the door and stumbled into the tavern before seeing a table of people who seemed strangely familiar.  OOoo. The bumbling giant was torn between utter joy and total fatigue.  He made a few wobbly, trudging footsteps into the establishment before reaching his arms skyward in a gesture of friendship toward the table of adventurers, a dumb smile crossing his lips, and collapsing onto the floor in a giant-worthy spill.  He was asleep before he hit the floor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sovbeos>sovbeos</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.gamespy.com/comics/nodwick/trogdor/TrogdorSmall.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk Man Monster-killa</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#333333>(9/21/03 4:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: :stumbles:...:falls:</span><hr size=1> Just as the four were about to stand, the action was cut short by the arrival of the giant.

As Athena came arrived with a key, they ushered the sleeping man in, quickly wrapping his hands and feet in rope bonds, securely tied.

Yet the knowledge of a single shelf of books within that hoard is worth more than all the gold in this country.  Would you say the maps of all this world and many others have no value?&quot;  The look in his eyes shows there is far more than could even be pictured.  <br>
&quot;The reason I seek this library is one of vengeance.  7 years ago, on a vast battlefield to stop the rape of my country, a ... fluctuation occured, ravaging and killing most of my kinsmen, while opening a murky portal to some realm of shadow.  Through it Tyrglenos, my own ally in the past yet the betrayer and leader of those heathens, left this plane with several of his commanders.  His force went on to slaughter the remainder of us, I being one of 70 that survived that butchery.  As the army marched on, our small band of battered souls was unable to give chase.  I'm sure you have heard that my land, Cybolis,&quot; he paused as several gasped in shock, &quot;still lies in desolation.  I did not agree with The Remnant on how to combat the evil, and so my path diverged from theirs.  I know Tyrglenos is still alive, and I can only imagine what desolation he has gathered under his fold in these 7... long... years.  I know I shall be able to reach this shadow realm with the smallest amount of information from that library, and yet it is contained nowhere else, in no other mind, I have found that out the hard way.  At the moment, my present goal is to find the pattern lying below the library's movements, for it has been seen in the four corners of this world and many places in between.  in 3 days time, it will be exactly one year since it appeared somewhere in this area.  The fibers of time shall reveal themselves, and perhaps finally give me the key to its next location.&quot;   <p>______________________________<br>
