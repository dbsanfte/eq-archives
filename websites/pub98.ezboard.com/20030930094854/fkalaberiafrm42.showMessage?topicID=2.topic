A lupine sigh escapes his muzzle as his thoughts churn over and over in his mind. The tunnel twisted and swirled, but for the most part seemed to travel in the same direction. <br>
<br>
Suddenly with a very hurt yelp, the wolf stumbles into something. Wildly struggling to escape, the hunter finds himself the prey. Tangled in a very strong spider web, he lets out a quick howl of panic, and struggles mightily to escape.

Or at least thats what he thought. Lifting his head was a surpreme effort, and only increased the dizzieness he already felt.

Cynthia finished her speech and opened her eyes looking at the wolf hoping for some sign that she was understood that she was not working in vain.<br>

Lifting his head from the ground, an obvious effort, the wolf's eyes begin to shine an icy blue.<br>
<br>
Huffing out a deep breath, the wolf shields his shining eyes with his lids. A soft snapping sound, like bones breaking pierces the shadows. His glimmering silver fur shortens against his pink skin. Lips pull back to reveal shortening razor sharp teath. The gleaming fangs pull back and blunt to an omnivore's set of teeth. Rippling muscles pull taught against bones as they rearrange themselves into those of a man. <br>
<br>
Resting on his knees in the shadows, the a naked man now rests where once was a great wolf. Contrary to his previous appearance, the man is simply average. Pale white skin, and an average hieght combine to make him appear frail. The silvery hair atop his head trails down to form a mane worthy of a lion. His eyes hold a lingering azure glow.<br>

Looking up at them from a little above the waist, his icy blue gaze raking over them, his nostrils flare a little to gain their scent. <br>
<br>
Following Cynthia's lead, he steps into the light. Wincing at the brightness his wolven eyes were unacostomed to, he looks up at Cynthia. Grinning his wolfish grin as she strokes his muzzle, he gives her hand an affectionate lick. <br>
<br>
Slowly he sweeps his gaze about taking in the scenery of this bright new world. People, living their lives in an artificial daylight Hooding his azure eyes with his lids, he takes a deep breath of this world. Scents rich and fragrant drift to his nose. Sounds vibrant and crisp bounce to his ears. A particular scent catches his attention. Cooked meat.<br>
<br>
Looking up at Cynthia again, he finds her haggling with another human over a piece of the delacy. Catching most of the meaning of the conversation, if not the words, he locks his twin sapphire eyes, and grins. As Cynthia lowers the treat to his level, a soft appreciative bark burbles form hsi lips before he takes a bite. A deep rapturous growl rumbles in his throat.<br>
<br>
Lifting his head as she speaks, listening intently, he barks gently, and nods his massive head.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blindeserra@kalaberia>Blinde Serra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#8B4513>(6/27/03 3:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Face First into the trap</span><hr size=1> [[ooc]] Lets move ourselves over to Taylea, and Vanias thread again [[/ooc]] <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=knightspasr>knightspasr</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://stu.aii.edu/~job312/werespider.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/2/03 1:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Face First into the trap</span><hr size=1> [[ooc]] moved over to other thread [[ooc]]  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:maroon;font-family:courier;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So I live so i die, either way time goes on.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm42.showPrevMessage?topicID=2.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm42.emailToFriend?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm42.threadControl?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm42.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm42.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="kalaberiafrm36">Mortal and Kindred Laws<option value="kalaberiafrm37">Character Biographies<option value="kalaberiafrm38">Character Plotting<option value="kalaberiafrm45">Times Square<option value="kalaberiafrm40">Central Park<option value="kalaberiafrm41">Stanton Isle<option value="kalaberiafrm42">Abandoned Subway<option value="kalaberiafrm43">Chitter Chatter<option value="kalaberiafrm44">Advertisements <option value="kalaberiafrm46">Admin and mods<option value="kalaberiafrm47">Warehouse District</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia>MidnyghtRising</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm42>Abandoned Subway</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br> <a href=http://www.runesofdesire.com><img src=http://runesofdesire.com/rod6.jpg></a><br><br>
