I'm an artist, but that doesn't pay the bills. Not like being a roofing apprentice really does right now either, but at least that's money.
I love scary movies. I love old time radio shows. I am big on old tv shows, such as Dick Van Dyke or The Munsters. I'm a big movie fan. Got probably a thousand movies or so, ranging from new DVDs to tapes of old movie serials from the 1920s. I listen to a good variety of music; I can leave the record store with Beatles,Rob Zombie, blues, some kind of goth compilation, and something classical all at once.
I played hockey for a while in school.
I'm very into vampires and vampirism. 
Hell, my board is a good reflection of some of my interests. Check it out....</span></div> 		<div id="personalbio"><span class="title">Personal Bio ::</span> <span class="value">Bio heh? Hmmm....
Lessee.... I guess it started at DarkForums a few years ago. I met someone there who brought me over to the Creed board. That crashed, and so I travelled with my then-companions to the Straights Of Chaos. From there it was a short jog to the Playground of Darkness, and my first moderator post. I then jumped back and forth between there and the Midnight Playground, where I became a moderator, and then an administrator. I left PoD and went fully over to MP. From there I cocreated a Haven. Being the chief administrator there led to my being either a moderator or administrator at a one-time total of seven boards, some of which I still mod at.
I gave up adminning at all but Haven, until such time as I left Haven to start my own Abandoned Playground, of which I am quite proud. I still moderate forums at a few other boards, some older and some newer. And there are still about 15 or so boards I hit just to hit.
Yeah, I'm busy online.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">Yahoo - BratPrince7</span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/btheabandonedplayground" target="_blank">The Abandoned Playground</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 		 		<span class="privatevalue">private</span>						</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2002 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
