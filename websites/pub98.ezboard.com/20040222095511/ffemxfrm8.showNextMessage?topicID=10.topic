<br>
Rahne rolled out of their bed with a jaw-breaking yawn and smiled at Kitty.<br>
<br>
&quot;Must ye leave?&quot; she asked the older girl.<br>
<br>
Kitty smiled, &quot;Classes.  I've got to get going.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lockheed glanced down from his aerie on top of a nearby bookshelf, decided that neither of his pets were doing anything interesting, and closed his eyes again.<br>
<br>
Rahne got up and padded over to Kitty on bare feet.  Kitty smiled to herself at Rahne's lack of shyness about nudity.  It hadn't been that way at first.<br>
<br>
Considerably shorter than Kitty, Rahne rested her forehead against Kitty's throat as they hugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hurry home,&quot; said Rahne.<br>
<br>
Kitty kissed the top of Rahne's head.  The hug continued, neither girl willing to break it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cat's and dogs...&quot; started Kitty.<br>
<br>
&quot;...living together,&quot; continued Rahne.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mass hysteria!&quot; they both laughed in unison as they finished the quote together.<br>
<br>

<br>
Sighing, Kitty released the embrace and looked about for her book bag.  &quot;I'll be out by 4,&quot; Lockeed let out a puff of smoke of irritation as his nap was interrupted by the conversation and winged down to the floor only to dissappear underneath the bed.  &quot;...course, I'll have that short break.  I could skip out of eating lunch and do some 'studying' in the library.&quot; <br>
<br>
Rahne blushed deeply at the memory, &quot;ye wicked girl!&quot;  Kitty flashed her a wide grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, I think that's what you were groaning that time,&quot; Kitty said cheekily.  Lockeed let out an audible grunt and emerged from under the bed dragging a textbook laden courier bag by his teeth.  &quot;Thanks dragon,&quot; she said with a pat to the Dragon's head.  <br>
<br>
Rahne spared a glance to the clock.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You'll be late...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes mother,&quot; Kitty said before planting a quick kiss to Rahne's lips and dissappearing out the door.  The Scot's werewolf smiled excitedly to herself and made her way to the dresser.   <br>
<br>

It was one she hadn’t worn since her days as a member of the New Mutants. To say it would be snug now would be an understatement. She smiled, placed her clothes on the bed, and then sat down at her computer to write the next chapter of her epic. It always made her laugh to think that it was her novel that brought her and Kitty together.<br>
<br>
Rahne didn’t have a clue why she wanted to make her book slightly risqué, but she couldn’t shake the urge. Without much experience under her belt, she started to ask Kitty questions which she happily answered. It didn’t take long, however, for “I’ll tell you” to become “I’ll show you.” And man, did Kitty have some things to show the were-girl.<br>

<br>
There's nothing like writing in the nude, after a couple of hours of cuddling with your lover, to make a &quot;slightly risque&quot; novel somewhat more... intense.  In fact, very intense.<br>
<br>
Not to mention the effect that Rahne's writing was having on herself.<br>
<br>
Three options occured to Rahne.<br>
<br>
First: get some privacy by locking the dragon away in the bathroom and then, uhm, &quot;handle&quot; the situation right then and there.<br>
<br>
Second: take a shower -- which could be either short and cold or long and hot.<br>
<br>
Or third:  wait an hour or two until she could visit Kitty at the library.<br>
<br>
Hmmm, come to think of it.  She could always do some combination of those three...<br>
<br>
Rahne sighed.  All those years of religious indoctrination in the orphanage had run into the irresistible force that was Kitty Pryde.  Rahne had no regrets, but the depth of the change's within her over the last few months still surprised Rahne sometimes.<br>
<br>
Of course, Rahne still had a conservative, &quot;proper&quot; streak.  And Kitty loved finding it and putting a shocked, &quot;we're going to do WHAT?!&quot; expression on the younger girl's face.<br>
<br>
Rahne realized that she was lightly tracing a circle around one of her nipples as she contemplated her options.  She stopped, bit her lower lip, and glanced at the clock.<br>
<br>

All of that work within a short period of time (not to mention the workout last night) had built up an appetite. Rahne rose from her desk and began putting on her clothes. She could still feel Kitty's hands on her and all of a sudden two hours loomed before her like an eon.<br>
<br>
As if reading her mind, Lockheed fluttered over to her and cooed. Rahne gathered up the little purple dragon in her arms and scratched under his chin. &quot;How 'bout it, little beastie? Are ye 'ungry?&quot;<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What if I were t'bring 'er lunch?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> It wasn't that Kitty couldn't cook, it was just that Rahne was better at it.

<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I was more then happy t'ignore that warning, especially when it came t'...other body parts last night.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Stretching his wings and slipping from his perch, he took flight and began circling her much like a cat would, only in midair. She stared at the dragon for a minute before gasping, “Oh! We didnae feed you last night!”<br>
<br>
She left Kitty’s lunch for a moment to amend the situation. Lockheed cooed, happy that she got his point so quick. It had been tiresome trying to get one of the girls’ attentions these days. They either were focused strictly on him, or only on each other. When Kitty and Rahne got going, they tended to forget that there was a world outside their bed.<br>
<br>
Rahne set out plate of cantaloupe and smiled at Lockheed. The dragon, however, was not happy. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>After ignoring me and not feeding me all day yesterday, she gives me <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>that</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He promptly huffed, spouting out a puff of smoke, and then flapped off back towards the living room. “Spoiled dragon,” Rahne just shook her head and went back to work on Kitty’s lunch.<br>

Like a lot of the Computer Science professors, he knew his stuff, but was a lousy instructor.<br>
<br>
Kitty was making a conscientious effort to pay attention, but Professor Jurgens had the ability to frustrate the best of intentions.  The student in the seat immediately to Kitty's right was snoring.  The one to her left was drawing pictures of bunny rabbits with machine-guns in her notebook.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Rahne didn't actually say that she'd visit me at lunch,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thought Kitty.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>After all, she's busy with her novel.  She might not be able to make it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Stop that!  Pay attention.  The test is next week.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Professor Jurgens started talking about infinite loops -- a programming error in which a certain event happened over and over.  Under certain conditions, it could cause a system crash.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sort of like Rahne and me in the shower the other day</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, mused Kitty.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Over and over again until we could barely stand up...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Stop that!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kitty managed a solid minute of concentration.  Then she began drifting again.<br>
<br>
Rahne had just been passing through town.  She dropped by to say hello to a former teammate.  At Kitty's insistence, an overnight stay turned into a weekend visit.  Then the weekend stretched into a week.  Then it was the end of the month and Rahne paid a share of the rent.  She went job-hunting the next day.<br>
<br>
It was good to have a roommate.  Especially one who understood the strange world of a mutant trying to &quot;pass&quot; as a normal person.<br>
<br>
One night, Kitty came home to find Rahne writing furiously in one of her tattered notebooks.  One rather funny argument later, Rahne was shyly reading one of her stories aloud to Kitty.<br>
<br>
Kitty grinned to herself at that memory.  Rahne had been an enthusiastic writer back when they were both students at Professor Xavier's school.  But Kitty hadn't realized that Rahne had stuck with it.  And she was getting pretty good.<br>
<br>
So Kitty firmly sat Rahne down in front of the computer, booted up a text editor, and ordered her to join the 21st century.<br>
<br>
And then came the day when a blushing Rahne asked for some advice about an erotic scene in the story she was working on.  Rahne wasn't very experienced in that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
One thing led to another.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Damn.  What the hell was Professor Jurgens talking about?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kitty rubbed her eyes, and glanced at the clock.<br>

It definately was not in the same category as Kitty's typical self-packed lunches of a sandwich, a bag of chips, and a soda.  A grin came to her lips.  A picnic lunch sounded like the right idea.  Even when they weren't amorous, Kitty's tedious programming classes kept them inside too often.  The redhead sighed happily to herself as she rummaged through the kitchen looking for a picnic basket.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The sun out...all the food...a nice seculded spot away from prying eyes...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p>_________________<br>

<br>
Kitty gently woke up the fellow who was snoring in the seat to her immediate right.  Then she finished a deal with the artistically-inclined girl on her left.  In exchange for a copy of Kitty's notes, the girl would supply a sketch of a werewolf (female, of course) joyously chasing a rabbit.<br>
<br>
Rahne would get a big kick out of it when she found it attached to the refrigerator in their apartment.<br>
<br>
Joining the mass of students filing out of the auditorium, Kitty felt her stomach grumble.  Perhaps she should have had some breakfast this morning instead of...<br>
<br>
Ahem.<br>
<br>
She would head to the library and see if Rahne had been able to get free from the computer long enough for a visit.  Perhaps they could go to the Student Union and grab a quick meal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kitty!&quot;<br>
<br>
Glancing down the hall, Kitty saw Rahne.  The redhead was energetically waving with one hand and holding a picnic basket in the other.  Knowing that she was wearing a goofy grin, Kitty hurried over to the younger girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you find me?&quot; Kitty asked.  &quot;I never told you where this class is taught.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rahne smiled and tapped one finger against the side of her nose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; laughed Kitty.  &quot;The nose knows.  Remind me never to cheat on you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah'll have to show ye mah ill-tempered side if you do.  Ah bite.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So what else it new?  Where do you want to have our picnic?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Someplace outdoors and private.  Very private.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfemx.showUserPublicProfile?gid=querldox9>QuerlDox9</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#dddddd>(12/3/03 7:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffemxfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/space/stiffneckrun/images/Brainy5.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Round Robin#1; part 11</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;font-family:century schoolbook;">&quot;Really, now?&quot; A slow grin spread on Kitty's face. &quot;If that's the case, then I know a place that would be perfect.&quot; She drew closer and placed a soft, brief kiss on Rahne's lips.<br>
<br>
The slight redhead giggled and blushed. &quot;Och, Katy!&quot; She looked around nervously, her voice dropping to a whisper. &quot;We're oot in public!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, so?&quot; Kitty smirked. &quot;Nobody around here cares. One of the benefits of a liberal campus.&quot; And indeed the passersby went on their way as if the girls weren't there. She took Rahne's hand and brushed a thumb over smooth knuckles. She leaned in once more and whispered, &quot;Let's head over to the library and go upstairs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rahne quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Upstairs?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">***</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
The University Library was one of the tallest buildings on campus. It was also the widest, which meant a flat roof. The concrete was already warm from the midday sun. The cool breeze carried with it the sound of rustling leaves on distant trees. It wasn't exactly a park, but every patch of grass on campus seemed to be occupied by a student. Too many prying eyes. So it was here that Kitty and Rahne arrived to have their picnic.<br>
<br>
They crawled onto the spread blanket and set up the food. Kitty's mouth started watering when out of the basket came sandwiches, beef stew, crackers, a two-liter of Faygo, and peanut butter cookies. &quot;You made cheesesteaks. You're a woman after my own heart.&quot; <br>
<br>
Rahne smiled shyly. &quot;But ye've already stolen mine.&quot; She draped her arms around the wiry brunette and closed her eyes when she felt warm lips close over hers. After a long kiss, they parted reluctantly and began to unwrap their sandwiches. <br>
<br>
They lounged on the blanket and tore into their meal exchanging lingering gazes. Every time they passed the Faygo back and forth, the fingers brushed against one another. Rahne's skin tingled at the contact. Finally, it was time for the cookies.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey.&quot; Kitty whispered, shuffling to her knees. When she got undivided attention, she broke off a piece of a cookie and brought it to Rahne's lips. She stared as the younger woman nibbled at the proffered morsel. There were a few crumbs on Rahne's lower lip. Kitty stroked the parting lips, her breath catching when she felt the flick of a tongue across her fingers. She leaned forward and closed her mouth over the redhead's lower lip, tasting peanut butter. <br>
<br>
Rahne held Kitty's face in her hands and deepened the kiss. Her blouse became uncomfortably tight all of a sudden and she let out a soft moan when she felt nimble fingers undoing her buttons. The sensations swirled in her body. She couldn't get enough of it, the hot kisses and the knowing touches, the feel of Kitty's well-built body pressed against hers, skin to skin.<br>
<br>
Kitty stopped unbuttoning the blouse halfway and slid her hand inside. To her delight, she encountered bare flesh. She  broke the kiss long enough to peel off the blouse and gaze at Rahne's full breasts. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Beautiful.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Her fingers twirled around an erect pink nipple and she trailed her tongue up and down Rahne's neck. Before long, she felt impatient hands tugging at her shirt. She obliged by shedding her shirt and bra. Rahne's hands pressed against her stomach and began to slide upward. She whimpered when the redhead began planting tiny kisses across her collarbone and pawing at her breasts. Within moments, they lay together on the blanket, arms wrapped against each other, legs intertwined. Their kisses became more intense and urgent. Kitty's hand crept downward and slid between Rahne's legs. It felt hot and damp. Staring intently at blazing ocean-colored eyes, she hiked up the skirt and stroked the front of cotton panties before creeping her fingers inside the waistband.<br>
<br>
Rahne's heart hammered in her chest. Her breath became short and rapid as slender fingers stroked her wetness. She ran her hands across Kitty's back, across her shoulders, covering her face with kisses. When she couldn't take it anymore, she lifted her hips and pushed down her skirt and underwear. Kitty drew back and finished removing the garments and then removed her own pants and underwear. She lowered herself onto Rahne and spread liquid kisses on the neck and throat, slowly making her way down. <br>
<br>
Rahne gasped and arched her back when Kitty began suckling her breasts, gently nipping, going back and forth. She clutched at the blanket on either side and grit her teeth. The throb between her legs turned into an ache. She looked down and saw Kitty kneeling between her legs and lowering her head, gazing at her. Licking her. She rocked against the hungry mouth, pushing against a hot tongue. When Rahne felt Kitty's fingers slipping inside of her, she nearly passed out. She bucked harder and faster, scrunching her hands through dark brown hair. The tremors crept up on her and hit hard. A strangled cry tore out of her mouth as she stiffened. She collapsed back down, gasping for air.<br>
<br>
Kitty crawled back up and held Rahne close, murmuring incoherently in her ear. As soon as her breathing slowed, Rahne stroked Kitty's face, kissing her softly. A gentle nudge later, she was on top. She worked her way down methodically, her mouth lingering on firm breasts, leaving them wet and the nipples tightly puckered. Kitty moaned, her body tensing as Rahne mapped her with her tongue. She resisted the urge to push Rahne head down to the burning need between her legs.<br>
<br>
The redhead took her time. She wanted to savor this moment, tasting the flesh beneath her. Her tongue slowly traced Kitty's chisled abs. They tightened and bunched when Rahne nuzzled them, moving lower to her destination. She parted quivering thighs and nestled her face between them.<br>
<br>
Kitty clenched her fists. Rahne's torturously slow ministrations was driving her insane. She raised her hips, panting hard. The redhead brought up her hand and shyly caressed the wetness before her. She pushed her fingers inside, feeling the muscles clamp down, marvelling at the tightness, thrusting in and out. Kitty's groaning turned into grunts. She rode Rahne's hand and mouth, shutting everything else out. When she felt the first rumblings of climax, she rocked her hips more intensely, and then all she could see was white behind her eyelids. With a shuddering sigh, she fell back feeling light-headed. She became aware of Rahne snuggling against her. <br>
<br>
They lay there with the sun beaming down on them. Kitty held Rahne in her arms, kissing the top of her head. &quot;Thank you for the lunch.&quot; she said. &quot;It was a pleasant surprise.&quot; <br>
<br>
Rahne sighed contentedly. &quot;Th'pleasure wis all mine. If only yuir schedule wasn't so bloody insane.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I know. I've gotta get ta class in a half an hour.&quot;<br>
