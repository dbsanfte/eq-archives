Something that has really been annoying me for a while now is the brain-dead responses I always seem to get in e-mails, posts, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
It started when I first began my web business. Suddenly I was getting e-mails asking for help, but how can you help someone who writes only one line? &quot;I would like you to do some simple graphics.&quot; No contact info. No details. Is it just me or is this guy three cans short a full six pack?<br>
<br>
I thought it was just a couple people. At first. Maybe they never made it through grade school or they have some kind of writing disorder. Then I got involved in the EzBoard communities and I saw it everywhere. &quot;One liners,&quot; as the forum Admins call them. They hate them, and I am really starting to understand why.<br>
<br>
There's nothing more frustrating than spending hours setting up a community and then having some yokel cruise by and introduce himself like, &quot;I am FAZe weeeeeeeee, i make things, weeeeeeeee bye.&quot; It's like an insult to your own intelligence.<br>
<br>
I suppose a lot of it has to do with my own personality. I am a person who is very detail-oriented, and when I converse with friends or family members or even strangers I can't even fake interest to a typical &quot;one-liner.&quot; If ya don't have anything interesting to say then it's best not to say anything at all.<br>
<br>
I think the Internet has sapped a lot of intelligence from people. It is far too easy to just sit there staring blankly at the screen. Playing games. Watching movies. The loss of personal interaction dulls the senses and I would go crazy if I didn't get out every now and then and interact with real living breathing human beings.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I will wade through the illiterate in these forums overflowing with wanton idiots devoid of even a simple interesting thing to utter. I mean, good God, if all you can say is 'I make things, weeeeeeee' then sell the computer and go back to English class.<br>
<br>

<br>
One liners have their place, although can get bloody annoying when over-used. Similarly chat that isn't exactly serious also has its place for various people - it's what some of us do, to escape reality. One reason this forum has been created is too keep the more serious arguments seperated from the general crazyness of the Free For All forum.<br>
<br>
I think your right, with regards to the dumbing down of the internet. Things have gone fast downhill over the last couple of years, and many people are unable to even form proper arguments anymore. Perhaps its to do with EZboard, which is hardly known for its intelligent member base. There's a lot of very good and intelligent discussion going on, but on various other media's (usenet etc.) You can blame various things, such as AOL or the commercilisation of the internet or the sheer boredom of many users who are unable to let go...<br>
<br>
I don't know, but like you... a return to conversation that is slightly more thought through would be nice...<br>

<br>
You say that it insults a forum owner's intelligence when they set up a community and someone posts only one line and leaves.  Possibly.  If the owner's desperate for new people.  But if the owner is comfortable with the people that go there, sometimes seeing someone post once and leave is a red flag. &quot;Hm, next time someone asks me if I know this person, I'll tell them all they did was post an advert and leave.&quot;  Or the owner just completely forgets about them and doesn't let it get to them.  But not all owners would take it personally when one random Joe Q. IDownloadCrapFromKazaaForALiving decides that these people aren't worth trying to get |-|4&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;0|2z 5|-|173.  It really isn't as big of a deal as you set it out to be.<br>
<br>
And here I was planning on posting a one liner to piss you off.  :P<br>

But, I feel you are tarnishing too many people with the same brush. <br>
<br>
These communities are not all about intense intellectual conversation and aptitude. They are also about socialising, expression and having some fun. I understand that the &quot;Hi, wee, bye&quot; sort of post is immature and unwanted on most boards, but not all the mindless childish posting reflects the characteristics of the person making it.<br>
<br>
Sometimes we all enjoy posting the odd sarcastic one-liners. This is usually because we know how much the community needs that slight air of exuberance to keep it alive and ticking. Obviously if we take it too far then there are always consequences. Most people understand that, the fact that some people continue after warnings just goes to prove your point.<br>
<br>
I believe that if you took the time to look through the forums within our community and those that are affiliated with it (especially our Tech Support forum <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) you would find that at least this community is an exception to your rule<br>

One thing that annoys me is word limits. MSN has a word limit; I guess its to stop people flooding, but I think it encourages me to do should things. They have a word limit that forbids people from doing replies that are too short! Maybe thats a bit over the top, I don't know, but I do think one letter replies banned would be good.<br>
<br>
The death of communication is not just online. How many people sit at a dining table and chat to their family at dinner time? How many sit in front of a tv and listen to neighbours? (or home&amp;away or richard and judy, god forgive them)<br>
<br>
When I do short replies, its because I am tired or have nothing to say. Sometimes I sit there and think of what to say I guess. I try to avoid the crap, but sometimes like to add my own touch which means going into weird details, that may make absolutely no sense to humanoids.<br>
<br>
When I don't read other replies, its because I am tired or bored of reading it. Sometimes they are not that interesting. I am sure what I am typing right now, and you are reading, is not the most interesting thing in the world. You don't need to know this sentence, do you? <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCE6FF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/bbbarden.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=total>ToTaL</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br><BR><img src=http://montos.virtualave.net/bbpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Tech Support Moderator<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-mod.gif /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 7/15/02 11:27:18 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: The Death of Conversation</span><hr size=1> LOL<br>

<br>
With MSN, IRC, ICQ etc. I think that one word replies are fine. The programs and protocols are designed to take large amounts of small data over a period of time e.g. &quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;Hey&quot;, &quot;How are you?&quot; &quot;Good, you?&quot; etc.<br>
<br>
On BBS's however this can lead to problems. Mainly due to the actual design of the BBS. In this case we have pretty large &quot;windows&quot; for each post and a single word reply takes up a lot of space and a lot of loading time. The protocol here has been designed to take small amounts of large data over a period of time.<br>
<br>
I suppose that different systems teach you different habits. A person that uses instant messengers more than BBS's is going to have trouble adapting, especially if they don't read the rules first.<br>

A simple ban on sending one letter would be a good thing for the Internet world, encouraging people to type probably and use caps, comma's, etc. etc. If you want an example of the annoyance it causes then I will be pleased to show you it using MSN, anytime ;o) <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/uitisbabybunny.showPublicProfile?language=EN>It is Baby Bunny</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://lyonesskim.moonunderglass.com/kitty/animatedpics_files/image008.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.sanrio.co.jp/english/characters/w_chara/sug180.gif HEIGHT=70 WIDTH=80><br> <span class=usertitle>Evolving Lake<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-2-3.gif /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 7/16/02 12:47:02 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: The Death of Conversation</span><hr size=1> hey mouse, good to have ya here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/grin.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
you were venting... but in a good reasonable way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
i agree and disagree with ya guys ideas... <br>
<br>
are one liners annoying? sure they are sometimes... i personally dont like replies like &quot; yes &quot;, &quot; no &quot;, or ( following funny reply ) &quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/lol.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;... like we dont know its funny...<br>
<br>
still, one liners are different from spammers, and in some cases one line replies are inevitable... ( i agree with total on this )<br>
<br>
i am not here to judge anyone... and this is just from my experience... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
i once visited a very popular board and started &quot; hey i am new here &quot; thread... <br>
just b coz i didnt go back to check on thread for few days, they started to bash me ( namely &quot;newbie bash&quot; )<br>
you dont expect newbie to be as active and talkative as regulars...<br>
<br>
as for asking help... its awesome that i got to know many guys who are very knowledgable about comp. and all ! i believe, not many of us would go up to someone we dont know and ask for help plus start nice conversation as well... <br>
i know about this, b coz i dont know well about comp. and i ask for help sometimes... ( not as often as b4 tho )<br>
i know how it feel like to ask something when you feel like you are the only one who have not know this simple thing... <br>
whenever i am asked to help or to give advices, i dont care if the person is a oneliner or some notorious dude who got banned from several boards...<br>
i believe... for most of time, asking involves courage... thats already something, isnt it?<br>
<br>
<br>
as for writing problems...<br>
well... the majority of posters at this board are british, right? the majority of posters of the other boards i go to are american and canadian... <br>
so i can easily assume that most of the posters i meet are native speakers of english...<br>
well i am not... english isnt my mother tongue... i often have to ponder what the posts mean... i often intentionally avoid some threads b coz i have no idea what s the topic... ( believe me... writing this reply is much easier than speaking it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/lol.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  you will know when ya got a chance to voice chat with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/rollin.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
in a way i am lucky, b coz i never got in a fight due to my poor grammer or wrong spelling or punctuation... <br>
but i saw few times where some guys use others incompetency of english as a weak point and bash them...<br>
<br>
how well do we know about each other?<br>
to me... internet is wonderful, yet scary world...<br>
<br>
only if we are more understanding and patient... ( that was for me... sowwie guys <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
